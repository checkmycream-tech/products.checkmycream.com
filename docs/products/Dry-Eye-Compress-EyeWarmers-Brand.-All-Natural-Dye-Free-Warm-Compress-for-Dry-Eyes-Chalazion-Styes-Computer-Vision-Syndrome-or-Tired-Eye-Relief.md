      <li>and hopefully it will be better.</li>
      <li>Just ok.</li>
      <li>So glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I did a search for dry eye compresses and found this one which seemed to be the best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to warm the eye compress once and have it stay warm the entire time.  </li>
      <li>I was right!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product for those needing warm heat to treat dry eyes.  </li>
      <li>This eye compress works fine.</li>
      <li>I had relief in my eyes after the very first use!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, clean, and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It is all-natural and a fabulous alternative to drops and eye jels.</li>
      <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;This is great because I can do both eyes at the same time.</li>
      <li>as when I woke up about 35 minutes later it was at room temperature on top and was still slightly warm probably body temperature where it still lay somewhat across my eye area.  </li>
      <li>I could always stitch one up, but seems kind of cheap on their part not to provide a simple cloth covering that cam be washed.</li>
      <li>and I need to keep warm compresses on them several times</li>
      <li>Leave this guy in the microwave for a minute and you will have just the right temperature to cure your eye issue without it being uncomfortably hot.  </li>
      <li>I have suffered from dry eye for almost 3 years until my Dr. recommended a warm eye compress 2x a day.  </li>
      <li>I was diagnosed with inflammatory dry eye and in addition to using drops, I was told to apply warm compresses three times a week, twice a day.  </li>
      <li>Most doctors and individual that have dry eye recommend a warm moist heat compress.</li>
      <li>Unlike many other products, the Dry Eye pillow stays warm for the full 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>This product has helped me more than the many eye drops I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>well built and effective with wet and microwave use</li>
      <li>When heated it was warm but not hot and the smell from the flax seed (I am guessing)</li>
      <li>keeps warm longer than the other eye compress I have purchased.</li>
      <li>I read all the reviews and decided my first choice would be the Dry Eye Compress, Eye Warner Brand mostly based on the statement that it stays warm for almost ten minutes and that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this compress since April and have found it to be very soothing and helpful.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing to my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I have had a very stubborn stye for over a year that would come and go.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>Live and learn</li>
      <li>The product was everything I expected - cleanly packaged, with clearly stated instructions - and it arrived sooner than anticipated.</li>
      <li>I wanted natural and I did get natural so that smell is on me.</li>
      <li>I like the natural cloth covering.</li>
      <li>Things have improved immediately and in time I am assured that I will have working oil glands again and my eyes will not be gritty and be normal again.</li>
      <li>This compress does not retain heat well, often has to be heated too long and burns, and is really not at all worth it.  </li>
      <li>After purchasing and attempting to use this I decided using a warm washcloth wasn&#x27;t all that difficult after all.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to dry eye sufferer&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>but it would often get too hot and leave slight burns on the side of my face</li>
      <li>If you think that you don’t have enough time to find a high quality product that meets with your personal needs, look no further, this one is for you.</li>
      <li>Heated the dry eye compress up per instructions and for a cover used a natural moist paper towel to protect it.  </li>

<li> This dry eye compress.</li>
<li> It does what it says it will do, provides a soothing heat for dry eyes.</li>
<li> My Ophthalmologist suggested I use a dry eye compress.</li>
<li> I immediately went up stairs to lay down and have close to 10 minutes of moist heat on my red and sore eyes.</li>
<li> Sorry to say this particular compress is a complete bust.</li>

<li> I no longer have teary eyes (due to dry eye) and helped my chalazion.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> For now I find a thick wash cloth that has been moistened and heated in the micowave stays warmer longer.</li>
<li> After becoming frustrated with drippy washcloths that soon became cold, I went online and discovered EyeWarmers!  </li>
<li> Immediately I went on a quest to find out everything I could possibly do to help alleviate this painful condition.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a bad case of dry eye syndrome for years now.</li>
<li> Needless to say the heat lasted all of about 3-4 minutes, if that.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed, to say the least.</li>
<li> Whatever is in the product made my eyes itch like crazy.</li>
<li> Also the filling once moistened and heated has a smell that is unpleasant to me.</li>

    <li> I use it, and feels good on my eyes,</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and received it 2 days later.  Previously I was using a wet wash cloth warmed in the microwave that needed constant reheating.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to warm the eye compress once and have it stay warm the entire time.  Will definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is great. I have a problem with Chalazion&#x27;s on my eyes and I need to keep warm compresses on them several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;This is great because I can do both eyes at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and very convenient to use! So glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable. My eyes were depuffed and moist after useing this. I recommend this product..</li>
    <li> keeps warm longer than the other eye compress I have purchased. i can also use it to massage my eyes given the larger form</li>
    <li> Just ok. Whatever is in the product made my eyes itch like crazy. Probably an allergy to something in the mask.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Heated the dry eye compress up per instructions and for a cover used a natural moist paper towel to protect it.  When heated it was warm but not hot and the smell from the flax seed (I am guessing) was nice and relaxing as well.  I do like that I was able to scrunch the bag up and under the eyes and uncovering my nose.  It retained the heat for a good while as when I woke up about 35 minutes later it was at room temperature on top and was still slightly warm probably body temperature where it still lay somewhat across my eye area.  Regards, Kim from Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </li>

    <li> You have to &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; it to use and you&#x27;re supposed to buy a cover for it</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with severe dry eye. Immediately I went on a quest to find out everything I could possibly do to help alleviate this painful condition. Most doctors and individual that have dry eye recommend a warm moist heat compress. I read all the reviews and decided my first choice would be the Dry Eye Compress, Eye Warner Brand mostly based on the statement that it stays warm for almost ten minutes and that it is all natural. I tried it almost immediately once it arrived. After wetting the compress I put it in the microwave, on high,for the instructed 30 seconds and at that time almost no warmth. I did it another 30 seconds and it did feel warmer. I immediately went up stairs to lay down and have close to 10 minutes of moist heat on my red and sore eyes. Needless to say the heat lasted all of about 3-4 minutes, if that. I turned it over hoping the other side would emit some warmth but no such luck. Back down stairs to the microwave,  with my husband commenting \\&quot;that was fast\\&quot; heated it again with the same results. Sorry to say this particular compress is a complete bust. Also the filling once moistened and heated has a smell that is unpleasant to me. I wanted natural and I did get natural so that smell is on me. I have ordered another brand as well and hopefully it will be better. For now I find a thick wash cloth that has been moistened and heated in the micowave stays warmer longer. Live and learn</li>

    <li> This dry eye compress. is without a doubt the best choice one of the best choice out there. If you think that you don’t have enough time to find a high quality product that meets with your personal needs, look no further, this one is for you. I have had a very stubborn stye for over a year that would come and go.  I used a much larger compress but it would often get too hot and leave slight burns on the side of my face I was putting it on.  Leave this guy in the microwave for a minute and you will have just the right temperature to cure your eye issue without it being uncomfortably hot.  Best of all it remains at this temperature for over 15 minutes!  I used this product twice a day for a week and saw great results! Highly recommend this one.</li>

I did a search for dry eye compresses and found this one which seemed to be the best. I was right!! This product has helped me more than the many eye drops I&#x27;ve used in the past. The only thing I do different when I put it in the microwave is to turn it over half-way through  the time cycle. I would highly recommend this product to dry eye sufferer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry eye for almost 3 years until my Dr. recommended a warm eye compress 2x a day.  Things have improved immediately and in time I am assured that I will have working oil glands again and my eyes will not be gritty and be normal again.</li>
