      <li>It could also be one of the reasons why your skin feels good apart from the rich serum of course.</li>
      <li>I tried this product and loved it, it is totally worth the price!</li>
      <li>It adheres to your skin SO much more effectively which will provide a better absorption experience.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every week for 2 months, and my skin is noticeable firmer, smoother, and more radiant.</li>
      <li>but I love these masks as they are DRENCHED with the collagen essence.</li>
      <li>Been using it aproximately once a week and feel like I have never looked better.</li>
      <li>I love how it has two steps.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product will never let myself run out of it.</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>and so there is better blood circulation</li>
      <li>We all love it.</li>
      <li>It is kind of too rich, feel so oily after using it.</li>
      <li>I use these on very special occasions as they are my treat.</li>
      <li>My face looks more moisture and smooth.</li>
      <li>Eliminates or significantly reduces wrinkles under/around eyes - even when smiling the wrinkles don&#x27;t show that</li>
      <li>I love it so much, I had purchased several times....and it always looks good after using this stuff.</li>
      <li>After using it, I just need light moisturizer and I will glow whole day!</li>
      <li>and that is why you feel fresh .</li>
      <li>moisturized and fresh</li>
      <li>My skin feels hydrated and fresh.</li>
      <li>so  the cool mask gets extra refreshing .</li>
      <li>sheet is well saturated and it is effective on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>I love these facial mask sheets.</li>
      <li>I am trying to save these as much as possible because I really love them so much.</li>
      <li>It is very moist.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s so much syrup</li>
      <li>They really soften and nourish my skin.</li>
      <li>The actual face mask material is not your traditional cotton sheet, but a very unique cellulose material that reminds me of a gel-like rice paper hybrid.</li>
      <li>It is a little thicker than most of mask I purchased.</li>
      <li>* Leaves my (normal) skin</li>
      <li>After just a couple of uses my skin already felt smoother and more firm.  </li>
      <li>It leaves me soft, and hydrate looking face.</li>
      <li>when I tried it my skin appeared tired but after using it from first time i noticed my skin became fresh and consistent as five years before.</li>
      <li>Love how it almost vacuum-sticks to the skin: if you know what I mean.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a facial mask for a long time that will leave my face feeling fresh and renewed.</li>
      <li>After I use it the first time, i simply fold it and put it back in the serum pack .</li>
      <li>It is more difficult to &#x27;unfold&#x27; the mask portion and definitely more messy than others I have tried but it does work.  </li>
      <li>When I took it off, my face was very oily, but several later, it turned just like water....</li>
      <li>First is to squeeze out the excessive fluid to apply to the whole body.  </li>

    <li> I love how it has two steps.  First is to squeeze out the excessive fluid to apply to the whole body.  Then, I get to put on the mask and relax.  It is very moist.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a facial mask for a long time that will leave my face feeling fresh and renewed. I tried this product and loved it, it is totally worth the price! I&#x27;ve been using it every week for 2 months, and my skin is noticeable firmer, smoother, and more radiant. I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments on the quality of my skin recently. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. There is a lot of serum in one pack. I use each mask twice. After I use it the first time, i simply fold it and put it back in the serum pack . There is enough serum to use the mask again the nest day. My skin feels hydrated and fresh. I sometimes leave the pack in the refrigerator so  the cool mask gets extra refreshing . Love how it almost vacuum-sticks to the skin: if you know what I mean. Its as if there is a suction effect. It probably is good for the skin because it is drawing blood towards the skin and so there is better blood circulation and that is why you feel fresh . It could also be one of the reasons why your skin feels good apart from the rich serum of course. Will buy again.  I have always raved about Korean skin products.</li>
    <li> This is one of several collagen masks that I have tried.  It is more difficult to &#x27;unfold&#x27; the mask portion and definitely more messy than others I have tried but it does work.  Takes a little practice but the directions are clear.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I use it practically everyday. It&#x27;s amazing! I put it on before I go to bed, then in the morning I take the mask out. It leaves me soft, and hydrate looking face. I truly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My skin glows after using it. It is a little thicker than most of mask I purchased. After using it, I just need light moisturizer and I will glow whole day! Love it!</li>
    <li> Hi ,&lt;br /&gt;I am 36 years woman , as any woman I am trying to fight aging and its signs such wrinkles.My big worry is about collagen reduce in my skin. whan l found this product emaditly I ordered it. when I tried it my skin appeared tired but after using it from first time i noticed my skin became fresh and consistent as five years before.</li>
    <li> very nice mask one of my favorites ever</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product will never let myself run out of it. Been using it aproximately once a week and feel like I have never looked better.</li>
    <li> It is kind of too rich, feel so oily after using it. I do not think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> GREAT MASK AND SO EASY TO USE AND HAS A GREAT FEEL TO IT!I FEEL THE DIFFERENCE FROM BEFORE I USED IT WOOWWOWOO</li>
    <li> I love it so much, I had purchased several times....and it always looks good after using this stuff. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this mask....</li>
    <li> A friend let me try this out some of these last week.  After just a couple of uses my skin already felt smoother and more firm.  Also, my skin tends to dry out a bit in the colder winter months, but after each use, my skin came out feeling moist and refreshed.  I will definitely be buying more. Good stuff for sure.</li>
    <li> I purchased for myself as well as for my friends. We all love it. My face looks more moisture and smooth.</li>
    <li> the product is not worth it.  it did not reach my expectations.  i would not recommend it to anyone. not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I tried one piece last night, it feels very different both the mask itself  and the serum. Hmm, difficult to describe.... When I took it off, my face was very oily, but several later, it turned just like water....Very interesting...</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It&#x27;s like having a facial at a professional&lt;br /&gt; Spa.  Your skin will feel so moist and taunt.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product... I like Korean sheet mask.&lt;br /&gt;The sheet is well saturated and it is effective on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my skin moist, radiant and plump after using it.</li>
    <li> Eliminates or significantly reduces wrinkles under/around eyes - even when smiling the wrinkles don&#x27;t show that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pluses:&lt;br /&gt;* Is scentless&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves my (normal) skin moisturized and fresh&lt;br /&gt;* Sticks well to my face so I can sit and surf the Net or read or snooze while wearing it</li>
    <li> I love these facial mask sheets. They really soften and nourish my skin. There&#x27;s so much syrup in it it&#x27;s enough for not only my face but my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> These masks are frikking EXCELLENT! I use these on very special occasions as they are my treat. I typically use the face shop masks weekly but I love these masks as they are DRENCHED with the collagen essence. The actual face mask material is not your traditional cotton sheet, but a very unique cellulose material that reminds me of a gel-like rice paper hybrid. It adheres to your skin SO much more effectively which will provide a better absorption experience. I am trying to save these as much as possible because I really love them so much. Definitely going to try out the acne (for breakout days) and the Liftingtox treatments for some variety to my skincare routine.</li>
