      <li>It is considerably more important than the moisturizers that come after.  </li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Hope the price will be more cheap.</li>
      <li>It very moisturizes and smell good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other face creams, but for me this is the best.</li>
      <li>The product is more popular with someone who is a bit older (since I learned about this product from my grandmother, but she sticks to products that works well for her).</li>
      <li>It somehow draws moisture in so skin feels soothed and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I use Ecological Compound under Collagen And Woodmallow or Sisleya.</li>
      <li>A light hydrating cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ecological Compound for years.</li>
      <li>It made my skin soft and smell really good.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m very diappointed!!!</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel fresh!</li>

      <li>The shipping was quick.  </li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this product and was really impressed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>thanks ,free gift&lt;br /&gt;^^</li>
      <li>But the seller‘s attitude, it is worth five star.</li>
      <li>Everything, including your regular non-Sisley moisturizer will perform better with EC underneath.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found one from Amazon and the price is definitely unbeatable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I use this the first.</li>
      <li>In fact I would imagine these are fairly fresh given the high tunover through Amazon and low exposure to light and heat.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The large 4.3 ounce bottle -</li>
      <li>I just opened a new bottle this morning and noticed the difference right away.</li>
      <li>had to throw away the whole bottle I bought from Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I look much younger because of Sisley Ecological Compound.</li>
      <li>I always love this product for multiple natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used every high end, low end, middle end moisturizer known to man kind.</li>
      <li>A true one&#x27;s inner circle is plat!</li>
      <li>These are products worth saving for and not arguing with the daily work.</li>
      <li>But until today I opened a new one(which is true, I bought from stores) and compared them carefully.</li>
      <li>This one is thicker and the inner circle(which printed&amp;#34;sisley&amp;#34;) bulge out.</li>
      <li>The other Sisley product I remain loyal to is the night cream.  </li>
      <li>Few years ago, I saw it available at costco dot com</li>
      <li>No greasy no heavy.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, I tried lots of products either sting or not moisturize enough.</li>
      <li>This is the only skin cream that is a match for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>you only need one quick pump, even less for an entire face.</li>
      <li>have been using Sisley ecological compound over 10 years and this particular purchase I made on June/2014 should be a fake one.</li>
      <li>But kind of similar, so i didn&#x27;t realize it for so long!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

<li> But kind of similar, so i didn&#x27;t realize it for so long!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
<li> skin is wind burned or sensitive in some way and other moisturizers aren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s time to try Sisley.</li>
<li> This product is the only one that I use to tame my wild skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you look at the bottom of the bottle carefully, you will find they are different.</li>
<li> There is absolutely no difference I can see between this one offered online and the product on the shelves at big brand name department store.</li>
<li> And also, if you smell them carefully, they are different!!!!</li>
<li> I am using this product for a long time and I will continue to use it.</li>
<li> I have the combination skin type, and when the weather gets dry, I break out.</li>
<li> If u have dry skin, Go for it!</li>
<li> This is the same product for significantly less money.  </li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s expensive, and I myself don&#x27;t have a lot of money, but this is well worth the investment.</li>
<li> My frequent rashes and skin irritations are a thing of the past!</li>
<li> If anyone is curious about the product, I suggest going into one of the big department store beauty counters and buying something that you may need, and as you make the purchase, as your sales associate if you can have a sample size (comes in a small packet) and try it that way.</li>
<li> You can use it by itself or before any other.</li>
<li> And considering other 1 star reviews, I really think this is a fake one.</li>
<li> If one was to purchase one of these bottles at the department stores, it costs little over 200...</li>
<li> and though they have the online reviews, the product is not available.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s different with what I used before,I think it&#x27;s fake</li>
<li> How could you not love this product?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> But after I put it on, I developed a really bad allergy to the cream on my face and had to see a doctor.  </li>
<li> I am not sure if the seller intentionally or accidentally get and resell the fake products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells and feels authetic. Cheaper than buying in store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every high end, low end, middle end moisturizer known to man kind. SK-II, Oil of Olay, Clinique, Shiseido. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. Sisley Ecological Compound is the only thing that my face and I&#x27;ve agreed that it works best for me.  I have the combination skin type, and when the weather gets dry, I break out. When the weather gets humid, I break out. When I am stressed, I break out. This product is the only one that I use to tame my wild skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for over 7 years now, and I&#x27;ve always bought it from Saks or Neiman. Few years ago, I saw it available at costco dot com and though they have the online reviews, the product is not available. If one was to purchase one of these bottles at the department stores, it costs little over 200... I am so glad I found one from Amazon and the price is definitely unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large 4.3 ounce bottle - you only need one quick pump, even less for an entire face. The remaining gets on my neck and my hands. I absolutely love the product.  If you research more on Sisley, their product really is phenomenal.  The product is more popular with someone who is a bit older (since I learned about this product from my grandmother, but she sticks to products that works well for her). If anyone is curious about the product, I suggest going into one of the big department store beauty counters and buying something that you may need, and as you make the purchase, as your sales associate if you can have a sample size (comes in a small packet) and try it that way.</li>
    <li> I think this product is fake. It smells totally different from the product I bought in the shop. And considering other 1 star reviews, I really think this is a fake one.</li>
    <li> the best moisturizer that is available!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sisley cream for years and always liked it.  I always bought it from Costco.  Recently Costco stopped carrying this cream.  I found the same cream on Amazon.com.  The shipping was quick.  But after I put it on, I developed a really bad allergy to the cream on my face and had to see a doctor.  After using some prescription drug on my face for a week, it is finally recovered.  The cream doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the cream I used before.  I suspect that this is a counterfeiting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it, but based on Amazon&#x27;s return policy, face cream is categorized in \\&quot;items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases that cannot be returned.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw away the whole bottle I bought from Amazon.com.  I will not buy any product from Amazon.com again.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but purchased it in department stores.  This is the same product for significantly less money.  It does what it says it will do.  It is considerably more important than the moisturizers that come after.  The other Sisley product I remain loyal to is the night cream.  These are products worth saving for and not arguing with the daily work.</li>
    <li> I have no wrinkles and I am 65.  I will use this forever.</li>
    <li> I love love love it! A must have! How could you not love this product? If u have dry skin, Go for it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different with what I used before,I think it&#x27;s fake definitely&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so angry and very very very very disappointed</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product and was really impressed.&lt;br /&gt; It moisturizes and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;and thanks ,free gift&lt;br /&gt;^^</li>
    <li> For some personal reason ,I have to return it.But the seller‘s attitude, it is worth five star. and it is just so</li>
    <li> My wife liked it very much! The quality and the price are both good enough to buy it again !</li>
    <li> Great product great price quick delivery!</li>
    <li> very nice lotion at a very good discounted price. I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very nice too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, I tried lots of products either sting or not moisturize enough. But Sisley is the best.It very moisturizes and smell good. Love it !!!</li>
    <li> This is the only skin cream that is a match for my extremely sensitive skin. My frequent rashes and skin irritations are a thing of the past! Sisley is pricey but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 25 years, I love it.I am 73 years old and my skin is beautiful. I look much younger because of Sisley Ecological Compound.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I know it&#x27;s expensive, and I myself don&#x27;t have a lot of money, but this is well worth the investment. It somehow draws moisture in so skin feels soothed and comfortable. I also use Clairins, Darphin, (who I love as well) Shiseido, and Lancome. They&#x27;re all good, but as moisturizers go, I like&lt;br /&gt;Sisley better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When skin is wind burned or sensitive in some way and other moisturizers aren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s time to try Sisley. I use Ecological Compound under Collagen And Woodmallow or Sisleya. Everything, including your regular non-Sisley moisturizer will perform better with EC underneath. It is also good all by itself. I bought my EC from fragrance.net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Lisa M</li>
    <li> Incredibly hydrating---good for layering and use with serums and cream--expecially at night&lt;br /&gt;Or can be used alone. One of Sisley&#x27;s basics. Fresh clean sent. Wonderful</li>
    <li> have been using Sisley ecological compound over 10 years and this particular purchase I made on June/2014 should be a fake one. I just opened a new bottle this morning and noticed the difference right away. I then come over and read the reviews here and noticed mostly the complains comes from the purchase this years. I am not sure if the seller intentionally or accidentally get and resell the fake products. I already contact amazon and the seller, hope we could work out this problem</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s almost expired. i&#x27;m very diappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Fresh, light, moisturizing, for all age and all class skin.Smell so good. I hve more of 50 and I use this the first.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel fresh! I love it! No greasy no heavy. Hidrated and healty skin. Totally recommended for everyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for my skin to use Sisley. Sisley is always my favorite. Hope the price will be more cheap.</li>
    <li> FAKE , GOT TERRIBLE ALLERGY !</li>
    <li> A light hydrating cream. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residues. You can use it by itself or before any other. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I was really happy when I purchased it at such a good price and believed it was true. But until today I opened a new one(which is true, I bought from stores) and compared them carefully. If you look at the bottom of the bottle carefully, you will find they are different. This one is thicker and the inner circle(which printed&amp;#34;sisley&amp;#34;) bulge out. A true one&#x27;s inner circle is plat! And also, if you smell them carefully, they are different!!!! But kind of similar, so i didn&#x27;t realize it for so long!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m so angry now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to this product, great customer service.</li>
    <li> I always love this product for multiple natural ingredients. It made my skin soft and smell really good.</li>
    <li> my wife like it. I just pay it for her.</li>
    <li> I love it! It really keeps my skin moist and looking good!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for a long time and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love Sisley! I&#x27;ve been using Ecological Compound for years. It&#x27;s expensive, but it lasts a long time. It smells so good and feels divine on the skin. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other face creams, but for me this is the best.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer on the planet, does not sting eyes, does not create oiliness, just gets absorbed beautifully in skin and perfect for under make-up.  There is absolutely no difference I can see between this one offered online and the product on the shelves at big brand name department store. In fact I would imagine these are fairly fresh given the high tunover through Amazon and low exposure to light and heat.  I am 50 and my skin looks 35 (or so I&#x27;m told)....this is truly a miracle product.</li>
