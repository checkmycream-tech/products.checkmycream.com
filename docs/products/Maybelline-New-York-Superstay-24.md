      <li>Love the color.  </li>

      <li>Was pleased with my purchase and the seller</li>
      <li>Love this lipcolor.  </li>
      <li>To be truthful, the present day Maybelline Superstay ones are not as good as what I was using, literally, a dozen years ago.</li>
      <li>The trick to applying these successfully is to work fast and sure and fight the urge to reapply too thick of a coat.</li>
      <li>The color does not last over 1 - 2 hrs and the color does not apply very smoothly.</li>
      <li>, I keep coming back for more because I&#x27;m not one to be reapplying lipstick all day, nor like lipstick smeared around my mouth, so, these Superstay are still my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With a steady hand quickly outline and fill - once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Maybelline Superstay was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Love how it works and how long it works.</li>
      <li>This stuff lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like most stains do.</li>
      <li>Color is nice, but I wanted it to be a little darker.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of different shades available to match any skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I really, really like this lip color.  </li>
      <li>The color is subtle and perfect for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>Will cry when Maybelline discontinues product as new formulas are created.</li>
      <li>Stays better than a lot of other similar products-----</li>
      <li>The color stays on for many hours with only slight fading.  </li>
      <li>As a busy mom I like the piece of mind of knowing I have lip stick on without the need to reapply.</li>
      <li>but it sure does stay for at least 8 hours without needing to reapply.</li>
      <li>Stays fresh looking, and is durable &amp; long lasting.</li>
      <li>read some comments that these are hard to smooth on.</li>
      <li>It gives me a natural look and lasts a long time.</li>

    <li> This stuff lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like most stains do.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day!  Awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick.  After eating and drinking, you don&#x27;t have to worry if your lipstick is still in place.  The color stays on for many hours with only slight fading.  There are a lot of different shades available to match any skin tone.  Definitely try this product.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Love the ease of using it.  I only have to apply it once after lunch, after the initial application in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great lipstick, great staying power, great color! If you&#x27;re looking for a long-lasting lipstick that looks great, Superstay 24 is it. And the Toffee color is neutral and flattering.</li>
    <li> Color is nice, but I wanted it to be a little darker. It doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as some of the other colors.</li>
    <li> Color nothing like shown. Real light frosted peach color.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Put it on in the morning ONCE, remove it at the end of the day.  Never smears, never comes off on a napkin.</li>
    <li> I wanted this and expected what I received. Lasts all day for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent !  Stays fresh looking, and is durable &amp; long lasting.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Love how it works and how long it works.</li>
    <li> Favorite lipstick!  Will cry when Maybelline discontinues product as new formulas are created.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many glowing reviews about the Superstay lip colors, and I have to agree with them 100%. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off on anything. It outlasts other similarly priced lip stains and isn&#x27;t as drying. The color is subtle and perfect for everyday wear. It&#x27;s definitely my go-to lip product. I love it!</li>
    <li> Stays better than a lot of other similar products-----</li>
    <li> Lasts the best of all the similar products.</li>
    <li> essential  with  my makeup</li>
    <li> Love this lipcolor.  The best at staying on.  Was pleased with my purchase and the seller</li>
    <li> Maybelline Superstay was exactly what I was looking for.  It gives me a natural look and lasts a long time. It doesn&#x27;t stay on for 24 hours but it sure does stay for at least 8 hours without needing to reapply. It&#x27;s my go to lipstick. As a busy mom I like the piece of mind of knowing I have lip stick on without the need to reapply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of these longlasting promises of day long coverage, and soon found out which style and brand did indeed deliver for me. To be truthful, the present day Maybelline Superstay ones are not as good as what I was using, literally, a dozen years ago. Something about the colors is off, which you don&#x27;t see till you actually apply. Every one that I&#x27;ve bought in the last 2 years has a sparkly glitter-like sheen, and I prefer a matte finish and like the gloss that comes with the color tube for any shine.&lt;br /&gt;But, I keep coming back for more because I&#x27;m not one to be reapplying lipstick all day, nor like lipstick smeared around my mouth, so, these Superstay are still my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some comments that these are hard to smooth on. The trick to applying these successfully is to work fast and sure and fight the urge to reapply too thick of a coat. With a steady hand quickly outline and fill - once.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could find one without a glittery sheen in a color I like. In years past, the colors used to be grouped by shine and matte which made it easier to make a choice, I miss that grouping.</li>
    <li> Very nice lipstick, my girlfriend loved it!</li>
    <li> The color does not last over 1 - 2 hrs and the color does not apply very smoothly.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this lip color.  I put it on in the morning and still have color at the end of the day.  In fact sometimes the next morning there is enough color left that I just put some gloss on and am set to go for the day.</li>
