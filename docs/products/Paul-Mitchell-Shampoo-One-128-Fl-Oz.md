### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Just superb stuff.</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell shampoo is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;flowing lockes &amp; everything in perfect place.</li>
      <li>This one gallon buy is a very good deal.  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo - great price</li>
      <li>The PM product is great; however, their packaging decisions leave a lot to be desired.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>this is a great product but the container was cracked and leaked within the box</li>
      <li>This gallon deal looked too good to pass up</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo, made even better by finding it at such a good price.</li>
      <li>Simply the best shampoo I have ever used - and I&#x27;ve used many.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo</li>
      <li>The product is outstanding but the package was sent with a defective top which caused spillage and loss of 1/4 of the product.</li>
      <li>My wife and I have used Shampoo One for more than five years and we love it.  </li>
      <li>Have used for many, many years.</li>
      <li>Shsmpoo One is by far the best Shsmpoo I&#x27;ve found... Does not strip hair and scalp of all oils yet leaves hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like Shampoo One and, after five days of using it, it sure doesn&#x27;t clean like Shampoo One.  </li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Shampoo One, 1 Gallon, this is a fantastic shampoo, I have used it for years,</li>
      <li>like that light coconut fragrance.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am very happy with the clean soft natural effect this Paul Mitchell shampoo has on my hair</li>
      <li>there is no substitute for having your hair clean and free from all or oils and products.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I use about 1 cap full of this shampoo</li>
      <li>well worth the difference in the price.  </li>
      <li>When shampoo arrived, the top had experienced some sort of impact &amp; had broken and leaked approx.</li>
      <li>Only shampoo I can find that never strips or overdries my hair, but still gets it very clean!</li>
      <li>and when you do use your other Paul Mitchell products I think you will be more pleased with your</li>
      <li>is the first time I bought it by the gallon.  </li>
      <li>The price is so much better than purchasing bottles with smaller quantitites.  </li>
      <li>One gallon certainly saves some money, but is also convenient.  </li>
      <li>If you have fine, delicate or damaged hair, you&#x27;ll love PM Shampoo One.  </li>
      <li>like I said I still have the whole arsenal of Paul Mitchell products on my shelf:  </li>
      <li>Makes it so much easier to dispense product.  </li>
      <li>After two years, my hair is much healthier, meaning I can allow it to grow longer without split ends.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to a particularly formal affair</li>
      <li>the detangler the lotions( flexible supersculpting); &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; which is the humidity resistant styling spray; the super skinny daily treatment, &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The present one is very poor for an excellent product.</li>
      <li>this is why I  highly recommend you buy the gallon size</li>
      <li>Yes, you do have to pour from the large container into a smaller one, but</li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling soft, fluffy, well-conditioned, and clean, with no discernible residue.  </li>
      <li>This morning I went to a local beauty salon and bought a couple of big bottles of the real stuff.  </li>
      <li>nothing negative to say, very thick, a little bit goes a long way, works good as a body wash as well, not harsh, very natural smell, washes out easily.</li>
      <li>I have recently in the last 6 months completely stopped using conditioners sprays and all that junk with a couple of exceptions.  </li>
      <li>and I mix it with some hot water in a little glass of water.  </li>

    <li> As expected, delivered without issue, in a timely manner. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old and while I have gained face in all these years,  I still have all my hair with very little grey.  I don&#x27;t Were a hat, and have used P.M. for atleast 25 years,  I&#x27;m just saying.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo I tried other shampoos from Paul Mitchell but none of them add the body at this one. This is my shampoo for life.</li>
    <li> One gallon certainly saves some money, but is also convenient.  Look for a pump dispenser on Amazon that fits gallon jugs.... Makes it so much easier to dispense product.  PM Shsmpoo One is by far the best Shsmpoo I&#x27;ve found... Does not strip hair and scalp of all oils yet leaves hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I can find that never strips or overdries my hair, but still gets it very clean!</li>
    <li> Have used for many, many years. Enough said.</li>
    <li> When shampoo arrived, the top had experienced some sort of impact &amp; had broken and leaked approx. 20% of contents in what had become a slimey mess of a box. I suggest shipper should research an alternative packing resource. The present one is very poor for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> this is a great product but the container was cracked and leaked within the box</li>
    <li> The price is so much better than purchasing bottles with smaller quantitites.  Yes, you do have to pour from the large container into a smaller one, but well worth the difference in the price.  Unfortunately when I ordered the shampoo, I ordered a CD.  Both items were shipped in the same box so it wasn&#x27;t surprising to find that the CD case was busted which was very disappointing.  The PM product is great; however, their packaging decisions leave a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shampoo I have ever used - and I&#x27;ve used many.  If you have fine, delicate or damaged hair, you&#x27;ll love PM Shampoo One.  Leaves hair feeling soft, fluffy, well-conditioned, and clean, with no discernible residue.  Just superb stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product. After two years, my hair is much healthier, meaning I can allow it to grow longer without split ends.</li>
    <li> I have recently in the last 6 months completely stopped using conditioners sprays and all that junk with a couple of exceptions.  if I&#x27;m in some extreme activity I will put on some styling gel to keep my hair completely in one position:  flat to my head and out of the way of fans power tools all that junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if I&#x27;m going to a particularly formal affair I&#x27;m a spray on some hairspray to keep my&lt;br /&gt;flowing lockes &amp; everything in perfect place. and in an attempt to improve the function of either the gel or the hairspray I&#x27;m MAY on some random occasions add some conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;that being said... I use about 1 cap full of this shampoo and I mix it with some hot water in a little glass of water.  my hair is past my butt.  that is enough to shampoo my scalp once and my hairs two times.&lt;br /&gt;I like that light coconut fragrance.  the only conditioning I do is by hand: smoothing down the hair follicles as my hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the clean soft natural effect this Paul Mitchell shampoo has on my hair I will be buying it by the gallon from now on this is the first time I bought it by the gallon.  like I said I still have the whole arsenal of Paul Mitchell products on my shelf:  the detangler the lotions( flexible supersculpting); &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; which is the humidity resistant styling spray; the super skinny daily treatment, &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; the coconut mousse: every Paul Mitchell almost.  And I feel they are the best.&lt;br /&gt;but there is no substitute for having your hair clean and free from all or oils and products.  this is why I  highly recommend you buy the gallon size so you don&#x27;t feel the need to conserve it.&lt;br /&gt;if and when you do use your other Paul Mitchell products I think you will be more pleased with your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next time I am going to try the tea tree shampoo. (gallon size, lol)saves 10 trips to the store.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo - great price</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Shampoo One, 1 Gallon, this is a fantastic shampoo, I have used it for years, nothing negative to say, very thick, a little bit goes a long way, works good as a body wash as well, not harsh, very natural smell, washes out easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this shampoo is but I know what it isn&#x27;t ... it isn&#x27;t Paul Mitchell Shampoo One.  My wife and I have used Shampoo One for more than five years and we love it.  We&#x27;ve always gotten it through a barber/beauty salon.  This gallon deal looked too good to pass up but it&#x27;s a fake.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like Shampoo One and, after five days of using it, it sure doesn&#x27;t clean like Shampoo One.  This morning I went to a local beauty salon and bought a couple of big bottles of the real stuff.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Paul Mitchell years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Buying by the gallon saves money. If you want a quality hair product, this is one.&lt;br /&gt;I buy about 2 a year.</li>
