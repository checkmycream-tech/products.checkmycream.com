    <li> It is exactly the same scent I had purchased in store. I was sad that I did not see this on the shelf anymore and lucky for me I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> good transaction, item was as described.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original perfume from Victoria Secret. It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Product received was not product advertised. In the photo the product on the left was what was advertised and I received the product in the right . Completely different. No box and very unhappy</li>
    <li> It came really fast and in nice packaging, the perfume smells really nice but strong and gives me a headache sadly.but spray lightly and its nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the price and shipping was great but I had received a bottle that would not spray, so I had to make it work. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I guess this perfume is not my type.&lt;br /&gt;It smells to strong and reminds me of old lady perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit better after it fades, but not much. Also it kind of&lt;br /&gt;smells like rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for Amazon! I got this fragrance years ago as a gift in the smaller size. After 6 years I was nearing the end of the bottle and started looking for a replacement only to find that VS reformulated the scent and mine was no longer sold.  I was a little nervous to purchase online not knowing if the product would in fact be the original scent, but it was! And I am so glad I purchased the 8.4 fl. oz. bottle. And if you are not familiar with the scent, it is neither overly fruity or floral. I would say it falls in the &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34; catagory. But in the best way possible, more like a cologne than a perfume. And to be honest I think there are pheromones in there, I like to switch up my scent day to day, but any day I wear this my boyfriend comments that I smell good. It&#x27;s turned into a running joke because it is every time and only when I wear this scent.  Well worth the buy!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s it, good product, good price. The only thing, I spectect a glass bottle, not a plastic one. It&#x27;s the only thing</li>
    <li> Waw it&#x27;s the best Perfum very sexy for ....., I m happy with this order very impressed it a great</li>
    <li> Smells great like roses, you wont get tired of smelling it. The smell of this mist is at it says  Sexy. i would recommend for teens and young adults.</li>
    <li> I liked this Victorias&#x27;s Secret product, it was great for my niece&#x27;s Birthday &amp; she loved the scent. It was more affordable than at the Victoria&#x27;s secret store &amp; arrived in a prompt manner&lt;br /&gt;&amp; on time for her Birthday. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice for Summer use.  Refreshing after shower as it is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, well packaged. One of my favorits. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed the smell on my wife! It&#x27;s not to soft and not to strong in smell. Matches my wife pH level just right.</li>
