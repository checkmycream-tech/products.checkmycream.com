      <li>I am pleased with these massage boots.  </li>
      <li>MY WIFE LOVE THIS UNIT</li>
      <li>My grandmother is able to walk with help, but she still uses them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was in a great deal of pain, this just doesn&#x27;t really have any effect like I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>It did better than I thought the price reflects and is well worth it and comes with a nice carry bag.</li>
      <li>The velcro is wide and works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>and WOW they are a great help.</li>
      <li>A softer cover would make them more flexible and comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Customer service is very good: I live in Canada, they don&#x27;t deliver there, I contacted them by email, they replied right away to confirm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to assemble and disassemble.</li>
      <li>and they solve the problem very quick.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and control.</li>
      <li>5 stars as it works and easy to use and affordable price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the item is easy to put together as well, even when I had to rig both the cuffs to fit my one leg and hook the hoses up to use for one leg</li>
      <li>: you can hold the wires with your fingers, and release your fingers progressively.&lt;br /&gt;Velcro and plastic are of good quality, product on the overall is good quality even if it doesn&#x27;t look like at first</li>
      <li>He is 6ft tall and the fit him just fine.</li>
      <li>I tried them myself and the fit is fine but the pressure and action are not sufficient to be considered a good massage.  </li>
      <li>It took us a while for her to agree to use them, so I tried them myself to show her how they work and to make her feel comfortable</li>
      <li>it should be mentioned specifically what size are those so anyone can see if it will fit around the leg or not......</li>
      <li>to get on and situated comfortably.</li>
      <li>My husbands feet are size 10&#x27; his feet fit in the foot bed</li>
      <li>the size is good: I fit the feet balloon (even I had doubts reading the comments, but what interested me first was the calves, but even the feet fit).</li>
      <li>When she notifies me that she received it, then I will ask her how much she liked it, and then I can send you her feedback.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are fantastic at keeping my leg cramps away.</li>
      <li>Wear light pants and socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>so far so good it is helping with my fathers legs pains.</li>
      <li>In addition, the seller clearly marks these as not for vascular problems, I assume because of legalese and requirements by the FDA etc, but they are indeed good for mild circulatory stimulation in addition to relaxation.  </li>
      <li>The product is very good for this purpose, I put them on at night when I go to bed and when ever I wake up a little</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say, this unit is made very robust and the tubes are pliable so you can move around without them popping off.</li>
      <li>but they are not bad either.</li>
      <li>thx you very very much...and thx for rushing them to us so quickly!</li>
      <li>, I feel completely confident that the boots will be able to be adjusted to a smaller size with NO PROBLEM!</li>
      <li>Fast and easy service.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved them.. The only problem I had with them was that they could not go around my one leg that has edema... You need to get a size a little bigger.. I used one inch velcro strips to expand the circumference to go around my bad leg...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the unit performs fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a little over two months ago.  At the time I thought it was a good purchase - it did what I thought it would do.  It is having problems already, though.  So I guess that I get to find out what customer service is like...</li>
    <li> I like the deluxe digital massage boots, once they are in place, the alternating massage is great!  Takes a little time to get them on properly.</li>
    <li> Life saver! 17 year old granddaughter with dysautonomia--these are a must-have! She says they saved her from terrible pain and weakness many times.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a friend who lives in Milan.  My friend saw this item at the skymall magazine during her flight from Milan to Los Angeles.  As a matter of fact she had ordered it, and their price was $199 plus shipping.  Because her credit card did not match with the delivery address, which was my home in California, they never sent the boots to this address, nor did they notify her.      We saw the exact item through Amazon.com, and the price was so much less $109.  I showed it to my friend, and she immediately asked me to order them for her, and so I did.  I got the merchandis so quickly that I was shocked!    I sent them to her about on the same day I received them from the vendor, about two weeks ago and she still has not received it.  When she notifies me that she received it, then I will ask her how much she liked it, and then I can send you her feedback.</li>
    <li> I have been using these boots for a while and they are ok.  Not great, just ok.  They relieve tired legs a little bit but not much.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I love them but they are not bad either.</li>
    <li> I bought these boots because I thougth them could help with my sometimes swollen feet.  The only problem I had was that my calves were too large for the boots to fit.  I had left an email with the company that sold me the boots telling them that they would not fit.  I just want to say that I got outstanding customer service.  I returned the boots and got a prompt refund. I have never had a company follow through so diligently to make sure I was happy with their product.  I only rated the boots 2 stars because I could not try them out.  I give them (the company that sold me the boots) 5 stars for customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
    <li> I bought a set of these boots for myself about a year ago.  I use them on a fairly frequent basis as I&#x27;ve always had leg pain - even as a child...  My Dad had bypass surgery a number of years ago and they stripped veins from his legs as part of that operation.  He has lived with the pain and discomfort for a number of years but this past summer, he was miserable so I  lent him my pair of Massage Boots.  I left their house and within 15 minutes of arriving back home, my Mom was on the phone to let me know that I would not be getting them back as my Dad was so pleased with how well they comforted him.  I then bought a second pair.  If I have to, I&#x27;ll buy a third and forth.  These things work unbelievably well and I couldn&#x27;t live without them - and neither could my Dad.</li>
    <li> I bought these boots for a client, to help reduce the swelling in her legs. It works well.</li>
    <li> The first control unit failed but was replaced quickly. The machine apparently returned circulation to my foot which went numb and so weak I needed crutches. Using the machine restored enough strength stand, although with care. A half dozen doctors denied my idea of deep vein thrombosis with blood pooling in the foot yet offered only pain meds.  Having similar deep vein thrombosis years ago, I knew my symptoms but doctors disagreed. I looked for something like  pump up stockings I knew existed. This device was the nearest I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because after using it several times a day I had pains like angina. I strongly  suspect clots were busting loose in my foot  getting to my lungs and heart. It never got bad enough to send for the ambulance, but close. I quit using it and the pains stopped.  Eventually I got brave and used it again and discovered if I used it more than twice a day I got the chest pains. I am convinced the chest pains are related and the machine works because it pushes clots out of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will DEFINITELY use it twice a day. I have no other hope to restore my leg so I will risk the chest pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is with doctors and deep vein thrombosis? My theory, (half serious) is they teach DVT the last day of medical school when nobody shows up for class because they are all out celebrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this thing but with care. It absolutely does work.</li>
    <li> bought this for my mom and with 2 x 20 minutes/day applications her leg swelling disappeared in less than a week</li>
    <li> The product itself is OK. But compared with price, it&#x27;s not worth it.     There is a little note says:  \\&quot;Due to Federal and State hygiene laws, returns of Deluxe Massage Boots are prohibited\\&quot;     How funny!</li>
    <li> I have serious pain in my feet. I use the boots only twice a day. I am a big man. I have problems keeping the strap over my feet tight but it has made big difference in reducing the pain in my feet</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. My 88 year old mother has slow circulation. This has really helped. Her legs don&#x27;t hurt as much anymore.</li>
    <li> My husband has neuropathy in his legs; and feet and he explains it does nothing for him.</li>
    <li> I ordered these boots for my mom who is going through chemo-therapy, and has developed neuropathy.  My moms biggest complaint was that her legs and feet were on fire and hurting so bad that her legs had to be rubbed constantly! We put those on massage boots on her and...she wont take them off...she loves them...it really helps her pain...thx you very very much...and thx for rushing them to us so quickly!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom. Bit cumbersome to use it</li>
    <li> Excellent service, I had to return a part that did come with a problem and they solve the problem very quick. The product is excellent for circulation improvement.</li>
    <li> The directions are in \\&quot;Chinglish\\&quot;, but can be made out with a little study.  Careful perusal of the drawings will show how to hook up the air hoses easily enough.  The \\&quot;digital sequence\\&quot; of the controller is simply not adjustable, except in duration of pressure, and that to only a small degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, they do inflate and deflate in sequence, and they do seem to be relatively ruggedly made.  I do have a concern with how well the hoses will stay attached over time. Where they attach to the cuffs and to each other it can be addressed with some small nylon zip ties.  However, where they plug into the controller, they use a special barb that is only held in by friction.  There is nowhere to put any sort of tie to hold it on.  Perhaps some sort of glue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find by changing the arrangement of the hoses I could get a useful variation of the massage action.  The method shown in the instructions that came with the unit only allow for one inflation/deflation pattern, running both the lower and upper leg at the same time  However, simply swapping one of the hoses to cross from one leg to another made a significant difference in the feel of the action; one that I felt was beneficial.  The hoses that come with the unit are long enough to do this with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I would recommend is that you wear stockings while using the unit.  Otherwise, the plastic inner layer becomes somewhat sweaty and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my girl friend, who is a nurse, and recently started working 12 hour shifts.  While in the hospital recently, they used a similar device on her.  So I bought her these, and she says they work great.</li>
    <li> These items were a gift. I do not know if they&#x27;ve been used or not. I have not received feedback yet. The reviews on the product sounded good.</li>
    <li> I love these Massage Boots!! I have swelling in my thighs and legs from a very bad car accident ! Today, is the first time I used them and to say I&#x27;m tickled, is an understatement. I just used them for about a hour and I could tell a world of difference. The air pump is very powerful, especially if you add more time to the normal setting of 20 seconds. If you have swelling, or edema, I really believe you will really like this Machine.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0020JN4BQ Deluxe Digital Massage Boots (fully adjustable)]]    Tho these orignaly arrived not workng, i was promptly contactd by a rep of th compny and was offerd a brand new electric box free of charg. now thees boots tthat rival th ones used in hospitls wrrk grate on edema.</li>
    <li> I had great hopes for this item. I have passive swelling of one leg following an accident. This item did not reduce that even while used with my leg elevated. The compression was so slight all I got were band marks similar to what you would get if you leaned against something and it left a temporary indentation. I can get 4+ swelling on a scale of 1-4, 4 being the greatest. I get much better relief just elevating my leg. Very disappointed with this product. NOW AS I AM PACKING UP THIS ITEM TO RETURN IT I FIND A NOTICE \\&quot;****************DUE TO FEDERAL AND STATE HYGIENE LAWS, RETURNS OF DELUXE MASSAGE BOOTS ARE PROHIBITED******************** THIS NOTICE IS NOT ON THEIR AD NOR WILL YOU FIND IT IN THEIR RETURNS POLICY.</li>
    <li> I got these for my father who has arthritis in his knees. The pain would prevent him from getting a good nights sleep. He puts these on his legs for 20 minutes before bed and they help him to get a restful nights sleep. They are very well made and aren&#x27;t very complicated to put together.I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with these massage boots.  The only problem I had was they were too small in the calf areas.  The max calf measurement is about 16&amp;#34; to close the boot properly.  Since my calves are larger than 16&amp;#34;, my solution was to buy two pairs of 2&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34; sticky-back Velcro from a fabric store.  I stuck the fuzzy side &amp; the loop side back to back to make extenders which then would easily attach to the Velcro fasteners on the boots.  With that extra bit of length they now fit comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Normally my legs ache due to poor circulation and these boots seem to help.  The motor is relatively quiet.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for a higher-end product without knowing if they would help or not.  I feel these were a good value and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product. The massage function by means of compression works very well and I am very satisfied. I inky give 4 stars because assembly is tedious.</li>
    <li> The massage boots are wonderful.  They provide much needed circulation for my legs.  The size is very, very good.  The velcro is wide and works wonderfully.  I am overweight and have always had very large legs. I am able to use both the calf and thigh sections.  What a relief! And as I loose weight, I feel completely confident that the boots will be able to be adjusted to a smaller size with NO PROBLEM!</li>
    <li> I bought the leg air massager and starting using them and thought they were effective. I used it twice a day for 20 minutes and in the AM my legs looked good(no swelling). During the day the legs would take on fluid again and swell. Then my daughter mentioned the elastic socks that diabetics wear ($20-25) and so I bought a pair of them.  I now use the socks every day for about 10 hours and my leg swelling is almost non-existant.  I would try a pair of the socks first due to the reduced cost.</li>
    <li> Helps my husband&#x27;s leg pain.  We tried to get this product through medical supply and was unable to due to regulations and insurance limitations.  The price was very fair and the product provides pain relief. This was a terrific find.</li>
    <li> These really help my legs at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to help my leg cramps - potassium, magnesium, calcium, massage, exercise, and homeopathy among others.  Even a Doppler ultrasound at a vein center showed that my valves are fine.  So why did I have excruciating cramps most every night?  I was at my wit&#x27;s end to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try these boots, as they didn&#x27;t cost all that much.&lt;br /&gt;They are fantastic at keeping my leg cramps away. I use them almost every night, and don&#x27;t have to worry about leg cramps anymore.  I don&#x27;t need the thigh part, so I only use the lower half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use them with bare legs, as the photo show.  Your bare legs will sweat profusely in the vinyl boots.  Wear light pants and socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t be intimidated by the assembly instructions.  Just look at the photo to see where the tubing goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these.  I&#x27;ve been using them for 7 months, with no problems.  I even take them with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> After some days i wake too much as a senior citizen i put my massager on for 15 minutes and am rejuvenated. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my mother who has Cancer and is experiencing edema of the legs from Chemo and Medications. I had some trouble getting them ONLY because UPS was too lazy to deliver or bother to find my apartment in a ten unit complex. They were sent back to the company, but I emailed them and explained what happened. I asked the company to ship to an alternate address and send USPS. They did exactly that and also sent them priority 2 day mail. The product was far better than I expected and after one days use my Mom was feeling her toes again. I highly recommend this product and the company that sells them. Thank you for the excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I purchased a cheaper set of these last year from a different manufacturer and have since been through 2 motors and air tubes that constantly fall off. I&#x27;m pleased to say, this unit is made very robust and the tubes are pliable so you can move around without them popping off. The material is well made and thick so it wont wear out or fall apart, the adjustable Velcro is great for a perfect fit, I love these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed with this.  I was hoping for more of a massage feeling.  It does feel good but once again not what I was really wanting.  I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy service. Item was as described but did not help my wife with her leg problems.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and bought anyway because my lymphedema was flared up and I was in a great deal of pain, this just doesn&#x27;t really have any effect like I was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> The ad said &amp;#34;fully adjustable&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s not true.  When I first got them my right leg was a little swollen and I could barely get the material around it.  My husband helped the next time and it helped a little but the pressure wasn&#x27;t very good.  I contacted the company and read other posts from customers and they all agreed that once they were purchased, you could not return them.  I fail to see how a guarantee can be offered if there is no remedy so I just wasted my money and buried the product in the back of my closet.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lou</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandfather.  He says it really works well and helps him with circulation and discomforts.</li>
    <li> multiple tubes are confusing</li>
    <li> My legs are too large for parts of it.  The parts that fit in it, the massaging is not strong.  Feels like a weak blood pressure cuff filling up.</li>
    <li> Did not fit well, too loose, the massage wasn&#x27;t strong enough to make a difference. I wasted my money on these boots.</li>
    <li> I have very severe neuropathy in my feet and legs and terrible restless leg syndrome. My doctor recommended I try these and WOW they are a great help. I use them in the evening (when my pain is the worst) and I just can&#x27;t get over how much they help. Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> This is very compact and functional device.  5 stars as it works and easy to use and affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> His legs ache and also are numb.  He normally won&#x27;t bother with anything like this, but really loves having it and is using it daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. so far so good it is helping with my fathers legs pains. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to those of you who have legs that ache either on a continual basis or just at night.  They give great comfort with the air massage. They can be set at the pressure you prefer for comfot.  The only issue I have with the product is that the hoses fit loosely and fall off during massage.  Other than that....this is a great product.  I have fibromyalgia and my legs ache horribly at times...this procudt give relief and although the aching does not stop completely, the aching does reduce in intensity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for and individual who has Restless Leg Syndrome.  It wasn&#x27;t strong enough to help very much.  I believe that they were hoping for a much more pronounced feeling of massage.</li>
    <li> much better than the last ones we purchased and broke within a  year. hope they last longer,and they came with instructions.</li>
    <li> Great for diabetic circulation and very relaxing.</li>
    <li> These are a complete waste of money.. Don&#x27;t purchase these. Too complicated to put on and once connected they don&#x27;t do the job! Waste of energy, time and money.</li>
    <li> I ordered these a year ago, they felt really good. Lately I started using them because I have symptoms of neuropathy in my feet and legs. They feel wonderful. I can get the intensity I want by setting to 40. 30 is a bit too weak but 40 is excellent. I am really happy I bought them and will buy another pair if these quit working.</li>
    <li> This boots are just what I was looking for, they give me a nice massage that help my legs have a better blood circulation, it is a really good article. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bulky and not easy to set up and store. It takes time to put on. I don&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
    <li> had to send these back. no hassle about it. just not what we needed.</li>
    <li> They are small dont even wrap around the leg. thats way these people put flyer with the item \\&quot;Due to hygenic situation please do no return the merchandise\\&quot;. May be they already knew that that they are small in size and they dont want anyone to return what they are selling. it should be mentioned specifically what size are those so anyone can see if it will fit around the leg or not...... I am very much disappointed with this purchase ....</li>
    <li> The unit arrived on time and packaged well. Assembly was simple and operating the unit was easy. I had it working in just a few min. Very comforting.</li>
    <li> I bought the boots for mother after reading several positive reviews online.  However, because she is a small woman (under 5ft and less than 115lbs, the boots are too large for her calves and she can barely feel the pressure.  I tried them myself and the fit is fine but the pressure and action are not sufficient to be considered a good massage.  Unfortunately the boots cannot be returned so I would caution that you be completely sure this is what you want before buying[[ASIN:B0020JN4BQ Deluxe Digital Massage Boots (fully adjustable)]].</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying this for an elderly diabetic person with poor circulation, don&#x27;t.  They can&#x27;t handle the uncomfortable pressure on their legs that&#x27;s necessary to make it work effectively.  A younger person probably would have no trouble with it, but then they probably wouldn&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> I have neuropathy in the leg and bought this because something similar to this was used on me during a hospital stay.  It is not as strong and powerful as the hospital&#x27;s, but it does provide relief for a reasonable price.  I tend to use just the lower leg portion and that seems to provide a tighter hold than if I also attach the thigh portion with the lower leg.  There are two settings to the inflation:  one leg at a time, or both legs at the same time.  I opt for the one leg at a time since that provides a tighter hold on each leg.  You also have control on the timer so you can nap and know that in 25 minutes, the machine will shut off.</li>
    <li> Due to a bad hip replacement, I have trouble bending enough to get the boots on.  However, once I did, the product worked really well. It would be nice if they added something like built-in loops at the top to help get them on.  I sure can&#x27;t sew my own loops on without putting holes in the \\&quot;airbag.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you are truly ill or have no one around to give you a hand with this you will be better off without the aggravation.  Don&#x27;t bother with this particular &amp;#34;medical device&amp;#34;.  It has about ten different parts to fit together and then there is the joy of fitting it onto your legs while it falls apart.......and then it hardly works.  Save your money  and your blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Definitely not for a bigger person.  They should offer a jumbo size unit for taller and larger people who are frequently the ones w/ heart, kidney and vein disease, not attractive young models. Idea is good but impractical for those needing it most.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Ship takes 1 week to ship to Florida.  There is no option to ship faster.  Product works great and does relieve swelling.  One advantage is you can join the 2 thigh massager together and use on your butt or stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design could be improved in these areas:  running time should be programmable from 20 sec  to 60 sec or more.  2- should remember settings on next run. I set timer at 50 seconds but restart will set timer back at 20 second.  so annoying.</li>
    <li> It is suppossed to fit up to 20\\&quot; calf but it barely fits a 17\\&quot; and not my wife&#x27;s swollen leg that is 18\\&quot;. Now lets see how fun it is to return lol</li>
    <li> These are good. for helping to vet the fluid and swelling to work out of your legs and also takes the tingling out also.</li>
    <li> I have lymph edema and suffer from leg pains at night.  The product is very good for this purpose, I put them on at night when I go to bed and when ever I wake up a little I press the button to turn it on again and go right back to sleep and sleep deeply. However the material that the boots is made of stinks so bad that I have to mark the review down. If the boots were made of better quality material I would have given it a 5 star review.  I have a better system that I use when the swelling is too great for this one, but difficult for me to put on.  BUT the boots do not have the very unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> i HAVE NERVE DAMAGE AND THIS WORKS ON ME!  I HAVE TO SAY THAT AGAIN WORKS ON ME.  CAN SAY WHAT IT WILL DO FOR YOU BUT WORKED FOR ME.</li>
    <li> They work fine, but the material is stiff. A softer cover would make them more flexible and comfortable. But they do the job as I am recovering from a total knee replacement and it helps to stimulate the blood flow from hip to toe!!!  ^_^</li>
    <li> This is too bulky massager. It is also too hard, so the massage is painful sometimes.</li>
    <li> The Deluxe Digital Massage Boots do a good job and perform exactly as I expected and as advertised.  They are similar to the devices used in the hospital in that they deliver very gentle sequential pressure, not the shiatsu type message that a Sharper Image chair provides; buyers should be aware of the difference.  In addition, the seller clearly marks these as not for vascular problems, I assume because of legalese and requirements by the FDA etc, but they are indeed good for mild circulatory stimulation in addition to relaxation.  These boots are clearly marketed as a mid-level massage boot and for me they delivered.  I had no problem with hooking up the tubing or keeping them attached; on the other hand, I sit up-right in such a manner that there is little chance of dislodgement.  The only things I wished were different were that they could be used for more than 20 min at a time and I wish they were fleece lined :-)</li>
    <li> I got it for my Mom that have circulation problems in her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surprise was when we conected just the B air flow is working, so just one size inflate.</li>
    <li> not sure how they work  - will have to rate them later - they look like they are well made</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these myself, but my wife loves them and uses them every day. She finds it very relaxing.</li>
    <li> awhile ago I had a blood clot in my leg which did damage to the veins and while sitting for any period of time my calf and foot swell.  I used this product though I had to rig it a bit because I was bigger then what the cuffs fit, but I only needed it for one leg.  So far it has caused the swelling in my leg to go down and stay down while using it.  I fully recommend this item to anybody with circulation problems in their leg(s).  I would have to say the only draw back is that I have to keep turning it back on every ten min. or so (never really timed it) but I don&#x27;t mind since it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the item is easy to put together as well, even when I had to rig both the cuffs to fit my one leg and hook the hoses up to use for one leg</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter who is recovering from major brain injury surgery.  The product is cumbersome, parts are flimsy and does not provide sufficient pressure to massage legs.  Very disappointed and should have returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 85 year old mother to use for her swollen lower calf, she says it is easy to use and she likes it.</li>
    <li> The boots do cover a wide range of areas on the legs but with the power on max the pressure it applies is minimal. At times it doesn&#x27;t feel as if I have anything on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who has water retention in his legs and feet due to diabetes and a heart condition. It works great and the results were noticeable after just a couple of uses. It&#x27;s easy to assemble and disassemble. There are much more expensive units on the market but it&#x27;s not necessary. This product will do the trick if you want to reduce the swelling. Also, if someone has diabetes and/or a heart condition you do not want the more expensive hardcore product as it may cause high blood pressure due to the excessive heat and pressure. This moderately performs the task which works better for someone with various ailments. Overall, give it a try if you want to circulate fluid build up and swelling. Once every other day for 20 minutes works just fine.</li>
    <li> I looked all my life for a massage machine that really compresses the legs, especially calves and Here it is!&lt;br /&gt;The functioning is really simple: it acts exactly like a blood pressure machine, but it&#x27;s electronic of course.&lt;br /&gt;It progressively blows the balloons for 60 seconds max, and releases the pressure. The pressure is REALLY high, don&#x27;t worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;only drawback: the pressure is released all of a sudden, and not progressively, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good for heart, because then all the blood is suddenly released in the body, but there&#x27;s a workaround: you can hold the wires with your fingers, and release your fingers progressively.&lt;br /&gt;Velcro and plastic are of good quality, product on the overall is good quality even if it doesn&#x27;t look like at first sight.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tall, 6&#x27;4, and the size is good: I fit the feet balloon (even I had doubts reading the comments, but what interested me first was the calves, but even the feet fit). thighs also fits.&lt;br /&gt;The product is really intuitive to use and customizable: there are a lot of wires (plastic wires blowing air), which seems complex at first time, but actually, you can assemble them as much as you want to focus the pressure exactly where you want (on only one calf, or only 1 thigh, or only 2 thighs, or only 2 calves, only 1 foot, 2 feet, or 1 calf and 1 foot,etc, etc ).&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is very good: I live in Canada, they don&#x27;t deliver there, I contacted them by email, they replied right away to confirm. Then by chance I went to spend a week holiday in a hotel in Las Vegas, I asked them to send me the package ASAP cause I was scarred to leave the hotel before receiving the package, and they sent it ASAP as I asked for, and even if it was Christmas period, I received the package right on time (the day of christmas, limit was 30th december).&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to compress your legs, buy this machine!</li>
    <li> Love this brought this for a aunt that has MS</li>
    <li> Good, strong quality. I looked at reviews before purchase, I believe it will only fit around legs up to about 160lbs body weight. Takes about 10min. to get on and situated comfortably. An added bonus is the fact you can do upper and lower together or separately. It has an effective ascending squeeze and it did relieve swelling and tightness, enough so , that after sitting through a second, compounded session I had to go to restroom. It did better than I thought the price reflects and is well worth it and comes with a nice carry bag.</li>
    <li> Sorry that the review has to be so bad, but there is no pressure at all and I feel like I have been had.  I hate to write bad reviews but this is an absolute and 100% NOT worth the money.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> The product is great, easy to use, however not fully adjustable.  The foot pad is small. My husbands feet are size 10&#x27; his feet fit in the foot bed but we are unable to close them.  The item is still usale for the calves and thighs and works as it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVE THIS UNIT</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Flimsy construction, uncomfortable hard plastic, ineffective pumping action one could barely discern. The one size does not fit all if you are thin.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected and CAN&#x27;T return them.Not too great.</li>
    <li> There really was not anything wrong with the product, it just did not work as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> Does not really massage very well. I kept the product because but it is not a great product at all.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t massage. Air comes in for 20 seconds, then out for 20 seconds. You can adjust that 20 seconds up to 60 seconds if you want but it doesn&#x27;t seem to change how much air comes in. You need to wrap these extremely tight to have any hope of feeling the air- I am not impressed and I would not recommend nor buy them again.</li>
    <li> fantastic,by end of the day just put them on and relax.</li>
    <li> My husband had poor leg circulation and has sever pain in his lower legs. These help to relieve the pain in his legs without medicine. They are easy to use and control. He is 6ft tall and the fit him just fine.</li>
    <li> At first we did not think it worked at all.&lt;br /&gt;Then we took off the thight section and then it worked properly on the calf section.</li>
    <li> My wife loves them. They are FOR HER. I try using them and I feel like a really week child is massaging me. She loves them and feels great after using them in the evening.</li>
    <li> They may help a little, but I was disappointed in them.  Legs/ankles down a little wight after taking them off, but that does not last long.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 94 year old aunt and she loves it for helping with her edema.  She reports that the hoses tend to come off the bladders but I told her to ask a male friend to put a small ty-wrap on each connection.  Properly done I&#x27;m sure that will take care of the problem</li>
    <li> Works just as stated.  Did not mind it on bare legs.  Feels good to me.  Bought for raynauds in my feet.  Will see if it helps with that.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0020JN4BQ Deluxe Digital Massage Boots (fully adjustable)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had surgery for a Liposarcoma that was wrapped around my sicatic nerve. The nerve was damaged and I suffer nueropathic pain esecially burning and extreme sensitivity of my foot and the feeling my calf is in sever cramp. These boots give me the pain relief I needed. Instead of begging for massages from my ever patient family I now just pop these on. Living in Australia I needed different voltage adapter but went to  JayCar electronics and they found an appropriate addapter for me. The customer care from this company was brillant also.</li>
    <li> My family bought these for my 86 year-old grandmother who suffered from a stroke and could not walk. From the lack of mobility, her legs and feet were very swollen. Using these a few times a day (2-3) for about 15 minutes, her swelling cam down significantly over a period of 5 days. It took us a while for her to agree to use them, so I tried them myself to show her how they work and to make her feel comfortable/excited about wearing them. They give a great leg/feet massage!! I have to admit that I have thought about buying a pair for myself. My grandmother is able to walk with help, but she still uses them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A feature that i really liked was that you could set the &#x27;intensity&#x27; of the compression by increasing the time they inflate (from 20s to 60s, i believe). 30 seconds felt really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone who is looking to reduce swelling or improve circulation.</li>
