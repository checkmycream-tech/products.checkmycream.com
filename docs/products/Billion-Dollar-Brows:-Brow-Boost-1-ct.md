### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am really happy with this product!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my brows!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in 100% perfect health according to all that.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>I even tried Latisse after this and that didn&#x27;t even work on my brows (but it did grow my lashes beautifully).  </li>
      <li>I had them tatooed and was happy with the result</li>
      <li>UNFORTUNATELY lol.)</li>
      <li>I read good results</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the products that cost upwards of $150 though to be fair...</li>
      <li>I have been very happy with how my brows have filled in</li>
      <li>I am very happy to see results so quickly and I will continue to use this product.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty fricking awesome.</li>
      <li>I believe in this product and am happy to learn that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been through 4 tubes used ( not every) nightly &amp; honestly havent seen growth.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>something will happen with more time.</li>
      <li>Many were over 100 dollars</li>
      <li>More hair, more groomed looking.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re touching my brows</li>
      <li>Quite pleased.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re looking fuller and more shapely.</li>
      <li>and I gotta say the brows look better.  </li>
      <li>I apply it in the morning before my makeup to the areas of my eyebrows that need it the most</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve felt better about my brows.</li>
      <li>Was able to get it at a discounted cost which helped.  </li>
      <li>and they are continuing to get better with use.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try to continue to see if I could get more growth.</li>
      <li>so if you want to try this you should buy more than one tube.  </li>
      <li>but they actually have almost a perfect shape and now just need more filling in</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are more filled in.  </li>
      <li>the price point, there isn&#x27;t going to be much lost money wise if you try it.</li>
      <li>and it really works and hoping to see more results after a bit more time!</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and virtually invisible when applied.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied and would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I had good brows before, I just wanted them thicker for a new style.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although Amazon,s delivery was perfect, the product was way less than that.</li>
      <li>I noticed longer lashes in about a week and a half, and now, at almost 3 weeks, my eyebrows are nearly perfect again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, and I certainly didn&#x27;t read any kind of warning on the packaging.</li>
      <li>I had a patch in one eyebrow that hasn&#x27;t filled in in months and months</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to give most things a try.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, it really does work.</li>
      <li>I would say buy 2 at a time because it does run out quick.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for quick results-this isn&#x27;t going to work..</li>
      <li>and I got lucky.</li>
      <li>There is a lot more new growth in areas that hadn&#x27;t seen brows in years and the brows are darker and thicker.</li>
      <li>Used this product for at least 4 months just to be able to assess it fairly.  </li>
      <li>and i am soo happy it took less than a month!</li>
      <li>However, this stuff has shown amazing results starting the first week.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t really get many new hairs.</li>
      <li>Not all products work for everyone, but I give this five stars and the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>This really isnt worth it.</li>
      <li>This stuff worked really well!</li>
      <li>After a month of daily use, however, I did see some eyebrows sprouting, mostly under my brow bones and along the outer arches.</li>
      <li>but this product has not disappointed me so far.</li>
      <li>I have recently switched to a self sharpening which is much softer :)</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t believe it was possible, but for $20 a month I may not have the full lush Brooke Shields brows of my youth, but I sure don&#x27;t have the pencil-thin tadpoles I had before that</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d read some positive reviews about BDB online, and since it was so affordable, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>a long time ago (10 or more years)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know for certain what would grow brow hairs</li>
      <li>had the results they claim, but I was very dissapointed to have perhaps 1-2 brow hairs change at all, certainly nothing like the claims made.  </li>
      <li>By two months I was definitely using less eyebrow pencil and sporting more of my own natural eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The results are not dramatic, after all it takes the hair time to grow back, but there is a huge difference in my brows.</li>
      <li>I know they&#x27;re more expensive, but I&#x27;ve had amazing results with both of those products.  </li>
      <li>and i was not trying to spend that much, so</li>
      <li>I have seen much improvement in my brows.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It really does work.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if I would have used it straight away after getting that hellish wax, it would have worked.  </li>
      <li>I used the whole tube but the brow boost did nothing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>For eyelashes though it&#x27;s a cheap enough product to make your eyelashes longer.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve probably spent money on sillier things. :)</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m really really waiting for.</li>
      <li>They have filled in enough</li>
      <li>Now i dont really need that much help with mine</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see how others can say it works....</li>
      <li>My once super long, luxurious, jealousy inspiring eye lashes had fallen out and refused to grow back.</li>
      <li>Have used other products that I love.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product through a special that Good Morning America was running on some random site and hoped it wasn&#x27;t as gimmick-y as it appeared.</li>
      <li>I have also been very careful to make sure I eat a minimum of 60gm of protein</li>
      <li>They are still coming in, in a steady pace.</li>
      <li>I wish I could post a picture to show you just how long my lashes are RIGHT NOW!</li>
      <li>After a death in the family I noticed that my brows had thinned considerably and were also much lighter.  </li>
      <li>My eyebrows pretty much look the same.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, it&#x27;s a slow process.  </li>
      <li>yup, strange I had to reorder and once again my brows do not have a bold spot anymore.</li>
      <li>Instructions say you will notice new growth in 3-4 weeks.</li>
      <li>I have used it for almost a month and there No signs of new growth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d wanted to see significant growth where I needed it most, in the inner corners of my brows, and that&#x27;s the one place I saw the least improvement using BDB, so I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy LiBrow which is more expensive, but has a better customer review rating.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s bc of new hair growth or just help shaping, but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I thought that maybe I hadn&#x27;t given it enough time the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>first one worked miracles, I am a 27 yr old girl, that lost significant brows due to overplucking in my teen years.</li>
      <li>a day, I&#x27;m a very petite female at 5&#x27;3\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>i have naturally bushy brows</li>
      <li>BDB is a complete bust.</li>
      <li>So far this seems to have made a difference.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to wait up to a month to see real results, but it definitely does work.  </li>
      <li>This product was one of many that I&#x27;ve used over the past 10 months in an attempt to get my brows back to some semblance of thickness.  </li>
      <li>Back when I was in high school</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It really does work.  It is easy to apply and virtually invisible when applied.</li>
    <li> I am guilty of over plucking my eyebrows. I have been over plucking for years. My brows got so thin, I was afraid the hair would never grow back. I have used bdb brow boost every night for less then a month and have noticed new hair growth. I am very happy to see results so quickly and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This product was bought for my daughter who over plucked her eyebrows and they were not growing back. She has been using this product every night for 3 weeks now and it seems to be working. Some of the patches which were not growing back are starting to fill in now. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these types of products, so I know when it&#x27;s working.  Unfortunately, BDB did nothing whatsoever.  If you&#x27;re serious about trying a product that really works, go for LiBrow or Metics RenewBrow (if you can still find it).  I know they&#x27;re more expensive, but I&#x27;ve had amazing results with both of those products.  BDB is a complete bust.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical, but I had my brows back after the first tube.  There were a lot of grays but I had also spent years plucking the outer edges up to the hair above my brow instead of vice versa.  I color my brows when I color my hair, but NOW there is brow hair to color.      I really didn&#x27;t believe it was possible, but for $20 a month I may not have the full lush Brooke Shields brows of my youth, but I sure don&#x27;t have the pencil-thin tadpoles I had before that were the legacy of my over-zealous teen years. This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now. I looked like a Jean Harlow wannabe after years of zealous plucking/shaping. My eyebrows were thin and weak. So far this seems to have made a difference. There is a lot more new growth in areas that hadn&#x27;t seen brows in years and the brows are darker and thicker. I&#x27;m not sure this will work for everyone, but it is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;Given the price point, there isn&#x27;t going to be much lost money wise if you try it. Note that based on other reviews here results appear to be inconsistent. I decided to chance it and I got lucky.</li>
    <li> i have naturally bushy brows but after years of plucking- they weren&#x27;t quite growing back. but since big brows are en vogue i just needed them! now i have my Brooke Shields brow and i am soo happy it took less than a month!</li>
    <li> Back when I was in high school I over tweezed my eyebrows because that was the style then.  Most of the brows grew back when I stopped but there is still an area in each brow where they are thin. I used the whole tube but the brow boost did nothing.  I was hopeful, but nothing grew back.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked really well! Within a couple of weeks I noticed that all of the missing spots in my eyebrows were filling in. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I saw other people&#x27;s reviews about this product and wanted to give it a try. I tried it for well over a month and saw absolutely no significant results than what I would see if I wasn&#x27;t using this product and allowed my eyebrows to grow out regularly. I really just want one spot in my eyebrows to grow back and for me to have spent $20 on this tiny tube and have it not work on that one spot bothered me.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this product. I noticed a difference after a month or two. I thought I&#x27;d try to continue to see if I could get more growth. Not sure if it was the product or it was that I made a concerted effort to pluck less.</li>
    <li> I bought the product because it was relatively inexpensive.  The serum has no odor and goes on the brows like a mascara wand.  I did notice some growth so it \\&quot;sort of works\\&quot;.  There are about 20 or 25 applications in the tube so if you want to try this you should buy more than one tube.  You have to put the applicator in the tube about 3 or 4 times to get enough serum for your brows.  I actually quit plucking so that is perhaps why my brows grew -- who knows??  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Stress had turned me into a walking nightmare. My severely over-plucked eyebrows weren&#x27;t growing back anymore. My once super long, luxurious, jealousy inspiring eye lashes had fallen out and refused to grow back. I didn&#x27;t feel like myself anymore and I hated it. I bought this product through a special that Good Morning America was running on some random site and hoped it wasn&#x27;t as gimmick-y as it appeared. Lo and behold, IT ACTUALLY WORKS! I noticed longer lashes in about a week and a half, and now, at almost 3 weeks, my eyebrows are nearly perfect again. I apply it in the morning before my makeup to the areas of my eyebrows that need it the most and then I apply it not only on my lashes, themselves, but also along my lash line, too. I wish I could post a picture to show you just how long my lashes are RIGHT NOW! They&#x27;re touching my brows, it&#x27;s pretty fricking awesome. I believe in this product and am happy to learn that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - It works. I love it. I&#x27;d marry it if I could.</li>
    <li> Using everyday no evidence of hair growth yet</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were randomly falling out due to having an allergic reaction to the make up i was using. I was in desperate need and came across a few other products similar to the Billion Dollar Brow Boost. Many were over 100 dollars and i was not trying to spend that much, so i decided to try this product. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and my eyebrows grew out fully! I would apply it on everyday and sometimes twice in one day. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this a few different times now. I do think it helps grow in hairs quicker and thicker vs using nothing at all. There are few products I come back to but this is one I do whenever I fall back into &amp;#34;over plucking&amp;#34;. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of tubes in 6 months or so and I gotta say the brows look better.  More hair, more groomed looking.  Before, if any little hair turned gray, got disobedient, etc., I&#x27;d just pluck, pluck away.  Now in my 40&#x27;s, nothing makes a girl look more tired than thinned out brows.  If nothing else, putting this product on everyday makes me aware of my brows, not mess with them, and after applying, eyebrow pencil goes on well over it.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product over 6 months and i started to see the results 2 weeks later. i didnt apply the product daily however it worked!!!!!i recommend the product</li>
    <li> After a death in the family I noticed that my brows had thinned considerably and were also much lighter.  In fact, I looked almost as if I had no brows.  This product was one of many that I&#x27;ve used over the past 10 months in an attempt to get my brows back to some semblance of thickness.  I actually used three tubes of this product and it did nothing for me.  The only product that has actually given some results is LiBrow Eyebrow Stimulator (see my review of LiBrow).  Billion Dollar Brows Brow Boost didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Helps my eyebrows grow back in but you have to continue using it or they go right back to being thin again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it really does work. I keep a supply at home all the time. I also only put it on at nite as it peels some.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually hard for me to review this product, since I&#x27;m of two minds about it. I bought Billion Dollar Brow Boost when the RapidLash eyelash and eyebrow serum, that had worked so well for my eyelashes, did not do the same for my eyebrows. I&#x27;d read some positive reviews about BDB online, and since it was so affordable, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I disliked the flaking I got every time I applied this product. It shows up worst where eyebrow hair is the sparsest, and all that flaking makes me feel as if my investment, as small as it is, is just peeling away, if you know what I mean. After a month of daily use, however, I did see some eyebrows sprouting, mostly under my brow bones and along the outer arches. By two months I was definitely using less eyebrow pencil and sporting more of my own natural eyebrows. A small scar I&#x27;d had since childhood actually grew back its hair, and I found this encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;But, after four months, I didn&#x27;t achieve my goal of total eyebrow regrowth and the product was beginning to run out, so I had to decide to buy another tube or move on. I&#x27;d wanted to see significant growth where I needed it most, in the inner corners of my brows, and that&#x27;s the one place I saw the least improvement using BDB, so I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy LiBrow which is more expensive, but has a better customer review rating.&lt;br /&gt;This product may work for you if your eyebrow loss is concentrated along the outer edges of your brows. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the case for me, but it may be for some people. I can&#x27;t say I saw no results from BDB because I did. They just weren&#x27;t the results I&#x27;d been hoping for. So now I&#x27;m on to the more expensive stuff and will write another review, one way or the other, as I see some results.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after just a few days of using this.  I have been very happy with how my brows have filled in</li>
    <li> This product did not live up to the advertising. It didn&#x27;t work - there has been no change in my brows whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube, and let me tell you why;&lt;br /&gt;The first one worked miracles, I am a 27 yr old girl, that lost significant brows due to overplucking in my teen years. However, this stuff has shown amazing results starting the first week. The down side and why I only rated it at 4 stars is because the minute you stop using it, it will start to show again on your brows within a week... yup, strange I had to reorder and once again my brows do not have a bold spot anymore. But it does work, apparently you have to use it continuously.</li>
    <li> I guess this works for some, but I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 6 months and have yet to see any new hair...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going into my third week using this and it really works and hoping to see more results after a bit more time! After years of plucking my eybrows very thin it came to the point when I didn&#x27;t even pluck them anymore and was desperate for my brows back.  I would say buy 2 at a time because it does run out quick.  It will make your skin around the eyebrows flake a bit so I use the brow boost at night then rub a thick moisturizer on in the morning.  Skin Store sent a heavy moisturizer as a sample with it and it counteracts all of the flaking.</li>
    <li> Instructions say you will notice new growth in 3-4 weeks. It&#x27;s been 7 weeks and nothing has changed, I might even have less brow now. I put it on every night. I&#x27;ll use it till the tube runs out but I think it&#x27;s going to be a waste of time. Not sure why I lost my brows, I had blood tests done, a complete medical and I&#x27;m in 100% perfect health according to all that. I have also been very careful to make sure I eat a minimum of 60gm of protein a day, I&#x27;m a very petite female at 5&#x27;3\\&quot;. So... I will also try LiBrow Eyebrow Stimulator as the other person to leave a negative on this said that product worked for her.</li>
    <li> this product is a waste of money.  i wanted to find an inexpensive replacement for nulash (which actually works) but this isnt it.  garbage.</li>
    <li> I ordered Billion Dollar Brows a few weeks ago, and have used it religiously.  I noticed a few random hairs falling out, but figured it was just stimulating the growth cycle and that this was normal.  Tonight while swiping BDB on, I looked closely only to notice I&#x27;m developing a bald patch in my brows.  I am SO disappointed by this product.  I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, and I certainly didn&#x27;t read any kind of warning on the packaging. Do NOT order this product, it&#x27;s not worth the risk.  I had good brows before, I just wanted them thicker for a new style.  This will teach me to be vain! :(</li>
    <li> I used this product following directions to a  \\&quot;T\\&quot; ...found it did not work as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Amazon,s delivery was perfect, the product was way less than that.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  I thought that maybe I hadn&#x27;t given it enough time the first time I used it.  It just doesn&#x27;t work!  I&#x27;ve been faithfully applying it every night for a month....nothing!!! I really don&#x27;t see how others can say it works....</li>
    <li> I had a patch in one eyebrow that hasn&#x27;t filled in in months and months so I gave this product a shot and it has beyond exceeded expectations! Very satisfied and would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working...     This is the 2 time I&#x27;ve given BDB Brow Boost a try but this time I have actually been committed to using it every single night. (whereas before I did it for a few days then forgot about it).  It&#x27;s been about 4 weeks since I started using it and I&#x27;ve only missed 3 days. The product says it takes about 4-6 weeks to see results. My existing eyebrows seem fuller and I&#x27;ve been diligently brushing the brow hairs with an old toothbrush, but I&#x27;m not noticing any new growth in the areas where I over-plucked in the past and where hair has refused to grow back.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m really really waiting for. I&#x27;m about to buy another container of it b/c mine will be empty soon, and I&#x27;m hopeful that there will be some results in just a few more weeks. (my eyebrow hair is VERY thick, corse, black hair.. so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why the roots are so stubborn).      We&#x27;ll see, and I&#x27;ll give an update if anything changes. Give it a try- everyone&#x27;s hair is different and this is one of the cheapest eyebrow growth helpers out there. Nothin to lose. You&#x27;ve probably spent money on sillier things. :)</li>
    <li> a long time ago (10 or more years), I got my eyebrows waxed and they never grew back!  Unfortunately, she didn&#x27;t do the shape I wanted, she gave me a very thin, rainbow shaped line that looks like I drew it on with a pen.  YUK!  So I tried this product to re-grow my brows.  But it didn&#x27;t work (probably because the follicles died long ago).  Maybe if I would have used it straight away after getting that hellish wax, it would have worked.  I even tried Latisse after this and that didn&#x27;t even work on my brows (but it did grow my lashes beautifully).  So I would recommend you try it if it hasn&#x27;t been too long since a wax, but not if you waited too long like me.</li>
    <li> Used this product for at least 4 months just to be able to assess it fairly.  Was able to get it at a discounted cost which helped.  Billio Dollar Brows is well advertised but I found little to no change in my brows despite consistent and correct use.  I don&#x27;t know how the people photographed on the BBB site had the results they claim, but I was very dissapointed to have perhaps 1-2 brow hairs change at all, certainly nothing like the claims made.  I don&#x27;t know for certain what would grow brow hairs and I&#x27;d like to see scientific research to substantiate claims before I spend another dime on this or similar products.</li>
    <li> I used Ardells gel for a year trying to grow my eyebrows back with little success, finally I decided to buck up and try something new. I began using this gel and suddenly I was growing hair back in bald spots that hadn&#x27;t grown in years from over plucking. I really didn&#x27;t think it worked, but after about a month I truly saw the difference, I FINALLY, after two years of wishing I had never been introduced to tweezers, I finally have my natural brows back!</li>
    <li> A few months ago I used a eyebrow pencil  that was very hard to put on (color wouldn&#x27;t stay on) so I stopped trying to fill my brows when I wiped it up and looked at my face the pencil ripped all my brow hair out!! I have recently switched to a self sharpening which is much softer :) I use this brow boost every night and my brows are growing so well! Thank you !</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and the results are subtle and gradual but every week after the second I do notice that my eyebrows are actually getting a shape and filling in more. When I went to tint my eyebrows like I do every month, they did look fuller. My brows are thin still but they actually have almost a perfect shape and now just need more filling in but this product has not disappointed me so far. I would recommend buying this one over Ardell growth accelarator. That stuff made the hairs that were already there get longer but I didn&#x27;t really get many new hairs. For eyelashes though it&#x27;s a cheap enough product to make your eyelashes longer. But for this Billion Dollar Brows gel, I strictly use that on my eyebrows since it&#x27;s working and I use the remainder of the Ardell on my lashes (the Ardell lasts longer as well UNFORTUNATELY lol.) But yes, buy BillIion Dollar Brows and hopefully after a month or 2 your brows will be getting back to where they should be or at least be fuller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m willing to give most things a try. Sometimes I do at the risk of saving myself a few dollars for what I convince myself is a miracle cure. This, however, was not. Back to the drawing board (and drawing in my eyebrows).</li>
    <li> Noticed no difference after 8 weeks</li>
    <li> This helps somewhat with growing my eye brows in, but it seems like it is taking forever. I&#x27;m still hopeful!</li>
    <li> I am on my 4th tube or so, this stuff does work to re-grow over plucked eyebrows over time. I have seen much improvement in my brows.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK AND IT WAS GOOEY. IT HAD A SMEL TO IT ALSO.</li>
    <li> Wish I could upload photo- I went ahead and got this brow boost gel and I&#x27;ve felt better about my brows. Not sure if it&#x27;s bc of new hair growth or just help shaping, but I&#x27;m satisfied. I got their brow powder to enhance them further in the lightest blonde color. It&#x27;s very natural looking. I&#x27;m very happy with my brows! They&#x27;re looking fuller and more shapely. Quite pleased.</li>
    <li> After trying several other brow growth products without success, I gave Brow Boost a try.  I haven&#x27;t tried the products that cost upwards of $150 though to be fair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brow Boost actually has grown hair back in my brows that has been missing for well over 10 years.  I had given up and resigned to the fact that I would forever have to draw on my brows before leaving the house.  I just bought my second tube of this because I&#x27;ve seen such an improvement and now have hope that one day I will actually have brows!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2-3 weeks now.  I try to apply it twice a day but sometimes I forget.  My eyebrows are more filled in.  Before use the ends of my eyebrows had stopped coming in from over plucking and threading. My one eyebrow now has the end and the other one is coming in.  I am really happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it.  Have used other products that I love.  I read good results but I didn&#x27;t find them to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 other expensive eyebrow boosters &amp; have to say this 3rd one has to be the least bit of all of them to work if it does. Now i know it says wait a month to see growth and its been a month..i&#x27;ve been through 4 tubes used ( not every) nightly &amp; honestly havent seen growth. My eyebrows pretty much look the same. Now i dont really need that much help with mine so maybe thats why but still i would say save your money and pick another one. This really isnt worth it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me! I have used it for almost a month and there No signs of new growth.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to grow my eyebrows out since October 2011. I have had little success. I have tried ardell as well as castor oil. The ardell did not really work, a little growth happened but not much. The Castor oil but made me break out, and it gave me the same amount of growth as the ardell growth. I have been using BDB brow boost since June 8 2012 I have seen alot of growth. They are still coming in, in a steady pace. I am guessing by August/September I will have the brows I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> I had very thin brows from years of overplucking. I had them tatooed and was happy with the result but I still wanted to see some actual hair, not just the tatoo ink so I tried this product.After daily use for about 3 weeks I had eyebrow hair. Thin at the outside corners but so full at the thicked part, I actually have to trim them once a week. Not all products work for everyone, but I give this five stars and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying, which weren&#x27;t so good-got my hopes up and gave it a try anyway-i even purchased 2 !&lt;br /&gt;No difference to my brows after 3 weeks...I am going to keep using the product until it is gone.maybe something will happen with more time.If you are looking for quick results-this isn&#x27;t going to work..</li>
    <li> Billion $ Brow was such a waste of money.  Supposedly got it cheaper from GMA, what a joke.  I lost brows.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Reordered it just recently.</li>
    <li> I used Ardell for over a month, barley any results.  The only reason I saw hair growing in is because I quit plucking while using Ardell.  With BDB, I did see hair growth in areas of my brow that had stopped growing hair.  I&#x27;ll be honest, it&#x27;s a slow process.  Be prepared to wait up to a month to see real results, but it definitely does work.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s not prescription strength, which I have also started using recently for faster and more dramatic results.  If you want something you don&#x27;t need a prescription for that will actually work, give this a try, but again, remember to be patient. Hair doesn&#x27;t grow overnight.</li>
    <li> did not do anything for me</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and have seen results. The results are not dramatic, after all it takes the hair time to grow back, but there is a huge difference in my brows. They have filled in enough I am not filling them every day like I was before and they are continuing to get better with use.</li>
