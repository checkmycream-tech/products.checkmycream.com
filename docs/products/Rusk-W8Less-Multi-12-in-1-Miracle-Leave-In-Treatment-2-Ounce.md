### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best leave in conditioner ever.</li>
      <li>I have to say I am so, so impressed.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great for frizzy flay away hairs.</li>
      <li>Great product that was recommended by my stylist.  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, great product!</li>
      <li>I love the body this produce gives me.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>she liked it very much</li>
      <li>It is smooth, shiny, and bouncy again.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying life as a woman of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34;, but of course the hair challenges can be a pain.</li>
      <li>True to part of its name.</li>
      <li>But overall good product.</li>
      <li>Not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>Rusk always wins.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser tried out a sample of the 12 in 1 Miracle Treatment at one of my haircuts, and voila&#x27;, it managed to give the old curls considerably more life than they&#x27;d shown in a while.</li>
      <li>This stuff really is a miracle treatment!  </li>
      <li>The best part is that it will last a long time because you only need to use a couple of sprays.  </li>
      <li>After having rough straw hair for several months, my hair already feels like real healthy hair again.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it!!  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel that it did much for my hair but kept using it anyways since it was in my cabinet.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and just we wanted</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>In particular, my shoulder-length naturally &amp;#34;surly&amp;#34; hair is now thinner, more fragile and flyaway than in my youth.</li>
      <li>This spray leaves my hair extremely soft and &amp;#34;calms&amp;#34; the dead ends and fly aways – I barely have to use the flat iron now.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair feel soft and manageable.</li>

<li> It is difficult to find something to encourage it in the right direction that provides moisture and body, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
<li> I went to the store the other day in search of hair treatments and noticed this.</li>
<li> I had been using a tresemme product before as I just started heat styling and hadn&#x27;t tried any other heat protectant products before.</li>

<li> I am very rough on my hair (bleaching/dying and heat styling) and I am ok with my hair being a little worse for wear, but lately the state of my strands was seriously concerning me.</li>
<li> Also strengths the hair you immediately see less breakage.</li>
<li> I spray a small amount into my palms, rub it over my fingers, and rake it through my hair.</li>
<li> My hair was badly damaged and this product brought it back to life</li>

    <li> Not a fan.  Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I am very rough on my hair (bleaching/dying and heat styling) and I am ok with my hair being a little worse for wear, but lately the state of my strands was seriously concerning me. I had been using a tresemme product before as I just started heat styling and hadn&#x27;t tried any other heat protectant products before. I didn&#x27;t really feel that it did much for my hair but kept using it anyways since it was in my cabinet. I went to the store the other day in search of hair treatments and noticed this. I have tried one other rusk product before that I like so I picked it up. I have only used this once, but after showering and towel drying my hair I sprayed this in, let my hair dry and heat styled as usual. I have to say I am so, so impressed. After having rough straw hair for several months, my hair already feels like real healthy hair again. It is smooth, shiny, and bouncy again. I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> Great product that was recommended by my stylist.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and I can&#x27;t live without it!!  The best part is that it will last a long time because you only need to use a couple of sprays.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> True to part of its name. Your hair does feel weightless but not all 12. But overall good product. Not bad at all. Rusk always wins.</li>

    <li> I am enjoying life as a woman of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34;, but of course the hair challenges can be a pain. In particular, my shoulder-length naturally &amp;#34;surly&amp;#34; hair is now thinner, more fragile and flyaway than in my youth. It is difficult to find something to encourage it in the right direction that provides moisture and body, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. My hairdresser tried out a sample of the 12 in 1 Miracle Treatment at one of my haircuts, and voila&#x27;, it managed to give the old curls considerably more life than they&#x27;d shown in a while. I immediately ordered it from Amazon, and have been using it almost daily for over 2 months. I apply it to towel-dried hair (or dampen on non-wash days with a spray bottle). I spray a small amount into my palms, rub it over my fingers, and rake it through my hair. I then scrunch some extra on my crown to give it some lift. I use a hair rake to finish the style. It seems to hold well in humidity, although I also use a smoothing oil occasionally to keep down the frizz on a breezy day. It also works well with a leave-in conditioner applied to the ends.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on times, Product is as described. Great for frizzy flay away hairs.</li>
    <li> she liked it very much</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and just we wanted</li>
    <li> Saved my after- pregnancy hair!</li>
    <li> this product is a miracle.....it works. My hair was badly damaged and this product brought it back to life</li>
    <li> I love the body this produce gives me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Life changer! How did I not know about this already?!</li>
