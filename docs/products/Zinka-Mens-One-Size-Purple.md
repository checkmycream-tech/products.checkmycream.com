      <li>Looks nice as well as protects.</li>
      <li>I have to keep it in a baggie to be able to use it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to buy 5 more tubes for when I head home.</li>
      <li>I primarily use on my nose, ears and neck</li>
      <li>Colored Zinka makes for great pictures and memories at all your different vacations.  </li>
      <li>Totally blocks out the and smells good as well.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and arrived promptly however it is just over half an ounce of product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thanks so much....!!</li>
      <li>great product to take you with to beach when go for a surf it doesnt run when you get in the water like other leading brands its even good for when i go skateboarding or on a bike ride or play football or soccer.or rugby even lacross or for just relaxing at the beach.or at home by the pool or for gardening or for construction or for working on the roof or camping hiking or just taking a ride in the convertible or on the high seas on a sailboat  or for a simple trip to florida even jeff spicoli approves  </li>
      <li>I have used this product ever since I was a little kid and have always had great success.  </li>

      <li>it was fun and protected my kids</li>

      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Works very well but don&#x27;t rub it in much</li>
      <li>This company is the original Zink Oxide and definitely knows what they are doing.</li>
      <li>far as value goes, &amp; bucks for .6 oz is pretty pricey.</li>
      <li>The pink, blue and green are much more fun when you&#x27;re kind of old as I am</li>
      <li>Luckily Amazon provides access to things I can&#x27;t always find at my local pharmacy/grocery.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that through all these years this company has stayed true to putting out a quality product while other sunscreens seem to have watered theirs down to save money.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I automatically put on the clear Zink every morning.  </li>
      <li>so maybe you can save a young woman from drowning.</li>
      <li>I heard that there are some new sunscreen regulations coming out that will have to upgrade the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands due to the lack of Zinc Oxide in them.  </li>

<li> Extremely small  size.....</li>
<li> This stuff works, but is hard to get off and a bit pricier than it needs to be.</li>
<li> Too bad all the local stores don&#x27;t see the value of keeping it stocked.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This sunscreen is awesome!  I have been an avid surfer, snowboarder and all around outdoorsman for decades now.  I have used this product ever since I was a little kid and have always had great success.  The colors are always fun to play around with.  Colored Zinka makes for great pictures and memories at all your different vacations.  Sports events (with team colors), Lake trips, surf trips, it&#x27;s endless.  I love the fact that through all these years this company has stayed true to putting out a quality product while other sunscreens seem to have watered theirs down to save money.  I heard that there are some new sunscreen regulations coming out that will have to upgrade the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands due to the lack of Zinc Oxide in them.  This company is the original Zink Oxide and definitely knows what they are doing.</li>
    <li> This zink has color, it&#x27;s not clear, so looks \\&quot;cool\\&quot;.  It does what it was intended to do, keep you from burning if you&#x27;re on the beach all day. Put it on your nose to keep it from getting fried.  Too bad all the local stores don&#x27;t see the value of keeping it stocked.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have had surgery on my nose for solar cells.  I use this if I am going to be out for a long time -- like yard work as I can see that my nose is covered.  Otherwise, I automatically put on the clear Zink every morning.  Both are great products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be the size of Chapstick</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but is hard to get off and a bit pricier than it needs to be.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells awesome! This small tube goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Extremely small  size.....like a sample size.</li>
    <li> Great for the nose and lips. I don&#x27;t believe in sunscreen and all the chemicals and believe they can cause skin cancer. All I use is this on my nose and lips.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes to use different color of Zinka and she likes wearing during her water polo games and swimming.</li>
    <li> Since we purchased this as a prop for a video shoot, I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the product, but the package arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Had I paid attention to the volume 0.6 ounce, I would have not purchased it.  Used it for my nose during my bike rides, only to discovered that it&#x27;s gone (washed off by sweat), thus not really worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Totally blocks out the and smells good as well. I primarily use on my nose, ears and neck</li>
    <li> Works well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great product, but the tube arrived with a hole in the bottom seal so the cream squeezes out the bottom and damages clothing that it comes in contact with.  I have to keep it in a baggie to be able to use it.  Not acceptable.</li>
    <li> great product to take you with to beach when go for a surf it doesnt run when you get in the water like other leading brands its even good for when i go skateboarding or on a bike ride or play football or soccer.or rugby even lacross or for just relaxing at the beach.or at home by the pool or for gardening or for construction or for working on the roof or camping hiking or just taking a ride in the convertible or on the high seas on a sailboat  or for a simple trip to florida even jeff spicoli approves  [[ASIN:B002MVAZWS Zinka Colored Sunblock Zinc Nosecoat Bundle (Set of 2) - White]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in San Diego on a family beach trip and found a tube of this at a local surf shop. Haven&#x27;t used this since I was a kid, and it&#x27;s a dream. Keeps my nose protected and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it all day. I&#x27;m going to buy 5 more tubes for when I head home. This will be great for Lake Powell, lounging by the pool, summer hikes. Luckily Amazon provides access to things I can&#x27;t always find at my local pharmacy/grocery.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face for total protection from the sun. I bought a face bronzing cream that I add to the white zinka to make it a flesh tone color. Looks nice as well as protects. It helps prevent wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get the white. The pink, blue and green are much more fun when you&#x27;re kind of old as I am and you put them on like war paint and your grandchild goes running away in terror. Works very well but don&#x27;t rub it in much so you look like a life guard so maybe you can save a young woman from drowning.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and arrived promptly however it is just over half an ounce of product. That&#x27;s on me. The pic in the description is larger than the actual tube on a standard size monitor. Just FYI&lt;br /&gt;As far as value goes, &amp; bucks for .6 oz is pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good protection, makes my skin smooth and smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this product for protecting my nose from the sun, but I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and the coconut fragrance really bothers me.  I hope that one day Zinka produces an unscented version.</li>
    <li> A little expensive compared to the inexpensive  tube of zine oxide you used to be able to buy in any drug store.</li>
    <li> it was fun and protected my kids</li>
    <li> Happy to have found this product once again...I use to be a life guard about 48 years ago....and used similar product.  Now I am retired and enjoy sunning in my complex pool and after a little while I can apply ZINKA on my nose and be protected for the duration of my pool time which is usually atleast 2-3 hrs everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Soon I hope to try a couple of the colors out......Even at my age it can be fun to be &amp;#34;COOL&amp;#34; at the pool......&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much....!!</li>
    <li> Being fair-skinned, on meds that increase sun-sensitivity, and having a basal cell cx removed from my nose,  I needed something that would protect my face from the sun. This product works so well that my nose cheeks don&#x27;t sting or turn red when I&#x27;m out in the sun.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Stopped the frying of my nose.</li>
