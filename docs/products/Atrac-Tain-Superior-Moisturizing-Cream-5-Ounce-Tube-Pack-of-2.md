    <li> Works well but made my foot itch.</li>
    <li> Healed my cracked heals when nothing else worked.</li>
    <li> Relative in Canada let us use this for rough elbows and it really works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent !  Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Best cream for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried all other &amp;#34;extremely dry&amp;#34; creams and this one actually WORKS!! Oncologist recommended after two bouts of cellulitis because of cracked heels. I usually hate putting cream on my feet because its so slimy and messy. This one actually dries into your feet or wherever you put it on. No smell either. I put socks on after just for extra moisturizing. I would highly recommend it, as does my doctor!</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever found for my super dry skin. I discovered this when my daughter who is a nurse brought it home from her hospital unit to try. She said this is what the hospital uses and I can see why.</li>
    <li> Really helps with dry cracked heels</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I&#x27;ve ordered multiple times. It is the only thing that heals my dry cracked heels. I use a foot file then slather my heels with cream and cover with cotton socks. Tip: I hate sleeping in socks. They make my feet hot. I cut the toe ends off so they&#x27;re like toe-less socks. My heels are covered so I can moisturize while I sleep, but my feet aren&#x27;t hot. Buy this cream. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help with the cracks and splits I get on my fingers the very second the weather turns cold.  I also needed help with the extremely dry skin on my heels. As for the finger splits, at this point in my life, I am convinced that nothing can prevent those!  (The only thing you can do is, once they open up, put a dab of Neosporin and cover with a bandaid and wait for them to heal. Using this trick,  I get relief in a day but they do come back over and over. Sigh!)  However, this product came closest to lessening the frequency and severity of the splits then any other product I have tried. It is not a &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; hand cream that you can buy in any store. It contains urea and alpha hydroxy which really makes the difference in hydrating &amp; softening the skin. I use this on my hands and feet in the morning and at night and do see a BIG difference in my skin. While the finger splits are not gone, they are not as bad.  However, my heels have never been smoother and less dry.  If you have issues with heel cracks then this is DEFINITELY the product for you.</li>
    <li> worked great.. No more dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> Never mind the creams/ointments you read about or see advertised; they don&#x27;t work.  Atrac-Tain absolutely works!! I have been using it for 5 years and my heals, and cuticles, are in great shape.  Best part no scraping, grating or cutting  Simply rub it in.  I use an old pair of white socks to wear so the cream doesn&#x27;t rub off on carpet, etc.</li>
    <li> Best foot cream I have ever found!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute BEST cream for very dry cracked skin</li>
    <li> Heavy Duty Moisturizer and exfoliatent for people with skin problems</li>
    <li> Put on my heal calluses.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dish-pan hands each winter......dry, cracked and tight.  This product is almost like a glove of protection.  Even a painful crack receives relief after a few minutes of application.  I smooth it on at bedtime.  Hands feel great in the morning.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just what I ordered.</li>
