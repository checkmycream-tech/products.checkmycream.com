    <li> Love! Love! this frame thinking about getting another pair. It&#x27;s exactly as the pic if not better. I had my prescription put in and work out perfectly. I highly recommend this frame. It&#x27;s light without being flimsy. Attractive looking. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Very cat eye and OVERSIZED. Check the pictures because the one of the mannequin head shows that they are oversized. Anyway, not for the small faced. The glass has somewhat of a haze over it and I&#x27;m not too fond of that but can&#x27;t go wrong with a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Nice item for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my glasses and have gotten many compliments. I plan ordering another pair for my girlfriend because she can&#x27;t keep her hands off mine</li>
