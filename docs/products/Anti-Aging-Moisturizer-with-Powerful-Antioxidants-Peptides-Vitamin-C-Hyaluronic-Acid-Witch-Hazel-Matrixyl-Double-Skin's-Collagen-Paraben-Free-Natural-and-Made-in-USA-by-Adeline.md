<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used it for a month now, I have notice some results by smoothing out my lines around, however it saids it for all skin types. I have combination skin, it moisturized my dry spots, but it was too oily for my t-zone area.</li>
    <li> Skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Okay, So I used this on my moms face because she has really bad dry skin, so I put this on her face and bam! her face was really cleared! I was completely taken back about the packaging! It looks as if it could something created by a freaking master mind! It is brilliant.</li>
    <li> I didnt see any difference in my skin from what I was using before.  It smelled good and felt good but did not change the look or feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. It has a nice scent to it, doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily and is perfect to apply prior to putting my make-up on in the morning and again prior to going to bed for the night. If you are in need of an anti-aging moisturizer, definitely give Adeline a try! I received the product to review via Tomoson.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer! It is wonderful for all skin types and all ages! Even though I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, crows feet or any of that at age 18, I have dramatically seen the disappearance of scars! It was actually quite amazed since it was unexpected. I also really enjoy how quick this product absorbed into the skin, after rubbing it into my skin, it instantly disappeared after 10-15 seconds. It does not leave a greasy feeling at all! I really dislike it when lotions or moisturizers leave a greasy film on the skin and don&#x27;t completely &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; in. That is probably my favorite part of this moisturizer, it&#x27;s lightweight but at the same time definitely moisturizing! P.S. check out my blog for a coupon code ;) Link is in my profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
    <li> Not to shabby! It feels very nice on your skin</li>
    <li> I received this moisturizer to try out.  This cream comes in a pump style container which I like.  The pump lets you control how much you are using.  The color is white and it has a mild smell. Once applied to the face it makes your face feel a little \\&quot;minty.\\&quot; LOL that&#x27;s the best word I can use to describe it.  It only last a minute but you can feel a difference.  I feel my fine lines look less noticeable.  I would say the consistency would be equivalent to most day time moisturizers.  I have extremely dry skin. I would definitely use this spring, summer, and fall. Right now my skin has been fine with this because I am using a super heavy night cream for moisturizer. So far so good! For my full review, or other product reviews, check out my blog at SurveysByStephanie.tumblr.com!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed trying out the Anti Aging Moisturizer from Adeline. As you are putting it on your face you will smell a light peppermint smell. Perfect around the holidays or any time for that matter. It isn’t so strong that it will knock you down or that you will smell of peppermint all day though. I felt that it left my skin feeling soft and I love that it helps to fight wrinkles. I am at the age where I have to start using creams like these to try to stay looking young for as long as I can. I also love that this product is free of parabens and artificial ingredients. I really try to stay away from putting products overloaded with chemicals on my skin. The only thing I really use that has bad stuff in it is Almay and I am really trying to find an affordable replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> use it and you will notice the difference immediately!</li>
    <li> This cream is just great does not make you break out and relieves dryness on the skin it makes your skin on the face fill so smooth and also shrinks your pores I have been using this for several weeks now and my pores are so much smaller with continued use I know they will be gone just love this stuff!!!!! finally found a product that really works and I am 58 yr old lady that really had some terrible looking skin but now is really looking so much better I even am getting compliments on my skin how great it looks my friend and family want to know what I am using and I tell them. I use all of Adeline products and I have to say THAK YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE PRODUCTS THEY REALLY WORK!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Used this for 2 months no difference, does not go on smooth</li>
    <li> I recently had the pleasure of testing this product for free and I&#x27;m so glad I did because I love it ! It is the perfect moisturizer for the day time. It is very light weight, but it makes my skin feel very hydrated and smooth. I love how fast it absorbs in my skin and it is perfect under my makeup. It fills in the fine lines around my mouth and prevents my makeup from settling in those lines, which is a life saver for me! One of my favorite things about this moisturizer for me, is that it didn&#x27;t break me out! I have very acne prone skin, that is easily clogged and I had no bad reactions. I definitely will purchase this moisturizer in the future, it is everything I want in a moisturizer and more !</li>
    <li> I really like this anti-aging moisturizer. The bottle is lovely (superficial, I know, but I appreciate a well-made product and packaging is part of the product!). The moisturizer itself is lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pretty peppermint fragrance. I have sensitive skin but the peppermint oil isn&#x27;t harsh or irritating at all, in fact, I rearlly like it because it feels cool and refreshing on my skin. One pump is all I need to cover my face and neck, so the bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs and spreads well, and leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include: Deionized Water, Witch Hazel Extracct, Glycerol Sterate, PEG-100 Sterate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Shea Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, PEG-8, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12, Phenoxyethanol, Captylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate VP Copolymer, Ceterayl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivae, PPG-12 SMDI/Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Xanthum Gum, Peppermint Oil, Green Tea Extract, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen, so I do use a lightweight sunscreen as well. I did receive a free product, but all opinions are my own and honest.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference using this product.  It leaves my skin tight, which I assume it&#x27;s supposed to do.  But I was disappointed that the directions state to use your usual moisturizer after applying this &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; cream.  That ends up being 3 creams to apply (with the serum).  Too much work.</li>
    <li> This is a behind fabulous and effective Face Cream!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of using this product, I have noticed amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped reduce the appearance of my fine lines and it has evened out my skin tone. My face feels smooth, it looks youthful and much more vibrant. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. It is quickly absorbed in your skin once you apply it. I am so impressed with the results and will continue using it. I highly recommend this product. </li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry, I&#x27;ll just get right to the point here... I absolutey love this face cream!! It&#x27;s true, I do. Although I am still a bit young to be worried about wrinkles, I am already noticing the start of a some. Considering I have quite a few unhealthy habits that have been proven to speed up the aging process with your skin and I stress a lot, I want to be ahead of the game when it comes to this, I want to prevent wrinkles and instead of trying to fight them later on, and of course like any woman, I want to look young and beautiful forever, and I have a good feeling this product is a great place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this product is the moisturizing quality. I have extremely dry skin, dryer than dry, and in this cold winter weather it gets even worse, especially my face. Dry, Itchy, Flakey, all of it. And it&#x27;s horrible. This cream though, is probably the best moisturizer I have tried yet. When I first applied it, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. It was almost like it didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin and was just layered on top of my face. Shortly afterwards it was completely absorbed though and after using it regularly it wasn&#x27;t like that anymore. I think it was because my face was so dry to start with. When I first got this moisturizer, I actually used it for two days and then completely forgot about it. Four days later I was looking into the mirror and realized how nice my skin looked and that&#x27;s when I remembered. But I just couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin felt from only using it for two days and then going for four days without any. Even my husband made a comment about my &amp;#34;glowing skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using Adeline for a little over a month, my face is much more moisturized in general even when not using the product, no more itching or flaking, and it is also more smooth and clear, my complexion seems to get better every day. Needless to say, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend this product to a friend, (and already have several times!) So if you are on the fence, don&#x27;t be. Yes, the price is a little high compared to a few others you can get at local retails stores, but it&#x27;s actually a decent price when compared to the high end face cream, and it&#x27;s worth it. I would love to see the price get dropped some, but I just remind myself how important it is to take care of my skin, especially my face. Besides, everyone deserves to splurge a little and treat themselves to good quality products that you will use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A little goes a long way... Just a little tip, it doesn&#x27;t take very much, you only need a very small dab of this cream on your entire face. This bottle will likely last me a good while, which also adds to it&#x27;s worth for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to come back and update with more after I see the effects of long term usage with this moisturizer but so far it&#x27;s been wonderful.friend, (and already have several times!)

This bottle will likely last me a good while, which also adds to it&#x27;s worth for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to come back and update with more after I see the effects of long term usage with this moisturizer but so far it&#x27;s been wonderful.</li>
    <li> The Anti Aging Moisturizing Cream from Adeline Skin Care is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. The perfect formula comes in a sleek, stainless steel-appearance bottle that features a smooth pump to give you the perfect amount for a full face. The light scent of mint gives the skin a cooling effect, and serves a partial session of aroma therapy. The Anti Aging Moisturizing Cream from Adeline Skin Care is a definite must.</li>
    <li> I would like to start by saying that I got this product to review but everything I tell you is my option. This product works well with the other products in the line not alone. The packaging is amazing and I like to look at it. I got this product for my aunt and she&#x27;s 63 years old and needs something to stop or slow down the aging. She told me that the product is easy to use and that it smells clean to her. The product makes your skin feel clean and fresh. The product last a long time and never changes in smell. The listing says perfect proportions to hydrate, lift, tone, and oxygenate your skin. We&#x27;ve created the ideal blend of Vitamin C, peptides, potassium, a unique O2 complex, and other ingredients to give you a radiance that will turn heads! The following is true and it&#x27;s amazing having people look at your skin because it looking great and you look younger. The product absorbed  really fast in seconds it feels like. The color of foundation that I have been using on my aunt has changed I put on the color I normally do and she looked bad to sun spots are going away. This product is the only one that is white in the product line which is nice because you know which one it is without reading. When using the Adeline products there was nothing else that was being used. The product doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily or dry. The smell of the product is amazing as well. The more you use the product the better your skin will look and the happier my aunt is with her looks. The product doesn&#x27;t make her feel oily which is great in a product. She used this for a week and her skin looks brighter and softer over all. I can&#x27;t believe how amazing the product&#x27;s in the line really are. I&#x27;m a believer in anti-aging products now I look forward to went I need to start using them I will looking for Adeline once again.</li>
    <li> I have recently fallen in love...with a skin care line!  It&#x27;s called Adeline Skin Care.  It is a small, family run business focused on producing great skin care products without a lot of nasty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: Adeline Skin Care sent me this amazing product to try at no cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Skin Care&#x27;s Anti-Aging Moisturizer contains Matrixyl, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C &amp; Vitamin E .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 1.7 oz pump bottle and retails for $37.50.  Like with the Serum, that may seem like a lot of moolah, but believe me, a little of this stuff goes a long way!  (further reason for me to believe in these products!!)  For me, it takes one good pump to cover my entire face-neck area, especially if I&#x27;m using it after the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Use It&lt;br /&gt;Use this moisturizer just as you would any other facial moisturizer (i.e. after toners, serums, eye treatments, etc.).  Remember to apply it in an upward, circular motion from the neck up to discourage skin sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I Thought About It&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that struck me was the scent.  While peppermint oil isn&#x27;t one of the &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; ingredients, it is definitely noticeable.  I have fairly sensitive skin and the only time the peppermint oil content has bothered me was when I had used a facial scrub before using the moisturizer.  With my normal cleansers and after the hyaluronic acid serum, I have had no further problems.  I have opted to only use this moisturizer in the morning also, because the times I used it in the evening, I was a little too &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; to fall asleep easily.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to do a really great job of moisturizing and tightening my skin.  I  My face seems hydrated for fairly long stretches.  I have even been able to start going makeup free because of the confidence I have gained through using Adeline products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has completely replaced my normal day-time moisturizer.  Like I said, I don&#x27;t prefer to use it at night because the peppermint scent is fairly invigorating.d, I don&#x27;t prefer to use it at night because the peppermint scent is fairly invigorating.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend.  I haven&#x27;t seen anything in the  Reduce Dark Circles and Puffiness Under Eyes.</li>
    <li> Top-shelf quality ingredients and really amazing results after using for only one week! I&#x27;m very impressed with this anti aging moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many beauty products I&#x27;ve tried in the past year - I&#x27;ve used tons of serums, oils, moisturizers and creams - but sadly only a handful of them proved to be worth the money. The majority of the products turn out to be very disappointing and ineffective. The Adeline moisturizer is a true gem among skin care products, though. I love everything about it - its consistency, the peppermint-y, natural fragrance, its silky smooth texture, the way it makes my skin feel and look.. it&#x27;s all truly amazing. This product is now part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s now and my skin used to be really nice and smooth until I had my baby daughter in February of 2014. Since then all the sleepless nights and exhaustion have been taking a huge toll on my body and health. I&#x27;ve noticed dark circles under my eyes and more and more wrinkles every day. I made it my mission to not only improve my appearance, but also work on the health of my skin. I&#x27;ve been trying to come up with a set skin-care routine that would rejuvenate and nourish my skin, but it really hasn&#x27;t been easy to find the right products. I am still far from being completely satisfied with my daily routine and I&#x27;m still experimenting, trying to find good quality, natural and healthy products that I can actually afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the Adelaine moisturizer is one product I can honestly get behind. It feels very luxurious on my skin, it goes on silky smooth and absorbs very fast. You can really feel the moisture lock in your skin. It improves the elasticity of your skin and the overall appearance of it. I can apply a liberal amount of it to my under-eye areas and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin there, nor cause any breakouts. It gently tightens your skin, without the dry and uncomfortable feeling some other anti-aging products cause. It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily and it smells very refreshing, thanks to the peppermint oil (I just love this smell!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s made with top-quality ingredients, such as shea butter, witch hazel extract and green tea extract. The formula seems to be working just great for me, and I have noticed some improvement in my skin tone and some smoothing out of the wrinkles around my eyes. It&#x27;s a powerful but very gentle, non-irritating moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for evaluations purposes. All thoughts and opinions are my own. I highly recommend this product!se.

    <li> *Disclaimer* I was sent this product for free for review purposes. ALL opinions and thoughts are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I’m rather young, so I honestly don’t have much use right now for reversing aging and restoring a youthful appearance. However, it’s never too early to take care of your skin to help delay the onset of the inevitable. I do have very dry skin and this past winter really took a toll on my face. I was excited to try this out solely as a moisturizer to see if it would help with my extreme dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using the moisturizer for 3 weeks now and boy am I happy with this product. My skins feels so much better after using this! My skin is so soft and smooth and most importantly it’s not peeling anymore! The moisturizer itself is not thin or thick, it’s definitely a medium consistency. As with most moisturizers your skin feels a little sticky after your first apply it but after a few minutes it will have completely sunken into your skin leaving a soft, smooth canvas!&lt;br /&gt;One nice surprise about this moisturizer is it’s peppermint scent. It’s so invigorating and energizing. It makes this the perfect morning moisturizer! There are so many amazing ingredients in this moisturizer. It’s full of Matrixyl, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E, Shea Butter, Green Tea Extract as well as 3 different peptides!&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t tried to use this on any other part of my body other than my face, but Adeline says you can use it on your hands, neck or really anywhere you’d like, except for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with this product. I highly recommend this to anyone who had dry skin. Just given how well this helped my dry skin, I’m sure the anti-aging benefits are real.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer. I have never experienced a moisturizer quite like this one. It is a light weight cream that blends in smoothly. The scent and the feeling it gives my skin immediately after it has been applied to my face is my favorite part of the product. It is extremely cooling on the face and just feels amazing. The minty smell comes from one of the ingredients, peppermint oil. I am a huge fan of peppermint oil as I use that for my migraines I suffer from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this moisturizer to people with oily to combo skin as I have found it to not be super moisturizing, but just right for people with that skin type. When I wake up my face feels very fresh and ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
    <li> Been using for several weeks now.......so far, NO CHANGE!!!! So sad bc I had high hopes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten really.great anti wrinkle creams before and had IMMEDIATE results!&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> I received this moisturizer cream on Friday and I&#x27;m already in love! It feels great on my skin, absorbs easily, and smells great! It has a peppermint scent that can really wake you up in the mornings. I can feel it tightening and do need to use my regular moisturizer on top of it to keep my skin from feeling dry but this is an anti aging cream, and not just a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m approaching 30 and I&#x27;ve always had great skin and intend to keep it that way! This cream really does seem to do everything it claims on the product description. The packaging is super cute and the bottle is small enough to fit in with my other beauty products and keep my bathroom organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only needed one pump to cover my whole face and neck. It seems like this bottle will last a long time. I&#x27;m very glad that Adeline sent me this product for free to test for them.</li>
    <li> As someone that’s always looking for beauty products to help improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer cream in the mail!! After testing it out for myself I was extremely impressed with this Anti-Aging moisturizer cream. It make my skin look and feel amazing &amp; I saw results in the first week of using this product. I love everything about this product &amp; definitely will be adding it to my favorite products list.  This Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer is packing with amazing ingredients that fight the signs of aging. This cream is formulated with 5 powerful anti- aging ingredients to fight the appearance of wrinkles and rejuvenate your skin. These ingredients are : Matrixyl, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C &amp; Vitamin E. Your are bond to see fantastic results when using this product as all of these ingredients are known to fight aging. These ingredients are also high quality ingredients making for a high quality cream that is handmade and free of parabens.  With this product you have all the ingredients you need to fight aging all in one small bottle!! This cream is also scientifically proven to double the amount of collagen needed to give the skin its elasticity so your wrinkles and aging will fade away fast and you will have younger looking skin in no time. This cream is also extremely easy to use all you need to do is apply a small amount of cream to your face and neck after washing in the morning or evening. I definitely recommend this product to everyone and anyone.</li>
    <li> This does work better than some others. I did half my face, within minutes I noticed the treated side was tighter, smoother with decreased bags under the eye, smaller pores. The tiny fine lines smoothed out. I mix three together for a great lift of face &amp; neck. This is one of those three</li>
    <li> I do a lot of traveling, and every where I go seems to be in a different season and this has been wreaking havoc on my skin. I have combination skin so finding the right lotions is usually a difficult task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been experimenting with different face creams and serums. Adeline’s Anti-Aging Face Cream is formulated with 5 powerful ingredients that fight wrinkles and rejuvenate your skin: Matrixyl, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C &amp; Vitamin E so I was intrigued and how well this cream would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cream its self has a pleasant minty smell so you instantly fee fresh and invigorated. A little goes a long way and it applies smoothly and absorbs quickly into your skin. Its also great on your decollete and backs of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for couple of weeks.  I have noticed a reduction in the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes, as well as the &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; at the corners of my mouth are definitely not as deep. This moisturizer feels luxurious when it goes on, it&#x27;s thick and creamy, but absorbs instantly and it is odorless.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the wrinkle reducing benefits, it seems to be helping to improve my skin tone and texture, my skin is hydrated in the morning, not that combination of dry and oily like it usually is.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first-thing-in-the morning lotion which goes onto my face and neck area prior to applying my makeup for the day. It only takes one pump of the dispenser to take care of my moisturizing needs for that area. I apply in upward strokes on my face and neck and use my ring finger to gently pat around my eyes until fully absorbed. This gives me all the protection my skin needs for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Although I use it specifically on my face and neck, it is also great for the rest of the body too...elbows, hands, etc. I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues while using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED A FREE sample to test and review.</li>
    <li> This has a nice, tingly and fresh feel and feels like silk when I apply it. It also has a very mild, pleasant scent and is a pleasure to use.  I&#x27;ve tried many face creams, serums and gels and have seen very little improvement to my skin.  While using this product I &#x27;ve been watching a small patch of skin on my cheek, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the southern California desert; the sun shines all day, everyday.  The patch I mentioned had very fine lines and appeared leathery.  This patch, that has bothered me so much, is fading and smoothing out.  Other than that I don&#x27;t see too much of a difference, but the rest of the skin on my face wasn&#x27;t in too bad of condition - I use sun block religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to assume that if this product is helping my trouble spot, the rest of my skin must be improving, also.  It&#x27;s kind of pricey, is I use it sparingly and by the time I use this bottle up, I&#x27;ll know if I want to buy more or not.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I have used this cream only a few days and I can already tell a difference in the tonal quality and healing of sun damage on my skin. I, probably, like most women, am very leery of what a product says it will do. But with the service you get with this company ( the nicest people and genuine concern) and the guarantee, I couldn&#x27;t resist. Plus the 4+ star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Have to say, I am happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I like how soft my skin is.  The bottle is a bit small and I haven&#x27;t noticed significant reduction in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the outcome of the Adeline products.&lt;br /&gt;Although the price is more than I ever spent for a moisturizer or skin product!</li>
    <li> I guess that I expected more with this cream. It is a good moisturizer but not a good Anti Aging cream.</li>
    <li> Product&#x27;s great but there&#x27;s not that much moisturizer in the bottle</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT EVERY MORNING AND EVERY NIGHT. IT LAST ALL DAY. I LOVE THAT I CAN USE THIS PRODUCT WITH OTHER FACE PRODUCTS.I DONT REALLY LIKE THAT IF HAVE NO S.P.F IN IT SO I ALSO USE ONE WITH S.P.F IN IT ALONG WITH THIS ONE IF IM GOING TO BE OUTSIDE ALOT.I LOVE THAT IT WAS I NICE SOFT MINTY SMELL ITS NO TO STRONG. IT DOES ABSORB FAST AND IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT. I LOVE THAT U ONLY NEED ABOUT A PUMP AND A HALF FOR YOU WHOLE FACE SO THE BOTTLE WILL LAST A WHILE. THIS PRODUCT IS USED FOR:HELPING YOU LOOK AND FEEL YOUNGER AND MORE VIBRANT AND ALSO PROVIDES NOURISHMENT TO YOUR SKIN. I LOVE HOW IT FEELS WHEN I PUT IT ON AND MAKES MY FACE FEEL GOOD AND SOFT. I DID GET THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE TO DO AN HONEST REVIEW. THIS IS MY HONEST OPINION ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this moisture cream.  When I went into well known make up store they informed me that everyone regardless of age should use a face moisture cream.  I was in the market for one when I was able to do this promotion. I have used other face creams in the past but not very extensively so my history is limited however, this one did not irritate my skin which already puts it ahead of others.  It isn&#x27;t super thick but I liked that as I could spread it around easier. I have been using this product once a day for about a week and I can already notice a difference. I really like the smell, it has a very slight minty fragrance which I see as a plus. I only need one to two pumps to do the job. I like that when I put it on it does not feel greasy, but my skin definitely feels moisturized.  First day I put this on I had a sun burn and this felt great on it.  Price is very competitive.  I see face creams in this price area all the time but for a MUCH smaller bottle  The size of the bottle is a nice size, I hate that most moisture creams in small pots.  Not only do I feel less sanitary using it but it isn&#x27;t enough.  This one is 1 full ounce(30 ml) and has a pump with a lid.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> So far I think it is doing a good. Just takes time</li>
    <li> As a nurse, I&#x27;m always skeptical of products,  but love this line.  I&#x27;ve waited to post my reviews until I used these products for a few months. Well, it&#x27;s been a few months and I&#x27;ve noticed dramatic changes in the wrinkles on my face and neck. My crows feet have become minimal and the parentheses line by my mouth has virtually disappeared. My only wish is that they would add some vitamins to the serum, so currently I alternate a couple of days with a serum that has those. I also wish they made the lotion a little bit larger size because if you use twice a day there is really not enough to also include your neck for the entire month and I&#x27;ve had to use other lotions on my neck. I will continue using these products for as long as they stay reasonable in price and are available!</li>
    <li> this is a must have!&lt;br /&gt;I’m very pleased with this company and their proudcts …&lt;br /&gt;This is the first of two items I’ve been given the honor to use.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, these items have Been gifted for free to me from Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream For review.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Normally I stick my beauty items in a draw..&lt;br /&gt;Not these they go in a pretty basket.&lt;br /&gt;The product is creamy but no oil to clog up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It bssicly does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;I’m very pleased!</li>
    <li> I tried for almost over a month but did not see any results.</li>
    <li> I am LOVING this product! No heavy fragrance, feels light and smooth going on and is quickly absorbed. I am very picky about my products and recent sent back a whole skincare line by a well-known supermodel..... I purchased based on the reviews I read here on Amazon and I can tell you they were on point! I have found my longterm skincare line!</li>
    <li> This product is wondeful for thirsty skin. I live in AZ and have a hard time finding products that nourish my skin without making it feel heavy or greasy. Adeline anti-aging moisturizer felt so good on my skin. It has a nice clean smell. Ive only been using the product for about a week but will definitely continue using it on a daily basis. The only drawback I found is that it doesn&#x27;t have any spf in it. I have to put my sunscreen on top of it. I recieved this product for free in exchage for my unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Not for me; I&#x27;ll return what i have left.  WebMD says, &amp;#34;Witch hazel contains a cancer-causing chemical (safrole), but in amounts that are too small to be of concern.&amp;#34;  Just not liking putting anything associated with cancer risk on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really do like this Moisturizer....this is my re-order of it.  Not an over-night fix, although I did notice some pretty rapid improvement.  But having used it a bit over a month, I&#x27;m noticing some serious difference in my skin tone/color.  I do use it along with the Adeline Hyalouronic Serum,</li>
    <li> I received the Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer free and for review.  The product comes in a very eye appealing container- a pump format.  The pump allows you to distribute just the correct amount and a little goes a very long way.  The moisturizer is very creamy and has a lovely scent of mint.  It spreads nicely onto the skin and is absorbed in a way in which there is no greasy or tight feeling after application.  I applied it twice daily- once in the morning and once in the evening after washing my face.  It is keeping my skin moist in the winter season when I am prone to extremely dry skin.  It is very light and does not cause any type of reaction such as itchiness or redness.  I would highly recommend this moisturizer and will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Late last night amazon arrived with my very first product review, well, 2 actually. Adeline was awesome enough to send me samples of their 1 oz. Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixl for all skin types and a 1.7 oz. bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum.My first impression? The 1.7 oz. bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum is just that. It is very liquid gel and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your entire face. I believe I used a pump and a half.  NOW my favorite this morning was the Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl. Two pumps and a nice thicker cream came out. It smelled lightly of peppermint and was a great wake me up!&lt;br /&gt;Since I have applied both products I do have to say that my skin feels lovely!&lt;br /&gt;You can find both of these wonderful products at&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/anti-aging-moisturizer-cream-antioxidants/dp/b00kveevnw/ie&#x3D;utf8?m&#x3D;a2ne1xkbwkz2te&amp;keywords&#x3D;adeline+anti-aging+moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/hyaluronic-acid-serum-moisturizer-alternative/dp/b00gmxize2?ie&#x3D;utf8&amp;keywords&#x3D;adeline+hyaluronic+acid+serum&lt;br /&gt;The Hyaluronic Acid Serum advises to use twice a day and so I will be following that directive.&lt;br /&gt;Please note!

    <li> saw no differences in skin texture or moisturazation</li>
    <li> Adeline Anti Aging Moisturizing Cream has everything you need a facial cream.  Free of harsh chemicals with the first ingredients listed being deionized water and witch hazel.  It probably has some names you have never even heard before like Matrixyl.  I was not sure what it was and did some research.  Matrixyl is pretty new to the market and is a peptide that specifically stimulates collagen synthesis and skin repair.  What is a peptide.  Peptide is a small protein fragment containing short chains of amino acids.  They are supposed work together to mimic the appearance of  broken down collagen, causing your skin to react by producing more collagen, as well as elastin.  With continuous use the result will be smooth skin and reduced appearance of those fine lines and wrinkles.  Sounds like a lot of mumble jumble.  In simple words, it will repair your skin cells and reduce those fine lines and wrinkles.  It is not going to happen overnight, but with continued use it will and those dark spots will start getting lighter or fade too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love the aroma, it has a fresh minty scent (contains peppermint oil and green tea extract).  It goes on velvety smooth and absorbs quickly into my skin.  I rub it on my face and throat every morning and night.  A small amount goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample.</li>
    <li> This is a small family run business with great products. I love this product and the way it makes my face feel. I use the eye serum, the hyaluronic acid and the moisturizer. It makes my skin look great. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
    <li> It did not seem to help much. Was disappointed</li>
    <li> I got this product a few weeks ago, and I have been using thing product each and every day since I received it. It is a wonderful moisturizer. It has many different ingredients in it, that most people buy separately from each other, I guess cause they cannot find a product that has all in one, but this is one of those products. It leaves my skin feeling super smooth and not even a bit oily. In the morning when I put it on, it seems to brighten up my face, and it makes me look much more awake in the morning, which is great for when I&#x27;m going out in the day time so I don&#x27;t look so tired. This cream also has a wonderful smell to it, a kind of minty one, which isn&#x27;t too strong but is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
    <li> A very definite and lingering medicinal peppermint smell, not distasteful... but not a scent I am overly fond of either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does absorb into the skin, leaving a smoother, fuller look to the skin.  My main testing area is the back of my hands... I have always had &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; looking hands, whereas my face has always been the other way around.  However, there is a very fine line of using too much.  Perhaps a single squirt is just about right for each hand-sized area because more than that, a tacky residue does persist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally adore Adeline&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum in every way, from scent to it&#x27;s clean, full absorption, to how absolutely wonderful it makes my skin feel.  Once again, using the back of my hands as the testing surface, Adeline Anti Aging Moisturizer does actually give far more immediate results than the Hyaluronic Acid serum, so on that aspect I do recommend this option.  My hands seriously do look plumper and younger just from a week or so of only using it, including all the veins that have always been very prominent.  As much as I love the Serum, I have never noticed such direct plumping and smoothing that this Moisturizer gives upon application.  However, it would be Adeline&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I will repurchase when empty.  Not too sure about this one - results or not, don&#x27;t know if I can personally get use to the minty scent that reminds me of the classic &amp;#34;decades old candy dish&amp;#34;.  :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, the results are pretty dang great with those gnarly pop veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I did receive this as an offered discounted product for reviewing purposes, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> This anti aging cream works great on any age woman teen and above. Bottle isn&#x27;t very big, but you don&#x27;t need much per use. Spreads great on any place you have wrinkles or see wrinkles forming. You see results after a weeks use daily. Keeps skin moisturized and happy. Soaks in fast, leaving your skin feeling soft, smooth, and healthy.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff it works amazing i have other products by this brand and they are amazing i highly suggest them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lucky to get offered lots of different skin products to try for review.  They&#x27;re all good--manufacturers wouldn&#x27;t put them out there to be criticized if they weren&#x27;t confident in their products.  Such is the case with Adeline Anti Aging Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline is unusual in that it&#x27;s not a serum; it&#x27;s a full blown moisturizer.  It can be used with the serum of your choice for a double whammy, but it&#x27;s great on its own.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and am delighted with the appearance, tone, and feel of my skin.  It&#x27;s not a face lift in a pump bottle, but it&#x27;s good.  I don&#x27;t know what Matrixyl formula is, exactly, but it&#x27;s working on my skin, and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction.  Who could ask for more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer I use with the hyaluronic acid serum and I love the firmness it provides and it smells wonderful!!:-)</li>
    <li> This little bottle of moisturizer is great. It has a faint, minty scent - which is supposed to be stress relieving. It sinks in nicely, feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. It&#x27;s hard to tell how much it is doing as an anti aging product since who knows what I might look like if I wasn&#x27;t using it. But I seems to keep my skin smooth and fairly wrinkle free. I can&#x27;t get rid of all of them and no product would be able to do that anyway. I&#x27;m 51 and I like the wear marks I carry around to reflect my wisdom. Ha ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizer and worth trying to keep aging at bay. Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I really like this anti aging moisturizer. This is probably one of the best anti aging moisturizer that I have used in a while. The moisturizer comes in an easy to use pump bottle. I apply the moisturizer after using my facial serums. The first time I used it I could smell a hint of peppermint. I checked the ingredients and there is peppermint oil in the moisturizer. I absolutely love the smell of peppermint so I’m happy that it has a light peppermint fragrance. It also invigorates my skin leaving it feeling refreshed. The moisturize quickly absorbs into my skin without leaving an oily residue. This moisturizer is probably one of my favorite anti aging moisturizers. If you’re looking for a good anti aging moisturizer you should definitely consider this one.</li>
    <li> This review is for Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl and Organic Eye Serum. I used the two together for two weeks and below is my summary.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get this product in the mail and actually saw the box sitting on my back steps as my family and I were heading out the door for vacation. The package wasn’t scheduled to be delivered for two more days and I was not happy about having to wait a whole week to try it. It was a nice little beginning to my week off. So, we walked out the door and I was opening it before we could even get down the road. I ripped into the boxes and pulled out each of the pumps. I’m a graphic designer, so packaging is important to me. The lid on each of the bottles had a tight connection and were opened by pulling firmly in the upwards motion. They had a substantial weight to them and didn’t feel cheaply made or assembled.&lt;br /&gt;Our trip was to the beach…only an hour away, but a nice escape from the everyday. The first night of our vacation was pretty much getting there late, unpacking, a short walk on the beach, and supper. When we arrived at the resort from supper I got my little girl ready for bed and rushed back in the bathroom to wash my face and try my new girly products. I washed my face and patted it dry. I would normally follow up with Clinique gel moisturizer and eye cream, but pumped out a little of the new stuff. It smelled amazing, like peppermint. I smoothed it all over my face and neck and loved the cooling effect and tingling that followed. Though I had already washed my face and it was clean, this somehow made it feel cleaner. Next, I patted some of the eye serum around my eyes. It felt so cool and refreshing, and again tingly. I liked the moisturizer, but I was overwhelmed with the eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I jumped in the shower before anyone else woke up. I always rinse my face off really well before using cleanser and was amazed that you could actually still feel the eye serum. When the water made contact with it, it felt sort of slippery. This made me feel that it worked all night long to protect the skin around my eyes. You want it to absorb, but no so much that your skin is dry and thirsty after a few hours. I feel like this is a problem that I run into a lot, so I loved feeling that it was still on my face. I quickly showered and dried off so that I could begin my makeup routine. I used the moisturizer before I applied my foundation and I felt that it smoothed the coverage of it similarly to that of my Clinique products. Over the next days at the beach, my face got a little sunburned on the beach and the cooling effects of these two Adeline products felt even sweeter on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for two weeks straight, using the moisturizer twice a day and the eye serum at night. I can feel that my face is smoother and it feels a bit tighter. I can’t see any difference as of yet, but I’m excited about the possibility. I hate that I’m just now learning about Adeline, but I can’t wait to try more of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary product in return for honest feedback.he water made contact with it, it felt sort of slippery.

    <li> I recently purchased this moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and, frankly, I don&#x27;t understand the positive comments about this. I have used it at night. It doesn&#x27;t feel creamy going on, and when I wake up in the morning, my face feels taught and dry. I have sensitive skin, and maybe this formulation is too strong for my skin. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that is very light.  I am happy with my purchase...</li>
    <li> It has minty smell and moisturize well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where to start here. This product is amazing!! It has a wonderful mint, not too strong at all, but it makes you almost want to it. Lol. It is very soothing on your face. My fine lines and deep forehead wrinkles that had lightened from previous products, were almost completely taken away. 1 did disappear! My jowl lines filled in. I used it on my hands and lower arms and it took away my age spots. Nothing else I had tried, did that! I also had red, scaly marks along my chin, and they disappeared. I can go on and on with great things to say, you need to try it for yourself. They have a money back guarantee, so you have nothing to lose. You won&#x27;t need it though, trust me! Good luck to all of you!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is decent: nice pleasant smell, not too heavy or greasy, and my skin feels nice after using it.  My complaint would be the amount that you get for the money.  I used a dollop each morning and another each evening before bed, and the product was gone in 3 weeks.  Not worth the price, when other products are comparable in quality, and are a much better value.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Noticed less crows feet as well as more awake eyes</li>
    <li> Now that the winter is here, my skin doesn&#x27;t have that sunny tanned glow and frankly it&#x27;s a bit dry with these horribly cold winds and I don&#x27;t wear foundation so, I need every little bit of help I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that it had a bit of a minty scent. I&#x27;m guessing that from the peppermint oil that&#x27;s in the ingredients. I love that because I&#x27;ve read that peppermint oil is very good for  you skin. I even featured some on my holiday gift guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I washed and applied on my face and neck as they suggested and it felt cool to the skin. Again this may be due to the peppermint, I&#x27;m not sure but, I liked the way it felt. My skin felt soft instantly. It does say to keep away from the eyes but, that&#x27;s okay. I have the eye serum for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels great. I love how soft it feels to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the pump to get the cream out. I always find myself pushing down far too many times before anything comes out. Maybe I&#x27;m just impatient but, I always struggle with pumps designed like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, however is really great and I recommend it especially with these winter storms heading our way. If you&#x27;re in a sunny part of the states, &#x60;well aren&#x27;t you the lucky one&#x27;. Just kidding. I&#x27;m not jealous at all but, this moisturizer is perfect for you to combat the sun. Best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> Received this item for free from company to try out. I absolutely love it. Definitely a plus for me to use in winter.</li>
    <li> Amazing benefits, Authentic Skin Care&#x27;s anti-aging mouisturizer works brilliantly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this moisturizer, this is by far my favorite, preventing signs of age is extremely important to me; with all the added ingredients in this one bottle you know your making the right decision. With ingredients like vitamin C+E, witch hazel, matrixyl, and hyaluronic acid this one bottle does the job of five!&lt;br /&gt;And is scientificlly proven to double collagen levels to give you better elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are easy to read and understand, ... And because it doesn&#x27;t have an over powering scent it&#x27;s great for men or women; while helping prevent fine lines and wrinkles, while restoring your youthful appearance of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature I want to bring up, and this has nothing to do with results, but I want to briefly bring up that they DO NOT TEST ON ANIMALS; this may not be a bog deal, but to have a mouisturizer that works as well as ASC&#x27;s and not have harmful testing is amazing. And I&#x27;m proud to say I use this brand of skin care, not only do I use this anti-aging mouisturizer, after I apple this to my skin I use there eye serum (GREAT TEAM) .... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works in so many great ways, by helping with my dry skin.. while giving it a refreshing radiant glow, helping my uneven skin tone, making my skin more smooth.. I feel more confident!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion. Everything stated is 100% truthful and my own personal views. Regardless I only recommend products or services I use/used personally and believe is a good product.</li>
    <li> I got some #Adeline in and I said I would review and tell people what I think about it .&lt;br /&gt;Now I have been applying mine for about a week now and my face feels so renewed and fresh I love it. I go to the pool a lot and the chlorine tends to dry out my skin and I would apply the Adeline on after and instantly I could feel the skin feel rejuventaed. I haven’t used it long enough to be able to say if it’s making me have less aging marks lines and looks but I sure feel like it’s making a change . I absolutely love how it don’t take much because shen I first seen the price I was skeptical but it takes so little it will last a long time. It’s very smooth to apply and goes in the Kin fast so you don’t feel sticky and like u have a facial on like a lot of creams and face lotions do. I reccomend to go try this product. I plan on getting my mother some as gift cause I am very happy with it can’t wait to try more of their products &lt;/p&gt;</li>
    <li> I received this moisturizer for reviewing purposes and for free from Adeline through Tomoson. According to what I’m seeing on the box, I’m thinking the Matrixyl is the advance petite trio, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C in this product. This product is supposed to be for all skin types, so I’m hoping it won’t cause irritation for me in the long run, but we’ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Use this Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says that you should apply the moisturizer on after toner and serum. It comes in an easy-to-use, hygienic pump bottle.  Honestly, the packaging is very attractive. If I saw this in store, I’d be drawn to it because of the packaging. I’m just that way :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Claims:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m quoting the box here, which says that this moisturizer “Contains powerful antioxidants to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Texture, Consistency, and Scent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, this moisturizer is white in color. It’s not as thick as the current anti-aging moisturizer that I’m using, but it’s not too watery either. It goes on a little thin, but I feel like that would be good for those nights when I want lighter moisture. I alternate between heavy creams and light moisturizers. This would be a light moisturizer. This moisturizer has a very slight scent and not a bad one. It’s pleasant and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can’t vouch for the anti-aging properties because that’s next to impossible to do unless you conduct a longitudinal study, but I can say that this is a decent and seemingly delicate moisturizer. So far I haven’t experienced irritation and I think it would be good for most skin types. I give this moisturizer a 5/5.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer cream. It soaks into the skin fast, and gives instant, long lasting results. I have terrible patches of dry skin on my face, and this cream really helps those areas.  Its a very light cream, and a very fresh clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Beauty provided me with free samples of products to review, and I was under no obligation to review it. Nor was I under any obligation to write a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: This company also has a serum for this product, and I think it&#x27;s even more amazing then this one.</li>
    <li> nice moisturizer but would not claim anything else</li>
    <li> another cream for the trash not effective</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum because I heard rave reviews about it. All the celebrities are talking about serum this and serum that so I figured I may as well give in. My face isn&#x27;t in terrible condition. As I am getting older I am seeing the dark circles and fine lines. I love that it is all natural with no parabens or terrible chemicals. I apply a little in the morning and find myself having a nice glow already just after a couple of days. It&#x27;s chalked full of vitamins and minerals so your skin heals nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky with residue. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and will be keeping it around for years to come! I am seeing a decrease in the dark circles and my skin never looked better!!</li>
    <li> i Loved this its a great addidtion to the whole ADELINE collection. I have been using this with ADELINE&#x27;S hyaluronic  acid serum and organic eye serum and they work together amazingly. i recieved this product for my to review and my reviews are always honest and only my real experiences i have with the product. oh and the Adeline products dont cause me any stinging or burning feelings i have experienced with others in the past.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! i have been using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks and i have noticed my skin is very soft and especially after i have exfoliated my skin thoroughly. I mainly use this product in the night time as i find it gives me a very moisturized face for when i wake up in the morning which i love since it is winter time. Also, in the morning i place a small amount all over my face under a sun screen and it works wonderful. Since i have sensitive skin i love how it doesnt irritate my skin as some other moisturizers do. Really loving this moisturizer so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tomoson has sent me this product but all opinions and comments are honest and my own*</li>
    <li> In all 100% honesty I have yet to run into a cream that doesn&#x27;t feel AT ALL not one bit like its on you until now. What I mean is once you put this on, your face just looks and feels awesome and you don’t feel like you’ve got anything greasy or thick on. I’ve always avoided make up and been overly picky with creams due to the fact that I swear I can feel my pores being clogged by whatever I’m attempting to put on…but not with this. You can actually tell they spent a lot of time perfecting this formula to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list is ok by me, I’m not feeling guilty about putting this on my skin one bit! Once again I’ve run into one of those things I’ll probably always have available for my awesometastic beauty routine. Once again, a little goes a long way! One pump of the bottle and I’ve been able to apply to my entire face! No adverse reactions to this cream, my sensitive skin is happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer. Sinks in, feels silky.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this moisturizer from the seller to review on my blog. I am pleased with how this cream performs. I decided to use it in conjunction with the seller&#x27;s hyaluronic serum. Since that serum can be a little drying this moisturizer was a perfect fit for it. It balanced out the drying effect and did not feel heavy.  Like with the serum I am saving this moisturizer for when warmer weather arrives. Even though it is spring, It is very windy in March so I still need products that are better suited for this type of weather. By end of May I think I may be switching over to this and the serum from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars is that I did use with other products instead of the seller&#x27;s own serum just to see how they would mesh. With some of my other products that I use now, the moisturizer is bit too much for my skin and it kind of caused a bit of shedding of my other serum that I use right now. That isn&#x27;t good. For best results use this with Adeline&#x27;s hyaluronic serum.</li>
    <li> This is a great face cream. It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy and has a wonderful fragrance. It absorbs and spreads well so I can do my face/neck with 1-2 pumps. The cream itself is white and reminds me of a candy cane. It&#x27;s scented with peppermint oil and it&#x27;s a very refreshing fragrance. I googled some of these ingredients and there are some stabilizers to hold it together and the peptides which help stimulate cell renewal and collagen production. I didn&#x27;t know that collagen is a protein and learned that too! Anything that helps with collagen production I&#x27;ll put on twice a day! It not only helps with overall appearance of skin, but also wrinkles and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ingredients include: Deionized Water, Witch Hazel Extracct, Glycerol Sterate, PEG-100 Sterate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Shea Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, PEG-8, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12, Phenoxyethanol, Captylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate VP Copolymer, Ceterayl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivae, PPG-12 SMDI/Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Xanthum Gum, Peppermint Oil, Green Tea Extract, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This product doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen, so I do use a lightweight sunscreen when spending the day outside and overall am very happy with the product. I did receive a free product to facilitate this review, however the opinions are my own and honest.</li>
    <li> You are never too young to start thinking about how your body is aging. There are so many products out there that promise a fountain of youth but end of damaging your skin more than anything. Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer is not one of them. It is handmade and contains 5 powerful ingredients which are all FDA approved. It doesn&#x27;t have parabens, no petrochemicals, and no fragrances or fillers. It is also backed by a 100% money back guarantee and they will even let you keep the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product. Orting and night after washing my face for the last 5 days. I liked that it came out easy with a little pump on the bottle. A little goes a long way. It did smell a little but an ok smell, because of the ingredients and not strong by any means or irritating.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like, is after rubbing it on my face, it kind of left a greasy feeling on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is supposed to prevent and help with laugh lines and wrinkles, make skin feel softer yet tighter, and help with dull and uneven skin tones. We&#x27;ll after using, I do notice that my skin is softer but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my laugh lines and forehead lines, but that can take time to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way it feels on my skin and the consistency and texture of the cream and I do feel like I am using something that won&#x27;t make things worse. So I do recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find this product on Amazon.com but remember if you don&#x27;t like it, they will offer you your money back. So it&#x27;s definitely a win-win. Go ahead and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product free as part of a product trial from Tomoson.com but the above opinion is my own unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Works well on eye wrinkles</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My skin feels 20 years younger after using it for just 7 days.  I really like how only a few drops covers my entire face and I feel the difference.  It makes your skin feel so soft, not greasy.  I already see small fine lines around my eyes and smile fading.  It feels so great on your face and neck.  You know it&#x27;s a great product when your skin just has a  healthy glow.  I am really happy with this product and am recommending it to my friends.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see what I am so happy about!</li>
    <li> I love this anti aging cream!  Most anti aging products I&#x27;ve tried have a medicine smell but this one has a pleasant minty smell so I love putting in on before bed.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It has a wonderful refreshing scent and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> One of the things that just PLAIN stinks about growing older, is our bodies stop producing all of those things we once took for granted.  Who knew collagen was something we actually needed and wasn&#x27;t just stuff to make ur lips big??&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has helped my circles, I&#x27;ve also noticed that after using my bags on my eyelids have seemingly shrunk!  It helps to reduce those fine lines and wrinkles (uh crow&#x27;s feet, anyone????) and helps to give back collagen and removes those hideous dark circles under your eyes.  It also while doing all of this, also nourishes and hydrates your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While, we are still awaiting the fountain of youth, products like this do help us to gain some of he nutrients and ingredients our body needs!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells so good and you can smell it all day. It is a tiny bit tacky for a short time when you put it on, but after that you are left with such soft skin! I would recommend this product to anyone. I have very sensitive skin and have to be very careful about what I use on my face and this didn&#x27;t bother me one bit. It didn&#x27;t itch, it didn&#x27;t give me red blotchy skin and it didn&#x27;t give me break outs! That&#x27;s one of the reasons why I gave it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This year I turned 41 (the horror!), and after looking in the mirror and deciding that it was time to upgrade my beauty regimen, I began a search for a great face care system.  I have been using the Oil of Olay Regenerist line of products for a number of  years, but I was beginning to notice a few lines in specific areas of my face.  After upgrading to the Oil of Olay ProX line, I had the opportunity to review three products produced by Adeline, the Organic Eye Serum, the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and the Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl.  This skin care system was provided to me, free of charge, for the purposes of an honest evaluation and product review.  I used all three of these products together for a total of 14 days, and the overall results should be considered cumulative.  This review, however, is specific to the Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let&#x27;s talk about the product itself.  According to the manufacturer, it contains five anti-oxidants: Matrixyl, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E.  Having used products containing each of these ingredients over the years, I was pretty confident that the moisturizer would meet my needs.  The manufacturers also state that the product will double the amount of collagen needed for skin elasticity.  Not being a scientist, I have no way of verifying this, but it&#x27;s nice to hear, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrives boxed, as pictured above.  I used the product twice a day, once in the morning before applying my make-up, and again in the evening before bed.  In my regimen, I first washed my face and neck using my usual face wash, applied the Adeline Organic eye Serum, followed by the Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Then, I applied the Anti-Aging Moisturizer.  When dispensed, the product has a clean almost medicine smell one would probably attribute to the witch hazel in the moisturizer.  I used one squirt on my fingertips, and after rubbing the tips of my two hands together, I brushed upward from the bottom of my neck to my chin.  I used another pump and applied to the lower half of my face stroking upwards and outwards.  My final pump was for my forehead and nose.  The product was quite fluid, not too watery, but not too creamy either.  It did not make my face burn or tingle at all.  It dried quickly, almost too fast for my face, as I like to have my skin a little moist as I apply my BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for two weeks, I have to say that I am extremely impressed with both the individual product, and the entire skin care system.  I have the beginning of creases on my upper forehead, as well as one line at the outer crease of each eye and laugh lines that have been with me since my twenties.  I also have three very noticeable creases on my neck.  Anytime I stop using the name brand products I was using before (usually when I run out of product), I notice a definite change in the appearance of my developing wrinkles.  However, I can honestly state that not only did none of the lines deepen, the lines at the corners of my eyes completely disappeared.  I have also noticed a diminished appearance in my neck creases as well.  At the end of the day, my make-up still seems newly applied and not washed out or faded from the natural oils on my face.  I also like the way the skin on my neck and face feels in the morning after sleeping with the product on.  My only real complaint about the product is that when compared to the other two in the system, I seem to be going through it much faster and will run out way before I run out of the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl, especially to someone who intends to use the other two products Adeline offers in this line.r, I brushed upward from the bottom of my neck to my chin.  I used another pump and applied to the lower half of my face stroking upwards and outwards.  My final pump was for my forehead and nose.  The product was quite fluid, not too watery, but not too creamy either.  It did not make my face burn or tingle at all.  It dried quickly, almost too fast for my face, as I like to have my skin a little moist as I apply my BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for two weeks, I have to say that I am extremely impressed with both the individual product, and the entire skin care system.  I have the beginning of creases on my upper forehead, as well as one line at the outer crease of each eye and laugh lines that have been with me since my twenties.  I also have three very noticeable creases on my neck.  Anytime I stop using the name brand products I was using before (usually when I run out of product), I notice a definite change in the appearance of my developing wrinkles.  However, I can honestly state that not only did none of the lines deepen, the lines at the corners of my eyes completely disappeared.  I have also noticed a diminished appearance in my neck creases as well.  At the end of the day, my make-up still seems newly applied and not washed out or faded from the natural oils on my face.  I also like the way the skin on my neck and face feels in the morning after sleeping with the product on.  My only real complaint about the product is that when compared to the other two in the system, I seem to be going through it much faster and will run out way before I run out of the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl, especially to someone who intends to use the other two products Adeline offers in this line.</li>

    <li> High quality and very creamy. Goes on nice no greasy skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid thirties and I am always in search for anti aging products, as my skin responds differently to products that I use, depending on the season. Yes, I have crazy, sensitive and perprtually dry skin. I must admit that this has been very frustrating until I found products that work for me - depending on what season it is, of course. I love using Adeline&#x27;s Anti Aging Moisturizer during the colder months and during the transition of seasons. It provides me with the &amp;#34;anti aging properties&amp;#34;, that surge of hydration and moisture retention, that I seek from products during these particular months. I was never disappointed with this product and brand, as it works for my sensitive skin. Needless to say, I am a very happy camper and will definitely be a repeat customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about a month now and highly recommend it. It&#x27;s lightweight, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, goes on smooth, and the smell is just wonderful! I hate using a product on my face with a strong chemical odor. This smells fresh and clean and feels great. I like the way my skin looks and feels, and a little bit goes a long way. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> love it, makes your face feel moisturized and smooth....</li>
    <li> First things first - this moisturizer is the BEST thing i&#x27;ve tried yet for my face. This was initially meant for my mother, who has oily skin. Once she tried it though, she insisted that I do the same. I, on the other hand, have dry, combination skin. My skin gets so bad sometimes that I deal with flaking - mainly on my forehead. Most moisturizers i&#x27;ve used have either left my skin with a greasy feeling, or completely dry as if I never put anything on to begin with. Adeline&#x27;s Anti-Aging Moisturizer leaves skin feeling smooth and soft, without any oily or parched. The product goes on very light and has a pleasant peppermint scent(which is non-irritating!). In addition to the product living up to its description and reviews, I have received not one, but two e-mails from two different customer representatives ensuring that I simply love this product. They were both exceptionally nice and wanted to follow up that there were no issues with my shipment or the product itself. They also replied promptly to me, which certainly means a lot. As for the anti-aging aspect of this moisturizer, I have only been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a difference in my face. I will definitely be buying this again and recommending it to all of my friends. Thank you so much Adeline!</li>
    <li> Not enough moisture for skin. After an hour I feel dry.</li>
    <li> I read these reviews telling me how it smells, silky on skin, so smooth going on your skin.  WHO CARES!!! Does this cream work efficiently for your needd.  Does it cause your skin to even out.  Fine wrinkles get softer.  What! What!  When I like a product this is my review...I LOVE IT FOR MYSELF.  THE RESULTS ARE GREAT! Try this product and see if it works as well for you.  I found my true love in this bottle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything as advertised.</li>
    <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd anti-aging product that I&#x27;ve used from Adeline and I have liked both of them. This one has peppermint oil in it, and it tingles a bit, and it smells like mint.  I like the peppermint; I find that it increases circulation to mine, and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a white, lotion type moisturizer that comes out of a very nice, well-working pump dispenser.  It is great to use under makeup, as it is one that has immediate effects of filling in very fine lines with an almost waxy type fill, but I didn&#x27;t see any parabens in the ingredients; I suspect it is the copolymers and glycerin having that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t at all greasy; my skin absorbs it quickly.  It does a good job of softening and moisturizing.  Long term, I can&#x27;t say if it is really effective for preventing or improving wrinkles, but it is at least a great short term help.  I see immediate improvement with very vine little lines and under-eye crepe that lasts for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint oil might irritate some with very sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;This is not what I&#x27;d ever call a &#x27;green&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; type product</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;m happy with the results and definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> I am absolutely IN LOVE with this moisturizer. As you can probably see from the picture above, I cannot get enough of it. I am going through this moisturizer like it is going out of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, the biggest appeal to me about Adeline&#x27;s moisturizer is it&#x27;s amazing scent. Fresh, clean, refreshing peppermint. Immediately, I feel refreshed after a shower and cleansing my face due to the moisturizer&#x27;s Peppermint Oil. Not overwhelming though- it is very soft, subtle and delicious smelling. I get excited to moisturize now! Never thought that would happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I don&#x27;t want to discount the other thing I love the most about this moisturizer. This moisturizer is thick. Normally, that worries me. I&#x27;m not sure if this happens to anyone else- but sometimes when a moisturizer is too thick- it never absorbs and creates this weird film on my face that starts to flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this absorbs so nicely! And, my face feels so fresh and soft. In the dead of winter, my face has been so dry and this is an amazing relief for me. As opposed to many thick moisturizers that I have tried- Adeline&#x27;s Moisturizer actually delivers with the added bonus of being anti-aging. So far, it has been my overall favorite new product that I have tried and it is forever part of my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Improved the appearance of &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; skin.  No strong fragrance or greasy feel.  Did not irritate my sensitive skin.  Highly recommend product.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and even better after using the hyaluronic serum and eye cream.</li>
    <li> It works and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  Beautiful results!</li>
    <li> I have tried many moisturizers over the years from the most expensive to those sold at Target, Walgreens etc. The one issue I&#x27;ve had with every single one (I&#x27;m not exaggerating) is that no matter how well they worked to moisturize my skin, I am always left with what I can only describe as a type of blotchy chemical burn. Going out into extreme cold or heat always exacerbates the condition. I had been using this product for several days and as other reviews have mentioned, was pleased with the light scent, impressed with the light tingle and happy with the overall results I was noticing. I hadn&#x27;t really given much thought to absence of the usual reaction I have with products until the day after my husband and I participated in a benefit motorcycle ride. I had planned to skip the use of products for the day but in my rush without even thinking I applied the moisturizer as part of my morning routine and spent the entire day with the wind and hot sun on my face. Not only did I wake up with no chemical burn or blotches, my face that very obviously took in lots of sun rays the day before felt smooth, soft and supple!</li>
    <li> This anti aging moisturizer cream feels amazing on my face. It has a light minty smell, which makes me feel refreshed. I love that a little of it goes a long way. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, and I can&#x27;t wait to use it in the winter, when my skin is very dry!</li>
    <li> Unable to properly review the product because I believe I&#x27;m sensitive or allergic to Hyaluric Acid I had a reaction to Synvisc knee injection; which is Hyaluric Acid. Thats why the product seemed to irritate my skin. I feel that this is no reflection on the product.</li>

I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blustery winter season has really taken a toll on the skin of many especially here in Western New York. The cold gusts of wind and heat combinations in our home make for a daily fight against dry skin on our bodies.  When I received Adeline&#x27;s Anti-Aging Moisturizer Cream I was excited because this was not only to help prevent against aging but also to help moisturize the skin which I need so desperately right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 32 years old and am slowly beginning to see signs of aging on my face such as crows feet around my eyes. I was interested in this cream because it held five ingredients for anti-aging which I hoped would help tackle this problem for my eye area. Matrixyl, Vitamin C and E, Hyaluronic Acid and Witch Hazel all come together to provide a result for the skin that is wonderful and fast acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The routine is very simple. I simply woke up in the morning and washed my face and then applied this cream. Before bedtime, I washed my face again and reapplied this cream. In less than a minutes time, my skin was all protected and nourished feeling more youthful within an instant and appearing more refined and toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the products in this bottle are free of parabens and are FDA approved. There are no added fragrances or additives and fillers which makes this product safe for all skin types. The scent is very faint with a slight peppermint smell to it. The cream goes on smooth and absorbs in the skin so there is no greasy residue left on your skin at all. The company is so sure of the success rate of their product that they are providing a money back guarantee for anyone unsatisfied. This testament is something I love to really advertise about because I think these are the companies that really need to be supported. If a company can stand by a product that much you can assure yourself that you will see results if you follow the routine!really need to be supported.

    <li> I had the opportunity to review 3 Adeline skin care products, including: Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl and the Organic Eye Serum, with the sole purpose of sharing my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Purchasing Experience: A+&lt;br /&gt;I always love when I can find a product on Amazon because I think that it just immediately makes the purchase experience better than other retailers right from the start. The same applies here. I ordered all three Adeline products and received the product super quickly through Prime shipping, in just 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Packaging and First Impression: A+&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good, with each bottle arriving in a smaller box. The bottles are nice – good quality material with the pumps on each functioning as expected. The labeling and overall appearance gives the product a classy look, and I enjoyed using them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Review: A&lt;br /&gt;I am very blessed to come from a long line of women in my family who are all quite youthful in their appearance. Much to my children’s chagrin, most people are shocked to know that I have a 19, 16 and 14 year old – or that I am bordering 38 years old. I love the fact that my skin is still fairly youthful – and that I am not knee deep in researching or trying everything under the sun to battle wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that – I was eager to try a new skin care line as the years are passing quickly and it never hurts to be prepared or to be proactive. I was truly impressed by all 3 of these products, and would highly recommend that they be used in unison. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling tighter, clearer and refreshed. There were times before I added the Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl into the mix that my skin felt a touch dry, but that would be expected with this type of treatment. Once I added in the moisturizer – it was the perfect balance that my skin was craving. I also want to share that,even at 37 – I still fall victim to acne breakouts. My skin has never been clearer since using all 3 of these products! Even if I never produce a wrinkle, I would still use Adeline because my skin is super clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite product of the 3 is the Organic Eye Serum. I am so not a morning person and often wake up groggy with bags under my eyes and my hair standing on end. No – this doesn’t fix bed head, but it does fix bags…and awesome-ly at that. You can feel a slight tingle as soon as you apply the Organic Eye Serum and immediately you are assured that it is indeed working. But besides the tingle you can feel a tightness and see the bags begin to disappear. Like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: B-&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered the products, I had done a quick google search on the ingredients. I felt comfortable that there were no animal products used in the making of the Adeline skin care, but I wanted to be certain. I sent a quick email to the company and they replied back stating that their products are never tested on animals (great!) and that they were pretty certain that the ingredients were not animal based. I would have appreciated a firm yes/no or let me find out – versus a “pretty certain”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Yes&lt;br /&gt;I had a great experience with the 3 products being used together and would recommend doing the same.</li>
    <li> I found nothing special about this cream.  I have nothing negative or positive to say about the product.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product through a product review on the Tomoson website. I absolutely love this product. It leaves your skin feeling soft and saw a difference just within a few times using it. I will be buying this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this moisturizer a short time but so far I am pleased with it.  It does not have any harsh chemicals or strong fragrances.  I need to apply moisturizer especially on my neck and chest and around my eye area, particularly in colder temperatures.  But I am trying to apply it every day as I get older to hopefully prevent some signs of aging on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to apply this and feel a tingling, minty sensation.  I was not expecting that from a moisturizer.  But then I double checked the ingredients and noticed that there is witch hazel and peppermint extract which was probably the cause of the tingling.  Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I have grown to like that sensation when I applied it but at first it caught me off guard.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a moisturizer that is free of harsh chemicals and strong fragrances.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I love that it has a tiny peppermint scent (nothing strong) when you first squirt out the moisturizer but you can&#x27;t smell it after that. My face feels smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product free for my review and honest feedback. My review is my personal opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> Okay.  Not great results but okay.  No problem just not terribly impressed.</li>
    <li> Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;Since this product was bought through Amazon the delivery was quick and easy. I got the product in two days as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Adeline has put a lot of thought into their packaging design and it shows. The bottle is wonderful and sleek and anyone who is into packaging design will be impressed with this display.&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;Considering this product is normally in the 60 dollar range for many other beauty retailers this one is a steal at $35.25US.&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;This product is lovely! It is a super lightweight formula and there is no greasy residue left behind after application! I have super dry skin and I am always looking for help when it comes to making my skin smooth and lush. Adeline achieved this with flying colors! After a week there was a huge improvement with my skin’s dryness and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the light mint scent is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy one; BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is everything you want in a moisturizer and more.&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free as a sample and my review/opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great Anti Aging Moisturizer. It has kept my skin moisturized all day and I love the minty smell of it. It makes your skin feeling smooth and fresh from the minty scent. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now and it has helped me with my dry patches on my face. I have also noticed some of the few lines on my face lessening. I would recommend this product to those who want a good but light moisturizer that keeps your face feeling hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Just received.  I am excited about trying this</li>
    <li> What do you need on a cold, snowy, windy day in the midst of winter? A good face moisturizer that will protect your face from drying out and crackling from the wind! This product is a facial moisturizer with some umph in it. It contains and advanced peptide trio, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid which are natural ingredients that are supposed to brighten the face and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.I had the chance to review Adeline anti-aging moisturizer during this past cold week and put it to the test. I applied the product after my shower at night time and I would say that it kept my face moisturized until the next night. It helped to prevent my skin from drying out and had a pleasant smell to it. My only complaint about the product is that it is not good for people with acne prone skin. I usually have very few pimples on my face and after using this product I had 3 pimples within a week. I think it is just a very think formulation that it may clog the pores. If acne is not a concern for you, then this product would be amazing to achieve a nice smooth and hydrated face.</li>
    <li> *Note: I was given a free sample of this product to try and review.  The first thing I liked about Adeline Anti-Aging Moisturizer was that it was creamy yet it absorbed quickly and did not leave a thick or oily feeling on my skin. I also liked that it was not overly fragrant. I am somewhat sensitive to smells and this product did not bother me at all.  I was only able to use the product for a few weeks before a review was requested so I do not know what long term effects this product would or could have, but I did not notice any negative side effects such as skin irritation, acne issues or drying out the skin as it tightens it.  Here is what I really liked about this product, when you put it on, like other anti-aging products, it has that slight tingling and it seems to tighten or rejuvenate skin that doesnâ€™t seem to have that youthful elasticity that it used to. But unlike other products it seems to last more than a few minutes. I actually caught myself touching my face several hours later to feel the difference it made.  Again, I have not been able to test the long term effects of this product so I canâ€™t confirm the anti-aging portion, however I can say that it made my face feel great and I like the product.</li>
