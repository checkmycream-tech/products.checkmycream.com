    <li> Hair feels harsh and brittle. You need to be very careful when handling the hair or it will begin to shed. Shipping was fast and packaged nicely. Only purchased to practice braiding techniques. BE CAREFUL, when COMBING!!! Can&#x27;t stress that enough!! I have also co-washed the hair to see if that would make a difference and it did not. Only gave the product two stars based on the reason for using the product. Hair quality is terrible otherwise.</li>
    <li> great for long hairstyles and hair is actually really loved this product its actually good.i recommend this you should buy it</li>
    <li> Wanted a human hair head for styling techniques and braiding.  Took advice from previous reviews and bought EMMA as opposed to the blonde due the review saying the blonde did not have a fuller looking amount of hair.  I couldn&#x27;t be any more happier than with EMMA.  The hair is long and there is a lot of it.  Color is a very, very dark brown. So I know I will enjoy styling it.</li>
    <li> Hair falls out way too much.. And it smells bad..</li>
    <li> she didi have to trim a inch or 2 of bad ends, but she has fun practicing braids &amp; bums. I wish it came w/ a stand....</li>
    <li> Love it!!  The mannequinn&#x27;s hair is perfect for cutting practice and coloring!  The hair was actually 24&amp;#34;; however, four of those inches will need to be cut.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and very satifsfied.  Received promptly and excellant price.  Purchased for my Daughter who is in cosmetology.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Claims to be 100% human hair, but there are plastic strands of hair mixed in with the human hair. I feel this is false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I think this head is a little creepy.  The real human hair leaves me wondering where the hair was sourced.  Our head had a couple of strands of gray hair.  However, my daughter saw one at my hairdresser and instantly fell in love with it.  She has been using it to practice putting makeup on the doll and braiding its hair.  The hair is easy to work with and so much nicer than those ratty Barbie heads.  You will need to buy the attachment clamp that goes from the head to the table.  I purchased one at Sally for $8.  The pole slid easily into the neck and allowed it to firmly attach it to a table.</li>
    <li> the amount of hair is very bad.. when I try to make a updo  of any sort,  I have a very hard time covering large amounts of skull.</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly but I have to say the hair is extremely thin, and I am not sure if I will be able to use it for the reason I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas present for my 12 year old daughter. She has put it though alot. Alot of heat hair dye of all colors and cut it several times. Now she has a cite pixi cut. Great price</li>
    <li> Not a bad mannequin. It&#x27;s shorter than pictured by 2 inches. Needed it for an up do demo to curl &amp; sew.</li>
    <li> This is a great product  and it matches the picture on site. I would recommend this product to everyone .</li>
    <li> Hair felt great except the ends..very fried</li>
    <li> I love this !&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new long haired head to practice on and this one is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Hair burned off when flat ironed at 230 degrees which is a low setting. Not 100% human hair. Synthetic is mixed in. Can only use it for cuts and braiding. Not good for cosmetology school.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for school. Real hair. The hair just kept falling out .</li>
    <li> Worked well enough to get stateboard licensed.</li>
    <li> but god forbid you have to color or style it. or any other chemical service. the hair wont take, or the heat will make it singe off.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t purchase this for professional practice but for my 9 year old daughter. And she loves it and uses it to practice braides. The quality is good and it&#x27;s actually scared a few people when the realize it&#x27;s fake which is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> Great Hair for styling, haircut, and thermal services training. I did not tried the chemical services yet. Her hair feels as the healthy hair, and does tangles easy. Oh, and she has a LOT of hair. I am super happy that I made this choice.</li>
    <li> Great exactly the way described reccomand this to all who want to try new techniques and style great price as we&#x27;ll defiantly worth it also arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Gave hair a bob cut, very amazing wokld recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this one for a friend currently in a beauty salon school.  She really likes it because the length of the hair is perfect and the price was right compared to others. It was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars. It is good for practice or practical testing. I did however have to cut approx. 3 inch off to even her hair out. She also came w/ a dent on the face. However.. I don&#x27;t much mind. I&#x27;m using her strictly for hair.</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews on numerous mannequins and finally decided to buy this one for my 6 yr old for Christmas last year.  She plays with it all the time and really enjoys it. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
