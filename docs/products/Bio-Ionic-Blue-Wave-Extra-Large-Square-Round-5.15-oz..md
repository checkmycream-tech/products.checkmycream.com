      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I generally agree with all the great things others have said.  </li>
      <li>; one is perfect, surprisingly so, I thought this size would only work on really long hair</li>
      <li>Leaves the hair shiny and frizz free.</li>
      <li>My hair dries faster and is silky smooth after drying and styling with this brush.</li>
      <li>Your hair comes out smooth and shinny, and it does not dig into the scalp.</li>
      <li>Really allows you to pull tension on the hair, getting a more smoother look.</li>
      <li>Drys quickly.  </li>
      <li>I read the suggestions first and thought I chose the correct size but the brush I received is huge.</li>
      <li>The brush is durable; I have had the first one for at least five years and it is still in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just right for straightening out mine.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many many round brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Bio ionic Blue Wave extra large brush is great.</li>
      <li>My daughter took my first brush like this off to college</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described.</li>
      <li>I have the two middle sizes and they work great for long hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like it isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
      <li>The handle is a fairly smooth material that gets smaller</li>
      <li>it DOES make for smoothness in my long hair, but since my hair is fine, if I roll it on the brush</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair with no natural volume.</li>
      <li>Most brushes are measured from outside of bristle to outside of bristle.</li>
      <li>I first bought the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, which is like a small, and then the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s more like a medium.  </li>
      <li>The square brush is better than my round brush for lifting hair at the roots.  </li>
      <li>I plan to use some type of soft gripping tape to make it less slippery and to build up the end of the handle.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>I have long, thick, wavy hair that requires a fair amount of tugging to work the brush from roots to end.  </li>
      <li>The measurements still aren&#x27;t clear on the site.</li>
      <li>This brush leaves hair soft and helps strengthen curls.</li>
      <li>They are soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>Item came quicker than expected and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>my slightly smaller, round bristle brush does fine on the bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was thinking of getting the 1.75&amp;#34; square, but don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
      <li>but I hope they make the actual brush sizes clearer for new customers.</li>
      <li>First off arrived smashed on both sides due to them saving postage and shoving in another product I had ordered from them.</li>
      <li>(I have the 2&amp;#34; size&amp;#34;) and hold the dryer on it, there are some slight crimps from the square edges, so it tend not to roll and hold the heat on the hair, I pull the brush through for smoothness.</li>
      <li>The odd square shape really makes blowing out my hair an easier job.</li>
      <li>I already have a Bio Ionic Blue Wave extra large square round brush and purchased another one to keep in my gym bag.  </li>

    <li> These BIo Ionic iBrushes are the best ever. Your hair comes out smooth and shinny, and it does not dig into the scalp. They are soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Works great I love it</li>
    <li> I already have a Bio Ionic Blue Wave extra large square round brush and purchased another one to keep in my gym bag.  The brush is durable; I have had the first one for at least five years and it is still in excellent condition.  It works well in styling my long hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Never will use a round brush again.</li>
    <li> This one is perfect for styling my medium length bob.  I first bought the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, which is like a small, and then the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s more like a medium.  This &amp;#34;extra large&amp;#34; one is perfect, surprisingly so, I thought this size would only work on really long hair but it&#x27;s just right for straightening out mine.  Very happy with it! (And it&#x27;s the same brand my hair stylist uses, and they know best!)</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Never tangles your hair.  Leaves the hair shiny and frizz free. Drys quickly.  Just watch price.  This brush on Amazon has been everywhere from 23+ to 12.  I grabbed two when it was the lower price.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this!</li>
    <li> This brush leaves hair soft and helps strengthen curls. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The square brush is better than my round brush for lifting hair at the roots.  I generally agree with all the great things others have said.  My only issue is the shape and material of the handle.  I have long, thick, wavy hair that requires a fair amount of tugging to work the brush from roots to end.  The handle is a fairly smooth material that gets smaller the farther you get from the bristles.  This combination means my hand is constantly slipping off the brush as I pull it through my wet hair. I plan to use some type of soft gripping tape to make it less slippery and to build up the end of the handle. Currently I use the square brush at the roots and a round brush everywhere else.</li>
    <li> I read the suggestions first and thought I chose the correct size but the brush I received is huge. The measurements still aren&#x27;t clear on the site. They were great in terms of shipping speed but I hope they make the actual brush sizes clearer for new customers.</li>
    <li> Really allows you to pull tension on the hair, getting a more smoother look.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair with no natural volume. This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. My hair doesn&#x27;t go limp and lifeless with this brush. It holds the blowout style and volume for hours without the use of sticky and hard hair sprays. Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong size and there wasn&#x27;t any instructions on how to return it. Return slip would be helpful.</li>
    <li> My daughter took my first brush like this off to college and I couldn&#x27;t live without it so had to purchase another one.  Its my hair styling staple.</li>
    <li> This is a must have brush.  My hair dries faster and is silky smooth after drying and styling with this brush.</li>
    <li> First off arrived smashed on both sides due to them saving postage and shoving in another product I had ordered from them. But otherwise I don&#x27;t think the brush was that great. I don&#x27;t know if my hair is too thick or what but it doesn&#x27;t pick up my hair to pull out while blow drying. It&#x27;s like it isn&#x27;t strong enough. Do wish it would have worked tho. Wah</li>
    <li> For starters, this isn&#x27;t a review of the brush per se, but of the size. Most brushes are measured from outside of bristle to outside of bristle. Not this brush. The size measures the column and the brushes, approx 1/2\\&quot;, are in addition to that. The brush I received was enormous. I wish I knew that before I ordered or that this information was included somewhere.</li>
    <li> I just love this brush! The odd square shape really makes blowing out my hair an easier job. I like the tapered grip. Great price!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It gives great volume to my fine hair.  I bought 2 more for friends as gifts.  Much less than the price at my salon.  Great seller, would buy from again!</li>
    <li> This brush got raves from people I know....it DOES make for smoothness in my long hair, but since my hair is fine, if I roll it on the brush (I have the 2&amp;#34; size&amp;#34;) and hold the dryer on it, there are some slight crimps from the square edges, so it tend not to roll and hold the heat on the hair, I pull the brush through for smoothness. The brush doesn&#x27;t work well for my bangs....maybe I need a smaller size for that, but my slightly smaller, round bristle brush does fine on the bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was thinking of getting the 1.75&amp;#34; square, but don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
    <li> I have tried many many round brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great all around brunch. I have the two middle sizes and they work great for long hair.</li>
    <li> Item came quicker than expected and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brush for my frizzy hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great brush, no snagging my hair while blow drying, lightweight and easy to use. Best of all, my hair is full of volume and very smooth. Very fast shipping, great seller! Will do business with again! A+++</li>
    <li> Bio ionic Blue Wave extra large brush is great. I have long semi curly hair that is cut in layers and this brush does a great job of giving me a beautiful shiny blow out. I had this brush before and got it through my hairdresser. I bought it from Amazon after my original brush broke after many years of use. Great brush, won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
