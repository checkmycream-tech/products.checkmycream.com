    <li> I really like this product, but the consistency is a bit running. However, it makes it easier to manage it and mold it into the nail shape you want because it doesn&#x27;t dry so fast. The smell of this powder is pretty good too. I got it within 1 week of purchasing it. Definitely would recommend it! 👍</li>
