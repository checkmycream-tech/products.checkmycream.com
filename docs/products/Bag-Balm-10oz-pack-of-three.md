      <li>This was introduced to me by a doctor who happened to mention it was good for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>and it is useful.</li>
      <li>My entire family and extended family and friends use it and love it.  </li>
      <li>I used this for my son  and daughter, who both had very stubborn diaper rashes that I couldn&#x27;t get to go away!</li>
      <li>If I buy something like this I definitely want it unused :)</li>
      <li>Because it really works!</li>
      <li>, I use it mostly on my feet, but sometimes all over in the winter when my skin becomes so dry.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works really well--- re-apply when needed but this stuff works like a charm to make your hands feel better in the winter time from chapped and cracking dry hands.</li>

      <li>Super moisturizing &amp; it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly what I ordered and it arrived prior to the ETA.</li>
      <li>Yes indeed it is good for dry skin, but only put a little at a time, because otherwise it leaves your skin with a coat of iggyness after it dries as it all does not get soak up by the skin.</li>
      <li>I use it on my heels, to keep them soft, as I wear sandals in the summer.</li>

    <li> I have used this product now for several years. I have diabetes and my feet become dry on the bottom. This is the best product that Have found to relieve this problem successfully.</li>
    <li> My parents use this for their hands &amp; its amazing. Super moisturizing &amp; it lasts a long time. Fast shipping by the way. Always a plus. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Bag Balm is a worthwhile product.  My hands are quite dry, but my cuticles present a particular problem.  They are tough, become calloused and sometimes catch on my garments.  I use Bag Balm at night.  In the morning my hands and cuticles are much softer.  I will say that repairing cuticles takes more time, so patience in using this product is required.  Also, the aroma of Bag Balm, while certainly not offensive, is less pleasant than some over-the-counter products.  I would highly recommend Bag Balm; it&#x27;s a terrific product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on chemo that causes side effects on my hands and feet and this is the one product that gives me relief.</li>
    <li> Great prduct at awesome price</li>
    <li> Bag balm was originally developed by Vermont dairymen to treat their cows&#x27; udders when they got chapped in the winter. I have a severe case of diabetic ulcers on my legs. Serious enough that I was once told I could lose a leg. Bag balm has done wonders to treat them. I ended up in the hospital with an infection. IV antibiotics and Unna boots brought them under control and now I use bag balm whenever I get another outbreak at home since I can&#x27;t put the unna boots on by myself. BTW...I&#x27;ve seen a lot of doctors. Over half of them pretend they have never heard of these old remedies. The drug company salesmen pressure them to use the latest product even though it may not be as good. Doctors seemed afraid to prescribe to their patients a product that is sold in feed and grain stores. The three pack is a good bargain but if you use a lot of it and have access to a feed and grain store you can save even more by buying it in 5 gallon buckets.</li>
    <li> Firstly, it is not colorless.  It does not work for my skin condition; it dries it out.  However, my wife loves it for her heel.  I am a little hesitant to use a product for animals in my skin.</li>
    <li> it is always good to have this at home around when getting cut. my husband likes it so much and it is useful.</li>
    <li> Good product that cannot be found locally</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! But what I had a problem with is that one container was opened with a fingerfull missing. If I buy something like this I definitely want it unused :)</li>
    <li> This balm is healing and does a fantastic job  with cracked, dry skin. It smells medicinal, so I just add a drop or two of essential oil, and that does the trick. Best ever!</li>
    <li> I love this balm. It is the best thing I have used for my dry, cracked heels.</li>
    <li> Bag balm always does the job.  We use this for our hands for cracks and general dryness.</li>
    <li> This product works great especially for gardening hands.  Many care takers use this in the homes for elderly patients with</li>
    <li> It puts a bit of a protective barrier on your hands as well as softening.  Great for those hurting cracks on hands.  If you get to much on all you have to do if wipe with a paper towel and your hands still feel protected but not greasy.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you wear sandals a lot due to problems with foot circulation,&lt;br /&gt;you will love this product as once a week applied, it will keep&lt;br /&gt;the skin on the feet from cracking.</li>
    <li> Our family has used this antiseptic ointment for two generations.  When the children crashed on a bicycle and had dirt or small gravel bits stuck in the skin, putting ointment on and covering with a loose bandage drew all the harmful stuff out. My brother in law used it for sore muscles. In the winter when my feet get dry I smooth on Bag Balm and wear a pair of socks to bed. Amazing Stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a Registered Nurse and I became acquainted with Bag Balm over twenty years ago while working in a wound clinic.  They were advising the diabetic patients to use this product on their feet because of its ability to soften skin so well.  Diabetics are notorious with dry cracking skin that often results in infection and even further problems.  A few years later while working in the Home Health system, we used bag balm on our bed bound patients and elderly patients because their skin would get so dry, often tear, start infection and get bed sores.  Bag balm went a long way to preventing this.  My entire family and extended family and friends use it and love it.  My cousin who does construction work and his hands often are cracking, dry, full of calluses, and even bleeding.  He says just putting it on is so soothing.  I am a diabetic as well, I use it mostly on my feet, but sometimes all over in the winter when my skin becomes so dry.  Anyone with delicate, dry or cracking skin will love this.  It is a little greasy, but I can put up with that compared to not using it.</li>
    <li> This really works. It can be used to make skin smooth and gets rid of cracks on the feet.</li>

    <li> wonderful product and will always use this!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff and finally at a reasonable price !!  Used to be $3/can, went up to $20/can when all hell broke lose in 2008/09 &amp; the corporate robber barons had control of the country and still do.  But that&#x27;s political...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it for dry hands in brutal cold wintry weather and handling paper products all day long.  Love it and have bought it for over 20 yrs.  Gramps used it back when and turned me onto it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is great to keep your hands moisturized!! Especially in the winter! This stuff works really well--- re-apply when needed but this stuff works like a charm to make your hands feel better in the winter time from chapped and cracking dry hands.</li>
    <li> Use this product for humans, and animals and love love love it. Heals and works quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my hands during winter forever. Heals chapping, cuts etc. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff always works,, treats and heals up many, rash, cuts, saddle rash, and so on. It has bin around a long time. Cary a small box for the long trail , it will save you.</li>
    <li> I used this for my son  and daughter, who both had very stubborn diaper rashes that I couldn&#x27;t get to go away!</li>
    <li> Because it really works! I gave it as Christmas gifts because I liked it so much and the people I gave it too liked it. The only thing is you have to watch because it is greasy.</li>
    <li> We received exactly what we expected. Three 10 oz tins of bag balm.  I love bag balm for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash.  It works every time.  It&#x27;s awesome stuff!  Even the worst rashes disappear soon after we use it.</li>
    <li> Bag Balm is a very useful product. I use it after I have done a long bike ride it helps with the chafing. It also helps heal open sores or cuts. It also helps dry hands.</li>
    <li> I really, really love this ointment!  A friend recommended it to me for small cuts and dry patches of skin (I have been diagnosed with psoriasis and eczema and have dry patches of skin; sometimes it gets really bad, especially in the Winter months).  I use this at night just before bed and also sometimes during the day.  It does not feel greasy to me and it does help my dry skin condition.  I would HIGHLY recommend this ointment to anyone!</li>
    <li> My husband uses bag balm on his hands when they are dry or chapped, or have little nicks from pruning bushes. A  little bit of Bag Balm goes a long way; the next morning, his hands don&#x27;t hurt, and they are smooth again. I use it on my heels, to keep them soft, as I wear sandals in the summer.It is a wonderful emollient. Even for paper cuts- they heal quickly, and Bag Balm makes them feel better.</li>
    <li> Great Foot care medicine</li>
    <li> As a dedicated bicyclist I&#x27;m one who re-purposed this bovine product.  Technically not for human use, it works well for those delicate areas of a cyclists anatomy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Only takes a small amount, so I would not purchase a pack of 3 again.  One will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This was introduced to me by a doctor who happened to mention it was good for dry skin.  Yes indeed it is good for dry skin, but only put a little at a time, because otherwise it leaves your skin with a coat of iggyness after it dries as it all does not get soak up by the skin. Real good for dry chafing skin.</li>
    <li> for every skin issue - this works</li>
    <li> We have used this balm for years.  My husband likes it for his dry hands in the winter.</li>
