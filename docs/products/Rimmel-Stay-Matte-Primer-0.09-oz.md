      <li>I have tried every kind of primer there is out there.</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth purchasing if you have troubles fighting oily skin!!!</li>
      <li>My face was still incredibly oily and it didnt really help my makeup stay put either.</li>
      <li>Best primer I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
      <li>I have been on the hunt for a good primer that will keep me shine free all day.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, nothing I&#x27;ve used had been able to preserve my makeup all day including this primer.</li>
      <li>Just pony up the cash and buy a better quality primer.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and stock up on it whenever i can get my hands on it.</li>
      <li>Its just OK, but does take some sheen off your face.</li>
      <li>Stick primers work better on the eyes than any bottle primer.</li>
      <li>Just simply okay.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>But i love this primer.</li>
      <li>and I like this way better.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores up and makes my face look better even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup on top.</li>
      <li>off anymore :)</li>
      <li>Also this formula does not keep me matte around my nostrils where I need it the most.</li>
      <li>It works okay-</li>
      <li>i need better matte primer.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s definitely in my top five.</li>

      <li>Love this product better than many high end primers.</li>
      <li>This is an easy, accessible, and affordable primer for beginners in makeup.</li>
      <li>Light on my face.</li>
      <li>I like how it reduces the size of my pores and it&#x27;s consistency is silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I finally settled on the Photoready primer from Revlon, but after years of use found it wasn&#x27;t performing as well as I would have liked, especially during the summer months, and for $14 I wanted something that was perfect.  </li>
      <li>and it fortunately does not irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>I apply this primer on top of a gel moisturizer (currently the Morning Burst one from Clean and Clear, which is awesome) and then apply my Colorstay Foundation for oily/combination skin from Revlon,</li>
      <li>Best primer i&#x27;ve ever used and i&#x27;ve spent a pretty penny on primer....</li>
      <li>make up, I can easily apply right away.</li>
      <li>this does not work for my super oily skin.</li>
      <li>I have super oily skin</li>
      <li>To me, that&#x27;s pretty darn good, especially with a drugstore primer.</li>
      <li>it did everything a primer is suppose to do plus helped with my oily spots not be so recognizable!</li>
      <li>After using it several times, I was happy to have discovered my new HG primer.    </li>
      <li>This primer is white and opaque, looks like a lotion, and soaks in rather nicely.</li>
      <li>When paired with my Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream, it makes me look cakey.</li>
      <li>Although this is the very first primer i&#x27;ve used, it does exactly what it claims.</li>
      <li>I apply before  I put on my makeup  no more great look ,it works well.</li>
      <li>I have large pores, oily skin, and mild acne along my cheeks and jawline.  </li>
      <li>I love this because it actually works.</li>
      <li>This product is the first that has kept the makeup from dissipating on my skin.</li>
      <li>So far this primer has been fantastic.</li>
      <li>I first purchased the Neutrogena version of shine control matte primer, and it did</li>
      <li>I love that it is in a squeeze tube so that every last drop can be used.    </li>
      <li>Living in Texas where it&#x27;s super hot in the summer, I don&#x27;t expect matte products to stay completely matte with the heat due to sweating and stuff, but this one has held up pretty nicely</li>
      <li>Where as porefessional really does minimize my pores, it makes me oily and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup stay on any longer and the mabelline primer did absolutely nothing for me but break me out.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t notice much of a difference at all when I wear it as opposed to when I do not.</li>
      <li>I applied my regular cream foundation (Covergirl Aquasmooth) and finished with a Maybelline shine free powder.</li>
      <li>but when rubbing it in it was very gritty and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I was very disapointed in this product i threw it out after using it for a week.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>I really do think it helps keep my foundation set and in place.</li>
      <li>im ready to give it away</li>
      <li>I have tried several primers and haven&#x27;t liked any of them well enough to repurchase until this one.</li>
      <li>Stay Matte Powder from Rimmel, and Studio High Definition Powder from e.l.f.</li>
      <li>It left my face super soft and was very lightweight.</li>
      <li>It works great through out the day, but I still get a little shiny and nothing a little powder can&#x27;t solve.</li>
      <li>I get nervous using new products because I have combination skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as nice as the higher end one, but then again it&#x27;s not as expensive</li>
      <li>16 yr old girl</li>
      <li>I am in my early 20s now</li>
      <li>, that is adult acne prone.</li>
      <li>I have tried benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;Porefessional&amp;#34; primer along with mabellines &amp;#34;baby skin&amp;#34; primer and they both don&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.</li>
      <li>Having used MUFE&#x27;s primer (costs nearly $40) and Bare Minerals Prime Time among others, Rimmel&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
      <li>I only have to use a small amount of this and it keeps me shine free all day</li>

<li> I &#x27;ve worn my bare minerals foundation with and with out this one.</li>
<li> It goes on smooth and I don&#x27;t have to wait an unnecessary amount of time to apply foundation and other facial</li>
<li> Putting my makeup on with this primer as a base makes a huge difference, since my face tends to get really oily during the day especially in the T zone.</li>
<li> This review is long overdue.    </li>
<li> Not sure why i bought a matte primer when I have normal skin.</li>
<li> Not only does my makeup stay in place all day while i&#x27;m sweating at work (Bartender), but my skin seems to feel a lot less oily throughout the day and especially in the evening.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t spend an extra 6 bucks on shipping, the product is not worth that price.</li>
<li> The consistency of this primer is slightly thicker than others I&#x27;ve tried (it&#x27;s a white cream)</li>
<li> and it has kept my skin matte all day long, and my skin is extremely oily.</li>
<li> I use liquid foundations, I sometimes use a foundation brush, beauty blender sponge, or just my fingers to rub in depending which of m foundations I will use that day) and when I would rub any foundation in, I could still feel the grittiness and little tiny sandpaper like bumps</li>
<li> I would rather pay the extra money and get my money&#x27;s worth than buy a cheaper product and be unhappy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for at least half a year and have not noticed any new breakouts or worsening in my skin.  </li>
<li> I have extremely oily skin .</li>
<li> Only complaint is I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell</li>
<li> not worth $8.99 at all, should be atlest $5</li>
<li> and although my skin is significantly less oily than it was when I was a teenager, I still have to be mindful about what products I put on my face.  </li>
<li> from this line, and at half the price of the Revlon primer (it&#x27;s about $6 in stores)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;m usually shiny an hour or two after putting on makeup but after using this it kept my face matte all day.</li>
    <li> A+++++primer.  Great coverage, non-drying.  The best primer of them all because of 1.  Ease applying, 2. Covers flaws and wrinkles, 3. Lasts all day, 4.  Perfect balance between moisture/dry .  I have tried expensive primers that cost 3 to 4 times more than this and none can compare with the results of this primer.</li>
    <li> Light on my face. 100% perfect!</li>
    <li> I mix this with my foundation to give me a matted look.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOVE this stuff. Although this is the very first primer i&#x27;ve used, it does exactly what it claims. Putting my makeup on with this primer as a base makes a huge difference, since my face tends to get really oily during the day especially in the T zone. It also does wonders in hiding pores. I would def buy this again</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve worn my bare minerals foundation with and with out this one. I really do think it helps keep my foundation set and in place. It&#x27;s not as nice as the higher end one, but then again it&#x27;s not as expensive, it gets the job done. It&#x27;s alright. Not the best, not the worst. Just simply okay.</li>
    <li> I like how it reduces the size of my pores and it&#x27;s consistency is silky smooth. It works great through out the day, but I still get a little shiny and nothing a little powder can&#x27;t solve.</li>
    <li> This primer does help to keep my foundation on but the results are not remarkable. In my experience the Rimmel Stay Matte Primer was a challenge to blend. I have no intention of repurchasing this in the future. Also this formula does not keep me matte around my nostrils where I need it the most.</li>
    <li> Love this product better than many high end primers.</li>
    <li> I love this because it actually works. I have extremely oily skin . I only have to use a small amount of this and it keeps me shine free all day</li>
    <li> It does what it claims to do...I use it every day and it does make my make up easier to apply and helps it stay in place throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I went from using the Benefit Porefessional to this and I like this way better. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores up and makes my face look better even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup on top. Keeps my makeup looking great and matte all day. Only complaint is I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of my money...</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Neutrogena version of shine control matte primer, and it did it&#x27;s job but when rubbing it in it was very gritty and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling smooth. Then I would always have to wait like 10 minutes to put any foundation on (note: I use liquid foundations, I sometimes use a foundation brush, beauty blender sponge, or just my fingers to rub in depending which of m foundations I will use that day) and when I would rub any foundation in, I could still feel the grittiness and little tiny sandpaper like bumps and it drove me crazy. Like I said, the Neutrogena product did last, but was just annoying. So I went to Target and bought this. I love it. It goes on smooth and I don&#x27;t have to wait an unnecessary amount of time to apply foundation and other facial make up, I can easily apply right away. Living in Texas where it&#x27;s super hot in the summer, I don&#x27;t expect matte products to stay completely matte with the heat due to sweating and stuff, but this one has held up pretty nicely and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to dab my &amp;#34;face shine&amp;#34; off anymore :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous primers from smash box to maybelline to nars and I&#x27;ve got to say i think this one tops them. It has no smell to it, it comes out white but doesn&#x27;t leave a white tint like some do. It left my face super soft and was very lightweight. it did everything a primer is suppose to do plus helped with my oily spots not be so recognizable!</li>
    <li> I have tried several primers and haven&#x27;t liked any of them well enough to repurchase until this one. What turned me off from all other primers I&#x27;ve tried is the slick, greasy feeling my face takes on. Furthermore, nothing I&#x27;ve used had been able to preserve my makeup all day including this primer. That being said, I am still impressed with this. I get nervous using new products because I have combination skin, that is adult acne prone. This primer is white and opaque, looks like a lotion, and soaks in rather nicely. I applied my regular cream foundation (Covergirl Aquasmooth) and finished with a Maybelline shine free powder. I was matte for a good 6 hours, and touched up with powder once. To me, that&#x27;s pretty darn good, especially with a drugstore primer. Having used MUFE&#x27;s primer (costs nearly $40) and Bare Minerals Prime Time among others, Rimmel&lt;br /&gt;Stay Matte is still my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have two tube at walgreens, they were buy 1 get one at 50% off. this does not work for my super oily skin. Once i add my foundation forget it, it feels like my face is melting. im ready to give it away i need better matte primer.</li>
    <li> Because of my oily skin, I have trouble with makeup staying on my face. This product is the first that has kept the makeup from dissipating on my skin. I recommend it for women with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a good primer that will keep me shine free all day. I have used this foundation once and I am really impressed. I applied my make up in the morning and spend 8 hours in Disneyland and got home to realize I was not shine at all. I have tried every kind of primer there is out there. From Laura Mercier to Benefits or Loreal, nothing gave me the feeling of not needing to retouch my make up in a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Not sure why i bought a matte primer when I have normal skin. I guess i watch too many oily youtubers, lol! But i love this primer. When paired with my Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream, it makes me look cakey. But with my Maybelline Matte Mousse, lordddd, match made in heaven! GREAT for the summer  months. I would look up a size comparison before purchasing, as I always do.</li>
    <li> came in 4 days but took a while to prepare to ship, its so small. not worth $8.99 at all, should be atlest $5</li>
    <li> You get this at a Longs Drug Store for under 10 bucks. Its just OK, but does take some sheen off your face. Don&#x27;t spend an extra 6 bucks on shipping, the product is not worth that price. Make up is difficult to apply over it.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and I could not find anything that could keep my skin balanced. I have tried Mac and other expensive products and none of them worked. I have a miracle in a tube. This keeps my skin balanced all day, even when I am using a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Best primer i&#x27;ve ever used and i&#x27;ve spent a pretty penny on primer....Gives a beautiful matte finish, you will look photoshopped. I love this stuff and stock up on it whenever i can get my hands on it. Ulta sells it for $4.99 and has been sold out the last FOUR times i&#x27;ve been in there. Literally flies off the shelf.</li>
    <li> I got this for my kit as I&#x27;m taking makeup artistry classes. On several occasions I&#x27;ve seen this primer react badly with different foundations, causing a curdling effect. It looks like the skin is peeling and blotchy. I read the ingredients and it turns out it contains talc. No wonder. Just pony up the cash and buy a better quality primer. This was a waste of $5.</li>
    <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve tried so far, it&#x27;s definitely in my top five. I am an african American 16 yr old girl and I have superrrr oily skin and it&#x27;s crazy when I&#x27;m in school.  I&#x27;m there for nine hours and this primer doesn&#x27;t make my face seem oily. Just perfect ðŸ‘Œ</li>
    <li> I was very disapointed in this product i threw it out after using it for a week. My face was still incredibly oily and it didnt really help my makeup stay put either. Junk.</li>
    <li> it is o.k. a little greasy under make up</li>
    <li> This is an easy, accessible, and affordable primer for beginners in makeup. But, I would only recommend this primer to be used as a face primer. Stick primers work better on the eyes than any bottle primer.</li>
    <li> It works okay- I have super oily skin and I really don&#x27;t notice much of a difference at all when I wear it as opposed to when I do not. I would rather pay the extra money and get my money&#x27;s worth than buy a cheaper product and be unhappy.</li>
    <li> I have tried benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;Porefessional&amp;#34; primer along with mabellines &amp;#34;baby skin&amp;#34; primer and they both don&#x27;t work nearly as well as this. I decided to give it a try (only around $6 at Target!) and it has kept my skin matte all day long, and my skin is extremely oily. Needless to say, it has also kept my makeup on all day as well. Where as porefessional really does minimize my pores, it makes me oily and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup stay on any longer and the mabelline primer did absolutely nothing for me but break me out. This is definitely worth purchasing if you have troubles fighting oily skin!!!</li>
    <li> So far this primer has been fantastic. Not only does my makeup stay in place all day while i&#x27;m sweating at work (Bartender), but my skin seems to feel a lot less oily throughout the day and especially in the evening. excellent cheap primer</li>
    <li> I apply before  I put on my makeup  no more great look ,it works well.</li>
    <li> This review is long overdue.    I have tried primers from just about every drugstore brand: Covergirl, NYC, e.l.f., Neutrogena, and Hard Candy.  I finally settled on the Photoready primer from Revlon, but after years of use found it wasn&#x27;t performing as well as I would have liked, especially during the summer months, and for $14 I wanted something that was perfect.  I came across this primer from Rimmel in a Beall&#x27;s Outlet store and decided to give it a try.  I was impressed with both the Stay Matte Whipped Mousse Foundation and Powder (my HG!) from this line, and at half the price of the Revlon primer (it&#x27;s about $6 in stores) I thought there was little to lose.  After using it several times, I was happy to have discovered my new HG primer.    I have large pores, oily skin, and mild acne along my cheeks and jawline.  I&#x27;ve been using this primer for at least half a year and have not noticed any new breakouts or worsening in my skin.  As for oil production, this product controls it for an entire day!  No longer do I have to carry around blotting sheets or a compact.  I apply this primer on top of a gel moisturizer (currently the Morning Burst one from Clean and Clear, which is awesome) and then apply my Colorstay Foundation for oily/combination skin from Revlon, Stay Matte Powder from Rimmel, and Studio High Definition Powder from e.l.f. and my makeup stays put all day.  No oil or greasiness breaks through at all.  The consistency of this primer is slightly thicker than others I&#x27;ve tried (it&#x27;s a white cream) but it spreads easily and applies smoothly.  I love that it is in a squeeze tube so that every last drop can be used.    I am in my early 20s now and although my skin is significantly less oily than it was when I was a teenager, I still have to be mindful about what products I put on my face.  I&#x27;ve found that this primer is the best one at controlling oil all day and it fortunately does not irritate my skin.  It is one of the cheaper drugstore primers on the market, and I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a quality primer for oily skin.</li>
