### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best out of the Peter Roth sunscreen powders.</li>
      <li>so beware if you have very fair, porcelain skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned with freckles and need a touch-up midday before going out to lunch, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because you can put it over your makeup and no one can see it, so you can keep reapplying it throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for maintaining a photo-perfect matte complexion while preventing sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this!!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t mind it like the cream sunscreen and it helps me be better about keeping them protected even when just driving in the car!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best SPF items out there because it&#x27;s all minerals, which means I won&#x27;t break out, easy to use and travel with</li>
      <li>This stuff is so good.</li>
      <li>This is really good stuff.</li>
      <li>The concept in this product is good, SPF in the form of powder so you can reapply your SPF during the day in case you can&#x27;t redo your makeup, but I don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like putting on powder over your makeup, except it&#x27;s actually good for your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS SPF!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since bought one from Colorescience that is really nice.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Be sure not to breathe in as you apply it, or you&#x27;ll be applying sunscreen to the inside of your lungs, lol.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but most of the time this is all I need.</li>
      <li>I do prefer the SPF 30 as it turns out, because it is much more transparent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would I use it in the tropics for more than a touch up to my SPF 80?</li>
      <li>love love love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Feel better knowing it&#x27;s SPF</li>
      <li>Quality is great, not too much smell, and so easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping this product would work, and be a good way to touch up on my sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to bring along.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry with me, and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply which encourages the use of SPF skincare.</li>
      <li>Easy to reapply when need arises.</li>
      <li>The color is just too strong.  </li>
      <li>, I always carry this in my cosmetic bag, good for sensitive skin, and you can apply it easily (ears, neck, face, shoulders).</li>
      <li>But instead, the product exploded all over my car and caused a huge hassle.</li>
      <li>so I apply it over my sunscreen lotion for a smooth matte finish.  </li>
      <li>I love that you can apply it right over your make up throughout the day.</li>
      <li>easy to use, compact and makes your face look good, that you forget its actually protecting your skin.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed in the coverage</li>
      <li>As professional gardeners, my husband and I always keep this effective, yet light feeling sunblock on hand.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got fair skin and sandy blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Much lower price at Amazon for sure than Sephora.  </li>
      <li>So I contacted the seller and after explaining what happened, they quickly replaced the item.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super bummed.</li>
      <li>Definitely not transparent on fair skin; pretty makeup-y looking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply once you figure out how it works, and it looks fantastic-no more greasy white face.</li>
      <li>If only I could remember to use it more often</li>
      <li>I can put this powdered sunblock on top of that for extra protection, and reapply the powder throughout the day with no greasy feel.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years and continue to be satisfied with the look and protection it gives to my face and neck.</li>
      <li>so I had to order a second tube for him :)</li>
      <li>I got too much on this the first time I used it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey for something that comes off pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I love this product and use if every single day.  </li>
      <li>This translucent powder is really really brown/yellow.  </li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>I really like these powders by PTR.</li>
      <li>It was very tan and a lot of orange under tones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a powdered sunscreen that really works.  </li>
      <li>If you are pale this is not something that will look good or natural.  </li>
      <li>Love that this has SPF without the greasy, non-breathable feel that other sunscreens have.  </li>
      <li>Great color, but very little actual bronzer</li>
      <li>The only thing is, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean the brush...</li>
      <li>The tint is very natural and it&#x27;s very matte.</li>
      <li>It has a little color and people are always complementing me on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
      <li>this would be a great product, but the packaging is all wrong.</li>
      <li>It works okay as long as you constantly reapply.</li>
      <li>cause its easy to waste it</li>
      <li>the 2nd time i used it and went to close it, the whole bottom came off and all of the powder spilled into the floor.</li>
      <li>I recommend it as a back-up sunscreen for those times when you didn&#x27;t expect to be out in the sun for a long period of time or for people with oily skin who break out from normal sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I REALLY didn&#x27;t want to believe the other reviews about the color of this.</li>
      <li>At least if you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you can always get a full refund from them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this!! It&#x27;s easy to apply once you figure out how it works, and it looks fantastic-no more greasy white face. It&#x27;s like putting on powder over your makeup, except it&#x27;s actually good for your skin. Be sure not to breathe in as you apply it, or you&#x27;ll be applying sunscreen to the inside of your lungs, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without this in my purse. The tint is very natural and it&#x27;s very matte.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry with me, and easy to apply. If only I could remember to use it more often</li>
    <li> 1st.  I like this brush.  I feel like I can see the powder actually on my face.  I know some people say they see the powder flying - well I like that.  At least I know something&#x27;s coming out, which is my problem with some of the other sunblock powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd.  I had the issue of the powder spreading all over my bathroom.  I realized that the reason for this is that I kept twisting the bottle instead of just pulling.  If you twist (like the sticker tells you NOT to do) then the bottom of the cylinder gets unscrewed and all the powder flies out.  Anyway, this happened to me.  So I contacted the seller and after explaining what happened, they quickly replaced the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have pale sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good. You can bring it anywhere (no issue with TSA!) and it really works. I only wish they had a version for the body so you could apply to larger areas.</li>
    <li> Much lower price at Amazon for sure than Sephora.  Quality is great, not too much smell, and so easy to apply.  My girl stated use this one, too.</li>
    <li> I wear a cream-based sunscreen that I apply in the a.m.  I can put this powdered sunblock on top of that for extra protection, and reapply the powder throughout the day with no greasy feel.  It has a little color and people are always complementing me on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
    <li> This item came in just bubble wrap looking used. There was no plastic seal and some of the powder had spilled out. If you&#x27;re looking to save a few extra dollars rather than ordering from Sephora, just get the real deal from Sephora. At least if you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you can always get a full refund from them. Do not buy from this seller!</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth by Peter Thomas Roth Instant Mineral Powder SPF 45... The concept in this product is good, SPF in the form of powder so you can reapply your SPF during the day in case you can&#x27;t redo your makeup, but I don&#x27;t know if it works, I think it looks a bit cakey, I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> This was meant to be a birthday present. It showed up today completely filthy with no packaging and very used looking. I&#x27;m scared to use it even. Definitely do not recommend this seller, but I can not comment on the product its self. Super bummed.</li>
    <li> Love that this has SPF without the greasy, non-breathable feel that other sunscreens have.  The powder has an orange-ish tint, but it goes on sheer and looks invisible.  I just use smashbox primer and this as my go to daytime makeup!</li>
    <li> I was not disappointed in the coverage and I like the fact it has sunscreen for extra protection.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> this would be a great product, but the packaging is all wrong. the 2nd time i used it and went to close it, the whole bottom came off and all of the powder spilled into the floor. $30 down the drain! it&#x27;s not transparent either, so beware if you have very fair, porcelain skin.</li>
    <li> love love love this stuff.  SPF 45 sunscreen without that greasy feeling or shiny skin!  My husband kept stealing it so I had to order a second tube for him :)&lt;br /&gt;Would I use it in the tropics for more than a touch up to my SPF 80? No, but most of the time this is all I need.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I keep it in my purse and use it on my kids before going anywhere!! They don&#x27;t mind it like the cream sunscreen and it helps me be better about keeping them protected even when just driving in the car!!</li>
    <li> Great color, but very little actual bronzer</li>
    <li> Be warned, this is definitely not a translucent powder, and arrived to me in what appeared to be used condition, with lots of brown powder spilled into the cap. Additionally, I just checked the ingredients, and turns out this item contains retinyl palmitate, which they advertise as being beneficial vitamin A, but which if you do some research you&#x27;ll find is terrible for your skin when used under the sun. Seriously a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a powdered sunscreen that really works.  It&#x27;s great because you can put it over your makeup and no one can see it, so you can keep reapplying it throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Best out of the Peter Roth sunscreen powders.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SPF! It&#x27;s one of the best SPF items out there because it&#x27;s all minerals, which means I won&#x27;t break out, easy to use and travel with, I always carry this in my cosmetic bag, good for sensitive skin, and you can apply it easily (ears, neck, face, shoulders).</li>
    <li> This was sent to be spilled all over the box, seemed used and dirty.</li>
    <li> easy to use, compact and makes your face look good, that you forget its actually protecting your skin. just be a bit careful cause its easy to waste it</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff. I love that you can apply it right over your make up throughout the day. It isn&#x27;t greasy or smelly.  It is very easy to use.  And it WORKS.</li>
    <li> Like this mineral powder a lot.  Feel better knowing it&#x27;s SPF 45 also!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd order.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use if every single day.  I&#x27;m concerned about sun exposure so I apply it over my sunscreen lotion for a smooth matte finish.  The only thing is, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean the brush...</li>
    <li> I really like these powders by PTR. I&#x27;m very fair skinned with freckles and need a touch-up midday before going out to lunch, etc. I do prefer the SPF 30 as it turns out, because it is much more transparent. I got too much on this the first time I used it and I got powder all over my face and had to take it off with a Kleenex. Definitely not transparent on fair skin; pretty makeup-y looking.</li>
    <li> I REALLY didn&#x27;t want to believe the other reviews about the color of this. I had a previous version that was totally translucent. This is NOT. I&#x27;ve got fair skin and sandy blonde hair. It was very tan and a lot of orange under tones. I had to give it away. I&#x27;ve since bought one from Colorescience that is really nice.</li>
    <li> As professional gardeners, my husband and I always keep this effective, yet light feeling sunblock on hand.  Easy to reapply when need arises.</li>
    <li> Meh. It works okay as long as you constantly reapply. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for something that comes off pretty fast. And you seem to need to use this with a face sunscreen anyway, or it&#x27;s not entirely effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and I consider it an essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to it while I was a performer at a renaissance faire, where we spend all day in the sun and get photographed constantly. It&#x27;s great for maintaining a photo-perfect matte complexion while preventing sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit hard to get started and there&#x27;s a potential for messy accidents if you twist the tube instead of pulling to retract the brush. This, in addition to the price, is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day after applying makeup.  It is easy to apply which encourages the use of SPF skincare.I have been using this product for several years and continue to be satisfied with the look and protection it gives to my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted a sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t messy that I could carry in my purse in case of emergencies.  It&#x27;s also the only sunscreen I can get my husband to wear when we go hiking.  It&#x27;s not greasy and since he has oily skin and isn&#x27;t visible once applied, he tolerates it well.  I recommend it as a back-up sunscreen for those times when you didn&#x27;t expect to be out in the sun for a long period of time or for people with oily skin who break out from normal sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I found this mineral powder when I was looking for sunscreen for my scalp.  I remember to sunscreen everything except my part and always end up with a sunburned scalp.  The other liquid products leave my hair greasy/oily or looking odd.  This way I can just put the powder on and not worry.  Haven&#x27;t had a sunburn yet.  The only thing I dislike is the dispenser.  It will come pouring out occasionally or I have to practically pound it to get some out.  It&#x27;s compact and easy to bring along.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this product would work, and be a good way to touch up on my sunscreen. But instead, the product exploded all over my car and caused a huge hassle. Not happy.</li>
    <li> This translucent powder is really really brown/yellow.  If you are pale this is not something that will look good or natural.  The color is just too strong.  I bought this to to prevent me turning into a tomato instead when I put it on I turned into a potato. :(</li>
