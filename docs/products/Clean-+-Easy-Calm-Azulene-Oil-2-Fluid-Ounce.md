      <li>Azulene oil is a penetrating and not greasy oil famous to prepare the derm and to calm and hydrate it before and after epilation.</li>
      <li>time I bought this oil on Amazon because it was a great deal, but I deplore they do not have it in bigger bottles.</li>
      <li>Easy and cheap solution to mild acne.</li>
      <li>And very fresh in its bright blue container!</li>

      <li>Recently, I have been unable to find it in the Beauty Supply stores I use, so I am very happy to now have a good supply.</li>
      <li>the price was better than most other brands.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t make my skin breakout when I put it on right after waxing.</li>
      <li>Found and bought this, and it&#x27;s exactly right.  </li>
      <li>The seller was available and professional.</li>
      <li>you guys :&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>and i will buy more to take care all my needs in the future</li>
      <li>good but too small for the price</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it really does get rid of left over wax after I finishing waxing.</li>
      <li>It also makes you skin fell smooth and silky for several days.</li>
      <li>It also does not make me break out (and I have very irritable skin).</li>
      <li>This azulene oil is very soothing.</li>
      <li>Did not get to use it too much for after epilation.</li>
      <li>and it was very soothing to my face.</li>
      <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>

      <li>As a Beauty Professional, I depend on it for after waxing care.</li>
      <li>I first used the little bottle that came with some hair removal strips.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super annoying, so be sure and put it in a ziplock if you travel with it.</li>

<li> The tweezer left little bumps on my face after peach fuzz removal.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> and I use it as an additive to other products that need a soothing element.</li>
<li> Just pour a little bit in your hands and mass the skin.</li>
<li> I applied a little dab of Azulene Oil to a cotton ball then applied it to my face</li>
<li> After epilation, pour a little bit on a cotton to get rid of the wax traces on your skin.</li>
<li> However, by using just a little bit of this product afterwards, the irritation and redness is kept to a minimum.</li>
<li> I ordered this to replace the little bottle that comes with a Parissa waxing kit.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t rub my skin raw, trying to remove the rest of the residue.</li>
<li> Have used this oil for several years now, but difficult to buy in retail outets.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find azulene oil in stores.</li>

    <li> Perfect wax remover ...</li>
    <li> this stuff smells nice but it made my skin scaly. Im switching back to extra virgin olive oil, works better as a wax remover &amp; is much cheaper</li>
    <li> Controlled top so it doesn&#x27;t all pour out at once, calms skin quickly, smells great and ships fast. Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for soothing and getting excess wax off after waxing. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I use this oil to remove sticky residue from my skin patches.  I first used the little bottle that came with some hair removal strips.  Worked so well, I searched for the oil itself online.  Found and bought this, and it&#x27;s exactly right.  Works like a charm so I don&#x27;t rub my skin raw, trying to remove the rest of the residue.</li>
    <li> I used it after using the Emjoi Tweezer that I also ordered from Amazon (also recommend that product as well) . The tweezer left little bumps on my face after peach fuzz removal. I applied a little dab of Azulene Oil to a cotton ball then applied it to my face and it was very soothing to my face. I also love the way it smells and would recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin or irritated after any type of hair removal.</li>
    <li> I love this product. As a Beauty Professional, I depend on it for after waxing care. Recently, I have been unable to find it in the Beauty Supply stores I use, so I am very happy to now have a good supply.</li>

    <li> This azulene oil is very soothing. It is a great way to remove wax residue comfortably. I like the larger size bottle and the price was better than most other brands.</li>
    <li> The item is great the seller did a great job thank you</li>
    <li> Good for soothing irritated skin.  Helps reduce acne if you apply it after you shower/wash and before bed.  Easy and cheap solution to mild acne.</li>
    <li> This oil looks amazing, smells amazing, and works very well. It also does not make me break out (and I have very irritable skin). Calms your skin instantly!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I wanted a larger size so I purchased this item.  I like the way it removes any wax residue after a waxing.  It also makes you skin fell smooth and silky for several days.</li>
    <li> this product does the job and i will buy more to take care all my needs in the future&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>

    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT FOR AFTER WAXING</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. It&#x27;s what you want to have on hand to revitalize and comfort you skin. Nice big size at a doable price.</li>
    <li> The seller was available and professional. Good product, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This removes excess wax very easily, as well as providing a soothing touch after waxing underarms.</li>

    <li> Have used this oil for several years now, but difficult to buy in retail outets.  Very good calming oil.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove wax after a service. Calms the skin too!</li>
    <li> Amazing, should everyone get it without hesitation!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you guys :&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for my mother. she likes it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find azulene oil in stores. I am so glad that I found it on Amazon. This is the best thing to use after waxing (especially on areas such as the face). If I don&#x27;t apply azulene oil after waxing, my skin gets horribly red. However, by using just a little bit of this product afterwards, the irritation and redness is kept to a minimum. Great product!</li>
    <li> These things last forever! I use them for shaving bumps and while they don&#x27;t fix everything, they are the best thing i have found. Be careful though - they stain clothing / toilet seats really easily. Also, every single one of them leaks from the cap. It&#x27;s super annoying, so be sure and put it in a ziplock if you travel with it.</li>
    <li> This arrived very quickly, in good condition. And very fresh in its bright blue container!</li>
    <li> I have used the Azulene oil that comes with sally hansen wax which was great always. This was looks and feels like that one but the results aren&#x27;t the same. I use it after my laser treatments, but it does not take care of the itch or irritation immediately and completely like the other one used to.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace the little bottle that comes with a Parissa waxing kit. Its great for wax removal, I love it. I use it with my GIGI kit rather than the gigi wax remover.</li>
    <li> I wish they would have bigger bottles with that product because we use quite a bit of that good stuff</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff I have to buy more SOON! It helps remove excess wax, it smells wonderful!! And skin feels great after this is applied. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> It works well and smells nice. More than likely I shall order more. Did not get to use it too much for after epilation.</li>
    <li> Love the smell n it works really good 🙊</li>
    <li> Works great for soothing my skin after wax.</li>
    <li> Would not wax with out this stuff.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it really does get rid of left over wax after I finishing waxing. It also helped reduce the redness after waxing.</li>
    <li> This works well with the Gigi system or any waxing. It does seem to calm my skin after waxing.</li>
