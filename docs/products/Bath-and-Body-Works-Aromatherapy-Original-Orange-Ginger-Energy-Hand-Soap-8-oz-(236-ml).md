<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for what it is - hand soap.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The very odd thing about this \\&quot;ginger</li>
<li> After using the soap, I usually sit with my hands to my face and slowly breath it in.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product....</li>

    <li> I love this product. I have used the Bath and Body Works shampoo and lotion that some Marriott properties put in their rooms, so I knew what I was getting. I love the potent combination of orange and ginger. It works very well as a hand soap in the kitchen or the bath.</li>
    <li> Great transaction!  Fast shipping and item exactly as described.  Love the ginger citrus scent!</li>
    <li> I love this hand soap it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands has such a clean smell.  I also keep it in my guest bathroom sure get lots of compliments.  I will be ordering more.  Thank you Delores</li>
    <li> Great fragrance....pricey for the size, but I would order it again....came quickly and packed well.</li>
    <li> Buy several.  Considering shipping cost, buying several will bring the per unit cost down.  I have not been able to get this from Bath &amp; Body Works lately, so I appreciate that I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE Bath and Body product! And it&#x27;s hard to find. The hand soap, body wash, lotion...the whole line of Orange Ginger is wonderful. I especially love the travel-sized body lotion for my purse. It smells like candy!</li>
    <li> I first got this as a gift, but have bought more because of how well it smells.  It&#x27;s a little pricey for what it is - hand soap.  Buy it for the fragrance, not the function.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. After using the soap, I usually sit with my hands to my face and slowly breath it in. The soap is not oily, but it leaves your hands with a distinctly smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but you only need to dispense a very tiny drop in order to wash your hands and experience that wonderful smell. Do not use a full pump! If you&#x27;re careful it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first discovered this soap at a friend&#x27;s house. When I decided to order on Amazon, the description said it was a &amp;#34;Foaming Hand Soap,&amp;#34; I was concerned it was not the same product. But the description is incorrect. The pump does not dispense the soap as a foam, just typical soap liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is not at all typical. It is heavenly.</li>
    <li> Just the right blend of soap and scent!  I go out of my way to find this for my bathroom!</li>
    <li> Amazingly awesome!!  Very happy with it.  :).  I will continue to order from you in the future when it comes to this product.</li>
    <li> As expected; quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I, too, came across this scent in hotel travels.&lt;br /&gt;The very odd thing about this \\&quot;ginger orange\\&quot; scent is that, for me, it is the clear and distinctive scent of the daphne flower, not ginger and orange. I have loved daphne flowers and their scents all my life but never found a perfume with it&#x27;s intoxicating and thrilling odor UNTIL this product. Go smell the small purplish-white daphne flower and then tell me this is not true of this wonderful product!! Amazon prices on this are great, btw!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
    <li> Not made in china..  For me, this is a huge sell..</li>
    <li> love the scent of this soap; fresh and clean results after washing</li>
    <li> During my travels, I came across this product.  It was in the guest packet of bath products.  I liked it so much I subsequently found where I could purchase it when I got home.</li>
    <li> I have this by my husband&#x27;s sink to wash my hands. It is the same &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; as the body wash and the hand lotion making a heavenly trio. The scent reminds my of my lovely friend, Kathryn, who purchased the bodywash and lotion for me for Christmas 2011. Most of it was lost in our Feb 2012 housefire because I was careful in my usage. The fire has taught me to allow myself to use nice things, so I hope that Amazon will still have this available when I use up this batch of ginger/orange Bath &amp; Body Works. It cleans nice without drying but the lotion tops it off wonderfully. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.... It&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey for every day use, but it&#x27;s  got  a lovely  aroma.</li>
