      <li>Originally I found this on the nyx cosmetics page and because people were raving about it I assumed it was really good.</li>

      <li>This powder id&#x27;s really good for getting that highlight &amp; contouring for those special occasions.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>its very light.</li>
      <li>It goes on very light</li>
      <li>but it is build able to an extent and does what it is intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok  it will work.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite product.  </li>

      <li>you&#x27;ll love this NYX product.</li>
      <li>I love the colors and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on ok highlight/contour powder for the price...probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase as there are better products on the market.</li>
      <li>One thing though, I had to scratch off the top layer because I wasn&#x27;t getting any of the product on the brush.</li>
      <li>The highlighter works ok.</li>
      <li>so I guess is okay.</li>
      <li>Its okay for the price</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re used to contouring with creams we prepared for a significantly more muted effect.</li>
      <li>For my Norwegian friend with porcelain skin it worked great!</li>
      <li>So for the price, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>personally really love Girl Meets Pearl as a face highlighter because it has a champagne look to it</li>
      <li>I cant tell you how much i love this  highlight and contour powder its one of my fav&#x27;s</li>

      <li>I received this very quickly and used it this morning.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use adn</li>
      <li>Dont like the product at all....not easy to apply...</li>
      <li>The dark conteur color is perfect, easy to apply and to blend in.</li>
      <li>The powder is not as smooth or easy to apply as it used to be.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect shade for my slightly tanned skin, and comes off lighter than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but like a lot of NYX products some are hits and some are huge misses</li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for an overall dewy finish</li>
      <li>but i got my money&#x27;s worth for sure.  </li>
      <li>But overall this is great for the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works pretty good, glad I tried it, it has been forever to try to find something that does both the light and dark shading I wanted...</li>
    <li> both work really well, the brown is dark but very blendable. also isn&#x27;t orange-ish at all! wish the white was a little more shimmery (it does have a slight glittery look to it) other than that they&#x27;re amazing!</li>
    <li> The highlighter is maybe the best. The contour powder could be a little more shadowy, im not into the whole brown look as it makes my very pale skin look like im wearing fake bake makeup.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. I usually like Nyx a lot. I wonder if they sell more shades for contouring or if this is the only option. A warmer-toned slightly shimmery highlighter (golden) would be a nicer option.</li>
    <li> Anybody who highlights. It&#x27;s a must have for the go bag!!! A night out. You will dip into this a few times, I&#x27;m sure. Super bright and nice dark shades. White has slight shimmer to grab light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can work this baby with one pinky.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping. Great price. Long last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice before and loved the colors for contouring, but it seems like they changed the formula. The powder is not as smooth or easy to apply as it used to be. I&#x27;m using the same brushes and technique, but it seems like I have to scrape off the top to get it on the brush. Frustrating but doable.</li>
    <li> Makes my face dirty looking no matter how I use it. Wanted to like this but like a lot of NYX products some are hits and some are huge misses, sadly this one was way off:(</li>
    <li> came with no instructions for application.</li>
    <li> This stuff is kind of a challenge to apply/blend. I&#x27;ve been looking for a dark contouring color for a long time, and after trying a cream concealer that broke me out, I decided to try this one. Initially I attempted to apply it wet, and it went on very sheer like watercolor. The color itself is fantastic. It&#x27;s hard to find such a dark contouring shade that is actually brown and doesn&#x27;t contain a reddish tint. For reference, I&#x27;m Asian with medium-lightish skin, non-olive complexion. If you&#x27;re worried the shade is too dark for you, it looks scarier than it is. It goes on extremely sheer and it seems hard to build on the intensity, so if it was easier to blend, it actually would make an excellent contouring product, because it really does create that nice shadow. I feel like I&#x27;d need to use the entire container to build the intensity I want, so I think I&#x27;ll look for another product. This might do well as a setting powder for a cream concealer/contour.</li>
    <li> I have a dark complexion and I can use this to contour...  The highlight is great</li>
    <li> The color of the contour shade is so warm and amazing.</li>
    <li> For the contour, it&#x27;s a darker color than I need, but with blending it&#x27;s perfect as a contour powder. With that being said, it is tricky to blend. Which is just about my only complaint. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s on. The highlight powder is a little lighter(weight wise) it seems and more blendable. However it&#x27;s a little sparkley. Not much, but it you&#x27;re layering it on, I&#x27;ve noticed it has a little sparkle. Over all it&#x27;s great. I suggest going over your face with a big fluffy brush to get it blended :)</li>
    <li> really chalky and cheap</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time this morning and loved it!  Works really well with African American Caramel colored skin.  Blends well and gives my skin the right contour and highlight.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The highlighter works ok. The bronzer side does not blend well. It&#x27;s like you have to scrape your brush on the powder to get it on your brush.</li>
    <li> The brown powder side is very pigmented but the white barely shows on alot of skin tones. This compact is good for contouring your face. Its not bad but it&#x27;s not that great either. This compact isnt reall necessary because i think that there are much better contour powders out there- its ok</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok  it will work.</li>
    <li> Awesome product if your into contouring. Perfect shade for me. I&#x27;m a olive skin tone might be a bit dark for most though.</li>
    <li> Having fun with contouring!</li>
    <li> I like it except that I am a dark/ medium color so I would like my contour to be a bit deeper. Other than that this product is great. I never used the highlighter because I don&#x27;t highlight so I&#x27;m not sure how well that works.</li>
    <li> i like it , but the highlighter is toooo much white . the bad thing about it that it arrived late</li>
    <li> I like it but if you&#x27;re used to contouring with creams we prepared for a significantly more muted effect. It&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re looking to transition to every day contouring. The colour is absolutely perfect for my brown skin.</li>
    <li> Love this contour kit!&lt;br /&gt;Great for beginners!  If you have porcelain, tan or olive skin, this will work well on your skin tone!</li>
    <li> I dont really like the product. Unlike what the other reviews said, I do like the highlighter color. However, sometimes it goes on cakey and flakes off. The darker color on the other hand I really dislike. It has a wierd red undertone and I cant get it to evenly apply to my skin. Its okay for the price but I wont use it very much</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the first contouring makeup that I&#x27;ve ever used. It shows up great and blends well. Not sure how this compares to a liquid as I&#x27;ve never used any, but it&#x27;s definitely a great powder and an amazing value.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works so good for my skin! I love the color because it&#x27;s mate! I like the mate</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even tell the difference,I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> This made my contour and highlight process so much more easy. I love the colors and the packaging is adorable! It&#x27;s alot of product but it fits so nicely in my make up bag.</li>
    <li> Its perfect when it comes to the description and picture but hard to use as a contour kit on face, more of a powder than slightly liquid like the other ones I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> Very good basic powder contouring &amp; highlighting duo. Tried it out today, and will definitely be using it as a part of my daily makeup, for when the creams or concealors are just too much. Took a pic (it looks a little dramatic, but it&#x27;s just the angle so u could actually see it 😉)</li>
    <li> This is a very good compact.  The contour powder needs to be a little more flat and the highlight could stand to be a little shinier.  But overall this is great for the price.</li>
    <li> I did not like the application of this contour powder. I have found that it is really hard to apply without streaking and it does not blend easily at all. Then the color fades throughout the day. Also the highlighter does nothing.</li>
    <li> This is good for beginners in highlighting and contouring.  The brown is my favorite!  The white needs to be applied lightly or else it will wash you out!</li>
    <li> The contour is great... matte color but the high light kinda sucks!</li>
    <li> This is a powder and does not blend well at all.  I am still searching for a cream contour. Kit.</li>
    <li> First off, I absolutely love the contour color. It is the perfect shade for my slightly tanned skin, and comes off lighter than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just swipe your brush in there, it is basically like you are using a translucent powder. The color doesn&#x27;t show up AT ALL. You really have to dig your brush in there to get any sort of highlight from this. I found that I got to the bottom of my highlighter in about a month, and I have been using the contour color for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could review the contour color separately, I would give it 5 stars, but I can&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m splitting the difference.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Makes my skin glow :) Lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Perfect for African American and olive skin tones!!! Very pretty.</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly and used it this morning.  I use it for make up contouring, which I just recently started doing, and never thought of even trying to do contouring until recently.  This compact works very well for a nice matte contouring look.  The bronze color is very dark, so use it very sparingly for contouring with a very thin brush application.  It does require quite a bit of blending, and use a very flat head brush with stiff bristles.  A good buy</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as described.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite product.  I can&#x27;t really give a good reason other than I just don&#x27;t like how it looks.</li>
    <li> not really sure how to properly use it because the white does not easily apply to my skin as i thought it would. its very light.</li>
    <li> This is powder so I guess is okay. I put it on and it... how do I say it? Like disappears very easily. I think is good to practice until you master it and move on to the cream/paste.</li>
    <li> great for last minute touch up.</li>
    <li> This is a very good contour/highlighter for someone just learning to use contour/highlighter. It goes on very light so you don&#x27;t have to do a lot of blending. One thing though, I had to scratch off the top layer because I wasn&#x27;t getting any of the product on the brush. All in all I really like it and will order again.</li>
    <li> Nice compact for matte contouring.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too dry and hard to even get it on a brush or sponge... It looks like kids makeup</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stay on very long to me, in my opinion but other than that it works good...for as long as it sticks.</li>
    <li> I love this compact!  Great for when I&#x27;m running behind and don&#x27;t have time for the cream contour palette.  Great product at a very reasonable price!!</li>
    <li> There are way better highlighting and contour products available. Also, you don&#x27;t get much product  and it&#x27;s not super pigmented. I shop around before purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I like this but the highlighter does not really show on light skin. Other then that the contour works great.</li>
    <li> Good price! As description. Good quality.</li>
    <li> This product is actually very nice.  I have taken some theater make up and special effects classes and this product works exactly as the products we used for the stage (but much more affordable).  If you have never used contour before you should definitely watch some videos first because its easy to look dirty if you don&#x27;t use this product correctly.</li>
    <li> My favorite contouring makeup for sure! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the exspensive stuff, this product is great.</li>
    <li> This powder id&#x27;s really good for getting that highlight &amp; contouring for those special occasions.</li>
    <li> The dark conteur color is perfect, easy to apply and to blend in. The light conteur color is not really visible on light skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not fond of this product. The white is completely matte and powdery, it makes my skin look ashy or dead. I dig some Nyx products but then there are products like this that make me rethink buying from them.</li>
    <li> Not very pigmented if you&#x27;re using it by itself, but I use it as a setting powder for my contour and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great value for the $</li>
    <li> This is an awesome HAC powder...I use it almost every day. It&#x27;s pigmented for a powder and it lasts a long time! Will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> It does the job. I use it as a contour for my cheeks and under my jaw. Why spend a fortune when you don&#x27;t have to? I just wish the white powder was a banana powder! That would make this 100x better!</li>
    <li> The dark nor the white colors were NOT very pigmented, either color :( hard to notice on my skin... :(</li>
    <li> Dont like the product at all....not easy to apply...doesnt feel good on skin tone have to apply a lot to show up</li>
    <li> First I want to start off with packaging. The packaging is GREAT, the compact is sturdy and the plastic doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy. I bought NYC&#x27; s sunny bronzer and the packaging is ridiculously cheap...this is nowhere near as flimsy or pathetic as the NYC bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s move onto the contour...the color is great, I have olive skin and this shows up amazingly well! It&#x27;s easy to blend for a darker and bold contour but the compact nature of the powder also allows it to be used for everyday contour-just make sure you use a GOOD brush and have a light touch (if you have a heavy hand make sure you work with this a few times to get the desired look). I use a smaller brush to apply this to contour the sides of my nose and it&#x27;s easy to work with for that purpose as well! I don&#x27;t experience any fall out and this stuff isn&#x27;t messy or muddy looking if you know how to blend it. I really LOVE IT. I haven&#x27;t found a contour compact powder in this price range that can compare to this stuff. Only because a lot of the stuff I find are matte bronzers which are OKAY but they tend to have more of an orange tone to it, and it&#x27;s not the best for contouring. This color is more dark brown and deep as opposed to warm and orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for pigment...STAY AWAY. This is for CONTOURING not bronzing which means it is matte. If you are really looking to contour your face use matte products because otherwise the purpose of \\&quot;contouring\\&quot; is defeated once you begin to add pigments. Pigments are not for adding depth under cheekbones or your jawline...it&#x27;s for highlighting or bronzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the highlight...it&#x27;s not so great. The color is so subtle that you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s a highlight. I suppose it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for an overall dewy finish but as a HIGHLIGHT-no. I actually don&#x27;t use this at all but I wasn&#x27;t very bothered by the quality of the highlight since I was only buying this compact for the contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally really love Girl Meets Pearl as a face highlighter because it has a champagne look to it and well, you know, it actually shows up. But there&#x27;s actually a lot of affordable and less-expensive products in the \\&quot;NYX price range\\&quot; that works well as a highlighter.</li>
    <li> I cant tell you how much i love this  highlight and contour powder its one of my fav&#x27;s it works really well for me</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Easy to use adn I haven&#x27;t found anything like it. I used my friend&#x27;s once and then had to get my own.</li>
    <li> Read some of the reviews on here before purchasing and some were mixed. I absolutely LOVE this contour compact! I am olive skin (blonde/European)....and this is perfect. You don&#x27;t need a lot of the contour or highlighter and I recommend having a good brush for both since you don&#x27;t really want to mix the shades. You won&#x27;t be disappointed---check on some contouring videos on youtube for further tutorials of how to properly contour...you&#x27;ll love this NYX product.</li>
    <li> Got it on time, and it was everything the description said it was, but I just didn&#x27;t care for the actual product. I prefer cream contour over powder.</li>
    <li> Not what im looking for.. Poor durability, not for a makeup applying rookie... The highlighter made my nose look shiny and the contour powder looked dull on my skin. Also absolutely did not like the applicator.. Im usually a fan of nyx products but this one did nothing for me</li>
    <li> the highlighting part doesn&#x27;t work the way it should, too cake, but the couture part works perfect. i would buy if your looking to contour.</li>
    <li> When I first got this item I was really excited about it. It arrived on time but the product itself is not what I expected it to be at all. Originally I found this on the nyx cosmetics page and because people were raving about it I assumed it was really good. It does have a chalky consistency. It&#x27;s not as dark as I thought it would be and I was using my finger to literally press down on the powder so I can get at least a decent amount on my face. I tried different brushes, eventually used my finger tips and it was a HUGE disappointment. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller did a great job packaging it though. No complaints there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; in most lines of foundation, and a little on the pink side; most contouring kits have a highlighter that is the same shade as me. obviously that doesn&#x27;t give me much highlight.&lt;br /&gt;i picked this contouring kit because it has ONE light shade and ONE dark shade. simple. and the tones are rather neutral so i can imagine them blending with yellower skin tones as well.&lt;br /&gt;you might be turned off by the stark contrast, &amp;#34;just white and chocolate brown. how could that possibly blend in with my skin?&amp;#34; this powder is very fine, it blends in perfectly with a blush brush and doesn&#x27;t give that dirty look.&lt;br /&gt;as long as you aren&#x27;t darker than the shader i would give this a try!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I received this item. It was very hard to rub onto and applicator and I was not capable of seeing the product at all.</li>
    <li> I have to work a bit longer to get it to blend right, but for the price I find a good trade-off. I have to be careful not to apply the brown on too heavily or my face will look dirty. It is very highly pigmented. The white barely shows up on my face, so I reapply it to get the desired lightness. The color lasts all day and I never had to reapply. I also like that it is matte. I just don&#x27;t like blushes or contour powders that shimmer. It looks fake and obvious.</li>
    <li> When I apply it, it does not seem to show up on my face. I can sort of see it on the brush, but not really. I can&#x27;t really see a difference on my face when I use it, so it just sits in my drawer.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the price being so low but it exceeded what I thought. I have a darker tan complexion and I&#x27;ve always had the issue of contouring powders not showing up therefore not making a difference. But this is pigmented and stays through out the day. I do have to use a lot of product but I always have too with bronzers and what not.  For my Norwegian friend with porcelain skin it worked great! Didn&#x27;t take much product and I didn&#x27;t have apply the product hard. It blends very easily and the high light isn&#x27;t obnoxiously shimmery. If it costed me more, this review would have been different but i got my money&#x27;s worth for sure.  I maybe would suggest it for lighter skin girls a little more but it did work for me.</li>
    <li> I do makeup all the time and I&#x27;ve worked with a little kit that works this good, for sooo cheap! 5 Stars I recommend this for beginners and fab makeup girls. One word AMAZING</li>
    <li> I like the dark side but the highlight does not work well.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product in the mail. I counted down the days. This is my second beauty prouduct ive ordered off Amazon, and it was shipped and got to my house on the first estimated shipping date. I opened the cute brand new package and went to work adding it to my beauty routine. Its the perfect matte powder, because when countouring it is a largely known tip is not to use shimery sparkly powder or a bronzer to contour.ive tried other beauty priducts for countouring but this is now my PERMANENT go to product. I plan on using Nyx highlight and countour powder until they discontinue it. You can excentuate your good features while countouring and this product does EXACTLY that!!!</li>
    <li> NYX highlight and contour louder does exactly what it should. Although the contour powder is very very dark for fair skin. I have to mix it with my MAC studioFX powder and then wipe on the back of my hand before applying to my face or else it just looks like I&#x27;ve been beaten up. Highlighting powder pigment isn&#x27;t that great but it is build able to an extent and does what it is intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied and I will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s on ok highlight/contour powder for the price...probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase as there are better products on the market.</li>
    <li> Hard to blend, especially if you also you a liquid foundation. The highlighter doesn&#x27;t work at all, too translucent.</li>
    <li> Spend the money and get a good one. I gave up on this product, entirely.</li>
    <li> Product arrived well but the illuminating powder was clear</li>
    <li> The contour is WAY too dark for my fair skin, but the highlight works great. So for the price, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Not pigmented at all. It&#x27;s hard to get any color on the brush, and even when you do, it still doesn&#x27;t show up well on the skin. I&#x27;m half black/half Korean. I&#x27;m not super dark, but maybe someone with lighter skin will have better luck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powder and not creamy. It&#x27;s hard to put on because it&#x27;s sheer which doesn&#x27;t help shade or highlight.  When you do put it on, it doesn&#x27;t stay on so you have to reapply so you end up with a lot of powder on.</li>
