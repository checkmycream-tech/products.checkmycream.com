<li> I have used for years and had a hard time finding them.  </li>
<li> Hard to find in stores these days.</li>
<li> would they mess with a quality product and also make it difficult to purchase?  </li>
<li> it was so incredibly frustrating.</li>
<li> Too expensive - Not happy about that</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> I used to have terrible acne...</li>

    <li> I wish that I knew about this product BEFORE I paid $200 for my Clarisonic!!!  No joke, this sponge is AWESOME!!!  Buf Pufs have been around for many years and I used to use them years ago but they disappeared from store shelves, so out of sight, out of mind.  In the meantime, I purchased all types of exfoliating products including the Clarisonic to help remove makeup and keep my skin clear.  I stumbled upon the buf pufs again and decided to give them another try.  This miracle little sponge takes off makeup and leaves skin clean like nothing else!  My complexion is more even tone than it has been in YEARS after a couple of weeks of using this sponge.  It&#x27;s so great that I rarely use my Clarisonic because I have all but forgotten about it.  I use the Buf Puf in extra gentle and find that it works really well for my sensitive skin.  Give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used Buf Pufs for many years and loved them.  Then I could no longer find them in stores. I had to purchase six of them from Amazon.  Too expensive - Not happy about that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first from that purchase for about a month now.  They are not made of the same stuff as they were in the past.  It has flattened out and seems almost as if it is disintegrating. The old Buf pufs lasted for months - six months, easily.  This one is ready to be tossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would they mess with a quality product and also make it difficult to purchase?  Women need to exfoliate their skin.  Men exfoliate when they shave.  Buf pufs were the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one of the generic ones from CVS and it is a poor immitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m pretty lucky if my biggest complaint in life is I&#x27;m not happy with my Buf puf - I can handle the big things in life - it&#x27;s the little things that bug the heck out of me. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan</li>
    <li> I have used a Buf-Puf for several years and its great.  My dermatologist informed me that it is the only product that actually clears skin (better than acne soaps).  These are no longer sold in stores so Amazon&#x27;s the best place to find them.</li>
    <li> Just like the picture and scrubs great without hurting or scratching my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was in my twenties...that&#x27;s 40 years.  If you want more youthful looking skin that is soft, clear &amp; clean...I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using extra gentle buf-pufs for years and love them.  They keep my skin smooth and free of clogged pores. I don&#x27;t know what to do without them.  They are no longer available in Nova Scotia or Massachusetts.  CVS sells a house brand that is similar but it is too rough.  3M Health Care is missing a huge audience of middle aged to older people who need the extra gentle product.  What&#x27;s going on?</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have used for years and had a hard time finding them.  Good old amazon!  Always have what I need. I like them because they are not too rough on my face.</li>
    <li> Soft enough that you can use it daily. What a difference it makes! clears your complexion.</li>
    <li> buff-puff is rough at first but keep with it.  I used to have terrible acne...no more and I get comments on how young my skin looks.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used a buf-puf, so I started out with the gentle version. It worked great! My skin was exfoliated on a daily basis, became less oily with consistent use of the buf-puf, and any bumps on my face really cleared up.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about the Buf-Puf?  It&#x27;s the best product out there to gently and thoroughly exfoliate your face.  Want younger looking skin? Use a Buf-Puf.  Want your makeup to apply more smoothly and evenly? Use a Buf-Puf.  Want to prevent clogged pores? Use a Buf-Puf. I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t use one!!!  It&#x27;s been around for years!  I have rather oily and acne prone skin and I have been using the Buf-Puf Gentle for at least 10 years.  I use mine once a week and that seems to work best for my skin.  It&#x27;s a must have product for me. An inexpensive, effective, quality product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love Buf-Pufs! Been using them since I was a preteen. Hard to find in stores these days.</li>
    <li> The texture of this buff pad is just right.  I have used other manufacturer&#x27;s pads and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  Feels scratchy on my face but def cleans and exfoliates!  Love my skin!  Just bought a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> great item for face.  exfoliates well.</li>
    <li> This sponge is perfect for me. It exfoliates without leaving irritation or redness, unlike the other facial Buf-Pufs. I use about 1 per month, and the price I paid was fair. Be careful, though: some merchants are charging big bucks plus shipping.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on the skin, restores smooth healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I only use this a few times a week.  It does a good job of exfoliating.</li>
    <li> My husband and I each use the Buf-Puf LFacial Sponge and we both love it.  It leaves your skin soft and fresh.</li>
    <li> only find &#x27;em online. a must-have item, for me anyways.</li>
    <li> The Buf Puf is honestly life changing. I&#x27;ve had acne for YEARS and at 26 and still having issues it was so incredibly frustrating. But one random day a friend of mine gave me an extra to try and within in days I noticed such a difference. The only thing I changed about my skin regime was this little puff and my skin is the best its been in years. Shoutout to the Buf Puf for sure.</li>
