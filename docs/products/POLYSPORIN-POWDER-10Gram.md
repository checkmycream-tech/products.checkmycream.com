      <li>I think it&#x27;s a very good product</li>
      <li>Great for healing cuts or wounds.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for drying out wounds, taking the sting out of and promoting the healing of paper cuts and kitchen knife gouges.  </li>
      <li>It works great.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my cats with good results whenever they injure each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a diabetic and the powder form of Polysporin is great for quickly healing wounds.</li>
      <li>It works great on leaking wounds,drying them up fast.</li>
      <li>Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>Why isn&#x27;t this Ploysporin Powder available in pharmacies?!</li>
      <li>This is a powder that is no longer available at most stores.</li>
      <li>This polysporin POWDER antibiotic is wonderfully stuff.it maybe costs a little more 10 to15 $$</li>
      <li>It will help close the skin very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in a shake bottle and it makes it easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>When you are looking for the power of Polysporin but need to get the wound to dry, that is great.  </li>
      <li>As a retired Physician  Assistant, this stuff is GREAT for &#x27;road rash&#x27; abrasions.... which have a need to be kept dry, thus avoiding maceration.</li>
      <li>I keep one in the medicine cabinet and another bottle in my first aid kit, where it has proven useful many times over the years.  </li>
      <li>Promotes quick healing.</li>
      <li>If you are treating a significant wound, one you need to bind, I fhave found it very helpful to clean the wound and sprinkle Polysporin on it to help absorb bleeding before I bandage.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
      <li>Unlike the ointments, this powder keeps the wound dry and more easily dressed when covered.  </li>
      <li>Sprinkle it right into the wound or cut to prevent infections.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, no longer produced.</li>
      <li>This is the only anti-biotic powder I have been able to find.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway shortly after receiving this product, the cut was sealed over and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>It is great on open wounds because it helps dry the wound.  </li>
      <li>It work very well, and limits the risk of infection until you can get better medical care.</li>
      <li>Now, I force some of this powder into the cut and pretty much forget about it.  </li>
      <li>The scab formed with the antibiotic powder inside and healed amazingly fast.</li>
      <li>and I really had to start babying it, just to keep it from getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
      <li>sure to buy a bottle with a distant expiration date.  </li>
      <li>You sprinkle this on a cut, and you will see it heal twice as fast.  </li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t really do the job the doctor thought it would.</li>
      <li>Well packaged and delivered in reasonable time</li>
      <li>FAR superior to antibiotic ointments, especially if you have an open sore.  </li>
      <li>Not worth the money that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>thorn me--two kinds of scratches that seem to be particularly poisonous.  </li>
      <li>In my years I have had more than a few opportunities to use this product.</li>
      <li>It comes in a small bottle with a shaker top under the cover.</li>
      <li>,small festering or ulcer wound are healed over night.saved many a trips to doctor&#x27;s office and money  on prescriptions.</li>
      <li>This powder is reasonably priced, the vendor mailed it timely and there was no extra charge for postage.</li>
      <li>In my case it not only exceeded my expectations but accelerated healing in some very tender places.</li>
      <li>such as these when they get submersed, the scab gets all white and mushy and can so easily peel off, so one needs to actually dry it out,</li>
      <li>I guess we can&#x27;t buy over the counter cures, then  they must have to stop selling to general public.works well on pets as well.it still baffles me ....</li>
      <li>For myself, I use to heal an old surgical scar that occasionally begins to reopen.</li>

<li> Polysporin is hard to find, and ordering it on line is much cheaper than having your pharmacist get it for you, which he may or may not do.</li>
<li> I keep this stuff around for prompt treatment of minor wounds.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It seems I am getting a lot of smaller  shallower cuts that I usually wouldn&#x27;t bother with, and only recently noticed them now because they were getting infected.  </li>
<li> It helps prevent infection and helps keep the site dry.  </li>
<li> but it is harder and harder to find.  </li>

<li> Any active watersports person has had a Sea ulcer develop or just have a small cut take forever to heal, especially in the tropics.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so hard to find and people are so unaware of the benefits of anti-biotic powder, I give it as gifts.</li>
<li> cut was healing very slowly, and getting red around the edges</li>
<li> I cleaned the raw skin, sprinkled the powder into it, and covered it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Honestly I think we all have been disserviced by creme and gel antibiotic ointments, and feel it is a crime that so very few pharmacies carry this powder, and pharmacists eyes glaze over when asked about it.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so hard to get...</li>
<li> A month or so ago I slammed my shin hard into my surfboard rail, cracking the fiberglass and removing a bunch of skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m just sorry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the size for $14.00. If you ever seen a picnic blue and white salt shaker that&#x27;s the size. Not worth the money that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff to use around feeding tubes.  It helps prevent infection and helps keep the site dry.  We have used this for years but it is harder and harder to find.  Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> This is a powder that is no longer available at most stores. It works great on leaking wounds,drying them up fast. I will always keep a bottle of this in my medicine cabinet!!</li>
    <li> Why isn&#x27;t this Ploysporin Powder available in pharmacies?! When I wiped out on my bike and scraped my leg, a friend told me about Polysporin Powder. I cleaned the raw skin, sprinkled the powder into it, and covered it. The scab formed with the antibiotic powder inside and healed amazingly fast. I keep this on hand now.</li>
    <li> I keep this stuff around for prompt treatment of minor wounds.  It comes in a small bottle with a shaker top under the cover. You sprinkle this on a cut, and you will see it heal twice as fast.  Unlike the ointments, this powder keeps the wound dry and more easily dressed when covered.

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in the local drugstore but I found it on line. I think it&#x27;s a very good product</li>
    <li> A month or so ago I slammed my shin hard into my surfboard rail, cracking the fiberglass and removing a bunch of skin.  I had cleaned it well, and applied neosporin to it daily, and bandaged it before surfing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut was healing very slowly, and getting red around the edges and I really had to start babying it, just to keep it from getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts such as these when they get submersed, the scab gets all white and mushy and can so easily peel off, so one needs to actually dry it out, bandageless for several hours and hope it does not get contaminated or abraded in that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkling some of this antibiotic powder seems to nearly instantly harden up the scab by drying it out, and one can bandage it without it turning all mushy underneath like gel type antibiotics seem to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway shortly after receiving this product, the cut was sealed over and healthy looking.  Any active watersports person has had a Sea ulcer develop or just have a small cut take forever to heal, especially in the tropics.  Like infected bug bites or reef rash.  This stuff is like gold in such a climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I am getting a lot of smaller  shallower cuts that I usually wouldn&#x27;t bother with, and only recently noticed them now because they were getting infected.  Now, I force some of this powder into the cut and pretty much forget about it.  Next morning it is just a cut, not a red rimmed itchy cut which I can squeeze pus out of, and if I do forget or not notice such a cut, and wake up to a festering cut, I squeeze it, and force some powder into it and forget about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I think we all have been disserviced by creme and gel antibiotic ointments, and feel it is a crime that so very few pharmacies carry this powder, and pharmacists eyes glaze over when asked about it.</li>
    <li> We used this on my Mothers infected toe and she is a diabetic and it worked wonders.  Her pediatric Doctor caller her a miracle girl -- she is 97.</li>
    <li> This is the only anti-biotic powder I have been able to find.  Get it at Amazon because I don&#x27;t think anyone else sells it in the US.  Made it Germany.  FAR superior to antibiotic ointments, especially if you have an open sore.  It will help close the skin very quickly.  It&#x27;s so hard to find and people are so unaware of the benefits of anti-biotic powder, I give it as gifts.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, no longer produced. As a retired Physician  Assistant, this stuff is GREAT for &#x27;road rash&#x27; abrasions.... which have a need to be kept dry, thus avoiding maceration. (Hey! It worked for me!)</li>
    <li> Works well clearing up an ulcer on my wife&#x27;s big toe that wouldn&#x27;t heal.</li>
    <li> When you are looking for the power of Polysporin but need to get the wound to dry, that is great.  In my case it not only exceeded my expectations but accelerated healing in some very tender places.</li>
    <li> Years ago while living in Germany I used antibiotic powder.  It is great on open wounds because it helps dry the wound.  Creams and ointments do not stop the bleeding.  I never found this product in the USA until I discovered it at Amazon. This powder is reasonably priced, the vendor mailed it timely and there was no extra charge for postage.</li>
    <li> This polysporin POWDER antibiotic is wonderfully stuff.it maybe costs a little more 10 to15 $$ but it&#x27;s well worth it,small festering or ulcer wound are healed over night.saved many a trips to doctor&#x27;s office and money  on prescriptions.I guess we can&#x27;t buy over the counter cures, then  they must have to stop selling to general public.works well on pets as well.it still baffles me ....stops selling or making this product is crazy.by the way amazon.com thank you for getting back to me on this matter.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and the powder form of Polysporin is great for quickly healing wounds. I wish I could buy this at the store. I keep a bottle in several rooms at home aa well as one in my purse.</li>
    <li> In my years I have had more than a few opportunities to use this product. If you are treating a significant wound, one you need to bind, I fhave found it very helpful to clean the wound and sprinkle Polysporin on it to help absorb bleeding before I bandage. It work very well, and limits the risk of infection until you can get better medical care.</li>
    <li> I keep this on hand.  I use it whenever my cats claw me or my roses thorn me--two kinds of scratches that seem to be particularly poisonous.  It&#x27;s great for drying out wounds, taking the sting out of and promoting the healing of paper cuts and kitchen knife gouges.  I use it on my cats with good results whenever they injure each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to buy a bottle with a distant expiration date.  A little goes a long way, and I find that I often toss out a quarter of the bottle when it expires.</li>
    <li> Amazon was the only place we could find this item.  But it didn&#x27;t really do the job the doctor thought it would.</li>
    <li> Great for healing cuts or wounds. Sprinkle it right into the wound or cut to prevent infections. For myself, I use to heal an old surgical scar that occasionally begins to reopen. Works in just a day or two... My mother, who was a nurse, taught me about the healing properties of the use of this powder. I&#x27;m just sorry it&#x27;s so hard to get...</li>
    <li> Promotes quick healing. I always have Polysporin Powder in  my medicine cabinet. Recommended by a friend who swears by it.</li>
    <li> I use this for my puppy.  It works great.  It&#x27;s in a shake bottle and it makes it easy to apply.  I will order again from this seller.  Well packaged and delivered in reasonable time</li>
