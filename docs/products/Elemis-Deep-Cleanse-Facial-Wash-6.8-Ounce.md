      <li>Bought it first on a cruise.</li>
      <li>My husband and I first used this product while we were cruising.  </li>
      <li>I could not find anywhere that it needed to be used with a certain time period.  </li>
      <li>Within a few months of starting the product, which works great, it started to smell and soon turned rancid.  </li>
      <li>and it kept my skin clear through the whole trip</li>
      <li>The product is very concentrated, so it actually lasts about 4 months for the two of us, making the costs comparable if not better than most store brands!  </li>
      <li>Really like the facial wash</li>
      <li>It gives him really soft skin.</li>
      <li>When I ran out recently I used normal Dove soap to wash my face until my new order came in.  </li>
      <li>Cleans very well, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>but I must admit, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>

    <li> I bought this for my husband after he tried it on a cruise.  After he ran out, he asked me to locate some for him and I found it on Amazon.  He really loves the Elemis line for men and I am glad it&#x27;s so easy to get via Amazon.  The only other place we saw these products was on a cruise ship and when those run out - you&#x27;re out!  Thanks for carrying these items!</li>
    <li> Works great and lasts a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Elemis since 2000.  This line of products delivers what it promises again and again.  The level of quality is tremendous and well worth the value.  I&#x27;ve fair skin and received great results from all the Elemis products.</li>
    <li> Best face wash i have ever tried and i have  tried a lot of them.  I will not try another product for men face wash, it is the best.</li>
    <li> Really like the facial wash</li>
    <li> I found this product in a spa on a Norwegian Cruise line trip and what a find. It is great to use before shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mild acne most of my life and tried many face washes in my time.  This one does not irritate my skin and works well for me.  Can&#x27;t say it will work for everyone since everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but Elemis products are of very high quality.  Takes just a little bit to work so it lasts a lot longer than others.</li>
    <li> Bought it first on a cruise. Thought dude was trying to sell me crap but it helped my skin dramatically. Yet I change my eating habits, no pork, lessened fried food and beer cause what you put in your body matters also.</li>
    <li> Cleans very well, and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a cruise I was on in the Caribbean and it kept my skin clear through the whole trip and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year.  When I ran out recently I used normal Dove soap to wash my face until my new order came in.  Noticed a big difference in the feel of my skin on my face.  The soap did seem to dry it out and the Cleanse Facial Wash didn&#x27;t!  I use it on my face in the shower every morning and find it very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it. It gives him really soft skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> great item just like on the ship and received it fast</li>
    <li> My husband and I first used this product while we were cruising.  We were so impressed, we have continued to use it.  The product is very concentrated, so it actually lasts about 4 months for the two of us, making the costs comparable if not better than most store brands!  The service was also prompt!</li>
    <li> Within a few months of starting the product, which works great, it started to smell and soon turned rancid.  I mean, how does a cleanser go bad?  Seems it contains milk products.  I could not find anywhere that it needed to be used with a certain time period.  I thought this was a fluke but it happened a second time with a second purchase.  If you purchase, just remember to use within a few months. I may try the product again keeping that in mind.  An email I sent to Elemis for either a refund or more info was not responded to.</li>
    <li> Relaxing smell, but too watery</li>
    <li> I went on a cruise and went for a spa treatment, the person asked what I was using to wash my face and was &#x27;shocked&#x27; when I told her soap. Coincidentally, she also helped me get rid of a nagging neck ache. So I bought this product from her, and have been buying it ever since.</li>
    <li> Invigorating facial scrub but I must admit, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try but am not recommending the product.</li>
