<li> I don&#x27;t know how long I survived without these things...</li>
<li> i got this because i was worried about using the one&#x27;s in the nail salon&#x27;s, and getting sick from them, So i got my own to take to the salon, and not have to worry about anything</li>
<li> only thing i didnt like is that they were shipped loose in my package with other items, but who cares...?</li>
<li> so you are less likely to cut yourself.</li>
<li> Only wish the size was a little smaller for the cuticle pushback tooI because i have small nails.</li>
<li> They are so inexpesive, but so sturdy and sharp.  </li>
<li> Cuticle pushers are very sharp so be careful.  </li>
<li> I typically have problems with trimmers over time, but this one seems to be made well.</li>
<li> They are amazing quality and INSANELY well priced</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
<li> wow were we wrong.  </li>
<li> Clippers are small and efficient.</li>
<li> I mean it does its job.</li>
<li> ill buy</li>
<li> and it is close to useless.  </li>
<li> I hate to spend the money on a manicure</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
