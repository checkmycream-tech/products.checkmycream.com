<ol>
      <li>Got this for a $1 at the 99cent store and it works great!</li>
      <li>This product is hard-to-find, and the price varies all over the map, so if you see a good price, stock up!</li>
      <li>The bottle is also great</li>
      <li>It was a shame that it was discontinued as it is a great product.</li>

      <li>When I put this product on, the smell is so nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky and this stuff was great.</li>
      <li>(although I use more product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair lays and feels when I use the Axe conditioner.</li>
      <li>I had been using a pricey Fekkai conditioner, and I like this Lure better</li>
      <li>After one use, I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I really love this hair conditioner.  </li>
      <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>
      <li>The Axe Lure is my favorite scent from the Axe haircare line.</li>
      <li>He just nodded his head, thankfully he didn&#x27;t say, \\&quot;told you so\\&quot;  :)</li>
      <li>This conditioner works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I received my order quickly, and he was THRILLED to have his conditioner-</li>
      <li>The product lays over the top of the hair making it so smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Very happy to be able to find a few more bottles.</li>
      <li>Axe Lure Just Soft is great with any Axe shampoos.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is also pleasant and mild -- fairly neutral -- not masculine nor feminine.  </li>
      <li>but fortunately, it can still be found on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the low price also.</li>
      <li>I used his one time when I had run out of my conditioner and my hair layed smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I started using Axe products a few years ago and especially liked the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I use with AXE just clean shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I just took a shower and used the Axe Just Clean Shampoo, then put this on over it.  </li>
      <li>Buying three at once is good, kind of a high price for them, but I like the product enough to do it.</li>
      <li>I bought this conditioner because the bottle looks cool</li>
      <li>, you name it conditioners and none of them made my hair feel so soft and smelling so nice.  </li>
      <li>The Axe Just Clean Shampoo is a nice shampoo, but it leaves your hair dry like most shampoos.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve read great reviews on other Axe hair products.  </li>
      <li>I lost the Einstein look which gave me a more professional appearance.</li>
      <li>The net of it is that it just absorbs in like some kind of fortification material.  </li>
      <li>The Axe Just Soft conditioner is super tried a guy friends because his hair was super soft and love it gave a couple bottles to my girlfriends</li>
      <li>I am not a big fan of hair conditioners, but I only use this one because it smells great.</li>
      <li>The 2-in-1s really have little/no more conditioning than the daily clean shampoos, so I found I really benefited from a dedicated conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I most definitely would recommend this product  for men women and children.</li>
      <li>and it makes your hair so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Just unpronounceable chemicals ;-)  </li>
      <li>My (male) roommate was complaining that nowhere he went carried this anymore, so, being a borderline agoraphobic and therefore a HUGE fan of Amazon, I looked it up, and, sure enough, Amazon served me well.</li>
      <li>The bottles were tightly shrink-wrapped together which I liked.</li>
      <li>It really has almost no scent at all.</li>
      <li>or so they quit being effective and actually begin to have the opposite effect</li>
      <li>Excellent product that is difficult to find locally</li>
      <li>I have fine, oily hair, and I want conditioning/body but not being weighed down with oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Made my hair extremely soft, just like bottle stated.</li>
      <li>it makes his hair really soft and</li>
      <li>and I have to admit I fell for the masculine description of \\&quot;just soft\\&quot; and there.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair, and it is short</li>
      <li>As it says...it just makes your hair soft.  </li>
      <li>It makes his hair soft and tamed, and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I wish this conditioner had a nice scent to it though, especially as this is usually the last thing I rinse off when I shower.  </li>
      <li>Normally I would not buy my hair conditioner online, but Axe has left me no choice.</li>
      <li>No other claims.  </li>
      <li>A few other sites want much more for this &amp;#34;hard to find&amp;#34; discontinued product.</li>
      <li>Even after using it daily for a year my hair was always soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Personally I did not find any side effects or problems with the Axe Lure: Just Soft Conditioner, but I would prefer if Axe would make the Lure scent in the shampoo or even 2-in-1 (shampoo and conditioner) form.</li>
      <li>Have since switched to all natural products a long time since using.</li>

<li> Way late on the review, but this product did live up to its name.</li>

<li> A lot of other conditioners are weighed down with mineral oils, butters, and such as \\&quot;conditioners\\&quot;.  </li>
<li> Never really into conditioner at all until I bought this one from Axe.  </li>
<li> and I like the white and black gradient theme over the brown and black gradient theme that Axe puts on other shampoos of theirs.</li>
<li> I am a stylist and when my husband would use this over professional products, I would think he was just being difficult because it was me.</li>
<li> I received my order in just a few days.</li>
<li> Hard to find other places...</li>
<li> I have been using it on my hair for the past month or so, and have noticed a change in my hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot;.  </li>
<li> My grandson has thick glossy hair and he loves this product.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to find, so time to stock pile!</li>
<li> How can you go wrong with that??</li>
<li> /&gt;Unfortunately it was pulled from retail shelves and is impossible to find except from closeout shops online.</li>
<li> I had put 4 stars because it has no smell :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky and this stuff was great. All of a sudden it&#x27;s hard to find, so time to stock pile!</li>
    <li> Never really into conditioner at all until I bought this one from Axe.  As it says...it just makes your hair soft.  No other claims.  I can tell a difference and I have to admit I fell for the masculine description of \\&quot;just soft\\&quot; and there. No fancy perfumes, etc.  Like this a lot. Was ordering here because suddenly my pharmacy stopped carrying the conditioner! Hard to find other places...not sure what is going on exactly with that...hope tey are still making it!</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because the bottle looks cool and I&#x27;ve read great reviews on other Axe hair products.  I just took a shower and used the Axe Just Clean Shampoo, then put this on over it.  The Axe Just Clean Shampoo is a nice shampoo, but it leaves your hair dry like most shampoos.  When I put this product on, the smell is so nice and it makes your hair so soft and smooth.  After one use, I love this stuff.  I will probably keep buying it as it keeps improving my hair.  I have used Fructis, Biolage, Nexxus, you name it conditioners and none of them made my hair feel so soft and smelling so nice.  If girls come up to me and ask to smell my hair, I will know why. Take my word and get this stuff!</li>
    <li> The only conditioner I use. I use it along with axe de-poof shampoo. I won&#x27;t ever change! I love it!</li>
    <li> My son said his hair is silkier and softer.  He recommends this product.   Axe Lure Just Soft is great with any Axe shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with conditioners where if I use them for about a month or so they quit being effective and actually begin to have the opposite effect, my hair ends up feeling dry and brittle. I started using Axe products a few years ago and especially liked the conditioner. Even after using it daily for a year my hair was always soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it was pulled from retail shelves and is impossible to find except from closeout shops online. Normally I would not buy my hair conditioner online, but Axe has left me no choice. It was a shame that it was discontinued as it is a great product. The fact that they no longer sell it leaves me to believe I am in the minority when it comes to men using conditioner.</li>
    <li> Got this for a $1 at the 99cent store and it works great! I had put 4 stars because it has no smell :(</li>
    <li> I really love this hair conditioner.  A lot of other conditioners are weighed down with mineral oils, butters, and such as \\&quot;conditioners\\&quot;.  I have fine, oily hair, and I want conditioning/body but not being weighed down with oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has no oils.  Just unpronounceable chemicals ;-)  The net of it is that it just absorbs in like some kind of fortification material.  It reminds me of some stuff I used 20 years ago which they stopped making and which I&#x27;ve long forgotten the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried almost all of the Axe shampoos and 2-in-1s, and there really is not much different in conditioning.  The 2-in-1s really have little/no more conditioning than the daily clean shampoos, so I found I really benefited from a dedicated conditioner.  I had been using a pricey Fekkai conditioner, and I like this Lure better (although I use more product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also pleasant and mild -- fairly neutral -- not masculine nor feminine.  This product is hard-to-find, and the price varies all over the map, so if you see a good price, stock up!</li>
    <li> Way late on the review, but this product did live up to its name. Made my hair extremely soft, just like bottle stated. Have since switched to all natural products a long time since using.</li>
    <li> The Axe Lure is my favorite scent from the Axe haircare line. The only problem for me is that it is only offered in the hair conditioner form and not the actual shampoo, so I use it after I shampoo my hair. I am not a big fan of hair conditioners, but I only use this one because it smells great. Personally I did not find any side effects or problems with the Axe Lure: Just Soft Conditioner, but I would prefer if Axe would make the Lure scent in the shampoo or even 2-in-1 (shampoo and conditioner) form. The bottle is also great and I like the white and black gradient theme over the brown and black gradient theme that Axe puts on other shampoos of theirs.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works pretty good.  I have been using it on my hair for the past month or so, and have noticed a change in my hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot;.  My hair feels less coarse and softer... almost \\&quot;silky\\&quot; to the touch.      I wish this conditioner had a nice scent to it though, especially as this is usually the last thing I rinse off when I shower.  It really has almost no scent at all.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner! They do not make it anymore but fortunately, it can still be found on Amazon. I ordered 3 bottles. I received my order in just a few days. The bottles were tightly shrink-wrapped together which I liked. No chance of leakage if the covers came loose. I was happy with the low price also. A few other sites want much more for this &amp;#34;hard to find&amp;#34; discontinued product.</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and when my husband would use this over professional products, I would think he was just being difficult because it was me. I had a lot of chemicals on my hair. I had an Einstein look, dry and just sticking out. I have straight hair, and it is short so it wasn&#x27;t my hair texture to blame. I used his one time when I had run out of my conditioner and my hair layed smooth and shiny.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The product lays over the top of the hair making it so smooth and silky. I lost the Einstein look which gave me a more professional appearance. I have been stocking up on this product for the last couple of months. I told my husband I love the way my hair lays and feels when I use the Axe conditioner. He just nodded his head, thankfully he didn&#x27;t say, \\&quot;told you so\\&quot;  :)</li>
    <li> My son loves all AXE products, and this one is no exception. The smell is awesome, so clean and refreshing.</li>
    <li> My grandson has thick glossy hair and he loves this product.  It makes his hair soft and tamed, and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product from Amazon and did not receive the order, although the tracking said it was delivered.  I notified Amazon and they promptly refilled my order and sent it to me without further cost.  I will definatly be shopping at Amazon in the future.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding.  I use with AXE just clean shampoo.  I most definitely would recommend this product  for men women and children.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that is difficult to find locally</li>
    <li> My (male) roommate was complaining that nowhere he went carried this anymore, so, being a borderline agoraphobic and therefore a HUGE fan of Amazon, I looked it up, and, sure enough, Amazon served me well. I received my order quickly, and he was THRILLED to have his conditioner- and some to tide him over until he can find it again.&lt;br /&gt;No frills, no girly/fancy smells, no extra BS, \\&quot;just soft\\&quot; hair, without any drama. How can you go wrong with that??</li>
    <li> Been using the Axe Conditioner for a long time and I don&#x27;t see any reason to change that any time soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t find this anywhere in stores. Buying three at once is good, kind of a high price for them, but I like the product enough to do it.</li>
    <li> The Axe Just Soft conditioner is super tried a guy friends because his hair was super soft and love it gave a couple bottles to my girlfriends they love it too try it girls!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this conditioner for a few years now and really enjoys it. it makes his hair really soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We havent had any luck finding it at the stores we used to buy it at so turned to Amazon and of course it was here. Very happy to be able to find a few more bottles.</li>
