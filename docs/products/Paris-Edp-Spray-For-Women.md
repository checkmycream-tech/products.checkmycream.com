      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten the most compliments wearing this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this fragrance after receiving a sample from Nordstrom, and promptly put it into my wishlist.</li>
      <li>Objectively, a lovely smell, and I don&#x27;t know what perfume she wore, but...</li>
      <li>It smells of light woods, some florals, and maybe a bit of orange.  </li>
      <li>item isn&#x27;t quite right, and while I do love the fragrance, I don&#x27;t think anyone should order this product from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I have been looking for a scent that didn&#x27;t have that sweet musky or vanilla smell that most people wear and this is quite different.  </li>
      <li>It is quite light but complex and a bit of a bright note as opposed to a musky note.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a fresh- cut roses/ violet scent and there are middle notes like this, but mostly it smells like grandma&#x27;s memorabilia trunk.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no way a reputable perfume company like Balenciaga Paris would sell this stuff, so, it&#x27;s likely counterfeit.</li>
      <li>is the first time this has happened to us -</li>
      <li>all service from Amazon has been stellar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it also smells EXACTLY like my grandmother.</li>
      <li>The effect is very mature and polished, and the dry-down is pretty true to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells old as if  it has been sitting for years, and the smell is nothing like the original.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure powdery violets will come back around as modern one day.</li>
      <li>I purchased and didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was totally delighted to receive the perfume, but the problem is that this isn&#x27;t the same as the sample I got from Nordstrom at all, the smell was off, and it didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Beautiful fragrance, and highly recommended.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s hard to pick out the individual notes because it&#x27;s very well-blended.  </li>

<li> To find that something you&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon is not really sold from Amazon and has been sent from a company with a difficult return policy is a real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> hint at it in the description- \\&quot;the antique charm of dried petals\\&quot;-</li>
<li> Not too heavy or dowsing.  </li>

<li> This is a fake version of the perfume.</li>
<li> I thought it would be fake, but indeed it is not.</li>
<li> Not happy  :-(  </li>
<li> Fashions in scent come and go, and the powdery violets in this one are still in living memory as the cutting edge perfume of three generations ago.&lt;br</li>
<li> Fake!</li>
<li> Very sad about this perfume</li>

    <li> This perfume is a gorgeous summer scent.  It smells of light woods, some florals, and maybe a bit of orange.  It&#x27;s hard to pick out the individual notes because it&#x27;s very well-blended.  It smells expensive, fresh, and light at the same time.  When I put it on I just want to keep sniffing my wrists; I can&#x27;t get enough.  This is a perfume for sunny summer days, walks through the woods or on the beach, picnics in grass.  Absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> My daughter discovered this fragrance on a trip to Paris. It was the perfect gift for her birthday this year.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this fragrance after receiving a sample from Nordstrom, and promptly put it into my wishlist. Lo and behold, my husband bought it for me for a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thought he was buying it from Amazon, but when we went to investigate returning the item, it said his order was sent via Beauty Encounters, despite the fact that when he went to buy it seemed like the product was coming from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was totally delighted to receive the perfume, but the problem is that this isn&#x27;t the same as the sample I got from Nordstrom at all, the smell was off, and it didn&#x27;t last as long. It just didn&#x27;t smell right, and the packaging was poor - the outer box was a bit dented, and there was no sticker on the bottle of the perfume bottle. All in all, it seemed like a &#x27;used&#x27; bottle of perfume somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could live with that, but the fragrance wasn&#x27;t quite right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t have time to return the item to Beauty Encounters, despite the fact that my husband was sure he&#x27;d ordered from Amazon - it was a bit weird how it seemed like the item was coming from Amazon (prime and all), and yet when we followed links to return the item, somehow it was suddenly sold from Beauty Encounters and not Amazon after all. The return policy for Beauty Encounters is fairly restrictive, and there was just no way we could have arranged a return on time. Fifteen days from time of order (at Christmas) just isn&#x27;t workable, and further - we thought we were dealing with Amazon, and not a third-party seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time this has happened to us - all service from Amazon has been stellar. To find that something you&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon is not really sold from Amazon and has been sent from a company with a difficult return policy is a real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item isn&#x27;t quite right, and while I do love the fragrance, I don&#x27;t think anyone should order this product from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband felt so bad that he took me to a Nordstrom store and got me a new Balenciaga Paris - paid more, and couldn&#x27;t return what he&#x27;d ordered from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful fragrance, and highly recommended. I just love it - but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this one.

    <li> This is a fake version of the perfume. The color is not the same, my original bottle is a clear yellow, and this is clearly a green color. I&#x27;m not sure what happened to this bottle. Smells old as if  it has been sitting for years, and the smell is nothing like the original.  I wish I could return it but I cant. Sad I wasted my money on a product I cant use.</li>
    <li> Thought it was better smelling then this, almost smells like it is old. Not happy  :-(  Very sad about this perfume</li>
    <li> Fake! I was very disappointed to get the same product quality I could get on the street for $5-10. It is sad that Amazon doesn&#x27;t fight counterfeits.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for my wife after she received a sample from Nordstrom. The sample of Balenciaga Paris Eau de Parfum she sprayed on her left arm doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the Balenciaga Paris Eau de Parfum I ordered from Amazon. The sample lasts all day and the Amazon purchase wears out in an hour or so. There&#x27;s no way a reputable perfume company like Balenciaga Paris would sell this stuff, so, it&#x27;s likely counterfeit.</li>
    <li> quite like the smell of this in the bottle- it&#x27;s floral but not overpowering or sweet, with a hint of powder. The effect is very mature and polished, and the dry-down is pretty true to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it also smells EXACTLY like my grandmother. Objectively, a lovely smell, and I don&#x27;t know what perfume she wore, but... this does smell like something that would be worn by a lady in her eighties or nineties. Fashions in scent come and go, and the powdery violets in this one are still in living memory as the cutting edge perfume of three generations ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hint at it in the description- \\&quot;the antique charm of dried petals\\&quot;- and there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with the scent, it&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;m sure powdery violets will come back around as modern one day. But in the meantime, be warned when you wear this perfume, you may be reminding those close to you of hugging their grandmother goodnight. Whether that&#x27;s what you want to trigger when you someone is smelling distance from your neck is up to you.</li>
    <li> I had read about a \\&quot; Summer\\&quot; version of Balenciaga&#x27;s PARIS, which is almost always described as smelling like a Victorian French cathouse.  Guess what?  This one does. I was looking for a fresh- cut roses/ violet scent and there are middle notes like this, but mostly it smells like grandma&#x27;s memorabilia trunk.  If I had a grandma.</li>
    <li> Our niece just loved, loved, loved this perfume.  She put some on the next day and has worn it alot.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells subtle but yet warm and mysterious. It got an elegant smell, soothing , and captivating. Its not overpowering so people have to be close to you you but leave  them wondering the sensual essence that you left behind.</li>
    <li> amazing smelling perfume very sophisticated scent perfect for work. perfect for evenings. winter spring summer or fall perfume. very feminine but sexy smell.</li>
    <li> At first I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this perfume on Amazon for so cheap. I thought it would be fake, but indeed it is not. The perfume smells amazing and lasts long just like the other same bottles from the department store. Thanks. I will buy again after my bottle is finished.  :)</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite perfume. I have been looking for a scent that didn&#x27;t have that sweet musky or vanilla smell that most people wear and this is quite different.  It smells strong and awful at first, but after it dries down, it&#x27;s not too overwhelming but yet lasts all day long.  I found myself smelling my wrist all throughout the day, it just keeps smelling better. It has a nice violet floral and a bit woody and powdery scent. So happy that I didn&#x27;t pay $100 at Sephora!</li>
    <li> I smelled this fragrance as a sample in a magazine. I purchased and didn&#x27;t like it as much.  I use it on occasion to add scent to my sheets.</li>
    <li> My new favorite.  So clean and fresh.  I get compliments everytime I have this on.</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume about 6 months ago in a department store and didn&#x27;t buy it, but wrote down&lt;br /&gt;the name. I kept thinking about the scent and decided to get it from Amazon. Its really nice and so&lt;br /&gt;glad I got it now. I was worried about it being shipped in the heat and the company packaged it so&lt;br /&gt;great, I was amazed! I also saved some $$ buying this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still loving it!</li>
    <li> Not too heavy or dowsing.  It is quite light but complex and a bit of a bright note as opposed to a musky note.  Bright and flowery, but you don&#x27;t guess flowers.  Not like gardenia or anything like that.  Kind of a cross between Juicy Couture and Chloe maybe.  I like it very much.  It would be hard to wear too much.  It is effective but still light.</li>
    <li> The Balenziaga Paris is one of my favorite fragrances.  I get a lot of compliments on it.  Will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> The best smelling fragrance of summer.&lt;br /&gt;The perfect flower combination that won&#x27;t overwhelm your senses. Light and sweet. I&#x27;ve gotten the most compliments wearing this fragrance.</li>
