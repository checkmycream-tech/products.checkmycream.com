<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had an older one I lost while moving and ordered this one a week ago. It was a bit pricey compared to other brands. Maybe because it has a docking station for re-chargeable batteries. I needed to use mine ASAP, so I removed the re-chargeable&#x27;s and put in 2 AA&#x27;s. worked GREAT! I have pitted nails from psoriasis and use these type tools to smooth my nails from pits made from my skin cells regenerating to quickly. I use one several times a week. Can&#x27;t tell you now how well this will hold up to my last one that lasted 2 yrs, but so far, it&#x27;s a nifty little tool that works very well.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price. Works well and has a good number of attatchments</li>
    <li> I am seeing a foot doctor about a real bad, thick nail fungus on my right big toe, a problem I&#x27;ve had for years. After nearly clipping the nail to its root on my toe, she told me to diligently file the nail as it continues to grow back before I apply anti-fungal treatment to it each day. So instead of using an emery board, I now use this rechargeable pedicure machine. It comes with a convenient rechargeable stand and an assortment of different tools, especially one for filing down thick fungal toenails. This machine has the spinning power to do the job and do it much more effectively than the emery board. The price is reasonable for this great machine. I recommend it especially for filing down thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> Great tool for a home manicure.  You&#x27;re able to keep your manicure and pedicure looking professional between visits.  So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Glad to have a product to help me maintain  the appearance of my pedicure between periodic trips to the podiatrist</li>
    <li> I think I don&#x27;t owe you review - this is my free will and I have provided you with my opinion</li>
    <li> Lots of pieces but the product did no perform as expected.  I will have to return to the nail salon to do what I was expecting.  It wasn&#x27;t  strong enough even to file my nails and the instructions on use was less than impressive.  My search for a good product continues.    if anyone out there has any suggestions or know of a better product please let me know.  .</li>
    <li> I purchased this manicure/pedicure set to replace a 15-year-old Homedics StyleSpa Deluxe that was no longer holding its charge. Having read your reviews of the newer version of the Homedics manicure/pedicure sets, I decided that this Medicool product sounded like a better one. Well, the Medicool Manicure Pedicure Station is OK - it does a good job - BUT it has only half the tools that my old Homedics product does. Now, when I do my nails, I use BOTH products - the Medicool for the basics (like trimming my fingernails) and the Homedics (which started holding its charge again) for removing calloused skin on my feet. Would I buy this product again? Yes, but only because the newer Homedics products seem to be of a lower quality than they used to be.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything &amp; this is the only product that works quickly &amp; easily on my foot calusses. There&#x27;s a tremendous difference in only 2 days.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I like that it can used cordless, but I prefer it plugged in.</li>
    <li> As everyone, i was trying to save money! And ooh i was right  in this one. My nails look like i had a professional session when i did it at home.you will not regret buying this</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good system. I have checked at local establishments and they were asking $70-150 for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different manicure sets -- from inexpensive to pricey -- and am most pleased with this one.  I am 60 years old and find this one very easy to use.  I especially like the large cone to smooth foot skin.  It really works!  It gently and safely removes calluses and dry, built up skin (I&#x27;m diabetic so this is essential.) It works quickly, but it is very easy to control so you don&#x27;t injure yourself by taking off too much skin.</li>
    <li> good for those thick toe nail&#x27;s that clipper don&#x27;t work on no more. also finger nail&#x27;s and the little sanding drum work&#x27;s on those thick callous on the hand and finger&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This seems to work really well for the cost.  I gave it 4 stars because the plastic housing around the bottom holding the attachments does not snap on tight which is frustrating.  The rechargeable feature is very nice.  It has plenty of speed to file nails but for heel callouses it would need to be more heavy duty.</li>
    <li> It is adequate, but not as good as the very old model I had but lost.  Not very powerful, slower, acting.</li>
    <li> This has replaced my clippers. I have diabetes and am very careful not to injure my feet. My toenails respond well to filing so I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidently clipping the skin around them.</li>
    <li> I had a rechargeable nail file for years that finally quit recharging, so I hoped this one would be at least as good. It is better! I lilke being able to plunk it down into the charging base instead of plugging in a charger and finding the tiny connection to plug into. It has a variety of manicure/pedicure attachments, but I use mainly the conical shaped file, which is superior to my old one.  It&#x27;s especially handy for smoothing toenails, which are increasingly difficult for me to reach with traditional hand files.  This costs the equivalent of 1 pedicure or manicure but should last for years.  That&#x27;s a good value, in my book!</li>
    <li> Yes I like it and it what I was looking for and needed for my thick toe nails and callouses</li>
    <li> I finally got myself this mani/pedi station. I should have gotten it long ago! I love that I can use it with or without the cord. Plus, I am now wearing artificial nails. Sometimes, I feel like the underneath sides need smoothed out between fill-ins. This tool can do it! I also had a hip replacement this year. I can&#x27;t keep my foot up too long, so this allows me to complete the filing much faster, and remove dead skin. I would recommend this to any lady, young or old.</li>
    <li> Love it! My chronic cracked heels are now easy to keep smooth and soft. Makes mani/pedi so much better and easier.</li>
    <li> Not very powerful....wish I&#x27;d have gotten a Dremel tool instead.</li>
    <li> Sounded good, looked good, was impressed with the online description,  However, when I used it on my toenails, all it did was jump and skip. I was totally frustrated and immediately packed it back up and returned it.</li>
    <li> Product Medicool Manicure/Pedicure Caddy with Rechargeable battery.  I wear my nails natural, not even clear nail polish on hands and color on toenails.  I would often get a manicure/pedicure (never to my satisfaction, no how much I paid).  I would watch the manicurists working on the false nails and think, \\&quot;I would love to get some tools like that and take care of my own nails.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now I have just what I need, I save money by taking care of my nails at home, and my nails never looked better.  Great product/tools that allow you to take control and give yourself the manicure/pedicure exactly as you want.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent nail file.  Works well on real or acrylic nails.  This is fantastic for dealing with thick nails, doing lots of nails, or if you just want an easier way than having to shape and trim your nails manually.</li>
    <li> This was worthless could do faster and better with a course emeryboard, I am returning it.</li>
    <li> This product works well on fingernails and toenails. It is especially effective on thick toenails, that can be difficult to trim with regular clippers. The product holds a charge for a long time, even with heavy use.</li>
    <li> Style and looks are fine. No motor power whatsoever. Maybe I got a bad one. Yah can&#x27;t do nuthing with this thing. sorry!</li>
    <li> This kit is a total waste of time. You would way outperform it with a hand file. Threw it in the garbage !</li>
    <li> Convenient with the rechargeable battery.  Nice option of unplugging the charging stand and plugging it into the nail tool directly.  Various tools for different jobs.  Works well and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> For what I wanted it to do, works great.  So far, no complaints.  I like that you can use independent of cord.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not understanding the good reviews on this product, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  This thing has no power at all - it might be different if it was variable power and this was the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting, but it just bogs down completely the minute it touches your nail or tough skin.  The attachments really are lame too - they each are supposed to have a different purpose, but each one performs about the same.  It is battery operated or AC plug in.  The battery power you might as well forget, but the plug in (which I used) - again just not enough power.  It does come with batteries.  Switching out the attachment heads is very easy, they just push in and pull out.  One drawback to the electrical plug in option is that the cord on the main unit is coiled and quite short.  When I plugged it in to the extension cord next to my bed, I had to put the plug in part up on the bed to have enough leeway to use the unit.  Very stiff coil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a few attachments for acriylic nails - which I wouldn&#x27;t use - anyway, not worth the money in any way.</li>
    <li> I received the Medicool Manicure Pedicure Caddy in a timely fashion and have found it to work as advertised.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Had this a short time and hardly used. When used it would shut off by itself. Also the one bit I wanted to use would not fit the tool. My fault for not sending it right back. I called the company and they said that I could send it back and pay shipping both ways. Well not worth the cost and effort. Stay away from this and get something better.</li>
    <li> This is OK I guess but does seem to \\&quot;stall\\&quot; A LOT!!! You have to use a light hand&lt;br /&gt;even while plugged in. Disappointing as I wanted to use it for dry, rough skin on heels,ect.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a similar product yrs ago for about the same price on HSN and it worked much better.</li>
    <li> this is not what it says it is. i got this and it doesnt have the power to do anything it states. very misled by ad on amazon. really crap product. im trying to yard sale this junk for 2.00 and it wont sell!!!!! very upset over ad.</li>
    <li> I had a manicure set from years and years ago, unfortunately it finally died.  I brought this product for doing my own manicures and pedicures.  It is a great product. It makes my pedicures look like they were professionally done even though I do it myself.</li>
    <li> It does not quit measure up to what I expected.  The tools do not remove excess nail easily. I find using regular clipeers more  efficient and less time consuming as well as far more effective.</li>
    <li> It is not strong enough. No professional equipment.</li>
    <li> This thing stalls out on my acrylic nails, and yet it actually burned me when I tried it on my natural toe nails (apparently, I wasn&#x27;t moving it around enough, or maybe my toe nails are flimsy), so I really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re supposed to use it for. I&#x27;m not happy with it, but it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you can really return once you&#x27;ve used it. I don&#x27;t know, maybe you can, but I didn&#x27;t try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it sits there, neatly and quietly charging til I figure out if it will work for my polymer clay stuff. It probably will, but since I bought it for nails and it won&#x27;t work for that, I can&#x27;t rate it very highly.</li>
    <li> I really am happy with my medicool manicure pedicure station. works very well and easy to use! I would recommend it even to my daughters in college that love to get their nails done but usually cannot afford it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as Christmas/Graduation gifts. Appears to be a quality product, however, none have been used.</li>
    <li> This is a good home product, which is easy to use. It saves money by  doing it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> the tips would not stay in and very shoddily made. Sent back and go back to using my 15 year old model</li>
    <li> The product is ok. I&#x27;m not blown away by it. The tool for trimming your nails takes forever. The tool that is suppose to take away dry skin is about the same. You really have to charge it for a good twenty four hours between uses because the battery goes fast. I recommend doing your nails the old fashioned way with a good emmery board.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Medicool set at a saloon 10 years ago for about $90. dollars. The quality and durability of this product is top notch. I still have the first one, but decided to purchase two more because of the great price. I gave one as a gift last year and my niece loves it as well. It does a fantastic job removing the dry dead skin on the heels of my feet and that has allowed me to wear backless shoes, which I was embarrassed to wear in the past. It also comes with extra tools now which is a bonus because it already has enough tools for any pedi/medi task needed. It is a great manicure tool as well. One tool cleans up your cuticles around your nails in a snap. I recommend this product highly and I believe it&#x27;s the best on the market and it will last forever! I have a friend who borrows mine when she visits although she has a pedi/medi tool from another maker. I hide it when she comes over now. Perhaps, she&#x27;ll buy her own soon. You can&#x27;t go wrong and I highly recommend this as a gift because of the quality and the price. You and your gift receivers will be very happy with this manicure pedicure set and it will be a &amp;#34;best buy&amp;#34; for many years. Oh, and be sure to tell your friends to buy their own!</li>
    <li> So far we have tried this just once, but we were very pleased.  It works safely without digging, a big concern! It took off callouses that hadn&#x27;t responded to cutting or lotions, and a week later, the skin in those areas is still soft.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time as promised. Works good, wish it was a bit stronger as my husband&#x27;s toenails are really strong. Perfect for my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I had tried others and they were really disappointing.  This one is very easy to use, very effective, very light to handle.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I use it for my toe nails.  It does a very good job on the ones that have gotten thicker over the years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, we don&#x27;t bother even trying to use this product.  The motorized unit has so little torque that one can seize the motor just by grabbing it with ones pinkie finger alone.  The manufacturer would probably claim this is intentional, but the truth it it makes this product almost useless.  My wife and I found that using a variable speed Dremel unit performs the same function at least 2000 x better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old daughter.  She does her nails multiply times a week and this is perfect.  It charges quickly and she gets several uses out of it in between charges.  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> The motor that powers the trimmers was not powerful enough. When applying it the motor almost stops. Set it back for a full refund.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with our purchase,  we wanted a tool that  we could use between our visits to the podiatrists.  This tool has the power to do what you want, and come with several attachments.  We are very very pleased.  I would highly recommend this tool as a at home use.</li>
    <li> I gave the Medicool Manicure Pedicure Station 5 stars because of its reliability.  I&#x27;ve had one for years and it gets the job done quickly every time I use it.  I like the selection of tips and the built-in holder.  I would recommend this item to anyone who is tired of filing their nails with emery boards.</li>
    <li> This product is handy.&lt;br /&gt;It will be used a lot . The manual one I had was old and I needed a replacement for it. This one is really nice.</li>
    <li> Again, this is something ordered for my granddaughter several states away and since I have not heard any negative reports I will assume it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job and doing it well. She does her nails about every other day and has become quite proficient and talented at it for only just 13 years old. I will have to ask next text session and add to this if need be.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. the battery last during the pedicure</li>
    <li> Its a great choice for the money. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> It does the job that I was expecting it to do. Sands the nail very smoothly and keeps the nails even.</li>
    <li> I use to have a manicure kit similar to this it lasted 10 year until the battery did not charge anymore and have to throw it away. I bough this one to replace the old one. One of the attachment broke the first time I use it in my finger. I returned and got a refund. Not good quality at all, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For the price it works very well.  Works well on toes as well as nails and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Used only one time &amp; so far, it&#x27;s made giving myself a pedicure a whole lot easier than ever before.</li>
    <li> Love this manicure set. I use it over and over again. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I just received my manicure and pedicure station. I am very excited to use it and as instructed, needs to be charged 7 hours for initial charging. I was about to do that but.... the plug / cord is not working. Plus, I&#x27;ve tried to use it with the rechargeable battery. I must say that it is not powerful enough to clean the nails.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was plenty powerful for all nail functions.. I have a few thick toenails that needed some attention and ina matter of minutes they were cleaned up... you have to be careful though using the sanding wheel to grind a thick nail  --  on one it went a bit to far and went thru to the nail base and was bleeding...just saying that this works faster than in expected... This product s for nails, not remvingo callus from  bottom of your foot</li>
    <li> I find this to meet all my manicure needs. Good quality. Easy to use. Would recommend this kit. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Easy for older person to use. Does a decent job especially for the price. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Great for older people that have a hard time reaching toes.</li>
    <li> The manicure pedicure caddy is not powerful enough. I didn&#x27;t even see a reorder sheet for the accessories.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this little station! I have problems with calluses and this tool helps keep them under control. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This I use as a pedicure--it has taken off \\&quot;things\\&quot; that have been on my toes for years, and improved the appearance of my feet immeasurably!  I can also file down thick toenails, and do all sorts of things--great set of tools!</li>
    <li> cheap cheap cheap and I don&#x27;t mean the price. A charge lasts about 1 use. Don&#x27;t care for, bad buy.</li>
    <li> Not enough power.. for power pedicuring round nails</li>
    <li> This is working for me.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything better. Simple to assemble and easy to use. Good for both toenails and fingernails in shaping.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be much more powerful then it was. I was disappointed with the way it filed my natural nails and would not recommend it, it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before settling on this set and I am glad I did.  The quality is definitely there!  It has enough power and a large enough assortment of tips to tackle thickened toenails or delicate manicures.  I&#x27;m seriously thinking about trying it on my Dog&#x27;s toenails.  Lol  No joke, I think it could handle it.  Being battery operated, it is fairly quiet which is always a good thing.  I think that for the money it was an excellent purchase and expect to give it a lot of use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help make it easier to do my handicapped childs nail because cutting them leaves sharp edges but I would buy this product again.  She has very thin soft nails and this item has difficulty shaving them down.  It even stops at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  runs out of battery before finished and can&#x27;t handle the job</li>
    <li> works great but not a long life on the batteries. Wish it came with a wall adapter for the hand held device,  Works good though</li>
    <li> This is a great way to give yourself a better mani or pedi.  It&#x27;s powerful enough even for smoothing caluses.  I bought more for gifts.  Everyone likes it.</li>
    <li> This little tool is great for your toenails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to med. problems, my husband does my pedicures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> My husband both have medical issues. He used to go to his podiatrist to get his toenails trimmed. Now we don&#x27;t have to pay $50.00 to have his trimmed. I can do it. I have bad issues with my back and now he can trim mine. Excellent product !</li>
    <li> used for gift--guess he likes it</li>
    <li> I have owned this product before.  For the price, it does a good job.</li>
    <li> the rechargeable battery last long when it is in use.&lt;br /&gt;lightweight easy to use in the hard to reach space</li>
    <li> Excellent product, will save you a lot of money from going to a podiatric, when you can do it at home.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a little pedicure thing to take care of my feet, I had another before that I had for almost ten years and paid like three times the price of this one. This one is powerful and easy to use, has almost everything that I need. For me it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product. It saves money to use the product myself and not have to go to a professional Pedicurist or Manicurist.  Thank You</li>
    <li> Keeps my nails beautiful.  Easy to use. Hmm, more words required, LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> In general, I do not like rechargeable units, and almost did not buy this because it&#x27;s a rechargeable. In my experience, rechargeable cordless units usually have a built-in or proprietary type of battery which makes the tool useless once the battery fails to hold a charge. This one is different!  Upon opening the battery compartment, I found a little slip of paper which warns that only rechargeable batteries are to be used. Underneath the slip of paper I saw 2 AA size Ni-cd batteries which are easily replaced, and can be found in just about any store you go to.  It&#x27;s not as powerful as other tools I have used in the past, but it does what I need it to do. I basically got this to do pedicures on my dog. She is terrified of nail clippers, but she quickly adapts to new experiences, and will lay quietly while I do her nails with this type of tool. In fact, not being too powerful is a plus. It&#x27;s not likely to heat up too quickly to burn her toes.</li>
    <li> it does a reasonable job of filing my toenails, but as others mention I have to be careful not to put too much pressure on it or else it stops.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use on my fingernails but it&#x27;s hard to control the shape and it weakens my nails. I didn&#x27;t buy it to use on my toenails, but that&#x27;s what I will use it for because it&#x27;s ok on the toes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for natural fingernail shaping.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t have enough power to smooth away a callous. If too much pressure is applied it stopped. It took forever to shape a nail. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Does everything I wanted it to so I can take better care of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I personally find the instructions awful. Someone could seriously hurt themselves if they use this tool wrong, and the best you have for instructions is a small paper that shows a pic of each piece and what it&#x27;s called, and maybe a few words with a small description of what that part is for.</li>
    <li> Get something a lot more powerful if you want to use it for thickened toenails.  Nice for ordinary fingernails, however.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT mani/pedi machine! Has great tools, ample power and it&#x27;s a lot of fun to use! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This has served my purpose beautifully. Now there is no need to go to a podiatrist or even get a pedicure. I can do it myself. This is a very compact kit - has everything and really it all works well.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Had to charge it up when I got it. Charge last a long time. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The main Unit is OK, even though it does not have much power. The tools (attachments) comes with it does not do any thing. I will not buy this unit again.</li>
    <li> An item that every one should have. I bought it to replace  one that I had had for years and finally just quit working.  Having the stand and bits within easy reach is an extra advantage.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this pedicure caddy.  It is so much better than having a battery filled one.&lt;br /&gt;So far it is working great.</li>
    <li> I tried the basic filing disc attachment. A light pressure does next to nothing. Applying enough pressure to start wearing away the nail causes the device to slow down and finally come to a complete stop. It seems rather toy like. I plan on getting a nail \\&quot;drill\\&quot; tool with enough POWER to do something like this one: [[ASIN:B006ZAPMT8 VOGUE PROFESSIONAL brand Powerful Slim Lightweight Pro Nail Art Drill KIT Electric FILE Buffer with 7 Specialty Bits]]</li>
    <li> great till it broke after 2 - 3 uses. they wouldn&#x27;t replace it.</li>
    <li> I think this might be more useful as a manicure product. I think I&#x27;m looking for an attachment that probably doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
    <li> After reading the instructions, I charged the unit for 7 hours as indicated.  I, then used it for around 15-20 seconds and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I could do my own &#x27;callous removing&#x27; rather than getting charged an extra five bucks every time I had a pedicure. I don&#x27;t know if the salon uses something more along the lines of a garage tool, but this little guy was like a barbie version...when I applied it to my heels it just skimmed the top similar to what I could do with a regular manual nail file and ran out of juice quick. I&#x27;m going to have to visit Sears with the hubby, I guess...Certainly not worth the $50 I paid for the thing at the beauty shop (which I&#x27;m sure was a rip off to begin with).</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have 3 fused toes and it is difficult to cut my nails, this solved the problem......thanks.</li>
    <li> I like it though I wish it was a little more powerful.  I really like that it comes withn electronic charger.</li>
    <li> I do love this manicure kit! It&#x27;s perfect for dead skin removing and cuticular smoothing. It gently polishes my skin and nails. There is a set of different cones so you can vary the roughness and the form for the best result.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it to buy.</li>
    <li> Feels like cheap plastic but it works. I have no problem with mine. Not good for heavy duty pedis but everyday grooming needs it fine.</li>
    <li> While this is not a high powered machine it does the job I needed it for and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> If you get thickened or dry, brittle nails, corns, or calluses, this is your answer. These tools are indispensable to take care of pedicure needs that a salon will not handle. The tools are incredibly easy to use, and the unit stays charged for a long time so that you can do a thorough pedicure with no difficulty. This has to be the most practical purchase I&#x27;ve ever made for foot care.</li>
    <li> Weak motor.  I had to return it.  I was not satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Im very pleased with this product.  The price was right and it delivered  as advertised. I&#x27;d recommend it to my friends too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my elderly mother who has trouble trimming her toenails.  She doesn&#x27;t use it because it is difficult to use and very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product. Ordered others and had to return them but this is a good buy and works really nice</li>
    <li> I love this Medicool Manicure Pedicure Station! For the cost of a single manicure ( or less) I have been able to keep my nails in summer shape for the entire season. It holds a charge for a good long time, and works very well, even on thick difficult nails. The&lt;br /&gt;sanding bits will work for you for several pedicures. I recommend this for the thrifty folks who still like to look well groomed.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I would have wanted but does the job! It is good for the money! Buy it !</li>
    <li> I had it before and had a hard time finding it,did find it at a Supply House for Cosmetologist&#x27;s,but very expensive.When I found it here and at this Price I was thrilled.</li>
    <li> seems more like a toy and i don&#x27;t think it will really handle pedicure requirements have to use a very light touch or motor stops</li>
    <li> I like that it is portable and recharges, no battery purchases required.  However, not that strong and if you have thick toenails it will take you a while to wittle them down.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Easy to use and works on thick, ugly toenails (my husband&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it from the description, but this tool can be used both as corded and cordless, which is very convenient. Not terribly powerful, but enough for daily maintenance and reasonably thin natural nails and reasonably well-cared for feet. Holds charge well. I haven&#x27;t noticed any serious reduction of power by the end of my first pedicure session. Uses regular rechargeable AA batteries, which means, you can replace them if they start holding charge worse - that&#x27;s really nice! (if it lives long enough to need battery replacement, of course) This tool is especially convenient to use on your toes and feet because it can be used cordless and you can reach everywhere. Very nice small set of bits - has everything you need and nothing that you don&#x27;t really need. Very convenient charger which doubles as an organizer for bits. You can detach the base from the cord very easily and take it (along with all the bits) with you wherever you feel like doing your nails. Overall a well designed product for personal use.</li>
    <li> Very handy for toenail, not so sure for fingernails.</li>
    <li> Works well for maintenance between professional mani/pedis.&lt;br /&gt;Product met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Good for those who need a bit of an extended reach to maintain their toenails.</li>
    <li> ver nice.  keeps my feel beautiful</li>
    <li> This item is very nice and a great size to travel with.  It contains everything necessary for a full manicure or a touchup as needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.  The emory for filing is very small and very slow.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to to use.  I have real hard toe nails, and it really helps keeping the trim.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my toenails. While it is not high speed like the one the doctor has in his office it works well for the money. I am sure the doctors cost a whole lot more.</li>
    <li> It has met my expectations well</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. It stopped working in 9 months. Not well made and only a 30 warranty.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as stated. Mine came perfectly boxed with all parts and an instruction booklet. So far the batteries keep their charge for a long time--I have used it briefly on occasion and now, today, continuously for about a half an hour and they still haven&#x27;t hesitated. The cord included is the spiral type (&amp;#34;telephone&amp;#34;-style) so it can be stretched as needed, should I want to use the unit for a longer time. The filing bits appear sturdy and made very short work of my fingernails. However, I purchased this for my unusually hard toenails and it worked like a dream to file those down in short order! I love this product and it seems to be worth the $26--much better than the other cheaper device that I have been struggling with. My only problem: Why did I wait so long to order it?</li>
    <li> Love this.  Easy to use. Good results.  Anybody can use it. I have arthritis and needed something easy to use.  I&#x27;m glad that I found it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nail buffer.  It removes ridges but I have yet to discover how it might buff my nails too.</li>
