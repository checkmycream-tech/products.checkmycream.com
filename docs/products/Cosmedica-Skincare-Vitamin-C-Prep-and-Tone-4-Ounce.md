      <li>Their own prep toner was too pricey</li>
      <li>To give an honest review, a product like this takes time to work in order to give an HONEST review.</li>

      <li>then the vitamin c. Love the results.</li>
      <li>love this product get them..</li>
      <li>I love using this product before using my vitamin c serum because it corrects the ph levels for better absorbtion.</li>
      <li>I use this right before the vitamin c 20% serum for even more effective results.</li>
      <li>Feels good when spraying, no smell which is important to me, no break outs on the face and anything that may help this 67yr old face filled with adventures lines is a good day.</li>
      <li>it is easy to put on.</li>
      <li>As it was my first time doing a peel of that strong, i was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a good PH balancing toner that would really prepare my skin.</li>
      <li>I am now a huge fan of vitamin c.  </li>
      <li>It has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>and they are really light almost freckle</li>
      <li>a second time lol</li>
      <li>It is light and refreshing and it makes my face feel super clean after I wash it.</li>
      <li>I use this in a beauty salve I make and Vitamin C is always welcome in facial products.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I love this spray, I use right</li>
      <li>Most of it goes into the air, unless I jam it right up against the cotton ball.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin smooth, bright, and clear without irritation while keeping it clean.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed and significant difference between this and my 3.00 toners from walmart</li>
      <li>I used this on a clean face, followed by their HA serum and my bioelements \\&quot;all things</li>
      <li>I still use my Thayers toner but this stuff is good for that pick me upper look</li>
      <li>far as the product itself, it&#x27;s fine for a refreshing spray.  </li>
      <li>Esto sí funciona super</li>
      <li>It evaporates quickly.  </li>
      <li>I also use this right after rolling, gives my skin a cool off, followed up by 100% collagen cream.  </li>
      <li>Really cleanse my face!!</li>
      <li>it is useful</li>
      <li>right before I apply my Jojoba oil moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Is not sticky, my skin absorbed very fast.  </li>
      <li>LOVE it so much that I use it after the shower (without the cotton ball, I just spray directly on my face)</li>
      <li>First I am a man who assist Doc with A to Z  </li>
      <li>This product and the hyaluronic serum is an absolute must every day!</li>
      <li>The brown tinted color of the product made me question if I got an expired bottle at first.</li>
      <li>first time doing derma on my face.  </li>
      <li>It did seem to help as a pre-peel prep, as it has a skin stripping quality that smooths skin out in short term, allowing for a more even application of the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has not been at least 30 days yet for any great results.</li>
      <li>I WILL NEED MORE TIME FOR A FINAL REVIEW.</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks of daily use my skin tone looked noticeably more even</li>
      <li>first, I sprayed it onto a cottonball and applied it before my peel AND after my peel.</li>
      <li>A Serum works really well!.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping it would help with the blackheads on my nose, but all it did was make my nose peel more, and dry out my skin more in general.</li>
      <li>If you spray it on a cotton ball, it absorbs so quickly into the cotton ball that you don&#x27;t end up with enough product to smooth over your whole face.</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because I&#x27;ve only had this product a few weeks and to be honest, Cosmedica Skincare Customer Service Team sent me an email, first asking if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, then asked for positive feedback.  </li>
      <li>These types of reviews are not helpful to the first time customer and really has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself.  </li>
      <li>Its good product but not sure what is it doing yet</li>
      <li>The product is clear, odorless, like water and quick to apply because of the spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this toner because it was recommended for use with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure by Cosmedica Skincare...</li>
      <li>I just received this and upon first application my face looked brighter and vibrant.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice anything exciting as far as reduction of lines.</li>
      <li>but I feel that I need to use it for a while to really notice any permanent improvements In my shin.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the ingenuity of cosmedico...</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I like the toner vwey much....</li>
      <li>Apply the Retinol serum very close to you fingers.    </li>
      <li>but I actually really like that.  </li>
      <li>I am pretty new to derma rolling, so I bought this for prepping my skin.  </li>
      <li>I use it when I wake up to make sure my skin is ready to soak in all the other products that I&#x27;ll be using and also to prepare my skin for makeup.</li>
      <li>I originally was looking to only purchase a prep toner for my Makeup Artist&#x27;s choice Lactic Acid peel.</li>
      <li>Be sure to moisturize due to it can be drying.</li>
      <li>My skin feels normal..</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and they said that was the normal color of the product.</li>
      <li>Always was on the lookout for any new products to push the envelope.    </li>
      <li>My skin is having less break outs and feels smooth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really cleanse my face!! I love this products! I use it before i apply my hyaluronic acid. Feel amazing together!</li>
    <li> Arrived speedily.  A good value.</li>
    <li> I give it two stars because I just start to use it. hope with time I will post an  update about this product.</li>
    <li> First I am a man who assist Doc with A to Z  Began in 2002 using Glycolic Acid, then, Renova, then Retin A.  Used to mix unbuffered  glycolic @8 %, then used Retin Liqued then OMG! Always was on the lookout for any new products to push the envelope.    Stay away from, lasers. Peels are the way but, talking about a Doc doings a deep peel, not the peel your Estatician does.    The liquid was a great peel and peeled so well my Cosmetic Surgeon sent me home for 2 days.    He ranted, if the patients see you it makes the practice look bad. Can anyone appreciate that, 2 paid day&#x27;s??    To both products I ordered the Vital C and Retinol A Serum works really well!.  Apply the Retinol serum very close to you fingers.    Thre Vit C pump in plain language, it takes time to get used to the Prep Spray.Now that I am through the learning curve it especially works well.        The bomb Diggidy is Retin A and glycolic acids.Retin A, dries you out especially in winter. The glycolic  puts moisture back in the basal layers of your skin.    SUNSCREEN SUNSCREEN SUNSCREEN this is the fountain of youth!    HOPE this helps everyone</li>
    <li> I just ordered this product..After reading reviews decided to buy along with 1.5mm Micro Needle Roller Skin Care Therapy Dermatology System.&lt;br /&gt; ...first time doing derma on my face.  I prepared my face with this toner...my skin felt tight, with a glow. No irritation at all.  Is not sticky, my skin absorbed very fast.  So far, so good.  will be using daily and will post progress.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed and significant difference between this and my 3.00 toners from walmart</li>
    <li> I been see the different on my face with the black spot&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again soon I&#x27;m running out</li>
    <li> I have been trying different products to combat the eternal aging process.  This product does what is says it does.  It has a similar affect that retin a provides.  Definitely not as deep but none the less you do get a mild peel.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS IN CONJUCTION WITH THE HYALURONIC SERUM. THE RESULTS ARE NOT QUITE UP TO PAR. I WILL NEED MORE TIME FOR A FINAL REVIEW.</li>
    <li> The toner seems to be doing the job. I have seen my face brighten up just a bit since I started using this product. The brown tinted color of the product made me question if I got an expired bottle at first. I contacted the company and they said that was the normal color of the product. I was relieved after that. But I will keep using this until it&#x27;s gone now that I have it.</li>
    <li> I like the toner vwey much....I use it twice a week to refresh my skin......It works very well on my facial and neck areas.</li>
    <li> Its good product but not sure what is it doing yet I just used for 3 days before hylauronic serum and match good. Anyway is hood product</li>
    <li> So far it has worked well and helped improve the condition of my skin. It may seem a little price but a little bit goes a long way so it is a good price for the amount</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would help with the blackheads on my nose, but all it did was make my nose peel more, and dry out my skin more in general. I also tried using this pre-chemical peel. It did seem to help as a pre-peel prep, as it has a skin stripping quality that smooths skin out in short term, allowing for a more even application of the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to comment on the bottle and the issues I encountered apply the toner. The application process is a problem. If you spray it directly on to your face, it doesn&#x27;t mist onto the skin evenly. It sprays hitting one area heavily. If you spray it on a cotton ball, it absorbs so quickly into the cotton ball that you don&#x27;t end up with enough product to smooth over your whole face.</li>
    <li> I hear a lots celebrity say how good this product is so i give it a try for about two week and love everything about it.</li>
    <li> I am now a huge fan of vitamin c.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a spray (spritzer) when I bought it but I actually really like that.  it is easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I love using this product before using my vitamin c serum because it corrects the ph levels for better absorbtion. Great combo and for collagen building. I use my derma roller then the vitamin c. Love the results.</li>
    <li> I received the product within a few days sooner then delivery date.  I have been using the product for over 2 weeks now and really love this product.  I will ordered again when product runs out.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It keeps my face refreshed but it doesn&#x27;t minimize pores. Still works better than using no toner.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use this product, then I use the hylauronic acid, I like the way my skin feels. Be sure to moisturize due to it can be drying. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use as a prep for a chemical peel but I received this product before my salicylic acid. With that said, I decided to use it once daily in the morning after washing my face to test it&#x27;s properties and effects on me. After a couple of weeks of daily use my skin tone looked noticeably more even and I don&#x27;t get that dry tight feeling that I&#x27;d usually feel after cleansing. My skin feels normal..that&#x27;s saying a lot coming from me. I would recommend this product to people who have combination dry/oily skin and who are acne prone. It didn&#x27;t give me additional breakouts, and my skin looks considerably healthier/less dull. The scent of this product is hardly apparent/almost non-existent.</li>
    <li> I use this in a beauty salve I make and Vitamin C is always welcome in facial products. I love using this antioxidant in my preparations.</li>
    <li> The product is clear, odorless, like water and quick to apply because of the spray bottle.  It is small but lasts a very long time since you do not need much to apply.  I have not reacted adversely to the product.  I use it before moisturizers.  It evaporates quickly.  The instructions on the label are incorrect since it states to &#x27;drop serum onto fingertips for application.&#x27;  If you are going to do that then you would have to open the bottle (which you can).</li>
    <li> love this product get them..it is useful</li>
    <li> I am not sure exactly what you are supposed to do with it no directions.</li>
    <li> I JUST WISH THE BOTTLE WAS A BIT BIGGER SO IT LASTS LONGER AS I USE IT ALL THROUGH THE DAY</li>
    <li> Love this toner! It keeps my skin smooth, bright, and clear without irritation while keeping it clean. I use this right before the vitamin c 20% serum for even more effective results.</li>
    <li> This I like. Every person needs vitamin C in and out. Great product for men and women.</li>
    <li> Feels good when spraying, no smell which is important to me, no break outs on the face and anything that may help this 67yr old face filled with adventures lines is a good day. To hard to tell if it works for me.</li>
    <li> Got it on time. Seems to be doing good. I would order again!!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I&#x27;ve only had this product a few weeks and to be honest, Cosmedica Skincare Customer Service Team sent me an email, first asking if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, then asked for positive feedback.  I didn&#x27;t really appreciate the assumption that I was not happy with the product.  To give an honest review, a product like this takes time to work in order to give an HONEST review. I base all of my ordering on Amazon from customer reviews and I&#x27;m personally a little bit sick of seeing reviews from people who &amp;#34;just received their product and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; and that really isn&#x27;t very honest if you ask me.  Or leaving reviews saying they use this product to &amp;#34;make their own&amp;#34; products.  These types of reviews are not helpful to the first time customer and really has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself.  JS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself, it&#x27;s fine for a refreshing spray.  I am pretty new to derma rolling, so I bought this for prepping my skin.  I also use this right after rolling, gives my skin a cool off, followed up by 100% collagen cream.  It also works just as well as Jane Iredale&#x27;s Hydration Spray for applying to your face before applying mineral make up.  As far as actually &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; results, it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin while using this product.  I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m suppose to visually see anything or it&#x27;s just benefiting my skin cells and not so much noticable on the outside.  I  have only used half the bottle and do not know if the benfits will be more noticable with longer use.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great customer service! Fast Shipping. Thank You</li>
    <li> I love this spray, I use right after I cleanse then I allow to absorb and apply my moisturizers, etc.. My skin looks brighter and smoother, my only con is it doesnt come in a bigger size bottle.</li>
    <li> I see no reason for this product.  I&#x27;m a 35 year old male who is starting to see my face get older and I&#x27;m not happy about it.  I ordered this toner because it was recommended for use with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure by Cosmedica Skincare...but there is no reason for this to exist, it does nothing.  There&#x27;s no difference from using it versus not using it.</li>
    <li> Esto sí funciona super</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle.  I use it with the other Cosmedica products (Hydrulonic, Vitamin C, moisturizer)  and it has stopped the aging of my 53 year old skin that saw too much sun in its youth.  My chest looks incredible now.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> I just received this and upon first application my face looked brighter and vibrant. Just a healthy glow! I used this on a clean face, followed by their HA serum and my bioelements \\&quot;all things pure\\&quot; cream. I have sensitive dry skin and I&#x27;ve hit my 30&#x27;s so I started having age spots/sun spots, not sure from the two but you can see under my eye area and they are really light almost freckle like, so I&#x27;m hoping this will possibly fade those spots. I will update later on w/more info but the customer service itself receives 5 stars for their assistance!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/30:&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff! I think I will repurchase this again! Skin is def brighter, that vitamin C kinda brightness. I use this once a night or 3 nights a week followed by 100% Natural and USDA Certified Organic Grapeseed Oil and WOW! GREAT PRODUCT! I still use my Thayers toner but this stuff is good for that pick me upper look or if you have dull skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/11/15&lt;br /&gt;As always, I change products like I change underwear and I never repurchased this a second time lol</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a week ago and i am noticing changes in my skin. My spots that were red have lightened to a pink color. I hope that with continued use of this product it will help diminish the darker spots further. It is a great skin conditioner!! I will be buying again</li>
    <li> It has not been at least 30 days yet for any great results. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin does appear to be brighter and my blemishes are slowing fading/evening out. So far so good. No breakouts either. I have oily skin and I use this every morning right before I apply my Jojoba oil moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a &#x27;time will tell&#x27; item. I am using this with a Derma Roller. I will update when the time comes that I have something to help. I can tell you, it came on time is well packaged, and is also, the least expensive of this type of product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all.  Also, I hate the spray bottle. Most of it goes into the air, unless I jam it right up against the cotton ball.  Will update if anything changes</li>
    <li> My skin get tight and less open pores in one week use and I notice brighter completion. Thanks for the ingenuity of cosmedico...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It works as a refresher for my skin.  I use it in the am before makeup and in the evening before bed.  My skin is having less break outs and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> ehh, it&#x27;s ok...didn&#x27;t notice anything exciting as far as reduction of lines.</li>
    <li> I love this toner! It is light and refreshing and it makes my face feel super clean after I wash it. I wish more products came in this sort of spray bottle - very easy to use and a great addition to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and works great before lactic acid peel. I wash my face and then use the vitamin c prep then apply peel</li>
    <li> I originally was looking to only purchase a prep toner for my Makeup Artist&#x27;s choice Lactic Acid peel. As it was my first time doing a peel of that strong, i was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a good PH balancing toner that would really prepare my skin. Their own prep toner was too pricey so I had to look for other alternatives - that was when I stumbled upon this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand before so I was a bit hesitant. Afterall, my skin was already too horrible and I didn&#x27;t want to do anything to further exacerbate it! So, I saw that it had good reviews and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I sprayed it onto a cottonball and applied it before my peel AND after my peel. I loved how my skin felt while using it, it leaves your skin feeling moisturized and not too dry (unlike other typical toners who seem to dry out my skin). I have a holy grail product from LUSH (their toner) but this is seriously even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it so much that I use it after the shower (without the cotton ball, I just spray directly on my face) - I guess I&#x27;m greedy that way! I use it when I wake up to make sure my skin is ready to soak in all the other products that I&#x27;ll be using and also to prepare my skin for makeup. I will repurchase again!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products! It has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin. I use it as a toner before the hyaluronic serum, or also add it to the serum if my skin is looking dull. This product and the hyaluronic serum is an absolute must every day! I consider it my liquid gold :). I&#x27;m almost 40 and my skin still has the texture of when I was 30.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with this product but I feel that I need to use it for a while to really notice any permanent improvements In my shin.  I do love the was it makes my skin feel.</li>
