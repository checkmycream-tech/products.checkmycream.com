      <li>it would actually be a good</li>
      <li>&quot; good.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve perfected the fitting process and also learned how to speak 100% perfectly with them in place, something that took ME a full day to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fit is not that great...</li>
      <li>They fit great.</li>
      <li>Besides the lip, this product is simply amazing...</li>

      <li>they were effective..</li>
      <li>If I smiled you could see the edge of the product.</li>
      <li>Then....if you have your own teeth, forget it.</li>

      <li>cheap cheap cheap!!!!</li>
      <li>Really impressed with the value for the price - Of course we were not expecting dental quality but what a cheap solution to a quick need.  </li>

      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a miracle and you too might be glad to have given them a chance.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I guess if you have no teeth already these might work? They&#x27;re way too perfectly straight and make me look like a horse.</li>
    <li> I love this item, it worked great for me. Everyone said how great they looked, and how natural. The only thing I can say I didn&#x27;t like was that on the package it tells you that you can mold the thermal plastic beads over and over  until you find the perfect fit, but after about five times of heating and cooling the plastic beads they didn&#x27;t really feel as flexible.Fortunately you can order more online, although I did get it to work. Overall I would definitely recommend these to anyone who needs a quick fix for an unsightly smile.The vendor I purchased them from was cashco1000, they were great also, I recieved my Item so quickly, I was pleasantly suprised. I would  order from them again without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I saw those \\&quot;Snap on teeth\\&quot; being advertised on TV and got excited. I could finally get a picture worthy smile. I called my dentist and he said he didn&#x27;t deal with the snap on smiles, and that I should save myself $1200 and buy cosmetic smiles online. He said they work just as good and look just as real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these on the billy bob website and ordered them. First off, the lip on the back everyone talks about (they call a shelf) RUINS the product. The teeth do fall lower than what is natural, and give you an almost bucktooth appearance. If they had gotten rid of that shelf on the back... it would actually be a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I had was with the beads it came with. They don&#x27;t stick that well. I followed the directions to the tee and it still didn&#x27;t stick that well. I&#x27;ve tried using a nail file to file down the teeth so they aren&#x27;t so long... but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at another product by Imako... looking at the demonstration video, there appears to be no shelf on the back. So we&#x27;ll see how it works. As it stands with these teeth though, great idea... not a good enough product. These would be great if they made them without the shelf on the back as you can position the teeth accurately.</li>
    <li> You should read the instructions twice, before you even touch this piece of thin plastic. My father in-law only tried to see how they looked in his mouth and they broke before inserting them.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased  a set of Dr Bailey&#x27;s Instant Smile Cosmetic Dentures False Teeth Novelty and for the price (around $15.00) it was a good product and when fitted properly they look pretty realistic.  They might be perfect for a job interview, Halloween, or something where you really need a good  looking smile.    The statement of not using them for eating is true.  Theses are NOT substitutes for dentures and they DID require some modification.      ***A WORD OF CAUTION. VERY IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MOLD, SHAPE, OR MODIFY UNLESS THEY ARE SOFTENED AT THE TIME BY BEING IN HOT WATER!!! In their RIGID state they are NOT FLEXIBLE and WILL BREAK!!!!****  Still, with the proper expectations set... a good product overall.  I would not pay the $39.00 - $60.00 or MORE, that some people are trying to charge, but worth it at around $15.00.      ***THESE ARE NOT DENTURES***!</li>
    <li> this product is a piece of crap and a waste of money..First of all trying to get the things to fit properly is a job, and when you finally get them on they make you look like you have buck teeth or better yet horse teeth.. please dont waste your time or money on this piece of crap..thanks</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money and they will NOT give you a refund once you get it.  Nope dont bother buyin it unless you are a tooth less person...</li>
    <li> my package was opened, and since it was open they didn&#x27;t want a refund. they were so bulky! I&#x27;m disapointed.</li>
    <li> This product was a joke.  I never could get them to fit at all!  I tryed time and time again with no success!  I was so disappointed and really angry that I ever spent my money on this item!</li>
    <li> Item as described in Premier Goods ad. I was pleasantly surprised when I received the Instant Smile Dentures and realized the excellent care that Premier Goods took to package it so carefully to insure it wouldn&#x27;t get broken.  Very pleased with the dentures.  They are just what my mother needs for special occasions. I will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> as they are not custom fit they may be smaller or larger than YOUR teeth...Also,some of the teeth are PINK!!! Terrible product and company only offers exchanges and does not refund shipping!!!</li>
    <li> We read the reviews and were hesistant, but for the price, delivery and immediate need, we decided to \\&quot;take a chance\\&quot;.  WOW! Really impressed with the value for the price - Of course we were not expecting dental quality but what a cheap solution to a quick need.  We used Funfinity for the purchase - They were the best priced and OMG the item delivered almost right after we hit submit.  Great vendor, quick dly, super packaging.  Will continue to order products from Funfinity!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wondering this company enjoys making people feel terrible? I was SO excited to get this &amp; when I got it &amp; it didn&#x27;t fit over my own teeth &amp; made my upper lip stick out like a horse, I just crumpled into the fetal position and cried. I can&#x27;t afford real dentures. I am not eligible for health insurance because I was born diabetic. My teeth are bad because I have been sick all my life. Now, this stupid thing has made me feel like crap. Don&#x27;t buy it. It will only lead to heartbreak. The only way I can see this product working is if you don&#x27;t have any top teeth. I have tried to use the sander to remove the ridge in the inside, but that didn&#x27;t help my upper lip from sticking out. Looking like a hillbilly is better than looking like Mr. Ed. :(</li>
    <li> I was really worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like this product after reading the very mixed reviews. But, I am missing some teeth and financially unable to have the problem professionally addressed. Since it is so inexpensive i figured, worth a try.the secure smile website tells you the product needs to be customized,it does. I did it with a nail file and in 45 minutes I had a passable looking smile. Objective people told me if they did not know my situation, they would not think the teeth looked fake.they do protrude slightly because I still have teeth of my own. In my opinion it still looks better than missing fronts.Be patient when following the directions and the product does work. May not be for everyone but certainly don&#x27;t have much to lose to give it a try.Don&#x27;t expect a miracle and you too might be glad to have given them a chance.God Bless!</li>
    <li> I received my \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; today and they look great in the package but thats about it... They dont fit like they say they would. When you put them in your mouth they buldge out your upper lip so you look like a horse!!! when you open your mouth they fall down and when you smile they buldge out... I wasted $17.00 on a product that was supposed to work. I am missing two front teeth due to domestic violence and just wanted my smile bakc... I look better with missing teeth than I do with these teeth in. I will never ever buy something like this again.</li>
    <li> EVEN THOUGH I READ THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS, I JUST HAD TO ORDER AND SEE FOR MYSELF.I RECENTLY BROKE A FRONT INCISOR AND AM WAITING 3 WEEKS FOR DENTAL APPOINTMENT ($1800/NO INSURANCE) TO PERFORM ROOT CANAL/POST/CROWN. I THOUGHT I COULD USE THIS DEVICE TO COVER THE SPACE SO THAT I COULD STILL MEET WITH CLIENTS AND \\&quot;PRESENT\\&quot; MYSELF WELL. THE DEVICE IS BEST FOR PEOPLE WITH VERY SMALL TEETH OR A LOT OF MISSING TEETH. THE RESEVOIR OR \\&quot;SHELF\\&quot; ON THE DEVICE CONFLICTS WITH REAL TEETH LENGTH.THE DEVICE IS ATTRACTIVE AND I THINK VERY REALISTIC, CONSIDERING WE ARE TALKING $10 HERE PEOPLE.THE BEADS WERE EASY TO USE BUT DID NOT KEEP DEVICE IN PLACE LONGER THAN 5 SECONDS.OH WELL....</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item. It just arrived December 9th, and it looks NOTHING like the picture. You would have to have tiny teeth to fit it. I tried to shave it down, because the lip in the back makes it impossible, and it broke right in half! So cheap. Seriously, if you are hesitating to buy this, because of the mixed reviews, hesitate no longer and DON&#x27;T. The bad reviews are true. You will regret it!! I hope this helps, because I ignored the bad reviews!!!</li>
    <li> I just received my \\&quot;Instant Smile\\&quot; teeth today.  I&#x27;ve never ordered anything like this before.  First of all, I want to refer to a previous review about the ridge on the back of the teeth.  It does make your teeth look too long and you can see your real gums when you smile.  SO, I decided to do something about it.  I tried clipping away the ridge with wire cutters and I broke the \\&quot;Instant Smile\\&quot; plate into 3 pieces.  SO, I glued the pieces back together successfully (including one of my fingers) with superglue.  It worked (except for the fact that the superglue took a layer of skin off my finger).  They look brand new again. The biggest thing for me was getting the teeth to fit the way I wanted them with the beed mixture.  I finally did it and for the low price of this item I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  Even though I had to go through quite a lot to get to the end result.  But, that was my own fault.  I knew there was a ridge on the back of the teeth when I bought them.</li>
    <li> I am so extremely upset to say that I can&#x27;t use this product because there is a lip on the bottom behind the teeth and prevents the teeth from looking natural. I look like a horse. Very disappointed to say that I&#x27;m going to have to buy the ugly Imako product...    Besides the lip, this product is simply amazing... if there was no lip there I&#x27;d be the happiest person alive right now.. They look very natural and are nice and hard unlike the Imako...</li>
    <li> I would lean on the I mako teeth before this brand they&#x27;re much better...</li>
    <li> Hello i have lived life  from 19 to 42 with messed up teeth from a car accdent&lt;br /&gt;I never thought i would smile again out side  but after theese came in i played around with them&lt;br /&gt;for about 30 mins and got them just right,  I look great now  since then i have got a new job i become manager in under 2 months&lt;br /&gt;at a huge bussiness,  it&#x27;s all got to do with this set of teeth  i ordered a few of them just incase something happens and i cant get them anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1 to 10  i give them a 15  there Great  and i&#x27;m on my 3rd pair  they dont last for ever  prolly 6 to 7 months if you take care of them&lt;br /&gt;the nice thing is no one can tell there not real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll upload some pics of them and you can tell me</li>

    <li> I bought this for my father, to cover some spaces over the implants, those little metal pins, and looks terrible and fake, My father hates it, he said it was  not comfortable at all, extremely hard and the shape wasn´t right. He tried another product for 3 weeks until the dental procedure was done, and he was fine.</li>
    <li> I have a front tooth that fell out.. Being uninsured like the rest of the country and not having money for the dentist...I tried this...Sad to say I still won&#x27;t go out of the house. :( I also bought the MORE expensive IMAKO teeth...  they suck also.  Guess I am stuck in the house til I hit the lotto--</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m 24 yrs old and my teeth are pretty gnarly. It has only been in the last 2 yrs and the rate of decay has been so rapid its left me quite depressed and afraid to go out. I&#x27;m currently unemployed because I just couldnt face a possible employer with my real teeth. I ran into an old friend whos eyes just kept going to my mouth. I had enough.    So I found these and ordered a pair expedited shipping!! I received them 2 days ago.I opened them up they looked just like they did online. I did everything the package said and I looked like classic highschool dork/geek/horse/chipmunk/rabbit anything with buck teeth.  the lip on the back made it impossible to use. If I smiled you could see the edge of the product. So I reheated the beads again and again for that \\&quot;perfect fit\\&quot; but after ...like... the 3rd time of reheating them they stopped being sticky.AND the plastic actually broke one of my teeth further.. thanks for that secure smile.I was soo determined to make them work that I kept at it.. I used polygrip right to my teeth and gums. They stuck out a little less... but still pretty far! So I put on a good movie and used a nail file and filed the back of them down perfectly flat. I kept at it for a while. The little \\&quot;taiwan\\&quot; and set of numbers is no longer visible. After I thinned them down and used polygrip... I was able to make them work for me.     I chose this product over imako because they look more realistic. People complain about them being yellow. I&#x27;m a coffee addict so this is the norm for me. lol Lets face it. Nobody&#x27;s teeth are WHITE. I want believable not perfect. Also Imako teeth have gums that make you look anemic. They are soo light its funny looking. I find that they are very 2D looking too. It looks like someone is just wearing a picture of teeth on their own! lol     My friends were like \\&quot; Why didnt you tell me you went to the dentist?\\&quot; When I told them they were amazed. My husband says they look real.. but.. he may be a bit biased. lol.  So if you have pretty ok teeth and are just looking for a hollywood smile... these are NOT for you. If you..like me.. have serious dental issues holding you back from living a regular life and lack funds to fix it.. AND you are prepared for some serious customization. These CAN work for you. You have to want it baaaad!!   Hope you are smiling too ¢¾</li>
    <li> There is a lip on the back of product teeth where you place your real teeth. This makes them extend pretty far past where your real teeth stop. This lip is the show stopper! Because of the lip, it gives a very unaturarl look. Think horse or chipmunk. Also because the lip, I can not smile without exposing the top of the product. The product is still useful in situations where little communication is needed. I would not even consider using this for a job interview.    If you don&#x27;t think the lip will be a problem... The product does look real, and can easily be formed to fit properly. Just follow the directions and move quickly and gently.    Speaking of the directions, I found it funny the picture (not illustration) in the directions does not include the product with a lip.</li>
    <li> This product is useless, I followed literally the instructions but it would not fit in my mouth.   It feels like having a big block of plastic in my mouth and there is no way I could use this in any public   place. I opted to go to the dentist and have my teeth fixed.</li>
    <li> Ill never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This looked so realistic, but it broke very soon after getting it! Disappointing to say the least! I didnt heat it high enough and long enough and it cracked and broke</li>
    <li> this was  the best thing i have ever got yes there a little bulky but with a nail file i was able to make them thiner ,and i am so happy i got them i was very sad because of the way i was missing two teeth on both side of my mouth left and right and know when people see me they see i look different but they dont get what it is they say i look younger its the best thing i ever did so if your thinking about do it</li>
    <li> I got the cosmetic teeth in and I liked the look right away but getting them in was hard and they stick out kinda far but for the most part an ok look</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with this purchase. Even though they are pure novelty i couldnt even use them because of a plastic rail on the back. It made them impossible to fit over my own teeth. Then of course, you can&#x27;t return them because you&#x27;ve already opened them.</li>
    <li> I made 2 inquiries since I ordered this product.  I STILL have not received them from the seller.  At this point I want to cancel my order and get my money back.</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions and still could not make this thing fit even after filing down the inner lip area. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I hate this product it didn&#x27;t even fit in my mouth properly. I did everthing it said to do and it looked like horse teeth, this is a rip off and i want my money back!</li>
    <li> The teeth broke while my husband was following direction to fit them to his mouth.  He threw them away immediately.  They did not work at all.</li>
    <li> This is the worst! its also called instant smile now probably becasue it has such a bad rep. Buy the other brand thats much more realistic looking.</li>
    <li> I would have rated this a ZERO if I&#x27;d had that option!&lt;br /&gt;I read the other reviews about this item and decided to go ahead and purchase two sets of these &#x27;horse&#x27;s teeth&#x27; anyway.. and yep, they look like huge over bite teeth, horse&#x27;s teeth, everything you don&#x27;t want your teeth to look like! However, if you&#x27;re missing your four front teeth, they could be an improvement as any teeth look better than no teeth... (lol). I&#x27;m sorry, to me this is true. Otherwise, it;s a complete waste of $. Unless you&#x27;re missing 4-6 of your front teeth these look absolutely ridiculous and totally NOT real in your mouth! Go to dentist and get the &#x27;snap-on&#x27; smile instead or the partial, or bridge that will solve the &#x27;real&#x27; problem. These are BULKY in the mouth, feel totally un-natural, took LONGER to custom fit than the instructions imply and they&#x27;re VERY FRAGILE, break easily and simply will not last. The &#x27;sealing beads&#x27; that come with them to insure &#x27;bonding&#x27; do not actually &#x27;bond&#x27; the false instant smile teeth to itself very well so you can&#x27;t rely on it to &#x27;hold&#x27; for long. The instructions indicate you can re-heat these bonding beads over &amp; over again but you can&#x27;t.. they become more and more hard and inflexible with each heating and this impedes the flexibility needed for a good fit which you won&#x27;t get anyway. For FUN or parties where you want to look &#x27;different, funny or even ridiculous&#x27; then by all means, buy these. To replace or hide a missing tooth, apply the cash towards a good dentist and a good system that really works. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy when i received this product. After filing it down completely it still would not fit. So i had to break it up to make them fit. After all that it looked half way wareable. Not happy at all does not fit like the commercial states.  [[ASIN:B003ZEXVRC Dr Bailey&#x27;s Instant Smile Cosmetic Dentures False Teeth Novelty]]</li>
    <li> These teeth worked for me!! Just heated the water and let them sit for a little while. Then played with the fit and presto! They fit great. Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> it was a different style than last purchase....unusable to me because of a lower tray that makes talking almost impossible</li>
    <li> Although they appeared to be the right size they were way to large for my mouth.  I may try a smaller size</li>
    <li> this product is not meeting the basic - does not get any softer when  I put it in hot hot water 3 times and it did not get any softer, so it makes it impossible to adjust.  And it does not look real whatsoever. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> this was the 2nd time ordering them. I  opened them used for about 2 minutes and they split in half not sure what to do with them now..maybe they were defective but I don&#x27;t want to spend more money to replace them to have them break again.</li>
    <li> it does not work it breaks yo easy and it to hard to put on so don&#x27;t waste your money go to the dentist instrad</li>
    <li> If you want to hide bad/ugly or broken front teeth.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Just see a dentist as soon as you can.If you can&#x27;t right away, there are other products like that, that work so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing these Teeth for over a year now...  Without getting into my reasons and oral descriptions, let it be known that I wear this appliance 8+ hours daily,  7 days weekly...&lt;br /&gt;With care, I make a set of these Teeth last a minimum of 8 weeks each...&lt;br /&gt;If you want a successful fitting and truly interested in achieving a great smile?&lt;br /&gt;Read On:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THESE UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE WILLING TO SPEND AMPLE TIME TO CUSTOMIZE THE FIT TO YOUR MOUTH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, perform the following steps and you too will enjoy an awesome smile whereas to me,  it&#x27;s worth the extra time &amp; effort:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1).&lt;br /&gt;Go to &amp;#34;Harbor Freight&amp;#34; and buy their $9.99 Dremel Tool. They sell an 80 piece Dremel Tool Set that includes Sanding Drums for under Ten Bucks!!!... These Sanding Drums work speedy miracles on fitting these Teeth to your mouth, and VERY quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2).&lt;br /&gt;Take the Teeth and place them into a cup of near boiling water allowing them to become soft... You can crack these in half if you&#x27;re not careful...  Once the Teeth have soaked in hot water and become soft, press the now soft  Teeth &amp;#34;Firmly&amp;#34; against your own Teeth... I do this step a few times making sure I&#x27;ve achieved the proper arch and indentation marks of my own Teeth into the backing of the Appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3).&lt;br /&gt;Take your awesome new $9.99 Dremel Tool and put one of the Six (6) included Small Sanding Drums on it and sand down the inside pink backing of the Appliance... Also sand off that troublesome &amp;#34;Lip-Ledge-Plate&amp;#34; on the pink backing while continuing to sand the entire surface of the pink backing making it nice and thin...  I sand mine down very thin to where you start to see the white Teeth becoming visible through the pink backing...&lt;br /&gt;Doing this makes for a more realistic look not to mention a very easy adaptation for &amp;#34;Lisp Free Speech&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;With the pink backing of the appliance sanded down nice and thin, the Teeth don&#x27;t stick out and look FAR MORE NATURAL!!&lt;br /&gt;With the Dremel Tool, you can have your Teeth sanded down in a matter of minutes!!  It IS the best $9.99 you&#x27;ll ever spend, Trust Me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4).&lt;br /&gt;Purchase &amp;#34;SECURE&amp;#34; Denture Adhesive... Google the stuff, it&#x27;s all over the internet... I find stores selling it for $9 delivered... This stuff &amp;#34;ROCKS&amp;#34;  because it&#x27;s waterproof and MAN does this stuff hold tight!!!&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER use the Plastic Fitting Beads that come with the Teeth... They ARE a pain in the ass to make work, and it&#x27;s not true that you can heat these beads over &amp; over &amp; over...  Trust me when I say THREE (3) times is the Max for re-heating this plastic... Any more than 3 attempts and the plastic &amp;#34;Changes&amp;#34;... It becomes stiff and simply put, is a total pain in the ass, not to mention that using the Plastic Beads adds a great deal of thickness to the Appliance making the Teeth stick out making you look like Bugs Bunny while creating a speech lisping problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, using Denture Adhesive is what it is, but in my opinion, it is worth the extra 5 minutes at days end to carefully tooth brush off the Appliance and the inside of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;SECURE&amp;#34; Denture Adhesive holds the Appliance ALL DAY LONG!!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone that is considering these Teeth as a cosmetic option...&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t be without a set.  I&#x27;ve perfected the fitting process and also learned how to speak 100% perfectly with them in place, something that took ME a full day to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace Out!!&lt;br /&gt;Steve M.✌😎&lt;br /&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada</li>
    <li> These are extremely realistic looking teeth. Used as a gag to someone that was waiting for dental work and it completely looks real!!!  Very inexpensive!!</li>
    <li> well i got these  in the mail today the packaging was very nice  , but i was so dissapointed with this prouduct i tried them ooops made me look like a chipmunk lol ok i wasted 20.oo dollars, when i put them in i could not even talk with the teeth i tried and tried ... i go see the dentist to fix my little gap, going away soon on vacation and i wanted something but i keep my mouth shut until then ..!!!!! i can only give it one starr for great packaging..</li>
    <li> seriously...its a total waste of money...i didnt even want to give it a star..its worst then when they first came out with dentures....its no where as they say realistic...its super bulky and make you have a huge overbite..i guess it would be better for someone with NO teeth..then they may appear real or somewhat...it also makes your mouth look as if its protruding in a abnormal way...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY...just save up for the snap a smile...because their like you purchased them at the dollar store..i just let my son play with it now...lol...</li>
    <li> I had extremely High hopes for this product , but it was all hopes. Don&#x27;t even think, \\&quot;oh it&#x27;s just 14 dollars, worth a shot.\\&quot; , no , it&#x27;s not worth a shot. It&#x27;s hard to keep in your mouth, even if you file it down, it&#x27;s useless. I kept thinking to myself, all these negative reviews are just ignorant people, turns out their right.save up for a saturdaynightsmile, or snap on smile., cheers</li>
    <li> I found this product very useful. I see in most other reviews people complain about the molding beads and the fact that the teeth seem to sit down too far because of the tooth rest/lip on the back of the teeth. I do not have any teeth what-so-ever on top so I did not need the molding beeds. Instead I made a plate using powder acrylic and liquid acrylic to create a moldable compound. Then I put the teeth in a cup of water I had boiled for a few minutes until they themselves were bendable and I attached them to the plate I made with the acrylic bonding agent. I wear them every day like regular dentures and eath with them. This is a very affordable way to have a beautiful smile when you don&#x27;t have costly dental insurance. I had been making my own teeth at home but could never quite get the real look to them. I am grateful for this product.</li>
    <li> I Wished the price was lower than 15 dollar. It is OK for just taking a picture but expensive comparing the usefulness.</li>
    <li> this is nothing like explained and it broke very easily, the product does not fit, this should not be even sold, i tried to contact the seller concerning this matter and never got a response will never buy from this person again the reason it has a star is cause they will not let you leave this blank</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for a cover-up, but do not expect to be able to eat with the teeth. Instant smile fits to your teeth securely and look great.</li>
    <li> Dr Bailey&#x27;s Instant Smile Cosmetic Dentures are the greatest!!  They offer a secure smile, just as promised. I can&#x27;t afford a set of regular dentures, but was tired of being looked down on for the condition of my teeth. With Dr. Bailey&#x27;s Secure Smile, no one knows what a mess my real teeth are.  The Secure Smile looks and feels natural. No one can tell they are not my natural teeth, they look great, are inexpensive, easy to use and very comfortable to wear. What more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth but large teeth so the mouth piece ended up being way too thick to look natural. I ended up taking it apart and grinding down one of the teeth to be a veneer.</li>
    <li> I gave this rating because the teeth look good but could be made of stronger plastic as a lot of people use these teeth to hide the fact that they are missing teeth. These are easy to break.</li>
    <li> No way would I ever buy this. It came broken and looks like a toy you should throw out.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely horrible. I ordered two pairs just in case there were any mishaps. The first pair snapped right in half when I was fitting them. I followed the instructions to a T, and watched the fitting video about 20 times. I figured hey, it&#x27;s okay because I have another set. Nope, they snapped in half yet again. Nothing but bad things to say for this product and will definitely warn people about it. I hope the makers of these teeth can sleep well at night knowing that they give people false hope to get a temporary better smile. If it was possible, I wouldn&#x27;t have even given this product 1 star.</li>
    <li> This product is not that bad make sure to follow instructions. It is very important to put teeth in warm water to mold them if not they will break very easily. suggestion to cut to fit moth dremel tool makes this so much easier than by hand.</li>
    <li> These look pretty real up close. There seems to be two polarized camps, people saying they are good, others saying they are junk and the Imako product is better.&lt;br /&gt;My assessment between the two is the Imako product, being much thinner, are for people with pretty good chompers to begin with and the Dr Bailey product will be too thick and protruding. If you are missing most of your teeth the DR Bailey product is the way to go. Fitting is key, both molding the teeth to the size of your jaw and then using the beads.&lt;br /&gt;Myself I have a pretty devastated mouth from antibiotics as a child, genetics, 40+ years of bad habits and a horrible diet. (bless me father for I have sinned confessional, FWIW) I&#x27;ve been procrastinating having the remaining teeth pulled and getting full dentures as several friends have and figured $13 was a very small price to maybe get used to seeing myself with a good smile and that motivating me to do it right. So the $13 for me is possibly the best money I will ever spend.&lt;br /&gt;If you are just looking for a nice smile for a date here and there these may work. They will not be like \\&quot;extreme makeover\\&quot; good.</li>
    <li> I was one of the lucky ones that was able to make this product work.  First off the lip on the inside bottom is ridiculous.  Way too bulky and makes them sit too low in your mouth, so I took my Dremel and filed it off.  I also made them a little thinner overall and filed out a hollow where one of my teeth sticks out a little to make them more comfortable.  Make sure to heat them up well before you try to initially form them to your mouth, this makes them much softer and they won&#x27;t break.  I also found that the plastic beads are only good for about 3 or so tries but I had some extra from Imako teeth that I had bought previously and you can buy extra beads.  Overall, I am quite pleased.  They look realistic in my mouth and the Imako did not.  They have much more of a real tooth look because of the fact that they are thicker and harder than Imako.  On me the Imako looked really flat and the teeth were too large looking in my mouth.  This may not be the case with everyone and I know some people prefer the Imako which are softer and therefore a little more comfortable.  All I can say is they&#x27;re probably not for everyone but they worked for me, you just have to experiment with the different brands and see what&#x27;s right for you.  I&#x27;m going to buy a couple of more pair of these as back-ups and retire the Imakos.</li>
    <li> I wonder why I even thought about buying them.  They don&#x27;t stick!  I&#x27;ve since got dentures!</li>
    <li> it broke when i try to get it to fit my mouth cheap cheap cheap!!!! i would watch out for this u are just blowing your money..  they are cheap made dont look like anything in the pics f- not even a f grade.</li>
    <li> WHEN I TRY TO PUT IN IT MY MOUTH AND TRY TO FIT IT TO MY MOUTH IT BROKE SO I AM SENDING IT BACK DIDNT LIKE IT</li>
    <li> when i recieved this order it was broken in half. i was so upset i threw it in the garbage. i was not happy with this product at all</li>
    <li> Its not as easy to apply  as stated but once i figured it out i was happy with the product</li>
    <li> i have been faithful to Buying this product for a temporary fix..Up to Now..why did Yall add a Bracket to this 1once a wonderful invention.....the new versions with the bracket is a NO GO..Do not buy this product if they are the new version..GO BACK TO THE OLD VERSION THE ONES WITHOUT THAT BRACKET ..PLEASE...they were effective..</li>
    <li> Best money I think I have ever spent.REMEMBER this is an $18.00 item,NOT a $1500.00 \\&quot;snap on smile\\&quot;. That being said,PROS: 1.Very realistic and natural looking teeth,not super,fake looking white.2.the one size fits all really does seem to fit most,I am male and it fits nearly perfect,although I have heard,for most females it may be a little big,BUT it can be bent and molded to still fit fine.3. you can customize the look of the teeth by cutting little spaces with a steak knife,between each tooth for an even more natural look. CONS:1.Must be patient and willing to try different mounting/securing methods of the teeth in your mouth,deture adhesives,etc.2.Must be careful not to drop on hard floors,seem semi fragile.3.if you want them to last a while dont be rough with them.Again,these are a temporary,cosmetic fix,but for the price nothing comes close.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have my money back. These would not work for anyone and any people who say they do they are lying or have baby teeth. There is no way for these teeth to stay fitted and I pain-stakenly followed the directions to no avail. Please save yourself the money and do not buy this product. I only got these after reading the numerous reviews that gave good feed back. I am wondering how much those people were payed or if those people are even real. Most likely anything good said is a fake person made up by the company to make their product look good.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT! AND DON&#x27;T SELL THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Teeth look very natural, but hard to fit and difficult to use, need some design fine tuning, could br more flexible.</li>
    <li> I hope these or just for fun because, rip off save you money if you ylook for cheaper way out this is not it</li>
    <li> This plastic is HARD!!!! i couldnt get it to form and the pellets that are included do not soften at all!</li>
    <li> I laughed so hard I almost choked. They are not for everyone . the teeth sit too low on me. I would have to file all the pink part off in order for the teeth to look normal and I&#x27;m not sure that would even work.</li>
    <li> Received product timely matter.the product was very hard to mold and presented bad no very bad fit.looked said they were buck teeth stuck out terribly very disappointed and dissatisfied..</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend. The teeth are a bit like dentures. I will recommend others to purchase them as well.</li>
    <li> they didn&#x27;t fit right and I didn&#x27;t like the feel of them at all. maybe good for others but I did not like them.</li>
    <li> Horrible product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teeth are bulky and make you look like you have a massive over bite. They bulged out my upper lip so much it looked like I was sucking on an orange peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they&#x27;re very fragile. I accidentally let them drop on the floor once and guess what? They broke in half just from that.</li>
    <li> Melts. Should be cost a quarter out of the bubble gum machine</li>
    <li> These are nice to look at but as far as fitting.....one size almost NEVER fits all for starters. I had to drummel the gums WAY down to even BEGIN to fit my mouth. Then....if you have your own teeth, forget it. I don&#x27;t think ANYBODYS teeth could fit in that little spot. If you DONT have teeth it&#x27;s hit and miss if your gums would fit in there. I break off the teeth I need and just glue them in with Secure. That works the best.</li>
    <li> the teeth are great as usual. ive ordered them before. the problem was that Amazon delivered them a day later than promised and i paid for overnight delivery!! Because of this i missed my sons wedding!! waiting for this delivery. I could not attend my sons weddiing with missing front teeth! i believe Amazon owes me a refund!! that was the worst day of my life!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be made pretty good but it looked very fake to me after putting them in. i ended up buying the imako teeth as well and they look and fit so much better but they are a bit more expensive</li>
    <li> I had a funeral I had to attend. I just could not face my relatives with a huge gap, decaying and yellow teeth in my mouth. I&#x27;m a popular guy among my family members and all eyes would be on me. Im in the process of have dental work done however, I needed something immediately. I came across this product through my desperate search for a new look. The product saved the day. I received it 1 day before the funeral...... right on time. I put the teeth in and wow did I look GOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!. I even looked younger and sexier. I must laugh because I had to get accustom to new teeth hiding my old teeth. It was certainly not noticed among the family. I love this product.........it gave me teeth and made me smile. I got noticed, and with a sharp suit, I looked good.</li>
    <li> TO HARD TO FIT IN MOUTH.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re waiting on dentures/partials, bridges, or crowns to be repaired or replaced...This is great alternative if you don&#x27;t want to be seen in public without your pearly whites ;-).  I would recommend this to a friend and definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Cheesy, Cheap and makes one look like a Clown as it does not conform to your mouth at all. Never buy again.</li>
    <li> If you want to throw money away just buy this!  What a joke!  This was plastic garbage, lets melt and mold teeth LOL.</li>
    <li> Fit is not that great...</li>
</ol>
