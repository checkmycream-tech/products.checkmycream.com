      <li>I love the variety of them.</li>
      <li>This set is okay for the price, but nothing spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay using them</li>
      <li>So love these masks!They work great and after using that, my face feels soft and comfortable!</li>
      <li>pretty good.</li>
      <li>Its not as forming to my face as others I have used but honestly its not bad at all.</li>
      <li>I feel rich!</li>
      <li>And also I bought the same brand of cleaning,it&#x27;s  also very good.</li>
      <li>I cannot say I have seen impressive changes in my skin after using them, but they certainly do not hurt.</li>
      <li>This is a really great product,you are able to try each different sheet mask and see which one works for your skin type.</li>
      <li>Not a bad value for the money, I will probably buy more when they run out.</li>
      <li>and I genuinely see and feel a difference with these.  </li>
      <li>The problem is that they don&#x27;t fit well.  </li>
      <li>I used the lemony one, it is so far so good</li>
      <li>This is true for all of them, and is also the case for another brand of Korean masks, so maybe they made the masks based on how they fit Korean girsl&#x27;</li>
      <li>After applying the mask on my skin for 20 minutes before I sleep, I can really see a huge difference in the morning!</li>
      <li>They are SUCH a good deal</li>
      <li>I received 12pc masks, very moisture, I love it.</li>
      <li>Also the shipping was super fast :)</li>
      <li>Quality isn&#x27;t as good as other facial mask that are 2 dollars per mask, but the deal is great and worth the money~</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The standard shipping service was faster than expected and i am very happy woth the product itself.</li>
      <li>I love that there is no mess.</li>
      <li>and the price is right.</li>
      <li>My face is left very smooth and supple.  </li>
      <li>They fit better than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but they still miss the mark.  </li>
      <li>HAHAHA!</li>
      <li>So far I only used the lemon kind</li>
      <li>Shipping was pretty fast</li>
      <li>The MAJOR problem is that they don&#x27;t fit my face very well.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend these masks to any man or woman who just wants to feel pampered.</li>
      <li>They work reasonably well, didn&#x27;t cure my girlfriends acne</li>
      <li>Really moisturized my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing they fit faces that are wider and shorter, with smaller eyes.</li>
      <li>and I particularly like combo sets because you get to try a large variety.</li>
      <li>The price is extremely affordable (less than a dollar for 1 piece of mask), and it works great on my combination &amp; sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>My whole face was so soft after using it.</li>
      <li>it is fun to try them - especially snail, pearl, platinum, gold....  </li>
      <li>The mask is too wide around the jawline plus there aren&#x27;t enough slits to be able to shape it around your jaw.  </li>
      <li>But my face is small, with big eyes, so when I fit the forehead part of the mask onto my forehead, the eyes part are not in the right place.</li>
      <li>So far I only try four of them and they&#x27;re really good😀</li>
      <li>Maybe its because my skin is sensitive</li>
      <li>I just reordered it for my 19 year old at college.</li>
      <li>It is too early for me to say if I will re-order these.</li>
      <li>It does contain alcohol, so if you have sensitive skin be aware.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Came early.</li>
      <li>I rotate them, but Im lucky enough to use one high end ones every OTHER night while using these on the &#x27;off&#x27; nights...</li>
      <li>Furthermore, the mask dried up too quickly in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I got them and noticed they are actual fabric masks to put on your face!!!</li>
      <li>A bit of a strange fit, as other reviewers have noted too, but it can be stretched and rearranged a bit.</li>
      <li>Being a facial mask fanatic, I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands of facial masks over the years.</li>
      <li>They all sting a little bit at first</li>

<li> Not a huge lot of difference between the different masks, but</li>

<li> They are a little bigger than my small face</li>
<li> Worse still, the nose part does not completely cover my nose (too short).</li>
<li> They do moisturize a little but has a ton of fragrance in it and some alcohol.</li>
<li> has a few &amp;#34;repeating&amp;#34</li>
<li> and there was a bit of burning at the beginning, but it went away after a few minutes.</li>
<li> I had to get rid of two masks (waste of money).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Am really happy about this product as its amazing in all ways. Smel, result and quantity. There is one package from each. If they put 2 more, its would be great. WoooW really the best ever.</li>
    <li> So love these masks!They work great and after using that, my face feels soft and comfortable! And I am going to buy them again!</li>
    <li> It actually made me break out. It might be just my skin though</li>
    <li> I bought the 30 pack of these and am VERY happy with them.  They fit my face perfectly.  The fragrance on these masks is present yet pleasing. Not at all overwhelming.  My face is left very smooth and supple.  I wish the parabens were not present, but....cant have it all.  This is the only mask I use with them in it and I wont give it up. They are SUCH a good deal and I genuinely see and feel a difference with these.  I rotate them, but Im lucky enough to use one high end ones every OTHER night while using these on the &#x27;off&#x27; nights...lol.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Inexpensive enough to have a mini facial every day. I wear every night overnight, and wake up feeling refreshed and moisturized. They do need to be cut in a few places to help them lay completely flat against the contours of my face, but I don&#x27;t mind and they&#x27;re worth every penny. Excellent seller! !</li>
    <li> I use it after my evening bath, while watching TV I wear the masks, to help with mousture and deep penetrating support for my skin before going to sleep at night. I love it. I have ordered this product several times. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great price, bought as a gift and she loves them!</li>
    <li> So far I only try four of them and they&#x27;re really good😀😄😊</li>
    <li> It feels so good in the skin, so many options and so refreshing for the sking, plus the price is awesome.</li>
    <li> Stocking stuffers, no feedback from my husband,  four daughters &amp; their husbands, fiance&#x27;s--but confident they&#x27;ll love them--any pampering is always a great thing</li>
    <li> Being a facial mask fanatic, I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands of facial masks over the years. Sad to say, most of the brands I&#x27;ve tried are usually overpriced and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I got to say that I&#x27;m loving Puretree&#x27;s masks! The price is extremely affordable (less than a dollar for 1 piece of mask), and it works great on my combination &amp; sensitive skin! After applying the mask on my skin for 20 minutes before I sleep, I can really see a huge difference in the morning! My skin is brighter, smoother, and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was prompt, I received my masks one week after placing my order. I will definitely order again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;ve a small face, and the masks fits well!</li>
    <li> It was an okay product, considering the price. However, it was not really effective as it described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of face essence masks and I particularly like combo sets because you get to try a large variety. This set is okay for the price, but nothing spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Ten different kinds indeed (I&#x27;ve got combo sets before that has a few &amp;#34;repeating&amp;#34; kind).&lt;br /&gt;2. The two &amp;#34;?&amp;#34; are collagen and pomengranate masks, made by the same company but of a different product series. These two are made from 100% bamboo fabric (the other ten are 100% Rayon), which I think feel nicer on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. They all have English translation in the back to tell you how to use them and the effects of each individual one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The MAJOR problem is that they don&#x27;t fit my face very well. I&#x27;m guessing they fit faces that are wider and shorter, with smaller eyes. But my face is small, with big eyes, so when I fit the forehead part of the mask onto my forehead, the eyes part are not in the right place. Worse still, the nose part does not completely cover my nose (too short). This is true for all of them, and is also the case for another brand of Korean masks, so maybe they made the masks based on how they fit Korean girsl&#x27; faces?&lt;br /&gt;2. If you look at the ingredient list you&#x27;ll realize that whatever &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; is in there is ONLY a little (it usually comes as the 10th ingredient), and the fragrance is artificial (added).&lt;br /&gt;3. It does contain alcohol, so if you have sensitive skin be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So an okay product for the price. I&#x27;m okay using them and I will not complain to the manufacturer/seller, but I&#x27;ll try something else after I finish them.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product,you are able to try each different sheet mask and see which one works for your skin type. Also the shipping was super fast :)Will definitely be buying this product again, this would also be a good gift to give:)</li>
    <li> Came early. They are a little bigger than my small face but if i pull it back it fits. They do moisturize a little but has a ton of fragrance in it and some alcohol.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of skin concerns these masks address.  The problem is that they don&#x27;t fit well.  They fit better than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but they still miss the mark.  The mask is too wide around the jawline plus there aren&#x27;t enough slits to be able to shape it around your jaw.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> Quality isn&#x27;t as good as other facial mask that are 2 dollars per mask, but the deal is great and worth the money~</li>
    <li> I got this because of the variety this pack had. However, some of them irritated my skin. Furthermore, the mask dried up too quickly in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I ordered the face masks after watching lots of korean soaps on the computer. I kept seeing the actors using it and was very curious about it. I am very satisfied with the product. My whole face was so soft after using it. It took a long time to get it but I think it had a lot to do with weather conditions up north. I just reordered it for my 19 year old at college. I will buy it again-</li>
    <li> I received 12pc masks, very moisture, I love it. And also I bought the same brand of cleaning,it&#x27;s  also very good.</li>
    <li> They work reasonably well, didn&#x27;t cure my girlfriends acne but she said she liked them so i would purchase again.</li>
    <li> They get the job done, hydrating and soothing. A good essence mask... I have had better but for the price this is great. Its not as forming to my face as others I have used but honestly its not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I got these as a Christmas gift for a friend, so I&#x27;m not totally sure how they work, but they did ship on time and I received 10 pieces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PureTree Brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raspberry (Firming and Glowing)&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea (Moisturizing and Brightening)&lt;br /&gt;Collagen (Moisturizing and Firming)&lt;br /&gt;Lemon (Brightening and Vitalizing)&lt;br /&gt;Aloe (Moisturizing and Soothing)&lt;br /&gt;Hydluronic Acid (Moisturizing and Nourishing)&lt;br /&gt;Kiwi (Firming and Nourishing)&lt;br /&gt;Pearl (Brightening and Glowing)&lt;br /&gt;Honey (Glowing and Nourishing)&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree (Anti-Trouble)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherimoa Return II Skin Brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 Mud Mask Pack&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 Pomegranate Mask Pack</li>
    <li> Have been doing some research around these sheet face mask and decided to try this one. Have just used one which is Pearl and liked the end result. It is too early for me to say if I will re-order these. Will come back once and I use all of them. Some of the fellow reviewers said that it gives a feeling of mini spa treatment and I totally concur with that.</li>
    <li> have used 2 of the masks.  pretty good. I love the variety of them. and the price is right. got two bonus pcs. nice.</li>
    <li> A while back I saw little packages with just enough cream to use 1 time for a mask at my grocery store. I wanted to get a few, but couldn&#x27;t find them anymore so I checked Amazon and found these. So I ordered them cause the price was awesome. I was pleasantly surprised when I got them and noticed they are actual fabric masks to put on your face!!! Maybe I am late, but I never even saw those before! I love that there is no mess. And my husband gets a kick out of it and says I look like Jason! HAHAHA! I would definitely get these again. My husband has to go to Korea in April and I already told him to look for these and stock up on them! :)  So far I only used the lemon kind and there was a bit of burning at the beginning, but it went away after a few minutes. It also had plenty of moisture, and I could spread the liquid from the mask to places the mask didn&#x27;t cover, such as my nose and lover chin and neck. I love them!</li>
    <li> I just received my order of these face masks yesterday and I am very pleased. Tried the lemon sheet mask yesterday and it made my face feel really nice and moisturized after I took it off. Shipping was pretty fast and I would recommend these masks to any man or woman who just wants to feel pampered.</li>
    <li> 1st time using these. I love them! Really moisturized my skin. I would like the option to choose the packets individually. I really liked the hyaluronic and aloe masks the best. and you can add a little water to use them a 2nd time since they are pricey....</li>
    <li> The mask fits perfectly on my face and I received more than 10 pieces!!! I guess, that&#x27;s a bonus! I used the lemony one, it is so far so good</li>
    <li> A bit of a strange fit, as other reviewers have noted too, but it can be stretched and rearranged a bit. Not a huge lot of difference between the different masks, but it is fun to try them - especially snail, pearl, platinum, gold....  I feel rich! I cannot say I have seen impressive changes in my skin after using them, but they certainly do not hurt. I have fallen asleep with the mask on and it did not irritate my skin. Leaving the mask on overnight did seem to tone the skin a bit. I bought thesemasks with the Dermal Korea Collagen combo pack, they arrived all together and I cannot see a difference between them. Not a bad value for the money, I will probably buy more when they run out.</li>
    <li> Great masks, bought em as part of gift bags. Love the variety</li>
    <li> So i bought these masks to properly moisturize my face once a week and overall i think they work well.  My biggest problem/concern was that one of the masks (lemon) set my face on fire.  They all sting a little bit at first but this one literally had my face burning red.  I had to get rid of two masks (waste of money).  Maybe its because my skin is sensitive, (but ive never had problems like this before).</li>
    <li> The standard shipping service was faster than expected and i am very happy woth the product itself. I recieved all 10 masks plus 2 extra!</li>
