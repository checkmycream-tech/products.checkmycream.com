      <li>Malibu Well Water is better.  </li>
      <li>My hair is too damaged to use these more than twice a week.  </li>
      <li>My hair looked much better before I used the products.  </li>
      <li>This is the best hair care treatment there is for us well water sufferers, totally makes a difference!</li>
      <li>My hair stays cleaner longer, it much brighter and looks gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>Found the project did not work for my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>The smell was fine to me.. not as flowery as some shampoos..</li>
      <li>My water is fine</li>
      <li>The condition was fine, and I didn&#x27;t even try the weekly treatments.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair &amp; well water, so it really helps keep the brassy look away!!!</li>
      <li>So I received this while on deployment after using Pantene (not that I&#x27;m a huge fan</li>
      <li>I have been using a L&#x27;Oreal product for over 5 years that is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>But I think this system will do the trick after seeing such great results after just one use.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny and smooth every time.</li>
      <li>When you get the real product this system is amazing, but not from this seller.</li>
      <li>I hope it keeps working, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s super lightweight and leaves my hair so soft and smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I was excited to get it</li>
      <li>conditioner is wonderful as I need a very heavy conditioner as well as a leave-in</li>
      <li>We have moved into a new house, and the water has not been so kind on my hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner work well to clean and condition my hair.  </li>
      <li>Made my hair feel clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>Took the dullness right out!</li>
      <li>The inclusion of all 3 products help get you on a maintenance schedule right from the start!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product one time and loved what it did to my hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo system for many years, and I was sent two bottles that say Malibu blondes shampoo and conditioner, but it is not the real thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There was no ugly odor..</li>
      <li>My hair is much healthier now too--no more unmanageable frizz, and even some SHINE</li>
      <li>Everything about the shampoo and conditioner is perfect except the smell is a little strong (but I&#x27;m sensitive to too much fragrance).</li>
      <li>For the first time in years, my hair felt clean.  </li>
      <li>The little  treatments that come with it  are great also.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel great and prevents the green buildup from our well water.</li>
      <li>Of course, as always.. I am sure those with sensitive skin should do a patch test to make sure they aren&#x27;t sensitive to this product..</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has brown hair with blonde highlights and it did the same for her; she was very happy with how her hair looked (very picky kid) and she loves the smell</li>
      <li>My hair was actually turning an orange kind of color.  </li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
      <li>Because I color my hair blonde and it is very fine</li>
      <li>This shampoo is excellent for removing rust residue, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other purple-tinted &amp;#34;blonde care&amp;#34; shampoos I have tried.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had to go back to the colorist since, they have stayed so &amp;#34;true!&amp;#34; I am SO HAPPY to have found out what was causing my hair to turn yellow and to have found Malibu Blondes products!  </li>
      <li>but I just had to here because this product really delivers!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Found the project did not work for my fine hair.  It was too drying and I ended up sending this back.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Makes my hair feel great and prevents the green buildup from our well water. Added bonus: it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this product a try since it is vegan. I highly disliked the shampoo. So much so, I stopped using it just after a few washes. The shampoo was very thick, did not lather AT ALL, and felt like I was trying to wash my hair with gel. The condition was fine, and I didn&#x27;t even try the weekly treatments. I do not recommed this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews.  I love a product recommended by my hairdresser but it is so expensive I decided to find something cheaper to do the same thing.  I have used the packaged product once and the shampoo and conditioner about 4 times.  My hair is not any less yellow and now feels like straw.  I will give away since I threw away the packaging and go bite the bullet and spend the money on the better product.</li>
    <li> use sparling will dry your hair out</li>
    <li> I typically use the hard water treatment&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t held the same results&lt;br /&gt;However I&#x27;m middle aged with natural blonde hair that is darker in the winter and this January after several uses received compliments on my hair color&lt;br /&gt;I keep on in a cap for an hair while doing household choirs then rinse w shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I think I like the hard water solution better but this work in the mean time</li>
    <li> As a blonde, we have to protect our tresses!!  This does just that and so much more.  My hair looks shiny and smooth every time.</li>
    <li> Did alright , I have iron water that damages my hair, I use this once a week, I can tell a difference, my hair is not as brassy . I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I used the crystal treatment per the package.. Oh.. how I wish I had seen the review where it was left on for 1/2 an hour.  I have 4 months of horrid iron buildup on my hair.. The 5 minutes i used it made a very noticeable difference.  It&#x27;s not perfect yet.. but I am going to go for a longer soak next week and am certain I will see even better results.  I was about at the end of my rope.  I was so darn dissapointed that the only solution might be a pricey whole house water treatment system.  But I think this system will do the trick after seeing such great results after just one use.  The smell was fine to me.. not as flowery as some shampoos.. but heck.. my hair isn&#x27;t ORANGE any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping it will reduce the terrible breakage I experienced as well.  I swear I have a mini mohawk from the well water!  The condition of my hair was great after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for another round!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok.. I waited a week and went in for round two of using the crystals.  I did use the shampoo and conditioner a couple times in the meantime (I only wash my hair about every 2-3 days to minimize drying and damage..plus we were out of town over the weekend.. so had to use another shampoo once).  The shampoo and conditioner work well to clean and condition my hair.  I do use an after shower spray leave-in conditioner.. but my hair is super damaged from both the lightening as well as 4 months of the harsh water damage...so it helps it not be complete straw to use the leave-in after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now.. on to my second crystal treatment.  Based upon other reviewer&#x27;s comments.. I decided I was going to try it longer.. and add a little heat to it.  I showered with the malibu c shampoo then applied the crystals paste to my hair and worked it in.  Then I took a shower cap and covered it (not rinsing).. and then spent about 10 minutes warming my head with a hairdryer.. being careful to keep it far enough away from the cap to not melt.  Justmoved it around to make the hair warmer than room temperature.  Then I let it sit for another 10-15 minutes before I rinsed it out.. reshampood and then conditioned with the Malibu c conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shower, I spritzed with my leave-in and then dried as normal.. and guess what???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR LOOKED JUST LIKE i HAD LEFT THE SALON!  There was no trace of the irony orange.. and my hair was nowhere near as limp and lifeless as it had been!  This product has apparently stripped all the crap out of my hair and just left it a bright highlighted blonde color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried leaving it in longer than the directions.. and adding the heat.. but I think that really did the trick.  This stuff is great.  There was no ugly odor.. and it didn&#x27;t burn.. or tingle or appear to negatively affect my scalp or anything.  Of course, as always.. I am sure those with sensitive skin should do a patch test to make sure they aren&#x27;t sensitive to this product.. but it appears to be completely non-caustic and non-irritating... at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say, is if you have hair that has been damaged by bad water.. you have nothing to lose and a whole lot to gain by using this product.  For me it is a complete hair saver!</li>
    <li> They only got 1 start because 0 is not an option. Unique Salons is the worst seller I&#x27;ve experienced. I have used this system for years, and what this seller sent me was not the correct product. Do not order from them. I never write reviews, but this experience was so horrible, I don&#x27;t want anyone to waste their money on this seller, find another seller!! When you get the real product this system is amazing, but not from this seller. Here are my issues with the crap they sent me.&lt;br /&gt;I was most definitely not satisfied with my purchase. I have used this shampoo system for many years, and I was sent two bottles that say Malibu blondes shampoo and conditioner, but it is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the bottles had no seal covering the opening. Unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the shampoo and conditioner are the same color,  and they should NOT be. They are both a cream color. True Malibu blondes shampoo is clear, and the conditioner is white. Not cream, and not matching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; is obviously a watered down version of whatever is in the conditioner bottle. When I squirted it out of the bottle it had so much water mixed in that the liquid went right through my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, this product is suppose to be 100% vegan, and the strong chemical smell was so apparent it burned my nose. Obviously, not vegan.</li>
    <li> ❤️ Love this product!!! I have fine hair &amp; well water, so it really helps keep the brassy look away!!! I also use the Hard Water Wellness formula as well!! ❤️</li>
    <li> I took a chance ordering this product. I have blonde hair which I highlight. Usually, I use L&#x27;oreal products because my stylist uses it. I&#x27;ve only used the product one time and loved what it did to my hair. For the first time in years, my hair felt clean.  The conditioner made my hair feel soft. After blow drying and flat ironing, still soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the longer I use the product. So far so good!n</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful about this bc I read great reviews, but my hair is getting more copper by the day and I use this stuff daily. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or anything but doesn&#x27;t keep my blonde, blonde either.</li>
    <li> I used as directed but did not like the results.  I have thick but fine hair that is permed and bleached.  My hair looked much better before I used the products.  The crystals seemed to strip out the brassiness in my hair but they also stripped away my perm and what shine I did have.  I washed my hair  before and after using the crystals with the Malibu shampoo and conditioner.  My hair had no body and looked dull (tho not brassy) and lifeless.  I washed it after a couple of days later with my own shampoo, conditioner and other hair products and got some body back as well as the shine back to my blonde.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this product again.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is kind of thick, but it is as expected</li>
    <li> Very nice product, but for well water issues. Malibu Well Water is better.  I would by this product again and use Well Water Shampoo as well for iron buildup</li>
    <li> Both shampoo &amp; conditioner smells wonderful!  Leaves my hair shiny soft and bright!! The treatment definitely works to brighten my hair even more b great in summer</li>
    <li> A must have for bleached hair! The water on my University&#x27;s Campus is incredible hard and has a lot of chlorine in it which causes my hair to turn slightly green. I started using the brightener every week and the shampoo and conditioner every other day, and I haven&#x27;t had any more problems. No problems with my hair becoming weak or brittle either, It always feels stronger and smoother after using the brightener. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I love this kit.  I have red-brown hair with a bit of blond.  I wanted to enhance the blond and tone down the red. It works!  I use the brightener every week or so.  My hair really likes the no sulfate shampoo and conditioner. It feels so healthy.</li>
    <li> Because I color my hair blonde and it is very fine, I am very picky about my shampoo and conditioner.  I have been using a L&#x27;Oreal product for over 5 years that is no longer available.  So I hve spent that last 6 months looking for a shampoo/conditioner combo that would take care of my hair.  THIS IS IT!!!!  This is even better than the L&#x27;Oreal product I used to use.  My hair stays cleaner longer, it much brighter and looks gorgeous.  And everyone has noticed that my hair looks so much better.  This is the second kit that I have bought.  It it really god if your travel.  It worked wonderfully while I was in Spain (very caulky water where I was visiting) as well as when I am home in FL, or visiting my childrens&#x27; families in North Florida or Massachusetts.</li>
    <li> About me:  I don&#x27;t have well water, I have public city water.  I have long straight hair.  My hair is thick, in that I have a LOT of hair.  However, each hair strand is very thin.  My hair is naturally &amp;#34;dishwater blonde&amp;#34;- so when I go to the salon I get a lot of light blonde highlights as well as a finishing rinse which lightens up my roots.  After she lightens my roots she always uses a lavender shampoo to take out any brassiness.  I was nervous that the crystal packets in this kit would bring out the brassiness.  This is not the case at all.  The crystal packets bring my blonde highlights right back to salon-day brightness and do not leave any remaining brassiness.  The crystal packets I LOVE.  The shampoo and conditioner, however, are only so-so.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I also experienced dry hair after using them.  I was fair, though, and tried using the shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks.  Results were not favorable.  I&#x27;ve stopped using the shampoo and conditioner (switched to another brand)- and now just use the crystal packets once every other week.  Amazon has the crystal packets for sale by themselves- and that is the route I will go next time.  The crystal packets get 5 stars.  The Shampoo and conditioner- 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products this shampoo and conditioner is absolutely wonderful on my hair love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> For years I spent boku $$$$ on platinum highlights to my naturally blonde hair every other month, only to have them fade to dingy yellow within 2 weeks. After being told by my longtime stylist for years that my hair &amp;#34;just had too much red in it to stay blonde,&amp;#34; I finally decided it was time to find a professional (aka super expensive) BLONDE colorist. The FIRST thing she asked me when I told her my hair always turned yellow was: &amp;#34;What kind of water do you have, well or city?&amp;#34; When I told her I had city water, her response was: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not your hair, it&#x27;s your water.&amp;#34; After doing some research, I found out that the water in my city is high in minerals and very hard, so I immediately bought a shower head water filter and purchased this shampoo and conditioner set, the blondes treatment, and the mineral treatment from Malibu Blondes. Three months later I am THRILLED to say that those highlights I paid that expensive colorist tons of money for are still there, still platinum, and still looking super natural exactly like I wanted! I haven&#x27;t had to go back to the colorist since, they have stayed so &amp;#34;true!&amp;#34; I am SO HAPPY to have found out what was causing my hair to turn yellow and to have found Malibu Blondes products!  My hair is much healthier now too--no more unmanageable frizz, and even some SHINE (I&#x27;ve never had shiny hair in my entire life!). If the choice is buying MB products or spending $200 every two months for highlights that go bad right away, I gladly choose these!!</li>
    <li> I love this product my hair looks great!!</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair looks great!</li>
    <li> Great product! Worked as described! Would definitely recommend to friends. No more brassy hair from hard water! Will reorder as needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde but my hair is bleached platinum. This keeps it glossy and moisturized, however, I find myself needing to use a clarifying shampoo every so often as it lacks a little in the cleansing department. But that&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay for how great this makes my hair look.</li>
    <li> Love it, takes the dullness,  and orange color out of my hair!!!!!!!! Will definitely order more. An tell my friends and family about it</li>
    <li> This set is no where near as good as the regular blue bottle of Wellness treatment.  Leaves hair feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> I am a very light blonde, natural. We have moved into a new house, and the water has not been so kind on my hair. It gets very brassy looking - therefore I usually go to the salon once a month and get a malibu treatment done. This shampoo is amazing - I have been using it for 2 months and it has kept my hair looking blonde with minimal buildup. I use the packets once a month.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it doesn&#x27;t suds a ton - I do have oily hair so will wash with a shampoo first than use this one again. Truly a great product for blondes!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you want to keep your hair color nice and bright.  Took the dullness right out! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I swim a LOT during the summer in my pool - almost daily - and I relied completely on this product to keep my hair from turning chlorine green.  It works!  Really nice conditioning and no hint of green at all.  Very, very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Everything about the shampoo and conditioner is perfect except the smell is a little strong (but I&#x27;m sensitive to too much fragrance). It makes my hair look very shimmery and easier to manage. My blonde highlights \\&quot;popped\\&quot; after my first use! My hair is dark blonde with blonde highlights. My daughter has brown hair with blonde highlights and it did the same for her; she was very happy with how her hair looked (very picky kid) and she loves the smell and it&#x27;s not over-powering to her.&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t tried the treatment packets yet. Amazon&#x27;s price on this kit was the best, only $19.50, while another site I saw wanted $32!&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is wonderful as I need a very heavy conditioner as well as a leave-in but I barely needed the leave-in conditioner with this product. I rarely write reviews but I just had to here because this product really delivers! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products from this company :)&lt;br /&gt;PS, we have hard water so that may make a difference of how this product works from reading the other reviews.</li>
    <li> The inclusion of all 3 products help get you on a maintenance schedule right from the start! I have always had excellent results with Malibu products.</li>
    <li> So I received this while on deployment after using Pantene (not that I&#x27;m a huge fan but it&#x27;s a small selection). Wow! What a HUGE difference! My hair feels like I chopped half of it off, it&#x27;s super lightweight and leaves my hair so soft and smells amazing! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Gives your hair it&#x27;s shine back. It also helped removed the orange color from my hard water.</li>
    <li> Hair is sillier &amp; less brassy.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for blondes without harsh additives and chemicals it cleans pollutants out of your hair and enhances the blonde !</li>
    <li> I just recently started dealing with well water. I did not realize the effects the water had on my natural blonde hair, until my mom commented on the orange hue and straw like texture of my long blonde hair. this product is great! helped restore my color &amp; gave me back my soft texture! I have tried many, many products and this is def the best!!</li>
    <li> I have hard water and blonde hair, which is not a good combination.  My hair was actually turning an orange kind of color.  After just one use of the Malibu product, I was blonde again!</li>
    <li> Makes my straw like hair soft and manageable. I have strawberry blond hair with an orange cast due to well water. Even with a water softener, my hair was suffering. This shampoo/condition/ treatment really makes a difference int he texture and color of my hair. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I kept getting dark deposits in my hair. I bought this product on a recommendation from a hair stylist. It dried out my hair and made it smell like well water. Made my hair darker which is the opposite of what I wanted. It was so terrible I threw it out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner will strip all the hard water deposits or other chemicals from your hair with the first application, and you will not only notice your hair is bouncier, more manageable and shiny, but it is blonder as well! Wonderful product and worth the money, especially if you pay to have your born blonde locks a little brighter with highlight.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel clean and shiny. Great product</li>
    <li> Amazing hair-care system for hard-water sufferers! I have tried many, many different shampoos and treatments to remedy the effects of hard water (despite a water softener and iron filter system, my well water still tends to turn my blonde hair gold/red over time). This shampoo is excellent for removing rust residue, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other purple-tinted &amp;#34;blonde care&amp;#34; shampoos I have tried. The weekly treatment is fantastic and really makes an immediate difference, removing red/orange tones and well water build-up in only 5 mins. The conditioner softens without weighing down fine blonde hair. Great stuff, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are very gentle, yet do clean your hair and leave it soft and shiny,...I am ordering more of the shine product that came with it because that really perks up blonde, especially dyed blonde hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff about a week, and it seems to work. I have really bleach blonde hair, and its still bright blonde 4 weeks after getting highlights. I hope it keeps working, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Love the effects of this shampoo but I hate the way it tangles your hair up sooooooooo bad I don&#x27;t understand why I have never had tangled hair and its pretty and soft again as soon as it&#x27;s brushed? --- Took to my stylist to solve the mystery.. Seller sent me bad product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner package is my favorite set. It is perfect for blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this from amazon excited to try these products after reading all of the great reviews.  We have very hard water where I live and I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner that would counteract that.  After 2 uses of this system my hair was completely dried out.  It felt like it was one more wash away from being straw. Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t use this system again.</li>
    <li> I have Highlighted  thin blonde hair.  This shampoo and conditioner works great for my hair type.  The conditioner feels light and does not weigh my hair down. I feel like this does keep my blonde brighter for longer.  The little  treatments that come with it  are great also.  I will reorder the whole set when I am finished with the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  This is the best hair care treatment there is for us well water sufferers, totally makes a difference!</li>
    <li> Thank you to previous reviewers who described their success with Malibu Blondes Wellness Kit.  My hair was blonde long ago, then I was mousy brown with gray coming faster every month.  It is color treated with a light brown and blonde highlights.  It had turned into dull red with dull orange highlights thanks to Florida&#x27;s hard water.  One single treatment of Malibu shampoo and conditioner has turned my 2 month old color treatment into light brown with blonde highlights and it is softer than any other hard water shampoo or conditioner (or any other product out there--I&#x27;ve tried many).  I used approx. one tablespoon of each, I have short hair--I suggest using sparingly until you see the amount for your length and thickness, no sense wasting it.  Well worth the price.  Shipment was fast with very good packaging.  I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> good price she loves them</li>
    <li> My hair stays SUPER soft and manageable, love the little packets to boost blonde</li>
    <li> Blondes need to stay blonde...this product revives my glorious goldens and stripes the buildup of the elements.  Smells goldenlicious!!</li>
    <li> I have horrible rusty well water that has turned my light blonde hair ORANGE! After just one use of the crystals and the shampoo and conditioner I can tell a huge difference in the texture and color of my hair! It looks and feels so much better than before! I only had enough time to leave the crystals in my hair for about 15 minutes under a shower cap. Next week I Iwill leave it on for 30 minutes under a shower cap and add the heat of the hair dryer for maximum effect. I will write another review and let you know how it goes. I am very happy with the results so far! The product also has a very pleasing scent. It kind of smells like Sunflowers perfume by Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love all Malibu C products, but especially the Blondes kit. I have naturally very light blonde hair and any little bit of hard water/chlorine etc will damage my hair. This kit keeps my hair in the best shape. It smells so good and works better then any shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Also, it is all natural so you won&#x27;t have anything stripping your hair. This stuff never feels dry and it makes my hair so shiny!! I love the packets too I use one a week and my hair feels extra clean after using them. This kit can get pricey, but my hair is important so it&#x27;s worth buying it regularly.</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my life!! I recently took a trip to Mexico and after washing my hair just one time, my blonde hair turned RED/ORANGE. I had no clue what caused it, but after reading online, saw it was probably iron/rust in the water. I thought I was going to have to go back to the salon to get my hair re-colored, but decided to try this after reading the awesome reviews. I left the crystals on for 20 minutes and used a blow dryer to heat up, and after washing out, my hair was blonde again!!! I am THRILLED and will keep this on-hand in case it happens again during my travels.</li>
    <li> I did not like the way this made my hair look or feel. Another hair product to be tossed. I was excited to get it and then was disappointed with outcome. My water is fine so maybe that had something to do with it. Did not like at all....</li>
    <li> Awful!  It dried out my hair.  My hair is like straw now.</li>
    <li> My highlights always disappear within 2 wks, due to the iron in my water. The pack of crystals (left on for 1/2 hr), shampoo and conditioner brought back my color and dissolved the orangey iron crud in my hair. Finally! I found something..</li>
    <li> I have highlighted hair that is damaged so my hairdresser told me I needed to brighten the blonde and told me about this. What a big difference! I have hard water that turns hair brassy and the blonde was looking more brownish red than anythingelse. I started using this and wow, blonde, blonde, blonde. Bright and shiny and full of life!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after my stylist spoke of it, since I had well water.  This definitely makes blonde hair fresher looking and feeling.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the conditioner smells like alcohol and doesn&#x27;t moisturize much.  My hair is too damaged to use these more than twice a week.  If it weren&#x27;t for the conditioner, I would have given this five stars.</li>
