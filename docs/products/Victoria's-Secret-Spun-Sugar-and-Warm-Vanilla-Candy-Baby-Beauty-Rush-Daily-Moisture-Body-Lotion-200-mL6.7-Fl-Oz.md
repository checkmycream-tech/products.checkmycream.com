<li> Long lasting .</li>
<li> I am very sensitive to heavy smelling lotions and this one is not</li>
<li> I must say I was constantly reminded of a couple other lotions out there that is currently being sold.  </li>
<li> It is a closed friend&#x27;s favorite fragrance and she has been very disappointed that she could not find it.</li>
<li> Victoria&#x27; Secret needs to bring this one back</li>
<li> I put the product on myself and tested the scent for a few hours.&lt;br</li>
<li> I noticed where the lotion had been on my arms there was a slick feeling where the lotion had been, even though I had used soap to wash it off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find now.</li>
<li> They use a base scent on all their lotions which makes them identifiable as BBW lotions.</li>
<li> I used to get it at victoria secret for 3/$25.00</li>
<li> This has been discontinued by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
<li> So sad this item comes once a year for semi annual sale.</li>
<li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
<li> I find this base scent annoying because of the lingering sweet sickening smell.</li>
<li> I hate VS discontinued and nothing else they have smells like it...</li>

    <li> Love this lotion. this is my husbands favorite lotion that i have bought in the past and i couldn&#x27;t find it anymore till now.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrant lotion. It&#x27;s hard to find now. It came quickly but was leaking a bit even with bubble wrap on the dispensing side but all in all I was vey happy to have my favorite lotion again.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved this scent and passed along to her friend also to purchase also, great smelling stuff!! thanks again</li>
    <li> My husband got me this thinking it would smell like sugar cookies. It does but it smells more very sweet candy like than warm vanilla sugar cookie. Still good though.</li>
    <li> I received the lotion that I had ordered for my daughter. I put the product on myself and tested the scent for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lingering heavy sweet scent. I must say I was constantly reminded of a couple other lotions out there that is currently being sold.  I am an avid shopper of Bath and Body Works. They use a base scent on all their lotions which makes them identifiable as BBW lotions. I find this base scent annoying because of the lingering sweet sickening smell. This lotion has the exact same base.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 hours the lotion was still powerful. I was happy to shower the lotion off. I noticed where the lotion had been on my arms there was a slick feeling where the lotion had been, even though I had used soap to wash it off. With all this said, It never reminded me of cotton candy. However, it did remind me of similar scents at BBW: Warm Sugar, or Vanilla Bean Noel. Mix the two together.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied.  I just hope there is more lotions and body spray. Does anyone have more? Thank you!</li>
    <li> My wife choose and I don&#x27;t mined it because damn it smells good. She loves victoria secret and this was a great deal.</li>

    <li> Absolutely love this product . The smell is amazing  and I recieved it pretty quickly :).</li>
    <li> This product does not smell like the same product that is sold in VS Stores and I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This has been discontinued by Victoria&#x27;s Secret. It is a closed friend&#x27;s favorite fragrance and she has been very disappointed that she could not find it. I was very please to find this gift.</li>
    <li> Smells great why do they discontinue everything that&#x27;s good :(</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion . It smells delicious and really made my skin feel so soft. Long lasting . Had no problem with seller and came early . I definitely recommend this lotion.</li>

    <li> Great product, at least that&#x27;s what she said</li>
    <li> This is my Favorite.....don&#x27;t want to use nothing else!  So sad this item comes once a year for semi annual sale.</li>
    <li> i ordered 2 spun sugar &amp; warm vanilla  candy warm baby but only got 1 . the other 1 is wild raspberry &amp; bright strawberry</li>
    <li> The product reached me extremely fast but it was super thick(unlike the one i have) it was more like a crem than a lotion and i still have the ones i bought from VS when they did have it and it no where near smelled the same. I couldn&#x27;t really smell it at all and I know all of the beauty rush collections were extremely strong.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and works great! Non greasy and feels great! Victoria&#x27; Secret needs to bring this one back, men everywhere think this smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I got exactly what i wanted. The only problem i had was on the bottles the price is only $12. I kinda feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this everywhere even in the store and they do not carry it anymore!  this is the only one I can wear</li>
    <li> An all time favorite for a reason.... The scent of Candy Baby is truly delicious. It is a bit like cotton candy and vanilla icing together making it a comforting, feminine, sexy scent.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive so I could get it more often. I used to get it at victoria secret for 3/$25.00</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because my wife was happy with the product if shes happy im happy.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that when we recieved it it was damaged and it was replaced right away no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great buy and seller</li>
