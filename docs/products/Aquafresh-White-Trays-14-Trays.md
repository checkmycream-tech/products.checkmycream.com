      <li>Great price and cannot find in the store.</li>
      <li>this is where strips win over these trays.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>This will greatly stop you from salivating which will move the trays around.    </li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>So this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>and it looks great on her.  </li>
      <li>This product was rely great.</li>
      <li>They try to flop around in your mouth, the gel comes out and it does not taste that great.</li>
      <li>Plus, the whitening isn&#x27;t as a great as Crest.  </li>
      <li>I love them!!  </li>
      <li>These things are amazing!  </li>
      <li>I used to use Listerine Dissolving Whitening Strips, and they were just as excellent with more convenient strips - however they discontinued those.</li>
      <li>Best of all, no piercing, stinging,pain etc. :)&lt;br /&gt;FYI</li>
      <li>Wish this product was sold in more stores but am happy that amazon still carries it!</li>
      <li>but happy with the end result and now about 2-3 weeks after still looking good and no pain or sensitivity.</li>
      <li>The flavor is pleasant, as well and there was no burning or aftertaste, whatsoever.    </li>
      <li>The product is good.</li>
      <li>I did not see the \\&quot;expires 8/11 GOOD UNTIL THE END OF AUGUST\\</li>
      <li>good result</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit teeth perfectly, but there is ample gel to cover almost all of the tooth.  </li>
      <li>in all if you are looking for a product that works, this is a good one.  </li>
      <li>you are salivating when putting the trays in, you will not get good contact of gel to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;SOMETIMES</li>
      <li>GOOD LUCK GETTING THE GEL ON THE FRONT OF YOUR TEETH.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Aquafresh trays do a good job of holding the hydrogen peroxide gel against your teeth.  </li>
      <li>This is especially true with the bottom teeth.    </li>
      <li>...deal with it guys for good outcome.</li>
      <li>DO NOT MAINTAIN GOOD CONTACT OF THE GEL TO YOUR TEETH.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Get it at a good price and you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not so good.</li>
      <li>(FYI: For reviewers that complain about gum bleaching, this is the answer to your woes because the trays will fit your teeth perfectly and not get bleach goo on your gums)</li>
      <li>The day after I finished my treatment the tooth pain stopped and I&#x27;m all good.</li>
      <li>so good job.</li>
      <li>I salivated from the gel, which tastes a bit minty, but not as good as some toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>This product is great I will buy more results just as good as dentist</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t get a very good fit.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the results, and have recommended them to friends.</li>
      <li>All I can say is I love these because my daughter loves these!</li>
      <li>This is the first trays I&#x27;ve tried that work on me and makes me very happy!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I think they put more thought into the packaging than into the product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these before and absolutely love how they work!</li>
      <li>For saving the expense and trip to the dentist, I found these to be quite worthwhile!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now lets be honest...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get why this product would have any kind of advantage over the strips?</li>
      <li>I really liked that.</li>
      <li>however, the goop inside the trays doesn&#x27;t spread too effectively over the surface of the teeth and instead spills out into your mouth.  </li>
      <li>The trays honestly refuse to stay in place.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of the trays (that&#x27;s what dentists use),and</li>
      <li>Once I get them in place I cannot release the pressure on my teeth at all or they slip, some of the gel comes out into my mouth, and they are not as effective.</li>
      <li>I liked using these Aquafresh trays.  </li>
      <li>i am very happy and everyone in my house already wants to order some for themselves.</li>
      <li>This product is certainly effective.</li>
      <li>Honestly, what did you expect it to feel like when you put peroxide in your mouth???  </li>
      <li>This is a nice product, but it did not work for me.</li>
      <li>those made my teeth tender and the results werent as effective</li>
      <li>These are not custom fit trays, so I did not expect a perfect fit.  </li>
      <li>Leave on full 45 mins and you will be soo happy...</li>
      <li>Work great, even on my sensative teeth and no bad taste.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product probably 5 or 6 times, and I&#x27;m fairly happy with it.  I had previously tried Crest strips and they didn&#x27;t seem to stay in place.  Perhaps the newest ones from Crest do, but I haven&#x27;t tried them.  I liked the idea of the trays (that&#x27;s what dentists use),and perhaps I got less irritation because the trays keep the gel inside and you don&#x27;t get much contact with the mouth tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main observations are these:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Obviously the trays are one size fits all.  They were OK….you put one on and then smooth out the gel so it gets on all the fronts of your teeth.  It&#x27;s not big deal to do that, really it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I had best results from leaving them on 45 min. to an hour each time.&lt;br /&gt;3.  They did not irritate my gums, but clearly some people are more sensitive than others in this.  I expected burning, but they did not burn me.&lt;br /&gt;4.  This box is for 7 days…you could do it every other day, but I usually did it every day because I wanted to be done with it.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I always get very much whiter teeth, so I&#x27;m always pleased.  In fact, a LOT whiter, to the point where I was monitoring towards the end to be sure I didn&#x27;t end up with unnaturally blindingly white teeth as some people do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially wondering about the trays as they don&#x27;t extend far enough to cover ALL your teeth and seem to be mainly for the fronts.  As I&#x27;ve been reading reviews, I read one that said the dentist trays are much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main negative, and I would suspect this is true for these or for any of the strips:  I pretty much can&#x27;t talk while wearing them.  I usually put mine on before taking a shower, then leave them on for the shower and doing hair etc. and all the other stuff I do.  That takes up a lot of the wearing time.  I always tried to get at least 45 minutes (I think the box said 30 min.) and sometimes got as much as an hour.  Perhaps that helped, but I could do that because they weren&#x27;t irritating to me.  As long as you don&#x27;t talk, the trays stay in place quite well.  If they start to get loose and fall down, it&#x27;s easy to push them back in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering if the new Crest strips might be better, but they are still strips and they cost a LOT more.  This Amazon price is actually the most reasonable I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> It does whiten your teeth, however the bottom tray doesn&#x27;t stay in place - on me anyway. It kept sliding up and getting stuck together. While trying to unstick it and put it back in place, the gel kept sliding out.  The top tray was fine. I&#x27;d give it 2.5 stars since it half&#x3D;worked.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t order this off amazon I bought mines in the stores but beware! This product has damaged my 2 front teeth after only 2 treatments!!!!! I have a crack going down my teeth from this product and the bottom doesn&#x27;t stay on my teeth were tingling I only left the product on for 30 minutes for both treatment even though it said 45!!!! Never again!! This is straight crap!</li>
    <li> This is the best otc whitening product I have ever used.  It is effective, it doesn&#x27;t cause major tooth sensitivity and it is convenient.  My only complaint is that the bottom trays are too small.    Listen, I read all the reviews and I have to say that the folks giving this impassioned negative reviews don&#x27;t seem to understand that some things work and some things don&#x27;t depending on the person. I&#x27;ve tried most otc whitening products out there and this is, for me, the best one.    I hate Crest Whitestips.  I abhor them.  They hurt my teeth, burned my gums, bleached my fingers, made my mouth hurt for weeks and absolutely didn&#x27;t work.  BUT I know numerous people who love Crest Whitestips. Crest Whitestrips works for some people, doesn&#x27;t work for others.  I don&#x27;t know why the Crest product doesn&#x27;t work for me and Aquafresh trays do, but I do know that, as with any selection of products, you have to try out different kinds before you find what works for you.     If you&#x27;re serious about bleaching: brush your teeth for a couple of weeks before hand, during, and after with sensodyne or a similar product to cut down on sensitivity.  Consider using the trays or strips of your choice less than reccomended, ie once a day instead of twice.  Don&#x27;t brush your teeth right before or after using the product, wait at least an hour.      And to the crazy reviewers that are engraged about the product?  Holy cow, take a breather! Return the item for a refund and try something else! Maybe you should see about valium infused whitening products next time.</li>
    <li> I had been using the white strips and decided to try the aquafresh white trays.  They DO whiten your teeth, but the bottom tray will NEVER stay on, ever. Top tray is good and reliable and works if you only want half of a white smile. Again, the bottom tray wouldn&#x27;t stay on and didn&#x27;t cover my teeth completely.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, good and bad. And decided to try the product anyway. The negetive reviews were right. This product is awful! The trays are cheap paper type material,they do not stay on and the gel burns your gums. I took them out after 5 mins and my teeth felt sensitive already. I am taking these back tomorrow.    Going to try Crest Whitestrips next.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 years... every 6 months I do a teeth whitening!  It&#x27;s easy to use although it doesn&#x27;t match perfectly your teeth; it&#x27;s fast and it shows results!  Most importantly you can control the whitening process and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper then going to the dentist.  I recommend it! And I recommend you buy it from the Amazon because usually it&#x27;s cheaper than in your local pharmacy...</li>
    <li> Found this at a discount store for only $15 so decided to try it.  After using only 2 times, my teeth are NOTICEABLY whiter.  These work much better and faster than crest whitestrips. Even if I have to pay full price for these next time, I will definitely buy again.  Upper tray stayed in place pretty well but lower was a little more problematic....however it still worked ok.  You do have to press against teeth and kinda smear gel whitener over teeth.....no biggee.  Once that&#x27;s done, they stay in pretty well for the 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 14 year old son who drinks coffee...After 3 days I could tell a difference and after 6 days his teeth are dramatically whiter!  He tried the crest whitestrips and colgate brush on whitener but they didn&#x27;t work for him.  His teeth now are beautifully white!  The trays are a little bit of a pain but the whitening is great!</li>
    <li> This is not a fluke/ I just got my baces off and wanted to whiten my teeth the over the counter way before shelling out Big $$$. After the 2nd treatment I noticed burning in the gums and much sensitivity with brushing. After looking closely at my gums, they were peeling where they come to a point between the front teeth. The trays don&#x27;t even cover my average size canine teeth, so the bottoms are more discolored then the whitened tops now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My wife is also using the product too, and shared with me that she is experiencing the same burning and skin peeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will be calling the company! The instructions are very vague. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your tags: aquafresh white trays, teeth whitening, whitening, oral hygiene, white strips &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because I am not convinced that the other whiteners out there actually work. I have tried the whitening strips and was always disappointed with the results. The trays work great, and they only left my teeth a little sensitive, but that just means that they work like they should!</li>
    <li> Originally purchased white trays from local drug store.  They are much less expensive thru Amazon and arrived the VERY quickly to my doorstep.</li>
    <li> I have to confirm what most of the disappointed buyers say:    1. The trays are cut out of a plastic that do not always fit your teeth. While upper part fitted OK, the bottom one did not even touch the front of my teeth unless I pressed it with my fingers.    2. Gel makes your gums white... whiter than your teeth ;) for approx. half an hour after taking trays off. Then you can see a bit of bleeding. I did not have this problem with any stripes.    I only regret that I have not consulted Amazon&#x27;s reviews prior to buying - it would have saved me some money pain and disappointment.</li>
    <li> I tried this product today and was very disappointed.  The trays were flimsy, would not stay in place, and the whitening liquid foamed into my mouth.  It was a very unconfortable and unpleasant experience, and I could not tolerate the trays beyond 20 min (suggested time was 45 min).  This was disappointing because I had hoped for an improvement over the typical strips.  The price was also high for a product that will now go into the garbage.  I think I will go back to the strips and avoid Aquafresh products in general after this experience.</li>
    <li> The white trays I got were messy and the gel broke apart alot and caused alot of salivation! Weird!  I don&#x27;t feel the bottom tray did anything  Top tray whitened my teeth some, but the results weren&#x27;t as dramatic as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> 1. Read the Directions&lt;br /&gt;2. Follow the Directions&lt;br /&gt;3. Done and White!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO Easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for 45 minutes, 7 days in a row, No Pain!&lt;br /&gt;Keep the Gel on your teeth, don&#x27;t press it out of the tray and onto your Gums!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dentist Noticed and ask what I did.  He said it was Very even whitening, unlike the results from many strip products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never got the STRIPS to work, they are Too much of a Hassle.</li>
    <li> I also had the same problem with the gel being released into my mouth.  I didn&#x27;t see a noticable change in the coloring of my teeth either</li>
    <li> Yes this is not a custom made tray.  If the upper hurts trim that part of the tray a minute amount, 1-2mm.  Be minimal about this so you do not ruin the tray.  That is what I do.  Don&#x27;t make your teeth so white that you look strange.  I am 71 and nobody my age would ever have brilliant white teeth.  My daughter does that and it looks great on her.  I love this product.  My upkeep is once a week.  The product is gentle enough for me with a lot of skin, tongue and mouth conditions.  I would never change brands for that reason.

    <li> My friend showed me these and after reading reviews I was skeptical. But, get them! If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth that is. I smoke cigs and these take my teeth from a yellow tint to bright white. I&#x27;ve bought 3 boxes, and won&#x27;t stop!</li>
    <li> Works to a certain extent, but not really. It burns my gums and leaves my teeth with what looks like fluoride white spots. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried many whiteners and this is my favorite so far.  They are easy to use.</li>
    <li> My teeth are already white but after two years of drinking 3 cups of coffee a day, they&#x27;ve become dull.&lt;br /&gt;After only three days of using this my teeth are back to their original shine.&lt;br /&gt;Had a slight problem with my gums being bleached on day 2 which at the end of the day wore off. (although my gums were very sensitive for the next two days)&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for a quick and lasting teeth whitening experience</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product since I had just gotten my braces off after 5 years, after a few days my friends stopped me telling my how much brighter my teeth look. My teeth arent WHITE-WHITE but definitely alot better. My Spainish teacher pointed out my \\&quot;pearly whites\\&quot; during class.    I did alot of research on the product and people spoke about gum irritation. I had no problem with the product, but I put vasaline on my gums before use just in case, this is recommended. I liked the product, especially for its price.</li>
    <li> So after about 3 days I realized that my upper teeth were starting to show signs of the yellow stains being removed. They looked much brighter overall as well but my bottom teeth were still the same. Every time I took the bottom tray out the gel would be gone because the spit glans at the bottom of your mouth loosen the gel and you spit it out or swallow  it. The upper tray work really well and the gel stayed in place. So the next time I tried laying down with my head back to the spit would drain back in to my mouth and not go near my bottom teeth and it didn&#x27;t work.     So I am thinking how can I make the bottom stay dry and it hits me put a CLEAN towel in you mouth after you put the trays in to adsorb the spit. If it get to wet put in another and this should stop the spit from loosing the gel on the bottom tray. I know that it is and inconvenience but This will work.     The trays design is not the problem but the two spit glans at the bottom of you mouth. Stop them and the gel should stay in place.</li>
    <li> I have just received this product (very fast delivery) and have used them only once. The bottom was almost impossible to put on. The top was a bit easier, but you have to keep your teeth together for 45 minutes or they fall right off! Don&#x27;t know yet how the whitening actually works, but I will post later.</li>
    <li> The Aquafresh trays work best! I&#x27;ve tried others and they are just as much and DO NOT have the fast results that you get with these. I notice after 3 uses. I love it!!! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I did read reviews half good half bad but i didn&#x27;t think it was THIS bad. The trays honestly refuse to stay in place. It took 2 tries for me to get them to stay in my mouth (by clenching my jaw for the 45 minutes of horror) To notice that after all of the gel slips and slides around (and out of the tray) that only HALF of my teeth were whiter after every use. Luckily the effect seems to fade (as in my teeth don&#x27;t look as nice and shiny white as they do right after i remove the trays) by the time i wake up in the morning which i find rather odd considering i don&#x27;t eat after i use the trays. Over all I&#x27;ve gotten alo&#x27;t more results from using whitening mouthwashes for less of a hassle.</li>
    <li> I like these.  I have tried other systems (strips, washes, rinses, special toothpastes) and these do the job.  I have a sensitive constitution and a lot of dental work, however, I had no gum sensitivity or bleeding of any kind -- and I am finicky.  The gel takes some practice to master.  You need to hold the tray to you teeth and spread the gel up and down, both to distribute it evenly and have a more satisfactory result, as well as to keep it in place.  I leave them on for an hour, so as to get my money&#x27;s worth and there has been no discomfort whatsoever.  I do not want to have blue white teeth - just a whiter version of natural enamel and this achieves it.      When finished, I always brush my teeth to remove the gel - sometimes with the new foaming, whitening Aquafresh toothpaste and sometimes with food grade peroxide and baking soda, making a paste.  It takes off all the residue and my teeth and gums feel clean and sterile. The flavor is pleasant, as well and there was no burning or aftertaste, whatsoever.    I cannot say that some people will not experience sensitivity, but since I have not, I was surprised and pleased.  Some people will not finesse the &#x27;installation&#x27; - patience and skill are required, but it beats having a dentist or specialist do it for many times the price, and the same result.</li>
    <li> White trays are really good, I have used them in the past and have had excellent results.. Only con is if you have sensitive teeth it will bother a bit.. Other then that great product..</li>
    <li> It was my first experience using products like these. I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes to the color of my teeth myself, but would use the product once in a while. I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it too much though.</li>
    <li> If I got the top on, couldn&#x27;t get the bottom on, &amp; vise versa.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping to save some money over Crest Whitestrips, however it ended up being a complete letdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the trays dont stay in. My only solution was to hold my mouth with my hands for the entire time. After using them, my teeth were severely sensitive (not normal after other whitestrips). After using them a bit more, I noticed inconsistent whitening that caused marks to appear on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand clear of these and buy Crest Whitestrips. You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> have used these several times to get rid of my yellowing from smoking,they work great and are easy to use</li>
    <li> After user #1 I was REALLY impressed.  My teeth were noticeably whiter--almost gleaming.  After use number two I noticed a bit more whitening but not as dramatic.  On use # 3 I felt some discomfort after putting the trays in.  After about 1/2 hour it was really starting to hurt and I thought something must be wrong so I took them out.  My gums were bleached white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1/2 an hour.  However, there was some lingering damage done that, while not severe, is annoying (there is still a slight bit of bleeding).  I have perfectly healthy gums so I was surprised by this...the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out.</li>
    <li> It whitened my teeth a little but not to the extent advertised. And it was very messy! You have to leave the trays on for an hour, so if you want to do it make sure you have no one you need to talk to and that the phones are off the hook. Its very inconvient and it sortof irritated my gums. Also its very foamy, so like I said, messy. Goodluck</li>
    <li> I used this product for two days.  The first day wasn&#x27;t painful at all, but I was nauseated after using it for the maxiumum length of 45 minutes.  The second day I noticed some discomfort about half way through that same amount of time.  By the end of the 45 minutes that second day, I was nauseated again, one of my front teeth hurt badly, and my gums and lips were chemically burned to the point that I had blisters that took three days to heal.  I&#x27;m too afraid to put them in again.      I did notice my top teeth were slightly whiter, but it did nothing for my bottom teeth.  I originally purchased this product over others because I thought the trays might cover more teeth than the others (instead of just the front four), but this wasn&#x27;t the case.  Not only did they not cover more teeth, they also did not reach to the top of the teeth they were supposed to cover.  So they are short both in width and in height.  Overall, I have to say it was a terrible waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different tooth whiteners since they have become easily available over-the-counter several years ago.  I am by far the least impressed the Aquafresh White Trays.  I have chemical burns on my gums, the gel slides out as I wear them and I inevitably swallow at least some of it, which makes my stomach hurt, and I cannot move my mouth at all while using them (the recommended time to leave them on is 30-45 minutes) or the bottom tray slides off.  I have seen noticeable whitening of my teeth with this product, but no more than with other products I have used in the past.  I will not purchase this particular product again.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of bad reviews about this product before I bought it. I had been using Crest whitestrips but they just were not doing the job, so I figured I&#x27;d try my luck with the Aquafresh trays despite the poor reviews.  I must say I am pleasantly surprised.  I experienced absolutely none of the uncomfortable effects that others reported, and I am shocked at how white my teeth got after even the first use. I have a feeling that because I have used many whiteners over the years (including custom dental trays from my dentist before over the counter whiteners became popular)my teeth and gums are less sensitive than most people&#x27;s.  I would definitely recommend the Aquafresh trays, but perhaps not for a first timer.  I think you should probably work your way up to them, maybe by using whitestrips first.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that a couple of the bottom trays did not fit as well as the tops.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over how difficult people are to please about this product.  It is an over the counter product at a very reasonable cost.  For saving the expense and trip to the dentist, I found these to be quite worthwhile! For the picky folks out there, I will address these complaints below:    1. The product will not be perfect. If you need perfection, I would advise you to save money and go to the dentist!    2. The trays will not fit everyone perfectly.  They do, in my opinion, have much better contact and comfort than whitestrips.  If you want custom fit and comfort, see point number 1.    3. Okay, there is a bit of minor, and I mean minor burning and irritation to gums.  This is no different from any other teeth whitening product on the marker. Honestly, what did you expect it to feel like when you put peroxide in your mouth???  Sheesh!    4. It&#x27;s goopy - yes.  I needs to be goopy to stay on your teeth.  Wipe it off and get over it.  Again if you can&#x27;t handle goop, see point number 1.    5. The flavour is actually not bad!  But if you are expecting something like chocolate, you will be sadly disappointed.  Again what can you expect when trying to cover up the taste of peroxide and such ingredients!    6. I saw results almost immediately and great whitening after the full 7 days.  But guess what?  It&#x27;s not perfect or as white as a dentist could get it.  And as before, if you require perfection, see number 1.        So, overall for the price I think it is good value and easier to use than whitestrips.  I have a whiter smile and no side effects to speak of. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> So, I used these last week and I still have strange white spots on my teeth. The product package says that it is temporary and will go away with continued use, but I&#x27;ve used the 7 days worth and waited a couple days and the spots are still there. I also did not like the way my gums felt afterward. They were sore and one time the white tray bleached them and my gums were burning. It was quite painful, actually. I would not recommend these. I think my teeth may be a tiny bit whiter, but not worth the $30.00, the pain, or the trouble, especially if these white spots stay on my teeth!</li>
    <li> What a pain to use - and a complete waste of money.  I thought the trays were terrible - they didn&#x27;t fit my teeth and then kept falling off.  I ended up using my own night guards to see if this worked better - the solution burned my gums and really made my teeth sensitive.  I finally quit after 4 nights.  I truly would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a week straight. I used it at the same time every night, and brushed my teeth prior to use just to make sure it was actually whitening my teeth and not food residue. I also took pictures prior to each use to see the progress. My upper teeth whitened slightly (mind you, my teeth were not even very yellow or discolored to begin with), but it did not whiten my bottom teeth at all, at least not noticeably enough. Also, the gel always stayed in the upper tray, but always leaked out of the bottom tray which is why I think it didn&#x27;t work. I was not satisfied and feel like I just wasted $35 and people will not even notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Things seemed well with these the first three days of use. They weren&#x27;t horrible. They didn&#x27;t fit very well but I really did feel like they worked good.  I can tell after 4 days my teeth are very white!  However, today I had an interesting experience that I hadn&#x27;t had before.  My gums were burning while I had them on.  I took them off early (after only 25 minutes) because I couldn&#x27;t take the burning anymore.  When I took them off I looked in the mirror and my bottom gums were sore, swolen, and WHITER than my teeth!  UGH!  They still hurt a few hours later.  I probably will not use these ever again, nor will I recommend them to anyone!  I think I&#x27;ll stick with whitening strips!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a giant step backwards.  The \\&quot;trays\\&quot; are like primitive white strips.  They are just awkward.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They do whiten very well, quicker and faster than the white strips in my opinion.  But, the negatives are pretty big.  The gel expands or something and really burns my throat and makes me nauseated.  I&#x27;ll finish out my pack, but never buy again.</li>
    <li> I really, I mean REALLY, wanted to like these.  I love the concept, but the trays are very flimsy and don&#x27;t make anything like a \\&quot;custom\\&quot; fit.  A lot of the product came out from the back and the sides.  I just got too grossed out thinking of what I was swallowing!  I gave it two stars though, because the gel did whiten pretty well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using the crest whitening strips but they weren&#x27;t as dramatic and the taste was horrible if you even got a little on your tongue. I&#x27;ve been using these for 5 days now with breaks in between because of my sensitive teeth. They stay on and the taste isn&#x27;t that bad at all. One thing I do hate about it is that sometimes random little dots of the gel will accidently slip out and I won&#x27;t notice til I taste it on my tongue and it causes me to gag out of reflex. So when I wear these I usually have tissue by me incase so I can get the blob off. You can talk with these but you sound ridiculous as expected. I usually wear these when I&#x27;m taking a 30 min-1 hour nap that way I&#x27;m not tempted to talk. I would def. recommend these because the difference is dramatic.</li>
    <li> I used these trays and was very happy with them and they worked well (note: you are not going to get movie star white teeth using this product - that&#x27;s why celebs spend thousands of dollars).  Some reviewers have stated that using these trays hurt their teeth and/or gums.  I felt no pain at all and I used them 7 days straight, but if you have sensitive teeth you might want to use them every other day.    Tips:    -- Put in trays when you are not moving around a lot.  -- When you put in the trays, massage them over your teeth to spread the whitening paste.  -- To prevent excessive salivating.....lay down on sofa or couch with your head leaned back and watch a TV program.  This will greatly stop you from salivating which will move the trays around.    Hope this helps, I really liked this product and signed up for the Amazon Subscriptions 6 month plan which offers discount on units.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, it will be the worst 45 minutes of your day. If I even saw these at the dollar store I wouldn&#x27;t buy them. First of all the trays don&#x27;t fit right, I can&#x27;t imagine they will fit anyone right unless you are the one they molded them after. Second, the gel that is in them oozes out and into the back of your throat causing you to swallow it quite often, it&#x27;s awful and gross. The other thing is, don&#x27;t even think of talking with these in, because they will come loose and once again the gross gel will ooze out. I&#x27;m very disappointed that Aquafresh would put their name on these. I have found the best whitening product is the Rembrandt strips, they stay on your teeth and you can talk with them in, they stay on better than the crest whitestrips, although with both, I think you will get the same result.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. The trays are very thin, filled with little ropes of gel that is too thick to spread and cover the teeth. So when you \\&quot;gently press tray with fingers to spread the gel onto and around teeth\\&quot; as instructed, it just oozes out over the tray in whole chunks of gel, which you then have to spit out, becasue they are floating uselessly in you mouth. I&#x27;ve tried them on three separate occasions and the rest is going to the trash. Just does not work.  I&#x27;ve tried three or four other bleaching systems over the years that have worked much better. This is the worst, by far. If I could give it \\&quot;0\\&quot; stars, I would.</li>
    <li> I just used the trays for the first time and at about 15 minutes I had such a sharp pain happen that I spit out the trays (and the gross gel) into my hands and had to go rinse my mouth out.     Upon checking my teeth to see what happened I noticed a BIG crack running down the entirety of my front left tooth. It doesn&#x27;t really hurt anymore and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s on the surface, but it wasn&#x27;t there before I used this.    You can bet that I&#x27;m calling the company on monday and that I&#x27;m going to go get this checked out by a dentist.</li>
    <li> This product is really difficult to use! I&#x27;ve used crest whitestrips and these trays are more difficult. The product shifts in the mouth and I&#x27;ve wasted like half of my trays. I&#x27;m going to try to get a refund.</li>
    <li> I whiten my teeth about every 4 months. I always used Crest Whitestrips because they had the strongest whiteners, but didn&#x27;t like the way the strips slid around my mouth. I then found \\&quot;American Fare\\&quot; brand at Kmart (which are still #1 in my book - I&#x27;ll explain after.)    I was reluctant to try Aqua-Fresh because they were about $5 more then Crest, but after hearing they had even stronger whiteners I bought them. I give them 1 star because I do feel that they did whiten my teeth better and faster then anything else I&#x27;ve used but the delivery system makes them unbearable and I&#x27;ll never buy them again.    Trays are to small, gel seeps out everywhere *GROSS*, I think I swallowed more then got on my teeth. I gagged and choked, you can&#x27;t even open your mouth with these things in let alone TALK. So you have to be completely silent and spit out clumps of gel that seep out the entire 30-45 min. I don&#x27;t even think I have to continue.    Try \\&quot;American Fare\\&quot; from K-mart. They have the exact same solution as the Crest which all dentists recommend, they&#x27;re $10 cheaper then the Aqua Fresh, and the trays are made of *wax* so they will mold to your teeth. (I always do the \\&quot;Primum 7 day\\&quot; who wants to use this stuff for 14 days anyway?)</li>
    <li> When Colgate took \\&quot;Simply White\\&quot; off the market I was devastated.  It actually whitened my teeth better than anything else and was cheaper and easier to use.  Aquafresh White Trays don&#x27;t whiten as well and are not that easy to use.  I don&#x27;t know who they&#x27;re making the trays for because I have a pretty small mouth and I can hardly get them to cover my teeth.  And I&#x27;ve tried many different strategies, too.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the Whitestrips either.  I don&#x27;t find that they whiten enough.  I&#x27;m hoping something new comes out one of these days that really works!</li>
    <li> My husband love this product. It is very effective and makes your teeth white in short time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and I have seen improvement in the color of my teeth. However, the product is absolutely disgusting to use.  My experience today was pretty typical.  I put the product in my mouth and found the tray would not stay in without providing support from lower lip/mouth.  The trays need to be pushed somewhat against the mouth in order for the gel to be evenly distributed around the teeth.  However, the gel has an alarming tendency to leak out of the trays and find its way into your throat.  Flattening the trays to provide even distribution only makes this more likely. Once the gel gets into your throat you will find yourself desperately spitting/coughing/hacking to get it out.  To illustrate, I used this product a few hours ago from 7:00 to 7:30.  From 7:30 to 8: 36 (present time) I have spent my time trying to get this stuff out of my mouth/throat.  I have brushed my teeth twice.  I have gurgled twice with listerine and dozens of times with water.  I have coughed and gagged dozens of times. In short, this product is disgusting to use.  I also would say this is probably a typical occurrence for many users. I say this because I am using this product as part of a dental study and after calling up and reporting this problem I was told that it was expected that users would swallow some of the gel because they couldn&#x27;t be expected to not swallow for the 30+ minutes during which they would need to have the trays inside their mouth.  All in all, I would think there has to be a better product out there than this.  If not, I don&#x27;t want to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> These trays hold in place better than Crest Whitestrips.  I can only use them for 2 days in a row, then need to take a day off before continuing for another 2 days.   Otherwise it makes my teeth sensitive and my gums turn white.   No different than Crest Whitestrips but with better whitening action.  The taste is better and so is the fit.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee and red wine and I need a little whitening boost every once in awhile. Usually, I use Crest Whitestrips but I had seen advertisements for these and figured the tray design might be better than the strips, since after all, that&#x27;s what dentists use.    Well, I should have just stuck to what I knew worked. The design of the product is materially flawed, and it just doesn&#x27;t work very well. The trays are literally tray-shaped - they are flat in the front as well as the back. I don&#x27;t know about most people, but my front teeth are shaped like wedges, not bricks. Basically, the design of the trays means that you have to bend and fold the trays around your front teeth to get them to stay on. Which leads to the second problem - the directions instruct you to push on the trays to spread the gel around so it covers the teeth. Well, the first night I used these, I pushed on the trays too hard and the gel gooshed out all over my mouth. YUCK. It stings the back of your throat. I ended up having to take the tray out, gargle with water - I had tears in my eyes! - and put the tray back. The next night, in order to avoid pushing the gel out of the tray, I didn&#x27;t push it as hard and I realized that I wasn&#x27;t getting very complete coverage over my teeth. This, to me, is ridiculous. With Whitestrips I don&#x27;t have to worry about positioning the product so that I get appropriate whitening coverage - it&#x27;s part of the product design. I don&#x27;t get why this product would have any kind of advantage over the strips? Plus, the trays are not very large and didn&#x27;t cover the same number of teeth (in my mouth) that the deluxe Whitestrips did. I have larger teeth and I definitely show more of them when I smile than these trays cover. I honestly almost did not continue using the White Trays because of all these issues, but I had paid money for them and didn&#x27;t feel like hassling with the return, but at the same time, didn&#x27;t want them to go to waste.    As for the whitening effect - it was fine - after three nights I had some whitish spots on my teeth that went away the next night. After 7 nights my teeth were noticeably whiter, but not as white as they had been the last time I used Whitestrips. Probably because the gel had covered my teeth insufficiently.     Would I buy this product again? NO WAY! Not when there is a competing product out there available at a comparable price that is far easier to use and gives better results. With Whitestrips you just put them on and go, there&#x27;s no positioning involved, you don&#x27;t have to worry about spreading the gel around to get even whitening, etc. There&#x27;s way too much work and guesswork involved with this product to make it worth it. Honestly, I think Aquafresh needs to take this product back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> so easy to use.  trays stay in place and do not slide like crest whitestrips</li>
    <li> Just what does everyone want ???  Whiter teeth AND total comfort AND great taste?!  Good grief...can&#x27;t you suck it up and suffer just a tad for the whitest teeth on the market in just 7 days??!!!  These things are amazing!  I&#x27;ve tried so many different whitening systems - including paying a lot of $$ for custom trays (they take weeks to work)from my dentist. The Aquafresh White Trays are definitely the quickest and most economical way to go. I plan on doing it again in 6 months - just like the directions suggest!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I noticed a difference with in 3 days. I have tried Crest White Strips as well, and thought this was a  much better product. The trays stay on your teeth, and you can even have a conversation if you want to!. I highly recommend this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so I bough one box at Walmart. It&#x27;s not worth it, that&#x27;s my conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like material, and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started to feel a vague pain in my gum.  Nevertheless, I continued using the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is barely visible. I hope you will have better luck.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before buying the product and there are people who absolutely love it and those who swear wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I&#x27;ll try to be as objective as possible...  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:  &lt;br /&gt;The product works. It whitens my teeth after the first use, and the result became very obvious after 3 uses (as it claims), so I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tray Design:  &lt;br /&gt;The tray fits my mouth quite well (but I have a small mouth... I even wonder how it would fit bigger mouth since the tray is kinda small.) Spreading the gel so that it fully covers the teeth isn&#x27;t easy. I noticed that the top part of the teeth are whiter than the bottom (especially the bottom teeth.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Side Effect: &lt;br /&gt;The gel DOES hurt the gum. I read other reviews and people have been complaining about bleached gum. My gum didn&#x27;t get bleached, it didn&#x27;t turn white, but it bled!!! The part of the gum closest to the teeth turned red because of the bleeding and there&#x27;s also minor peeling of the gum too. It hurt pretty bad when I brushed my teeth. The bleeding only happened the first two times... I guess my gum got used to the gel since it didn&#x27;t bleed after the third time (however, still hurt a little.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  &lt;br /&gt;It does the job. It whitens your teeth, but comes with a price... hurts your gum!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, here&#x27;s what I do:  &lt;br /&gt;The first two trays I used them two days in a row (like the instruction says) and on the second day, it&#x27;s really painful on the gum. So I waited one day before doing the third one and my gum didn&#x27;t hurt as much. I would suggest using it every other day (or you can try two days between use)... I think it helps with the tooth sensitivity (which I didn&#x27;t experience as much as when I used the Crest White strip) and the painful gum.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to use as it did not want to stay on your teeth. The gel was also hard to spread around on your teeth. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> You will notice a difference in as little as 3 days! I noticed my stains were gone and my teeth were whiter.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product, the design of the disposable trays are weak. The trays don&#x27;t cover the majority of your teeth, and the bottom trays are even smaller in size. If your mouth is the size of a kid, they may work fine. But I would not buy this product again, and I&#x27;m applying for a refund.</li>
    <li> This product burnt the roof of my mouth... and didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth.  :(</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband. We were VERY dissapointed. The trays are too small and very gooey. The taste is horrible. We don&#x27;t know if they whitened his teeth, because he could not get through the first day. I tried them the next day, and I agreed. They went straight to the trash.  Save your money or try something else.</li>
    <li> This product is poorly designed. The trays are flimsy such that they generally will not stay in place. The gel is meant to be pushed against your teeth so that the trays and gel will always cover the surface of your teeth, but this mechanism does not work. The gel is not adhesive enough to stay in place. You will often find clumps of it come out the edges, forcing you to either swallow it or risk losing the entire tray when trying to spit the gel out. Perhaps the intensity of the gel would work better than that of competitor&#x27;s white strips, but since the gel rarely stays on, it&#x27;s impossible to tell. I will go back to strips and stay away from these trays. It was a true waste of money and I regret having tried what I thought would be more like a professional teeth-whitening kit.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much changes after 7 days. It bleached my gum and peeled the gum between my two front teeth, and it also irritated my tongue. However, all this discomfort were bearable. I am not going to buy it again because it didn&#x27;t bleach my teeth much.     I had a lot of foam and saliva during the treatment, so I am not sure if that is the reason the outcome wasn&#x27;t so good. I used Colgate whitening gel before, and it didn&#x27;t work either. Therefore, I decide that I am going to let dentist bleach my teeth next time. Hopefully, I would have better luck.     Use it before you brush your teeth will reduce the irritation to your gum and teeth. I could go for 45 minutes when I used it before I brushed my teeth.</li>
    <li> The nice thing about these trays is they are fairly easy to use. However, I found they do not completely cover my upper or lower teeth (maybe I have big teeth) and they do not seat really well on the teeth.  If you get them on properly, they do stay in place pretty well.  But, it took me a day or two to get them on properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is very thick and does not easily spread out to cover the teeth.  If you just put the trays on and do not \\&quot;squish\\&quot; them down to spread the gel, you&#x27;re going to end up with uneven whitening.  Overall, I think I like the way the Crest White Strips work a little better.  I thought the trays would be easier to use.  But, I will probably go back to the Crest product when I need my next round of whitening.</li>
    <li> This should have a huge warning on box!  I used one tray of the 7 day treatment, for only the recommended time. Not only did it burn but it permantly destroyed the dentin inside my teeth making them translucent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth now appear grey along the bite line (incisal edges).  A single 45min treatment (as described by the packaging) did not whiten my teeth but permantly bleached away the tooth color leaving grey edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not whiten my teeth regularly, the last time was a crest whitestrip 5years ago (with no problems).  This was a single treatment of the recommended 7 and it permantly damaged my tooth color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently many females have translucent incisal edges, and the is absolutely no warning on the box about this potential side effect!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure these make your teeth whiter but the are very uncomfortable and you pretty much drool the whole 45 min you have them in.</li>
    <li> I cannot stand this pain! I just used aquafresh whitening trays on my teeth, i&#x27;ve been having pain for 5 hours already and it doesn&#x27;t go away, i took 3 painkillers, doesn&#x27;t help! it hurts! aaa...</li>
    <li> The first two-three days were fine but day four, the trays burned my gums white and in one spot, brown!  It hurts.  Plus, the whitening isn&#x27;t as a great as Crest.  The trays also aren&#x27;t large enough for long teeth and they don&#x27;t whiten the backs of teeth; only the front.  Coloring on the back of teeth and affect the color seen by people when you smile.</li>
    <li> I made a video review &amp; demo for the Aquafresh White Trays! Check it out here:   [...]</li>
    <li> I have no idea how effective the gel is because I cannot even get the trays to stay in place around my teeth, especially the lower one.  Did they actually test these trays on human subjects before going to market?  This is the worst  teeth whitener product I have ever used, including the generic versions.</li>
    <li> Hey there, i am a teenage who wanted to whiten my teeth but i didnt know where and how. I found these crest white trays and bought them when they were only two dollars. Anyway, i used them the first day that i got them and they work great! It only took about three days to get my teeth as white as a piece of blank paper. by the seventh day, my teeth were glowing. Before i got these trays, however, i read other reviews that talked about stinging of the teeth and white spotting. In my experience, there was a bit of a tingling sensation but it was nothing painful or long lasting. Also, the bleach on the tray did leak down to my gum one time and it did create a white spot, but that is nothing to worry about because it is perfectly normal, it doesnt hurt, and it goes away within the hour. So, all in all, this product worked fantasticly and it lasted al very long time. in fact, my teeth are still white and it has been months sinse i last used the product. i strongly recommend! good luck!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many gels, strips, trays, etc. These are the best in the long run. The first time you use them you may feel some irritation and it can vary from none to painful. You may notice spots on your teeth that are whiter than others. This will go away and blend by the end of your first or second use. My teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight and the trays take some getting used to as far as getting the gel evenly covered over all your teeth. But you&#x27;ll learn what works for you. I leave them in for the max 45min. I use them twice a year and I get so many compliments on my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product would work better if the trays stayed in place and the gel could spead over your teeth evenly.    I found even after five days the bottom tray hard to keep in place and most of gel going down my throat!    The whitening/pain ratio is about the same as Crest strips. I found minimal irritation with average results.    Please take back to the DRAWING BOARD for better results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the 3rd day and noticed a significant improvement after the first use.  The trays have stayed on my teeth easily and that hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  I don&#x27;t think the gel tastes bad at all -- it&#x27;s minty.  I&#x27;ve felt slight tooth sensitivity, but my teeth are already sensitive and that&#x27;s a consequence with any peroxide based whitener.  All in all this is an effective, convenient, relatively inexpensive, and non-messy product.  I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> They are a waste of time and money. They put goo in your mouth and not as much on your teeth.  After a week, my teeth are the same color as when I started.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and am thrilled with the upper tray.  The lower is not as easy for me because my lower teeth are a bit uneven but none the less, the whitening is so dramatic.  I actually ended up taking the upper tray and using it on my lower teeth for more coverage.  I give this 5 stars, but in my opinion, I would like Aquafresh to re-design the lower tray to match the size of the upper.   &lt;br /&gt;The strips and paint on methods never worked well for me.  The Aquafresh product was absolutely fantastic.</li>
    <li> These taste so much better than Crest white strips. &lt;br /&gt;pros: did see whitening, tastes okay &lt;br /&gt;cons: some of the gel does come out the back and can&#x27;t talk with them in, but they stay on better than the strips (I just use them for a half-hour when talking isn&#x27;t necessary eg.working out, watching tv, getting ready in the morning). &lt;br /&gt;A good alternative to professional whitening.</li>
    <li> This product does not whiten like I expected and the trays are awkward and not maliable enough to conform correctly to your teeth. Also, the gel doesn&#x27;t hit every spot so the tops of my teeth aren&#x27;t the same color as the base. And when you&#x27;re done with it it leaves big chunks of gel in your mouth that made me gag. I also had to search all over for how long to leave them in...it&#x27;s not on the instruction insert but on the box in tiny little letters.  &lt;br /&gt;Instead of these go with Crest Professional Whitestrips. You can&#x27;t get them in stores--I could only find them online.</li>
    <li> They actually worked.  It is a generic fit on your teeth, so they slip and slide around and your mouth ends up filling up with peroxide foam, but it actually did whiten pretty well.  It takes a couple of trays to figure it out.</li>
    <li> This product is certainly effective. I noticed a difference after the 1st use. They are somewhat uncomfortable to wear both trays at the same time, but worth it for the results. My teeth were a little sensitive the next day, but nothing unbearable.</li>
    <li> Simple to use.  Great results in a short amount of time.  Delivery to your door saves a lot of time.  The dentist is pleased, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim at the super market the other day (I wish I had checked online first since it&#x27;s $10 cheaper on Amazon). I gave it a try, and yes my teeth did hurt a bit if I used the strips for three days in a row, so I used them about twice a week, sparingly. At first I didn&#x27;t think I noticed much of a difference. There were a couple white spots on my teeth that I was unhappy with, but they went away within a few days. Then about a week later  I bought a brand new white shirt. It was perfectly white, and my teeth matched it! It was the best feeling in the world! These strips WORK! I know a lot of people complained about your saliva taking the gel away from your teeth, I felt the same way, but it didn&#x27;t effect the end result!</li>
    <li> It remains to be seen how much they actually whiten.  I&#x27;ve completed three nights.  I will agree with others in terms of the fit, especially the bottom tray.  It has very little give so I can&#x27;t get a very good fit.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues with sensitivity or gum bleaching.</li>
    <li> This product made part of my gums white and puffy after wearing the trays for 20 minutes.  I have healthy gums overall, so I guess they are \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.  The whiteness has subsided after about 30 minutes but I will not use this product again.  Be careful and if your gums sting, remove the trays and rinse.  Better yet -- don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 complete rounds of whitening (5 days each).  I found the trays easy to use -- you do need to follow the directions &amp; found that they whitened well.  I did have some tooth sensitivity but have had that with other whitening products, including professional whitening like Brite Smile.  I will continue to use the Aquafresh product.</li>
    <li> I usually use Crest White Strips for my twice-yearly whitening, but saw the commercials for these white trays and thought they might be less messy than the strips.  Boy was I wrong!  Problemo numero uno?  It&#x27;s EXTREMELY difficult to get the trays to stick to your teeth.  They are so poorly shaped - like tupperware.  You know, like when you get one side closed, but the other side pops open?  Secondly, the trays are teeny-tiny.  They must&#x27;ve been designed by oopla-loompas who were embarassed by their pearly yellows.  The gel (which is very thick and looks like it&#x27;s been drying out for months) clumps up and oozed out of the trays, irritating my gums and turning them white, despite putting a little vaseline on them to protect them.    The one postive thing is that my teeth don&#x27;t feel sensitive like they do when I use crest white strips.  The kit I bought comes with a special toothpaste that prevents sensitivity, to which I credit the lack of teeth problems.  No tooth whitening product is a walk in the park, but it shouldn&#x27;t be this dreadful.  I will definitely be going back to crest strips.</li>
    <li> Messy and does not work</li>
    <li> I am only on my second day and am afraid to finish the pack.  I had the trays on for 45 minutes as instructed and when I took them off my gums looks damaged.  They were white and discolored, but now the color is returning.  The gel really hurts my gums.  I&#x27;ve used Crest strips and did not have this much tooth and gum pain.  It&#x27;s not worth taking the risk of using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 13 year old son who has always had yellowish teeth.  He had tried the Crest Whitestrips but hated the taste and he could never get them to stay on his teeth properly.  So here is the simple review: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  Whitening:  The trays definitely made an improvement in the color of his teeth.  They are whiter and brighter. &lt;br /&gt;2.  Taste:  He said the taste was ok and was significantly better than the Crest Whitestrips. &lt;br /&gt;3.  Fit:  He thought the trays were much better for keeping them on his teeth but not convenient for talking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall he enjoyed his experience with the White Trays but the gel did not go all the way up to the gum line, so he does have some residual yellowing but he said he would use them again.  He did experience the gel dripping out the back of the trays the way some others have reviewed this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end, we would buy them again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> but now after I&#x27;ve used the product it looks so nice and natural. so good job. only thing i didn&#x27;t like about the product , in day 2 it was in my mouth the kit and after about 30 minutes i got a sharp pain in my tooth i spit what ever chemical that&#x27;s in it out and was relived to know that after a few moments the pain went away. the days after that I&#x27;ve decided not to push the time and after 20-25 minutes i removed it and it was enough for me. but happy with the end result and now about 2-3 weeks after still looking good and no pain or sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Hurts my gums and made my teeth very sensitive. The trays doesn&#x27;t stay in place and you began to drool. Seemed to scratch and made my teeth look very transparent.</li>
    <li> These are the best way to whiten your teeth at home, especially for people with sensitive teeth. I used to use Crest strips, but they started causing me to have sharp pains in some of my teeth. I switched to these trays and have been pleased with the results. They don&#x27;t hurt my teeth and they work. My only issue is that sometimes you&#x27;ll get a tray that has the gel unevenly distributed, but I just use a q-tip and move the gel around in the tray. Seems to solve the problem.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth don&#x27;t buy this. It hurt so bad. And you have to wear it for 45 minutes for 7 days in a row. I think that is a bit much. But that was my experience, after the 3rd night, I stopped....</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I get the Aquafresh compared to other brands. These seemed to work ok, I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in my teeth. I probably wil try something else next time. The downside to these is it really makes your teeth tender later on. Don&#x27;t drink coffee or wine after because it&#x27;ll stain. BAD! And nothing cold for at least 12 hours I&#x27;d say. It&#x27;s kind of a pain in the butt because you really have to plan your diet around them. You&#x27;re not supposed to have brushed your teeth immediately before either so brush then get ready for bed and then try them on just before. My best suggestion that way they have all night to work and they&#x27;re not interrupted by eating, like if you had used them in the morning.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice an overall dramatic whitening, but now I have very very white spots on my teeth. The gel sits in the bottom of the trays and you have to squish it to get it to cover up to the gumline. It was very hard for me to get an even distribution and now I have very noticeable white spots along the line where most of the gel sits at the bottom of the tray. Now I have to figure out what to do to fix the white spots! (it says in the package that they are temporary, but these have lasted for days).</li>
    <li> This was the first time that I have used a product to whiten my teeth and I was pleasantly surprised at the results of the Aquafresh trays. They showed an actual whitening after the first use and upon completion of all the trays, had whitened my teeth substantially. I have since tried the other whitening strips, but find that your product is much easier to use. The trays stay on your teeth much better than the strips and I like them much better.I would recommend your product over anything else out on the market today.</li>
    <li> I have used a million varieties of whitening products, but this one is definitely the best. It whitens so much more quickly and effectively than other means. My only complaint is how sensitive they make your gums; I naturally have sensitive teeth/gums, but the trays temporarily exacerbate the pain a great deal. It&#x27;s worth it to me, though.  &lt;br /&gt;My experience with whitening strips is that the resulting whiteness is very temporary, and my dentist tells me this is because they&#x27;re not permanently whitening my teeth and they look white because the ingredients dehydrate my teeth. She said this is also because I am young and that whitestrips work better on older teeth. These whitening trays have results that last A LOT longer. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Um....yeah...that&#x27;s pretty much it. For someone who just needs a little clean up, this will work just fine. the trays are easier to use and not as messy as strips.</li>
    <li> I honestly cannot understand why this product got so many bad reviews! I bought these because the taste of Whitestrips make me gag, and you have to wear whitestrips twice a day for at least 7 days to get any result. I will never buy Whitestrips again! Aquafresh&#x27;s White trays are much easier, and work a lot better! In just 3 days I could notice a considerable difference. I thought the gel tasted much better than the whitestrips gel...this gel is citrusy and fresh tasting. Also, the white trays fit my teeth perfectly and did not slide all around in my mouth. (I do have small teeth...if you have big teeth these might not be the right product for you.) The only downside is they do cause some sensitivity, which most whiteners do. I am very pleased with the results, and have recommended them to friends. I had no pain or whitening of the gums which some of the other reviewers complained of. I loved these!</li>
    <li> I have tried Crest White Strips, Rembrandt 2 Hour Whitening Kit and various other off brand gels.  This product is messier than the others I have tried, but it whitens the best.  It took until my third day to get the trays in comfortably and so there wasn&#x27;t gel floating around in my mouth.  It&#x27;s true that there is potential for gum bleaching and chemical burn, but did you really think doing this was good for you? You just have to be careful to not get the gel on your gums or in your mouth.  If it squishes up to your gums, slide a q-tip under the mouth piece to wipe it off.  I didn&#x27;t have problems.  Use this product carefully and correctly and you will get great results!</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. The worst whitener I&#x27;ve ever used. I got 20 minutes into the first tray and nearly died from the pain. The goo is too firm and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, so it just pools and collects unevenly on the teeth and gums. The flimsy little tray does not conform to your teeth and just causes more problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve used Crest as well as Rembrandt, both with decent results. I think from now on I&#x27;ll stick with Crest. It&#x27;s very expensive but worth EVERY penny.</li>
    <li> These work really well!!! Just feels like a retainer.</li>
    <li> Yes, I tryed the new Aquafresh Trays, and do not like them. Agree with most others, the trays do not stay put/do not fit teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big chunks of gel,ends up in your mouth, and its GROSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to the Crest Strips.</li>
    <li> You know... I tried these. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the white strips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried hydrogen peroxide (which just so happens to be the main ingredient in most whitening products). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Out off all of them, the hydrogen peroxide works the best. 5 minutes a day swishing the generic store-brand 3% stuff around my mouth and within 2 days, my teeth are MUCH whiter than they were. Now if I&#x27;d quite smoking, they&#x27;d actually stay that way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But seriously. These things are really uncomfortable if you don&#x27;t have totally straight teeth and they feel like they&#x27;d be a tight squeeze even on totally straight teeth. I&#x27;d avoid them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And besides... &amp;lt;2 dollars for hydrogen peroxide... over 30 for these!? No-brainer I&#x27;m telling you...</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product before i read the reviews.  In my opinion the trays stay on better than the strip kind.  There is alot of whitening goo that you press into your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place.  The first morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was becuase i pressed too hard.  I havent had the problem since.   &lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after 7 days.  My gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly.  The pick color returned within an hour. It really isnt as bad as the other reviewers make it seem. &lt;br /&gt;All in all if you are looking for a product that works, this is a good one.  I was truly surprised at how well they worked.  I will be purchasing these in the future.</li>
    <li> only for those people with no crowns or bonding on teeth...it will only work on natural tooth enamel, Too bad they don&#x27;t tell you that before purchasing!!!!</li>
    <li> I will give both the PRO&#x27;s &amp; CON&#x27;s about these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;*it does make a noticible difference as far as whitening, I noticed a difference after the first use&lt;br /&gt;*you&#x27;re done in 5-7 days&lt;br /&gt;*it didn&#x27;t taste horrible to me, kind of minty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;*more expensive than other whiteners&lt;br /&gt;*the trays are HORRIBLE. My teeth are smaller &amp; my teeth straight but these didn&#x27;t fit at all. Most people would not be able to fit these on their teeth correctly&lt;br /&gt;*it did burn my gums. I&#x27;ve used other whiteners and never burned my gums&lt;br /&gt;*made my teeth more sensitive &amp; painful than they have ever been. Sometimes just sitting with the tray in my mouth I would get a shooting pain through my teeth. I kept getting pains for a couple of months after using these. And I&#x27;ve never gotten any pains with any other whitening product before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. The trays will not fit the majority of peoples teeth, they are more expensive, burns gums, makes teeth sensitive and again I have to say how horrible the trays are, did I mention that the trays were horrible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time around I would use Crest White Strips. They are cheaper and although they take longer to use, my teeth didnt get sensitive, my gums didnt get burned and those will form to any teeth. Plus, look at all the positive reviews compared to the many negative reviews on these.</li>
    <li> These are, by far, the worst choice for whitening. The \\&quot;trays\\&quot; don&#x27;t mold to your teeth at all, they are extremely flimsy, they feel horrible, and they don&#x27;t stay put. The whitening gel is disgusting, like thick mucous, and it made me gag when I took the trays out of my mouth because of the way it was hanging on parts of my teeth and the texture is gross. I wish I had \\&quot;listened\\&quot; to the others who reviewed this product that had similar things to say.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews of this product it made me realize many people are VERY hard to please.  The mechanism of action behind most tooth whitener products is to hold hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (which breaks down to hydrogen peroxide with urea in your mouth) solution in contact with the teeth for a predetermined amount of time according to the concentration of the particular product.  Aquafresh White Trays are no different - rather than a strip they use trays.  When hydrogen peroxide stays in contact with soft tissue, especially irritated soft tissue, it is normal for a burning sensation and temporary discoloration to occur in sensitive individuals.  The Aquafresh trays do a good job of holding the hydrogen peroxide gel against your teeth.  You do have to use your finger on the front of the trays to spread the gel around evenly, but is that really too much work?  These are not custom fit trays, so I did not expect a perfect fit.  I noticed visible results after a few applications and was pleased with the performance of this over-the-counter product.  If you have sensitive teeth then be wary of tooth whitening products as they often increase sensitivity.  You can either keep the trays on for a shorter duration or use a potassium nitrate based toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth (Sensodyne, Colgate Sensitive, etc.) for several weeks prior to, and during, the whitening process.  This should alleviate a lot of the discomfort.  All in all I liked this product better than the strips because the gel is able to penetrate better into the spaces between your teeth ensuring a more well-rounded whitening process.</li>
    <li> good product, not what i expected but, after 3 of this you can see the difference...</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer in the fact that some people are just hard to please or too ignorant. The hydrogen peroxide will bleach your gums and make them very sensitive. This is true of all teeth whitening products.    Difference between trays and strips:    1)The tray is much more rigid so you dont feel like they are slipping especially when saliva begins to build. This is especially true with the bottom teeth.    2)The tray has a more condensed area of the whitening gel so it is easier to get them on your gum if not put on correctly. Also, if not placed correctly, you might not have enough gel to cover to the top of the teeth.  (Make sure you get the teeth behind the gel and then push on the tray to spread it.)    3)The tray&#x27;s rigid structure makes complete coverage of teeth very hard. So, I feel, like the incisors and canine is more bleached than the front molars.    4)Aquafresh whitening gel is better tasting than Crest&#x27;s.    All in all, I rather use the tray. I like how the tray never comes loose because of excess saliva unlike the crest strips.</li>
    <li> These are my fave!! Great price and cannot find in the store. You will love em too. My dentist always says I have \\&quot;above average white teeth\\&quot; and I drink coffee everyday!! Love it.</li>
    <li> The product works really well, but it does have some downsides. First of all it&#x27;s an universal size so it won&#x27;t fit everyone&#x27;s teeth. While the upper tray was covering my gums, the lower one wasn&#x27;t big enough for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth started hurting me after the 3rd day of wearing it and the pain got worse until the 7th day. And the pain is really bad, even though I&#x27;ve used the recommended toothpaste. I couldn&#x27;t even fall asleep because of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this was only happening after wearing it. The day after I finished my treatment the tooth pain stopped and I&#x27;m all good.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I love these because my daughter loves these! It is the only tooth whitening product that she will use, stating that the others do not work anything as well as these Aquafresh white trays. She was very happy to get them as a gift because she uses them a lot. The price was definitely better here on Amazon than any price I found in the retail stores.</li>
    <li> Took them as instructed and didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  It seems the teeth are smoother and cleaner but not whiter.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite of all the whitening strips I&#x27;ve tried. They&#x27;re the only ones that don&#x27;t cause pain afterwards and I always get compliments after using them.</li>
    <li> its a great stuff for the price you pay! Although me teeth and gum did get quite sensitive after using it for a couple of hours or so. Not too bad. Would recommend it</li>
    <li> Ridiculously difficult to keep in place !  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Cheap and flimsy.  I cannot imagine how they could not come up with a better design.  I think they put more thought into the packaging than into the product!</li>
    <li> In spite of its great review in Real Simple Magazine, I was disappointed in White Trays.  They were very difficult to keep in place on both the upper and lower teeth, so I&#x27;m sure my teeth didn&#x27;t get as white as promised.  There was some improvement, but probably not enough to try them again</li>
    <li> As I am writing this I am wearing the trays for the first time.  My first impression: these are so much better than Crest White Strips!  With the strips, the gel would oose out, make my mouth foamy, slip around all over, and made my teeth hurt very badly.  The trays don&#x27;t oose and they stay in place very well.  I&#x27;m not sure about the sensitivity yet, I&#x27;m sure there will be some, but I am using Sensodyne so I am hoping that will help as well as doing right before I go to sleep so hopefully any pain will be gone by the time I wake up.  I&#x27;ll type up another when I have finished the treatment.  :)</li>
    <li> Yes, I have experienced some of the side effects from the whitening trays mentioned by other reviewers (gums turning white, teeth sensitivity).  All of these potential effects are listed in the instructions for the product and are temporary.  In my experience, the whitening of the gums goes away within an hour and the sensitivity disappears when you discontinue use of the product.      I have used the strip tooth whiteners and I can confirm that this product works better.  My teeth are much whiter within one week of use and I am quite satisfied with the results.      A great product!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews here. I&#x27;m rating it 1 star because this product has 2 major problems: no matter what I did, the trays did not fit the shape of my teeth. That&#x27;s a problem because the whole point of using a whitening tray instead of strips is they&#x27;re supposed to fit tightly so you can get the gel exposed to all teeth surfaces. The second problem is there&#x27;s simply very little whitening gel inside each tray making it very difficult to cover all upper or lower teeth. Realizing these major shortcomings, Aquafresh has discontinued making this product, which is why the expiration date is Sept. 2015.</li>
    <li> 1) The trays that come with this product are thin and the edges hurt my gums sometimes.  2) Trays do not cover the back of your teeth, hence they do not get whitened -- but they should.  3) the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; has the consistency of play dough.  It moistens in your mouth but not entirely.  Even after an hour, I have taken the trays out and had some parts of them in pretty much the same shape.  This is after smushing the tray against my teeth.  4) an hour is a long time for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  I used Rembrandt trays and after each use of those, my teeth were whitened more than a week of these.</li>
    <li> Love these trays.  They are not messy and you see results right away.</li>
    <li> I like these aquafresh trays, they are easy to use and make my teeth whiter.  I am sure if I used these more than once a week I would have better results though.  The trays fit pretty well and they are reasonably priced when you can find them on Amazon or Ebay.  I think the peroxide gel stuff also does a great job at cleaning your teeth and gums. I had a great dentist exam the other day and they said I take great care of my teeth and gums. I think this stuff may have helped with my good dental report card..plus flossing every day helps too!</li>
    <li> Used these once, and the next day my teeth hurt. I will not be using these again.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of negative reviews for this product and I&#x27;m not sure why that is. I picked up the product because it was on sale for $20 at the drugstore. After reading the reviews I was nervous about trying it, but I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever. The trays are a bit small, but all you have to do is make sure you spread the gel across your teeth. The tray is very flexible so even if it does not fit your teeth perfectly, it can still be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive teeth and I experienced no discomfort at any point, and did not experience any gum sensitivity. The gel is not exactly pleasant, but it also does not taste vile so I found the product to be quite manageable in my mouth for 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw definite results after the third use and would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for an easy, cheap and pain free whitening experience.</li>
    <li> I buy these each year and have always been happy with the results.  Much easier to use than strips or pens.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth, so I was a bit wary of this product after reading the reviews. In fact, however, the discomfort caused by these trays was pretty mild. The results were pretty mild as well (certainly not something others would notice). All in all, it probably wasn&#x27;t worth the money, but it wasn&#x27;t the painful process I&#x27;ve seen others describe. Next time I&#x27;ll try whitestrips.</li>
    <li> This product will likely whiten your teeth.  Using it is gross.  It has so much product in the trays that you can&#x27;t swallow it and begin to kind of drool.  It&#x27;s not that comfortable either.  I ditched them for 30 minute Crest Whitestrips and am MUCH happier.</li>
    <li> when you look at yourself in the mirror after using these.  Two words of advice: Do not brush your teeth a couple hours before using these or your teeth will be too sensitive. And for the same reason (sensitivity) I have to use them every other day as opposed to every day.  I like them better than the strips because the gel gets in between the teeth where the strips don&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> The trays are easy to use, great results with no mess. Have tried other whitening methods, this is the easiest with the best results.</li>
    <li> Get it at a good price and you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this 6 separate times now. 42 applications in all.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the Aquafresh Trays were great.&lt;br /&gt;I then tried \\&quot;Target\\&quot; Branded Strips and then back to Aquafresh Trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aquafresh Trays are more effective than Target Strips, that is for certain, but after 42 uses, I have become more critical of the Aquafresh Trays for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRAYS ARE FLIMSY&lt;br /&gt;TRAYS DO NOT MAINTAIN GOOD CONTACT OF THE GEL TO YOUR TEETH.&lt;br /&gt;Trays are too stiff to shape to the curvature of your teeth-  this is where strips win over these trays.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of gel in the trays seems to be insufficient to cover more than your 4 front teeth top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;If you put the tray in nervously and end up getting the gel BEHIND your teeth --- GOOD LUCK GETTING THE GEL ON THE FRONT OF YOUR TEETH.&lt;br /&gt;If you are salivating when putting the trays in, you will not get good contact of gel to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;SOMETIMES the gel will burn your gums if you smush it past your teeth and onto your gums - especially if it ends up on the lingual gum surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, I will recommend you try them, ONLY if you don&#x27;t have to pay more than $20/box.  THEY WILL WHITEN YOUR TEETH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy permanent trays that I hope to mould to the shape of my teeth and use the tubes of gel that will fill the trays.</li>
    <li> I like my teeth white. But when it requires 45 minutes of searing pain, no-thank-you! I was excited to try this product since it presents itself as better than competitors&#x27; white strips. And white it does indeed whiten my teeth, the second I apply the trays my gums start to burn like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I removed the tray, my gums were swollen and almost completely white for 24 hours. Did the bleach actually get to my gum tissue? Eeeks! I looked like son of Dracula! So much for a pretty smile.</li>
    <li> I realize everyone&#x27;s teeth  - and tastes - are different, but I was not blown away by this product.  After using it as directed for seven days, I&#x27;d say my teeth are a teeny bit brighter but not really noticeably \\&quot;whiter.\\&quot;  I think if they made this a 10 day regimen, it would be satisfactory.  As it is, I think I&#x27;ll try another round of whitening with another brand.  On the plus side, the trays are pretty easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love Aquafresh White Trays, they are the best of all the whitening products I have tried. They seem to be getting harder and harder to find in retail stores, so I&#x27;m happy to see that Amazon has them. Highly recommend for whiter teeth!</li>
    <li> This product was rely great. I used it just how it told you on the box and it really made a difference. I can only imagine if you we&#x27;re to buy various boxes, how absolutely white ones teeth would be. I recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;d like their teeth slightly whiter.</li>
    <li> I use these about every 6-9 months when my teeth start looking dull.  Work great, even on my sensative teeth and no bad taste.  White strips always make my teeth hurt, these do not.</li>
    <li> I used these once and within an hour of taking them off I noticed a difference, I have very sensitive teeth and they caused me no problems, as long as you get the trays in correctly, they are wonderful. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> After randomly deciding to whiten my teeth, my friend and I grabbed white trays. However, we should have read some reviews.  I am on my last day as we speak, and my gums are ON FIRE.  For the first 5 days, it all went fine.  Although the gel is very uncomfortable, and comes out of the trays into your mouth frequently.  For the last 2 days however, my gums have been bleeding and very very sensitive.     PROS:  White teeth.  Well fitting tray.    CONS:  Bleeding gums, painful gums. Hurts to brush teeth.  Loose gel.</li>
    <li> I never noticed any improvement at all plus it irritated my gums and made them bleed, I would not waste my money on this product.</li>
    <li> These are great and work like a charm! They do have a bad taste after the 30 minute mark but so goes the price of fabulous!</li>
    <li> This is the first trays I&#x27;ve tried that work on me and makes me very happy! The trays fit fine, you just have to press a bit for the gel to spread. Results were noticeable on the 3rd day and it lasts for quite awhile. Even my friends had noticed it. My dentist said I didn&#x27;t need whitening in the first place (he said the results would be small, but I am very vain haha) so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t take his treatment which would&#x27;ve costed me 20x more! The only complaint i might have is that my teeth get extremely sensitive the day after, but I don&#x27;t know if its a normal side-effect? Whatever - beauty is pain, plus the results last longer than the sensitivity :D Overall a great investment!</li>
    <li> I love this! Can&#x27;t live with out it now! Same day I saw  my teeth more white and after a week using it no complaints !</li>
    <li> The trays are too small and they do not reach to the back teeth.</li>
    <li> The product is good. My teeth are more white. The unique problem is that each tray is too small and these only cover my front teeth.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; got a free whitening kit from his dentist.  And I didn&#x27;t want to be outdone, we are friendly competitiors.  So he used his really expensive trays that were molded for his mouth and I used these. At the end of seven days you couldn&#x27;t tell his kit cost more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two teeth pre filled mouth trays per single pack.  One for the top, one for the bottom.  When you put them on you need to use your finger to sort of spread the whitener around a little.  The top tray fit my teeth great.  The lower tray seemed too small, like it didn&#x27;t want to reach the front bottom of my teeth.  So it took a little adjusting to get it to fit right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the trays in for thirty minutes.  By the third day my teeth were quite a bit whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not whiten any artificial crowns or teeth that are not natural.  The first day there were sort of whitish spots on my teeth.  The next day they were gone.  The third day my teeth were definitely whiter.  Day four I accidentally slept for two hours with mine in and gums hurt like mad and my teeth were hyper sensitive.  The next day I skipped because my gums and teeth hurt.  The sixth day my teeth were sparkly.  The seventh day I was actually satisfied with my results.  And the eighth day I was elated with my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my whiter teeth really bring out my eyes!</li>
    <li> Product seem to work but the strips are too flimsy and the gel is to hard.</li>
    <li> Really hurt my teeth for minimal whitening effect</li>
    <li> These white strips had hurt my teeth and made my gums white. The trays also weren&#x27;t very well fitting.  I discontinued using them after 3 uses. After those 3 uses I really didn&#x27;t see a noticeable change in the color of my teeth either. I think in the future I will look into getting them professionally whitened and lay off of the coffee and soda.</li>
    <li> I have used AquaFresh white trays 2 times now and find they work very well.  I place them in my mouth after brushing in the morning, drive to work, remove and brush again.  Fresh taste, works well and my teeth are now the color I want them.</li>
    <li> The trays for the Aquafresh product are a little wider than the generic ones.  If you have a wider smile, you&#x27;ll never fit into the generics.  I use them about once a year.  If you have sensitive teeth, you&#x27;ll need to use a desensitizing toothpaste for a week or two before starting these.</li>
    <li> I did not see the \\&quot;expires 8/11 GOOD UNTIL THE END OF AUGUST\\&quot; note until just now and I ordered this item a week or so ago. I plan on returning it as soon as I get it. The note is not anywhere on the selling page. Also, I&#x27;m not guaranteed to receive this item until the middle of September.</li>
    <li> Gums were burning the entire time. Now have an open sore. Verry little pleasant results. Teeth minimally whiter. Spend the $ for Crest.</li>
    <li> This product is the most useless excuse for a teeth whitener I&#x27;ve found in many years.  The concept is good -- a prefilled tray that only needs 30 minutes per day for a week.  But the trays are beyond flimsy, difficult to fit, are only wide enough to cover a few teeth, and do not stay in place.  I ended up swallowing most of the gel each day, as the trays leaked badly.  Worst of all, I saw nearly zero whitening effect after seven applications.  This was an absolute waste of time.  There are much better products on the market.</li>
    <li> These taste horrible and are impossible to keep on. I ended up swallowing most of the gel because it slips and slides all over the place. After removing the tray I would get THE WORSE sensitivity, unlike any other whitening product I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I would get random shooting pains that would travel up to my head giving me a horrible headache. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s whitened my teeth either, didn&#x27;t even bother finishing the box. Spend a little more on whitening strips they work x100 better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. It used to be of a much higher quality and they have changed the the bleach and trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays:&lt;br /&gt;They used to be a soft foam that really fit my teeth. The new style was made for people with very small teeth and are flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach:&lt;br /&gt;The gel bleach is not soft enough to spread evenly across all your teeth. This results in a very uneven bleaching and spotty results. I thought I could maybe spread it and use my custom trays but it&#x27;s too think and won&#x27;t spread. There&#x27;s really no hope in getting even results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is terrible and I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> It works with me 😁i like it</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times.  I think it works much better than strips because it foams up and gets in the cracks between teeth.  I usually use it every 3-4 months for a touch up on tea/soda stains.  I can do 2 or 3 trays and notice a big difference.  I save the other trays for later which helps stretch the $.</li>
    <li> The Aquafresh trays only reach the top half of teeth and they are too flimsy. If they would cover the entire tooth I think this would be a good product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth despite using special toothpaste and changing my habits but this product works great!  My gums didn&#x27;t whiten or feel raw, my teeth didn&#x27;t hurt or whiten unevenly and the trays weren&#x27;t uncomfortable to wear for the duration of the treatment.  The trick to keeping the gel in the trays instead of it getting into your mouth, which is nasty, is to apply the tray and press the tell onto the teeth working from the edges to the center.  If your a big drooler like me, it helps to place cotton balls under your tongue in a flat later so it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable, and it doesn&#x27;t get in the way on my tongue stud either.</li>
    <li> Hard to use; takes time to fit to teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been using these trays for years. They are so much easier and cleaner to use than strips. One can see a result in two days already.</li>
    <li> Amazing you will love these they whitened my teeth 100% so worth the money and yeah get these haha amazing</li>
    <li> I always use these. I have for years. There has been mixed reviews on the effectiveness. If you use these every other day and until gone you should have minimal sensitivity and great results. As always yellow teeth will always whiten better than grey teeth. Be sure to have the whitening on the front or the teeth and push down and spread it evenly once in your mouth. It&#x27;s only like an hour. DO NOT TALK, EAT, OR DRINK while in use. Best to do this while watching TV or reading before bed. Always makes my teeth look gleaming after finishing a box. I get a ton of compliments. I pick up a new box every 3-9 months depending on what&#x27;s going on and what I eat/drink to do touch ups.</li>
    <li> Works great I love this product.  Used it many times before/</li>
    <li> My all time favorite whitening strips. Not to harsh and very natural appearance. People compliment my teeth all the time and I know it&#x27;s because I use these strips.</li>
    <li> Product worked very well. My teeth are noticeably whiter. I plan on using this product again in six months. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> did not hurt my teeth with sensitivity at all and made my teeth a bright sexy white after just 3days. omg I really love these, pffft screw the crest strips, those made my teeth tender and the results werent as effective</li>
    <li> It was an awkward mess - smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered, much less fit securely.  It&#x27;d probably be easier without the trays.  I don&#x27;t know if they work or not.  I gave up.  I want my Crest Whitestrips back.</li>
    <li> I found the trays really easy to use.  They molded well to my teeth and I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort or burning like some of the other reviews stated.  I saw noticable results right away and will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I tried this over three days as my teeth are stained from coffee, cola, and red wine. Now, my tongue and gums are burned and sore. My teeth are a tiny bit whiter, but not much. --It hurt a little each time I used the product, but today (the third day) is the worst. I might try Crest White Strips, but I understand I might get a chemical burn from them, too.     Per the American Dental Association site, I dentists use materials to protect your gums from the bleach. Whitening at the dentist&#x27;s is way more expensive than doing it at home, but I think it might be worth it.    Additional notes on the Aquafresh product:   1) It fit my mouth pretty well.  2) You have to mash the ropy gel (prefilled into the trays) onto your teeth. It can break a bit, but if you do it quickly, seems to go on fine.  3) I salivated from the gel, which tastes a bit minty, but not as good as some toothpastes.  4) Upon completion, I swished water in my mouth to evacuate the clumps of gel.  5) I had some dramatic white spots on a couple of molars. I noticed what appear to be white scratches on my front teeth. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t really see that it did much. ---I wonder if they might include some color charts so one might better assess if the product is actually working.</li>
    <li> Works well, I advise keeping the trays in for a longer period of time. My teens used it and they said it wasn&#x27;t comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips previously, and was actually interested in trying this product for all the reasons that I was put-off when using the Whitestrips: Dry mouth after use, horrible tasting gel, strips that got heavily laden with saliva before the time was up and shifted out of place and having to use the strips twice a day.  I liked using these Aquafresh trays.  They are soft and flexible, but don&#x27;t expect them to mold to your teeth.  I have relatively straight teeth, so while these trays didn&#x27;t mold to my teeth, they did stay in place more easily.  The gel had a mild minty flavor and didn&#x27;t dry my mouth out as much.  I would buy them again.  They work!</li>
    <li> Get your teeth really white but a little uncomfortable since they are a little to small.</li>
    <li> these taste terrible, they don&#x27;t form to your teeth, the gel is too solid to get into all the right places.  i had chunks of slimy gel floating around in my mouth, and the bottom tray never stayed in place.  i&#x27;ll stick to crest whitestrips from now on.</li>
    <li> I decided to try these because the whitestripes fall off my teeth, but I&#x27;ve had to throw away two trays because if the gel comes out it automatically gives me a gag-reflex. You have to not squeeze the gel too much otherwise this happens. I plan to use the rest of the trays until they are gone because they do whiten my teeth, but I will not be buying these again. At least the whitestripes didn&#x27;t make me gag!</li>
    <li> of all the whitening products I&#x27;ve used, this was the best.  however, the goop inside the trays doesn&#x27;t spread too effectively over the surface of the teeth and instead spills out into your mouth.  they would need to work on that, especially for the price they charge for these.</li>
    <li> I like these trays. To me, they stay in place much better than the Crest Whitestrips. After 5 days my teeth are definitely whiter. I have the luxury of being able to wear them without talking the whole time. I push the trays to spread the gel onto the teeth and then close tightly for 45 minutes. Slight gum irritation, but no more than with the trays from the dentist. If it matters, dentists tell me I have a small mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different whitening items in the past, and I must say these are the worst! While the gel actually does whiten a bit, it is impossible to apply evenly over the teeth. The thick, ropey gel did not spread like it was supposed to, resulting in uneven coverage and spotting, and the trays did not fit my teeth at all. The old fashioned, dip in boiling water clunky trays are much better than these. Save your money--get Crest Whitestrips instead. They work better, fit and conform to the teeth and are not messy at all.</li>
    <li> my teeth were defiantly whiter after using, but the gel inside the trays is annoying to spread over all of your teeth and most of the time it falls out and it seems like you are wasting your money, next time i am getting white strips rather then trays.</li>
    <li> These do in fact work just as they say they do.  Finally a product that follows thorugh on it&#x27;s promise.  Within 3 days or sooner my teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> To keep it short, these work wonders on my teeth. In just two days I noticed a massive difference. They are cheap here, much better than in store, and only have a few downsides.  They are hard to get in place, I wasted one days worth.  They don&#x27;t fit teeth perfectly, but there is ample gel to cover almost all of the tooth.  Otherwise, they taste GREAT and don&#x27;t burn. Even on my sensitive gums and teeth! They whiten wonders. Sometimes excess gel comes out, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad and all you have to do is spit it out.  For the price, it is a great deal and if they don&#x27;t work for you, you really aren&#x27;t loosing out on much money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because the gel is si gloppy and falls out of the trays while on my teeth. The gel is not very soft and stays glopped together as one piece. It also gave me a blister  on the inside of my mouth.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;: (</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems using this product and had super high hopes for it because of the reviews. However, these trays didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all, really. I feel like I now have to go and buy a different whitening product and spend more money. It&#x27;s sad and disappointing- feels like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> These are a waste of time. The bottom trays are too small to fit around your teeth so they don&#x27;t stick. This is a terrible product!</li>
    <li> Doesnot fit, hard to keep it 45mins</li>
    <li> I have used these for over 5 years; previously purchased from W-Mart.  I was always pleased with the results after a 7 day treatment.  I receive multiple compliments on my white teeth...including compliments from my dentist!  The trays are flexible, allowing for me to get the closest possible contact.  The whitening formula tastes fine and does not cause sensitivity.  I have not been able to find this product in stores recently so will be purchasing from my always reliable Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Pros - Pretty straight forward, the trays are neatly packaged, they&#x27;re a one size fits all sort of deal. The kit does exactly as it says, lightening your teeth two or three shades by the end of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The standard &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; isn&#x27;t really true, but that should be obvious by now with any sort of kit you buy. I have a narrow mouth, so they fit relatively well, but weren&#x27;t deep enough for my tastes and sat awkwardly on the lower row of teeth, making for a bit of fighting to be necessary to find a comfortable alignment each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much to report, these sorts of kits are not enjoyable to begin with, so your usual spitting and foul gel taste is pretty standard, even with this. Admittedly, the gel isn&#x27;t as bad as crest. It&#x27;s a grueling 7-day process, but overall, well worth it in my opinion! I&#x27;d certainly buy the product again.</li>
    <li> This kit is awesome- and I&#x27;m ordering online now- b/c my HEB doesn&#x27;t have them in stock at the moment. First off- my teeth cannot tolerate crest white strips- after 2 minutes I get that piercing pain deep in my teeth- if you are affected too- then you know what I&#x27;m talking about! Secondly- these are little bendable trays with gel in them- this works wonders compared to (strips- come on.. these barely stay on, and wax type ones- that don&#x27;t liquify to get into the little crevices that hold onto staining). Every time I do one of these for an hour (I think it says for 30-45- but I&#x27;ve gone an hour and half -napping with it on)I get stopped by so many people that comment on how white my teeth are; and this is just from one treatment. Best of all, no piercing, stinging,pain etc. :)&lt;br /&gt;FYI as for all whitening kits- do not drink red wine, coffee, dark fluids the same day or shortly after the treatment- or everything will be undone- I think it&#x27;s more porous the first day. Anyway this kit is the best, the most practical and the most adaptable per getting in between teeth and other areas that stay yellow with white strips.</li>
    <li> My primary issue is that the bottom tray does not cover my bottom teeth--and it&#x27;s not as though I have large teeth. I have used similar whitening products in the past, and have never had this problem. I also found the whitening agent very \\&quot;gloppy\\&quot; and difficult to smooth across my teeth. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I found the trays hard to keep in place....but will try them again to see if I notice a whitening.</li>
    <li> Simple review. They work they really do. Theyre is some sensitivity after but it does goes away. Also the white stain on the gums it also goies away after a few minutes. Theyre not custom fit so.youll strugfle a few times to fit them real nice. Would buy again and will.</li>
    <li> Overall, a poor product. Issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The lower tray barely covers the top 1/4 of your teeth - even when massaging the gel down.&lt;br /&gt;2) My gums burned, although it wasn&#x27;t too terrible.&lt;br /&gt;3) My teeth became sensitive after about the third day so I had to stop for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;4) After 6 days of use, my teeth did not appear any whiter. I&#x27;m a coffee drinker, dark fresh ground coffee so I was expecting something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find them too uncomfortable though. Throw them in at the start of a hockey game and take them out at the end of the period (Go Wings!). I would not buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Aquafresh brand white trays before and have tried alternatives, but nothing else compares.  They&#x27;re easy to use and work very quickly.  The only downfall is that they can get uncomfortable since you have to wear them for an hour.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. it brightened my teeth 2-3 shades whiter and is very easy to use. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Definitely has worked for this 81 year-old male. Teeth have whitened and look much improved in terms of appearance. Glad I purchased the product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> They had a very short expiry date</li>
    <li> Did not whiten my teeth... Not one bit.</li>
    <li> Got mine for 11 bucks because they&#x27;ll expire 1/2015. Used them TWO days got brighter whiter teeth  but the tooth sensitivity set in and used them every other day afterward. Brighter, whiter teeth and smile without as much slippage as the whitener strips. The trays stay put are thin, comfortable and disposable. You won&#x27;t be re-using them with other oral peroxide gels.</li>
    <li> This product is great I will buy more results just as good as dentist</li>
    <li> By the last of the 7 trays you might have a chance of getting these to stay in position.  Following the included directions sure won&#x27;t help.  Terrible design, very little of the whitening agent gets where it is needed.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than the white strips.  I noticed a change in the color of my teeth within three days of use.  I do think that using them on a regular basis of more than once in awhile would be great, but I think it is cost-prohibitive.</li>
    <li> These didnt stay on my teeth- slipped off</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these! My friend has beautiful white teeth because of these strips. I, however, must have sensitive teeth and just cannot bear the pain after using these. I know they work if you do not have that extra sensitivity.</li>
    <li> i take care of me teeth and floss daily, but my teeth are not as white as i feel they should be plus i&#x27;m getting married in less then 2 months. i tried these last night and after the first time a drastic improvement!! i am very happy and everyone in my house already wants to order some for themselves. of course they are messy but to me its worth and i dont mind a mouthful of ooze for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> It really does work. Keep in mind, you have to follow the instructions and use EVERY DAY for 7 days. It took me the first 2 days to get the hang of it and not drool all over the place. But keep in mind, it will make your teeth and gums temporarily overly sensitive. I even felt a slight sharp pain on my gum on day 4 but that went away after a few seconds and it was not that painful.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on coffee drinkers teeth but I used these years ago but the tray was actually wax and you could mold it to your teeth.these thin trays suck.aquafresh should bring back the wax trays.overall it whitened my brown spot on my front tooth that was from coffee.it did the job in a day</li>
    <li> These Aquafresh trays are a waste of money.  They are very uncomfortable and hard to keep on your teeth and the gel does not spread through the tray...you still have clumps of unused gel in the tray after your 45 minutes are up.  I personally like the crest whitestrips 100% better.  I only tried these because they are new but would never buy them again.</li>
    <li> Not so good. I thought I try these over Crest Whitestrips because they seem to advertised like a \\&quot;mold\\&quot; for your teeth. I don&#x27;t have a perfectly straight teeth, which is a problem with these, as they tend to not grip on to my teeth and saliva just mixes with the whitening substance, making a uncomfortable and foul tasting experience. If your sensitive to this whitening stuff, you&#x27;re better off buying something else like Crest White Strips. Therefore, not recommended. But I will admit, after using just one set of trays, teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> I have tried many whitening products in the past and have not seen much of a difference with any of them.  Although I was dissapointed in the fit these provide, I noticed results after the first use. I personally like the trays much better than the strips because all the goop stays more in the tray than in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I have had professional bleaching and used different versions of Crest whitestrips in the past.  I thought that I would try something different out of curiosity.  I tried twice.  It is difficult to position the trays and get the \\&quot;goop\\&quot; on the front of the teeth.  I have a rather small mouth and the trays barely fit over my teeth.  They didn&#x27;t stay in place long enough to get results.      I went back to classic Crest whitestrips.  I haven&#x27;t found anything to beat them yet.  I plan to call Aquafresh about this product, as I would have gladly spent $30+ on something worthwhile rather than this product that will probably end up in the trash.</li>
    <li> the trays were easy but if your teeth are not perfect the trays do not work.  Top trays fit fine but bottom didn&#x27;t work because my bottom teeth are crooked.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product. I have used many of the strips, and they never stayed on properly. If you follow the instructions with these strips, the trays will stay on and the gel will cover your teeth. You are supposed to put the tray on and gently spread the gel. I was rough the first time that I applied and the tray didn&#x27;t stay on well. If you do it correctly, the gel WILL hold the tray on for the entire 45 minutes. I should mention that I saw results after the first use. I am on my third use today and my teeth are markedly whiter (though my teeth were not bad to start with, just not the ivory color I wanted).    I should add the the product will temporarily discolor your gums. This will only last a few minutes, however. If you have sensitive teeth,  this product will exacerbate that situation. Use a sensitive tooth toothpaste. I had to take ibuprofen because I have extremely sensitive teeth and the discomfort from breathing in the cold air was just too much.    Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because, in comparison to most whitening products, it seemed relatively quick and easy. I sincerely regret my purchase. The trays do not fit properly. They try to flop around in your mouth, the gel comes out and it does not taste that great. The worst part is that this product \\&quot;burned\\&quot; my gums and gave me terrible teeth sensitivity - which I have never had prior to using this product. The product does whiten. However, I have a very tiny mouth and the product only whitened half of each tooth! It looks ridiculous. I plan on going to the dentist and getting professional whitening.</li>
    <li> The tray fits fine on my upper teeth but not my lower.  The only reason I can figure for this is that two of my lower teeth are not perfectly straight.  I had to hold my jaw in a very awkward position to keep the trays in place for the necessary time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to stay away from products like these due to the sensitivity caused by the process.  However, about a year ago, my dentist recommended putting fluoride gel(which I purchase form the dentist) into \\&quot;my trays\\&quot; after bleaching to relieve the pain only to be frustrated that \\&quot;my trays\\&quot; would have to be custom made at a price I was not willing to pay. (FYI: For reviewers that complain about gum bleaching, this is the answer to your woes because the trays will fit your teeth perfectly and not get bleach goo on your gums) I was very excited that Aquafresh introduced these trays because after I bleach, I can rinse out the trays and put in the fluoride gel for as long as I can stand.  This has solved my sensitive teeth problems, and now I can bleach as often as I like.</li>
    <li> I used the 7 day treatment.  It definitely made my teeth less yellow.  Frankly, my teeth used to be unacceptably yellow, now they are just slightly yellow.  I did not experience any of the side effects that some users had (burning gum).      That said, my friends who have had dental treatment to whiten teeth end up with beautiful WHITE teeth.  I don&#x27;t have that, even after this treatment.    This product suits my purpose, but, it is definitely not a substitute for a whitener treatment by a dentist.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Easy to use!</li>
    <li> Worked great! Walmart price was around $35. Here it was$11.00 what a deal!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and good result if used as instructed .&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
    <li> My fiancée and I tried these for our engagement pictures but he had better success than I because his teeth are straight.  Mine were okay but not to the extent I wanted.  They&#x27;re the best price for what they do and you really do see results after a couple days.  Don&#x27;t swallow anything and DON&#x27;T BRUSH before and it&#x27;ll be fine.  I didn&#x27;t have these problems but I don&#x27;t want to find out what happens if you do.</li>
    <li> I expected the trays to cover all of my teeth. However, they only cover the front half of the teeth and do not extend to the back teeth. They do whiten,  just not ALL of your teeth.</li>
    <li> it was hard to use and gel seemed dried out.</li>
    <li> The trays must have been molded for a 5 year old. They are tiny, good luck fitting them if you have undergone puberty already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also completely inflexible, waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Does leave you teeth a bit brighter but you will feel a sting!</li>
    <li> The trays are flimsy/poorly cut vinyl plastic.  They barely cover the top section of your teeth and will not stay in place.  Pretty upset I spent $25 on this.  Do yourself a favor and stick to the Crest strips.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, but it did not work for me. My teeth turned white after the treatment, but turned right back to their original color after two or so hours. And it also hurt after the first day. I coped by putting orajel on my gums, no pain after that, but this did not work for me. Waste of, time and money.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to the letter, but noticed no improvements to the coloring of my teeth. I have used these several times before, so maybe I should have increased the wear time(??)</li>
    <li> these only whiten the teeth they completely touch.  The  Crest whitestrips are better by far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and absolutely love how they work! I smoke and drink coffee and I swear by these things! I only wish you could still find them in stores. I use to get them at Sams Club and you would get 10 in a box, so I just bought 2 boxes this time and will use 10 and have 4 for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Smaller package to try the product and see how it worked.  Performed very well so reordered in the larger size.  Fast and well protected delivery.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfy with this product. It was exactly what I ordered and I received it on time with no problem at all. I will suggest it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;ve been using this and on the 4th day my husband told me he observed that my teeth got whiter compared before using this thing. Happy customer indeed!</li>
    <li> Decent product. It does whiten your teeth but not completely white. It also made my teeth very sensitive and it was a bit painful.</li>
    <li> trays are small and way to flexible to hold in place.  too bad because the whitener seems to work fairly well.</li>
    <li> This product worked in just 3 days like the box says! I only do one tray at a time because it&#x27;s easier to manage and helps to have the contrast of what your top teeth looked like vs your bottom.  Overall, I&#x27;d buy these again because they work and caused very little to no irritation/sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at drugstore...more expensive! I opened box and seen the product and immediately said ohhh noo when looking at the super flimsy plastic (almost between wax paper and plastic) and thought I wasted money...I was wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has wow&#x27;ed me as for the brightening of my teeth...quite a difference day one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets be honest...The pieces are very flimsy and small and upon putting in your mouth you are going to be all negative thoughts...But, this is what you have to do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put piece in mouth and spend a moment pushing the thick gel around giving your own effort in this process to make sure covered good. The thin plastic pieces will not stay put and will move all around on you...don&#x27;t worry just focus on moving gel around...do top and bottom. Then get both top and bottom lined up and shut your teeth keeping them down...top teeth to bottom teeth with no overbite. This is going to be somewhat uncomfortable, but find something relaxing that takes your mind of it. Every so often look in mirror to make sure still in place and push gel around again and realign and shut teeth again. Soon the plastic will start to mold to teeth as they get more wet. Leave on full 45 mins and you will be soo happy...I know I was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt no discomfort maybe a very slight sensitivity. I kept my tongue away from plastic and really didn&#x27;t swallow much as I let saliva just pool...deal with it guys for good outcome. The gel is thick, but you will see when you take them off why the thickness was a good thing. I didn&#x27;t experience any gum whitening at all...but as others point out that did have neg review it goes away shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to put in your effort too and note that any way you go your gonna have some form of complaint whether it be expense of dentist doing it or inconvenience of doing it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow my teeth are white (they were medium shade discolored)</li>
    <li> I deducted one star because they do not cover ALL the teeth. The teeth in the back are not covered, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything that does, so it&#x27;s only 1 star off. Yes, you may not see the teeth in the back most of the time, but it still would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does hurt. BUT, it worked pretty well for me. I never did more than one application because, after the first use, the teeth were white enough. I really liked that. You save some money there. They also have much more gel than the strips. If I did it twice, I think my teeth would be as white as they get.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is pretty decent. I once went to a dentist and you pay at least 200 bucks for have all your teeth done. So this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how to fight the hurting of the gum. I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s the gum. I think it&#x27;s the tiny little \\&quot;gap\\&quot; between your gum and your teeth. It&#x27;s a sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;You should follow the instructions and only take it out after 45 minutes. Then you get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@ the people complaining that \\&quot;it&#x27;s hard to spread\\&quot;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You kidding me!? Use your hands to distribute it evenly. It&#x27;s not that hard to grasp! It should be common sense. It&#x27;s not liquid, it&#x27;s a gel. So, yes, you have to use your hand to move it around a little.</li>
    <li> These are a pain to keep on, so you have to dedicate a day to whitening your teeth (can&#x27;t just put &#x27;em on and go). But once you get it on somewhat decent, the content is very strong and effective! I used to use Listerine Dissolving Whitening Strips, and they were just as excellent with more convenient strips - however they discontinued those. These are the next best thing. I absolutely hate Crest strips - that&#x27;s like watching paint dry and seeing no difference!</li>
    <li> It is hard to find these anywhere. You cannot buy these in stores anymore which is a bummer. Oh well, I always get them on here cheaper anyways. There are always better deals going on with this seller. Always a satisfied customer. I usually only use these to whiten my teeth and they work fantastically. I love them!!  (The whites-trips work as a great duo too!) Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used crest 3D white strips last summer and liked the results but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with how they only covered the very front teeth (my mouth is normal sized, possibly even small).  I had read that the aquafresh white trays are larger and decided to try them this summer.  Well, I ordered them and unfortunately this is not true.  They cover even less than the white strips and are super messy (that gel is not something you want to be getting all over!).  I hate to leave negative reviews but these were just a joke.  Packed them right back up and am returning them, thankfully Amazon is great with returns.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on my teeth often, and I&#x27;d attribute a lot of that to these! The trays stay in place, are easy to wear while you&#x27;re doing other activities, don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth and are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> These disposable strips are hard to apply and do not stay on your teeth. To the trash can. Not worth my time.</li>
    <li> Trays are too small&lt;br /&gt;Whitening gel is nearly impossible to distribute evenly&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were aching for days&lt;br /&gt;This product is 100% garbage</li>
    <li> I have been using whitening toothpaste for a couple of years but wanted something to really accelerate the process. These trays are a joke. They&#x27;re far too small to cover your teeth unless you&#x27;re a child and the trays don&#x27;t even contain enough gel to whiten more than the top portion anyway. The trays are advertised as being \\&quot;flexible\\&quot; to fit the shape of your mouth, but they&#x27;re WAY TOO flexible to stay in place. Imagine taking a sheet of waxed paper coated with Vaseline and trying to hold it in place for 45 minutes. These trays are EXACTLY like that. You&#x27;ll end up wrestling with these the first couple of times you use them and will end up throwing some out and starting over to get them on right. Even if somehow you get them situated where you want them the gel usually clumps together and oozes out of the trays into your mouth instead of staying on your teeth. I guess if you want to whiten your tongue this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cheaper than some competitors and takes 45 minutes (I think Rembrandt takes two hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ridiculously small and flexible and the gel gets everywhere it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am a grown man, however my teeth are no different in size than the average adult. Having said that, these trays are 10 times too small. Get it, not just a little small, they are designed for a toddler. The barely cover the top of your teeth and there is a space about 1/4 inch or more from the trays to your gum line.&lt;br /&gt;I called the manufacturer and they admitted they have received ( in their words ) numerous feedback addressing this issue. In other words, I am not alone in this complaint.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best teeth whiteners out there. I like the tray idea although they are a bit small but they work well. I noticed an improvement in my teeth after the first day and others noticed too. I have read reviews about white spots on the teeth and gums and causing pain but I didn&#x27;t experience any of those things. I would definitely recommend them over the strips and I will use them again in six months. I just wish they were a bit bigger but that won&#x27;t deter me from using them because they just work.</li>
    <li> Perfect because the trays don&#x27;t slip off your teeth like other strips do. The concentration seems to be high so even if you whiten every other day for the full amount of time you will still see the desired results. Wish this product was sold in more stores but am happy that amazon still carries it!</li>
    <li> Very obvious whitening of the teeth but as soon as you stop using the trays, your teeth go back to the way they used to look</li>
    <li> I have used most of the box, and the trays slip off my teeth very easily. Once I get them in place I cannot release the pressure on my teeth at all or they slip, some of the gel comes out into my mouth, and they are not as effective. Also, I have receding gums and these trays do not even come close to covering all of the length of my teeth. They are also VERY short—they only cover the front teeth and do not reach very far around to the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all that, my teeth do appear to be whiter, but they are unpleasant to use. I just ordered another product, SuperSmile, and I&#x27;ll see how that goes. it&#x27;s not a tray, so it should solve several of the problems these trays have.</li>
