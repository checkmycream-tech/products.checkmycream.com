      <li>The hunt continues for my hair&#x27;s best friend.</li>
      <li>Both work great!</li>
      <li>I have always struggled with my wavy/curly hair because it gets frizzy and poofy instead of having any definition whatsoever, and what I saw was shiny, beautifully defined curls with no frizz to be seen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This does not have sulfates which is great, butit also does not contain 100% organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>He has thin-ish happy hair that LOVES this shampoo.</li>

      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>Great lather, nice shine to my hair after (I have medium hair, not dry, not oily.), smells great too.</li>
      <li>The first three were great.</li>
      <li>I get incredibly irritated when products claim to be organic but the ingredient label clearly shows names of chemicals I cannot even begin to pronounce.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of my hair.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how much I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It cleans well &amp; is healthy for your hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>It s okay.</li>
      <li>Even using more every time now, I find I have to wash my hair twice.</li>
      <li>I also love the matching conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love the texture and the shine after using this product.</li>
      <li>so if you are wondering about this one, try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>so I was really happy to find such a good one.</li>
      <li>My husband and I really liked the sound of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>My verdict - will buy again :)</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair looks so healthy and feels so strong.</li>
      <li>The great thing is that my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily at all, not even near my scalp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a trade-off, I will have to keep experimenting to find the right balance.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean, and healthy.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel strong and shinier.</li>
      <li>So I alternated with a strong dandruff shampoo.  </li>
      <li>To me, this shampoo seemed too strong rather than moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>At first, that shampoo gave me pretty good results, but I knew there had to be something better out there, and I think I found it.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is fantastic, I can use this product with no problems at all</li>
      <li>It has a light smell that is not cloying.  </li>
      <li>I have had a good experience with the lavender shampoo from this company, so I was surprised.</li>
      <li>I started becoming interested in a more organic lifestyle almost two years</li>
      <li>My favorite ever shampoo, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t strip color,&lt;br /&gt;leaves</li>
      <li>However, the one thing this shampoo has going for it that is unique is its scent.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong smell that lingers for my entire workday and while I don&#x27;t absolutely love the smell, I still do like</li>
      <li>Consequently I went through those three bottles more than twice as fast.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky and full of moisture.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, lathers generously, and conditions my hair without making it greasy or heavy or feel coated.</li>
      <li>After reading very positive reviews I decided to try this one.</li>
      <li>I have looked high and low for a good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I use a followup conditioner to keep down the curly hair frizzies, but my hair wouldn&#x27;t look this good without the Avalon shampoo.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the initial smell, no artificial fragrances, of the shampoo, but I have gotten used to it now.  </li>
      <li>I had to wash again and use more the second time than the first.</li>
      <li>You can guess I have tried many different ones.  </li>
      <li>Most moisturizing shampoos leave my hair moisturized enough to put a comb though it.</li>
      <li>I used my regular conditioner , then finished with this one that was okay.</li>
      <li>But that is exactly what happened to me.  </li>
      <li>I had been using different shampoos for many years</li>
      <li>and I noticed the difference in the first wash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always nice to have your hair not smell like every other woman&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>jjust not what I expected for shampoo, seem to use more.</li>
      <li>When I used as much as I used to use I got no lather in my hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather that much</li>
      <li>It does not foam up like other shampoos, and that makes me feel all the better about it.  </li>
      <li>I like the flegrance and also more formy than other organic shampoo that I know.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t latter up or leave your hair feeling full of suds.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overally, I think I will be sticking with this shampoo for a while longer, but I do have two tiny gripes that prevented me from giving it a full five stars.</li>
      <li>I think my previous shampoo (A combination of Aveeno&#x27;s Moisturizing Shampoo and Organix Coconut Milk Conditioner) was a lot better at giving my hair a silky and well hydrated quality.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
      <li>My husband and I have both used this shampoo and the one for normal hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you want more definition, shine, and softness, but I would advise following it up with other oils to maximize the benefits.</li>
      <li>and I have NEVER had to clear my hair from the drain again!  </li>
      <li>When I first used this shampoo I actually felt that my hair was dryer than before, but stronger.</li>
      <li>but it seems I can only grow it to a certain length until I have to cut it because I get split ends.</li>
      <li>No matter what I used, I was always having to clear my hair away from the drain to let the water out of the tub.    </li>
      <li>hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often like the all natural shampoos</li>
      <li>This does not strip the natural curl or body out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair manageable and silky and at the same time does not effect my skin which is really saying something.</li>
      <li>It seems to work really well the first several shampoos but after about a month our hair was horribly dry.  </li>
      <li>I chose this particular shampoo (&amp; conditioner) because of the decent price point and the moisturizing aspect, since my hair tends to dry out from heat styling.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair but straighten daily and live in the humid Houston area.</li>
      <li>My hair feels healthier and I think its current texture reflects the natural state of my hair rather than a texture achieved by lots of styling and product.</li>
      <li>When it was time to buy a new shampoo I happened to be at an organic grocery store anyway and limited to their selection of products.</li>
      <li>Probably only a feeling but compared to much cheaper options this is not special at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Another product that made my hair extremely dry.  Again, please try for yourself as it may be just what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of my hair. I love the texture and the shine after using this product. I give this 4 stars! This shampoo lasts long. It is thick and little goes a long way. My verdict - will buy again :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is fantastic, I can use this product with no problems at all and I have bought some very expensive products in the past. This product leaves my hair manageable and silky and at the same time does not effect my skin which is really saying something. There are thousands of products out there so if you are wondering about this one, try it you&#x27;ll love it. I know I am staying with it. It also smells wonderfull. For those of you with skin issues like me, this will not add to your problens, it is a wonderfull product. Would rate it a 7 if I could.  i</li>
    <li> My husband and I really liked the sound of this shampoo. The ingredients list is superb and it smells lovely. He has thin-ish happy hair that LOVES this shampoo. But I have long, frizzy-ish locks that aren&#x27;t a fan of this shampoo. It leaves his hair soft, and my hair feels sticky, slightly greasy, but dry at the same time. Le sigh. The hunt continues for my hair&#x27;s best friend.</li>
    <li> If someone told me that my hair would stop falling out just by switching to this shampoo, I would have laughed in their face.  But that is exactly what happened to me.  I had been using different shampoos for many years and I always had a problem with flaking.  So I alternated with a strong dandruff shampoo.  No matter what I used, I was always having to clear my hair away from the drain to let the water out of the tub.    Within a week of switching to this shampoo, I stopped using dandruff shampoo forever and I have NEVER had to clear my hair from the drain again!  That was at least 5 years ago.    If they ever stop making this shampoo, I will buy the formula and manufacture the stuff myself.  That&#x27;s how much I love this shampoo.  The only problem I have with this product is the dumb name.  I just call it my shampoo.  It&#x27;s the ONLY shampoo I will use.</li>
    <li> Not as good as products from hotels on maui.  It s okay. The conditioner didn t perform well.  I used my regular conditioner , then finished with this one that was okay.</li>
    <li> lathers well, I like it. Doesn&#x27;t smell that great but, it does what its supposed to. I bought the 3 pack so I will be using it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to San Francisco and within a few months jumped on the \\&quot;organic everything\\&quot; train. When it was time to buy a new shampoo I happened to be at an organic grocery store anyway and limited to their selection of products. I chose this particular shampoo (&amp; conditioner) because of the decent price point and the moisturizing aspect, since my hair tends to dry out from heat styling. When I first used this shampoo I actually felt that my hair was dryer than before, but stronger. I think my previous shampoo (A combination of Aveeno&#x27;s Moisturizing Shampoo and Organix Coconut Milk Conditioner) was a lot better at giving my hair a silky and well hydrated quality. However, my hair felt cleaner with less residue with Avalon Organics, so there are pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s to each. My hair feels healthier and I think its current texture reflects the natural state of my hair rather than a texture achieved by lots of styling and product. It&#x27;s kind of a trade-off, I will have to keep experimenting to find the right balance. However, the one thing this shampoo has going for it that is unique is its scent. It&#x27;s always nice to have your hair not smell like every other woman&#x27;s. My boyfriends LOVES the smell of this shampoo, in fact, he even enjoys using it himself when he stays over.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels clean, and healthy. I have been using this shampoo for years.</li>
    <li> jjust not what I expected for shampoo, seem to use more.</li>
    <li> I got this hair product  along with it&#x27;s conditioner. Great stuff !!! It doesn&#x27;t latter up or leave your hair feeling full of suds. It smell great too !</li>
    <li> My husband and I have both used this shampoo and the one for normal hair.  We both have the same complaint:  It dries out our hair terribly.  It seems to work really well the first several shampoos but after about a month our hair was horribly dry.  Since we have a water filtering/softening system for our house, it can be nothing but the water.  I am using it for dish soap and it works great...cuts grease like a champ...what does that tell you?</li>
    <li> My favorite ever shampoo, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t strip color,&lt;br /&gt;leaves hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I try others but always go back to this one.</li>
    <li> I started becoming interested in a more organic lifestyle almost two years and it&#x27;s been a journey and a lot of trial and error; but my hair, health, and skin have definitely benefited from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second organic shampoo I have used after using Aubrey Organics for about 1.5 years. At first, that shampoo gave me pretty good results, but I knew there had to be something better out there, and I think I found it. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 1 month and I noticed the difference in the first wash. It has a very strong smell that lingers for my entire workday and while I don&#x27;t absolutely love the smell, I still do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was noticeably smoother within the first wash/condition and as it dried I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t as frizzy as it usually is. Frizz is the number one problem I have with my hair, followed closely by a lack of definition in my wavy/curly hair. After just a week of using it, I noticed that I had almost no frizz and my hair was so incredibly shiny! I&#x27;m also in the habit of running my fingers through my hair a lot when I&#x27;m at home, and my gosh, I don&#x27;t think my hair has ever been softer. The great thing is that my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily at all, not even near my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week ago I went shopping and I caught sight of my hair from the back because of the way the mirrors were set up and I kid you not, my mouth fell open in surprise. I have always struggled with my wavy/curly hair because it gets frizzy and poofy instead of having any definition whatsoever, and what I saw was shiny, beautifully defined curls with no frizz to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overally, I think I will be sticking with this shampoo for a while longer, but I do have two tiny gripes that prevented me from giving it a full five stars. 1) I get incredibly irritated when products claim to be organic but the ingredient label clearly shows names of chemicals I cannot even begin to pronounce. This does not have sulfates which is great, butit also does not contain 100% organic ingredients. 2) I was hoping to see a difference in the amount of hair that fell out as I was showering, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to grow my hair out for years now but it seems I can only grow it to a certain length until I have to cut it because I get split ends. Hopefully this shampoo will change that because I will continue to use it along with other essential oils. I highly recommend it if you want more definition, shine, and softness, but I would advise following it up with other oils to maximize the benefits.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It makes my hair feel strong and shinier. I also use this with their matching conditioner. Both work great! I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the initial smell, no artificial fragrances, of the shampoo, but I have gotten used to it now.  It doesn&#x27;t lather that much but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! I have bought these packs of three a couple times now!</li>
    <li> After reading very positive reviews I decided to try this one. The shampoo is very thin but even when using a lot of it I am left with a feeling the hair is not clean. Probably only a feeling but compared to much cheaper options this is not special at all. I dont see any reason to want to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!  It cleans well &amp; is healthy for your hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and never want to switch to anything else.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue or weigh your hair down.  I also love the matching conditioner.  I have thin dry hair that is color treated.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for couple of weeks now. I like the flegrance and also more formy than other organic shampoo that I know. I think this shampoo works good for me.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low for a good shampoo.  You can guess I have tried many different ones.  This is the best I have ever used.  It leaves my hair silky and full of moisture.  It has a light smell that is not cloying.  My hair looks so healthy and feels so strong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long and torturous journey, but I found my shampoo.  I have curly short babyfine hair, and other shampoos would leave it flat and lifeless.  This does not strip the natural curl or body out of my hair.  It does not foam up like other shampoos, and that makes me feel all the better about it.  I use a followup conditioner to keep down the curly hair frizzies, but my hair wouldn&#x27;t look this good without the Avalon shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I guess I expected it to help with De-tangling my hair. Most moisturizing shampoos leave my hair moisturized enough to put a comb though it. I am African American yet it left my hair kinda dry.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but it just didn&#x27;t work well with my hair type. I have naturally curly hair but straighten daily and live in the humid Houston area. I used the shampoo and conditioner and it left my hair feeling heavy, weighted down and almost with a oily feel. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have opted for the \\&quot;Moisturizing\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It smells great, lathers generously, and conditions my hair without making it greasy or heavy or feel coated. Just bought the 3 pack.</li>
    <li> It takes a pretty negative experience for me to write a 2 star review.  To me, this shampoo seemed too strong rather than moisturizing.  It seemed to dry my hair out.  I can&#x27;t wait until I am done with the three bottles that comes with this order.  I have had a good experience with the lavender shampoo from this company, so I was surprised.</li>
    <li> I have used six bottles of this shampoo. The first three were great. Great lather, nice shine to my hair after (I have medium hair, not dry, not oily.), smells great too. I don&#x27;t often like the all natural shampoos so I was really happy to find such a good one. When I ordered another pack of three I was happy to see the \\&quot;Now more sustainable\\&quot; sign on the label. But when I used it I found instead of the thick gel in the first batch a runny syrupy consistency. When I used as much as I used to use I got no lather in my hair. I felt only about half of my hair got washed. I had to wash again and use more the second time than the first. Even using more every time now, I find I have to wash my hair twice. (I have Halle-Berry-short hair.) Consequently I went through those three bottles more than twice as fast. Disappointed with the \\&quot;improvement\\&quot;. I&#x27;m looking for another shampoo.</li>
