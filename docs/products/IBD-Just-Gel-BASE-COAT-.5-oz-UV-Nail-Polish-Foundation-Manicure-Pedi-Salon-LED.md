      <li>Great price for a great product.</li>
      <li>Great product and true to review!!!</li>
      <li>LOVED IT</li>
      <li>Looks good when you put it on but comes off within 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I am going to try Gelish , which is getting much better reviews !</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>and she liked it alot</li>
      <li>I LOVE doing my own gels at home.</li>
      <li>I have tried applying this along with IBD color and top coat</li>
      <li>Use a cotton ball doused in alcohol to remove tacky Top Coat.</li>
      <li>Prefer Harmony&#x27;s Gelish foundation and top coat does a better job.</li>
      <li>I used it with a IDB color and a top coat.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this one goes on better, seems to set better and faster too.</li>
      <li>Tried curing longer, buffing nail more -nothing</li>
      <li>I have much better luck with CND and Gelish.</li>
      <li>The IBD brand of polishes is one of the better products out there.  </li>
      <li>However, from now on I will spend the money for the better product.</li>
      <li>I gave a two, I think its okay to used it.</li>
      <li>I love the IBD brand of polish.</li>
      <li>Love this gel polish.  </li>
      <li>works just as good as Harmony gelish and so much more decently priced!!</li>
      <li>the nail polish is fine</li>
      <li>This seems to work well with my UV light for my gel nail kit.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy IBD whenever it is available to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, but will peel off in one to three days.</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely and dries fast under the UV lamp.</li>
      <li>i use a 30 watt uv light (salon brand)</li>
      <li>I use a LED light</li>
      <li>and they work so well with my LED light.  </li>
      <li>Thought I was saving money because this is cheaper than the original.  </li>
      <li>Use a clean cotton ball doused in alcohol and clean off every nail.&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
      <li>Just the right size, easy to handle bottle.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve purchased colors that are amazing (parisol) and others which were very streaky/watery/runny (hot springs)</li>
      <li>but it was fast shipping. :)</li>
      <li>that is one main thing i love also</li>
      <li>Quickly glide it over the nail.</li>
      <li>That is pretty crummy compared to the weeks the Gelish stays on!</li>
      <li>I was able to easily peel the entire gel polish from my nails two.</li>
      <li>It looks nice for a while but chips very easily, as easily as regular nail polish (in my opinion).</li>
      <li>/&gt;The key to making at home gel/shellac last, is making sure your nails are very clean to start and making sure you are not overloading the polish.</li>
      <li>The polish comes right off.</li>
      <li>it peels right off</li>
      <li>This peeled right off my nail within hours.</li>
      <li>But make sure each layer of Top Coat is very simple and not heavy thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>) Put on a simple glaze now, so a Top Coat.</li>
      <li>*Make sure it&#x27;s a simple coat.</li>
      <li>, you get a larger bottle for your money and IMHO it lasts better without peeling or chipping.  </li>
      <li>But this way you know your thumbs are getting direct uv light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel nails for about a year and half.</li>
      <li>i also noticed that is was very clumpy when i was putting it on my nails.</li>
      <li>but I dont have much to compare it to.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel polish for 3 years, and have tried several brands, and this is my least favorite.</li>
      <li>AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS!</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that they are both 1/2 ounce size which is very generous unlike other brands.</li>
      <li>Make sure when curing, your thumbs are pointing upwards, it will be unnatural and might give you some slight pain inbetween your thumb and index finger.</li>
      <li>will be a frequent buyer!!</li>
      <li>Dry your nails with a clean towel, with nothing on it.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
      <li>I use Gelish and wanted to try something new....</li>
      <li>Easy way to tell if you are using too much polish, is if it bleeds into your side cuticles (not top, but bleeds into the sides).</li>
      <li>so I apply the color directly to my nail</li>
      <li>I dont see any problems so far.</li>
      <li>Place rest of fingers directly under the lamp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This surprised me as I have used IBD colors and have never had any complaints about them.</li>
      <li>Brought to my spa and had it put on by a professional.</li>
      <li>maybe I&#x27;m just impatient and should of used a faster shipping method than the free shipping, I did not like that it took 10days to arrive.</li>
      <li>great thick , it doesnt take long to dry</li>
      <li>But after reading the rest of these reviews -- and after trying the Gelish base and top coat, which are wearing much better so far -- I think the IBD products may just not be as durable.</li>
      <li>I love IBD polishes for color, but the top and base coat do not preform as well as the Gelish brand.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I was just reading the other reviews and got a little irritated.</li>
      <li>I have bought so many different brands its ridiculous.</li>
      <li>so I am going back to doing them myself, It will be fun to try all the crazy colors this summer and much more affordable.</li>
      <li>I have used the IBD colors with gelish base and top coat and that works fine.</li>
      <li>While this is longer than regular polish for me, I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the time &amp; money.</li>

<li> I have used other similar products like OPI</li>
<li> Use OPI Bondaid pH Balancing Agent on every single nail.</li>

<li> I usually have my nails done at the nail salon</li>
<li> off after just few hours !</li>
<li> Stick with the more expensive base coats like gelish that lasts at least 2 weeks.</li>
<li> If it looks dull, then repeat step 7, followed by 8.</li>

    <li> I hardly use this as a base coat because the gels seem to peel up the next day if I do so I apply the color directly to my nail and it seems to last longer.</li>
    <li> I started doing gel polish at home a few months ago using the IBD base and top coats, but could only get 4-5 days out of a manicure before it started to peel. I figured that was just because I was hard on my nails; I have a young child, type a lot for work, etc. But after reading the rest of these reviews -- and after trying the Gelish base and top coat, which are wearing much better so far -- I think the IBD products may just not be as durable. I&#x27;d stick with Gelish.</li>
    <li> I used Gelish base and top coat for the last year or so. I had a friend tell me about this brand being a lot cheaper so I gave it a try. I have tried over and over to get this stuff to stay on. The longest it has stayed on my fingers is 2 days. That is pretty crummy compared to the weeks the Gelish stays on! This review section for this polish I think is a great Gelish add. haha</li>
    <li> I use Gelish and wanted to try something new....what a mistake....it peels right off&lt;br /&gt;Stick with what you know.....the nail polish is fine</li>
    <li> I have tried applying this along with IBD color and top coat at least 20 times. Making every change and modification I could think of to keep it on -- wiping with acetone before applying, wiping with alcohol before and between coats, wearing gloves when cleaning, curing for longer between coats. Nothing worked. Within a day the entire polish peeled off. I&#x27;ve never used IBD before and will not buy it again. I&#x27;ll spend the extra $ for OPI which never gives this issue.</li>
    <li> It goes on too gloppy and thick in places, your nails will &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off. Prefer Harmony&#x27;s Gelish foundation and top coat does a better job.</li>
    <li> I have used other similar products like OPI but this one goes on better, seems to set better and faster too. I will continue to buy IBD whenever it is available to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks IBD,&lt;br /&gt;  Susan</li>
    <li> Love this gel polish.  Just the right size, easy to handle bottle.  Speedy shipping!  A+++++</li>
    <li> I gave a two, I think its okay to used it. but they don&#x27;t stayed on the nail longer than other gel brands.  but it was fast shipping. :)</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, but will peel off in one to three days. I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel polish for 3 years, and have tried several brands, and this is my least favorite. This surprised me as I have used IBD colors and have never had any complaints about them. Will not buy this again</li>
    <li> Lifts in a day or less. Very disappointing. I&#x27;ve been using gelish base forever and decided to try ibd. What a bad decision. I tried troubleshooting this with longing curing times, thinner coats, thicker coats, bonder, you name it. Nothing helped. Needless to say, I Am going back to gelish for my base coat.</li>
    <li> great thick , it doesnt take long to dry i use a 30 watt uv light (salon brand) on the 30 second setting and the idb gel dries fast and hard . i use other idb gel colors with the base coat and usually lasts about 2 weeks even then it doesnt chip my nails just grow so i re do them, it is a soak off and that is one main thing i love also it is thick enough one coat does the trick</li>
    <li> I love the IBD brand of polish. It works very well, hold the polish for 2 weeks or longer at a time and is still less expensive than other brands. I will buy IBD often!</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. DOES retail for almost 20$. Giant .5 oz bottle. Can&#x27;t skip this step. I LOVE doing my own gels at home.</li>
    <li> I have used Gelish at home since last October and never had a nail peel off.  I thought I&#x27;d save some money and get IBD for the base and top coats.  All of my nails kept peeling off.  I kept redoing them as a nail would fall of then finally after 3 days of that I just took them all off and redid my nails with my Gelish base and top.  I can still use the IBD colors but not the base and top coats.  I use a LED light and I also have a UV light and both failed to keep the nails on longer than a day.</li>
    <li> This peeled right off my nail within hours. I followed the instructions as well as used &amp;#34;CND Scrubfresh&amp;#34; and a dehydrator prior to polish. I have much better luck with CND and Gelish.</li>
    <li> i have been using this products nail polishes for a little over a year and have had no problems but i was using the gelish brand base coat and top coats, tried this brand base coat and am very disappointed. it peeled up within hours of doing my nails, i can be a little rough with my nails at times and this is not something you want on your nails. i also noticed that is was very clumpy when i was putting it on my nails. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This base coat is great and works well with the gel polish. It goes on nicely and dries fast under the UV lamp.</li>
    <li> I love IBD polishes for color, but the top and base coat do not preform as well as the Gelish brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a good product.  The polish comes right off.</li>
    <li> Great product and true to review!!!</li>
    <li> This is not a good base coat at all. It peels off in like 2 days. Stick with the more expensive base coats like gelish that lasts at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> yes i bought it for a friend as  gift.  she tried mine and she liked it alot so I had to buy it for her</li>
    <li> Poor quality, doesn&#x27;t stick to nails. Brought to my spa and had it put on by a professional. Polish lifted and came off a few days later.</li>
    <li> Very bad base coat -peels off after just few hours ! Tried curing longer, buffing nail more -nothing helped -won&#x27;t be buying this again . I am going to try Gelish , which is getting much better reviews !</li>
    <li> Ok, so I was just reading the other reviews and got a little irritated. I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel nails for about a year and half. I have bought so many different brands its ridiculous. There is a way to make this brand stay on your nails for longer than 1-2 days. Here&#x27;s how:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Wash your nails before you begin with a basic dishwasher soap. Nothing fancy, nothing oily, nothing moisurizy, nothing with crazy scents. So basically, no Bath &amp; Bodyworks soap. Dry your nails with a clean towel, with nothing on it.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Use a clean cotton ball doused in alcohol and clean off every nail.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Use OPI Bondaid pH Balancing Agent on every single nail. You do not need to go crazy &amp; use a lot. Keep it simple.&lt;br /&gt;4.) Now use your IBD Gel Polish Base coat.You do not need a lot. Just a simple glaze on each nail. Cure for 2 minutes. ***Make sure when curing, your thumbs are pointing upwards, it will be unnatural and might give you some slight pain inbetween your thumb and index finger. But this way you know your thumbs are getting direct uv light. Place rest of fingers directly under the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;5.) Now put on your IBD Gel Polish Color. Put on 1 simple coat. Do not make it thick &amp; nasty. Easy way to tell if you are using too much polish, is if it bleeds into your side cuticles (not top, but bleeds into the sides). Cure for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;6.) Repeat step 5. ***Make sure it&#x27;s a simple coat. Do not make it thick and goopy, do not make it bleed.** Cure for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;7.) Put on a simple glaze now, so a Top Coat. Cure for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;8.) Use a cotton ball doused in alcohol to remove tacky Top Coat. Quickly glide it over the nail. If it looks dull, then repeat step 7, followed by 8. But make sure each layer of Top Coat is very simple and not heavy thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to making at home gel/shellac last, is making sure your nails are very clean to start and making sure you are not overloading the polish.</li>
    <li> I have never had issues with IBD products but this base coat does not adhere.  It seems watered down and makes me wonder if it is a bad batch, expired or if the seller purposely watered it down. I&#x27;ve heard this sometimes happens with perfume ordered online but nailpolish!!!  I won&#x27;t order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Thought I was saving money because this is cheaper than the original.  Looks good when you put it on but comes off within 24 hours. Bubbles up and peals off like a piece of saran wrap.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, pay the extra for the brand name. Mine is now in the trash.</li>
    <li> I usually have my nails done at the nail salon but it was getting expensive so I am going back to doing them myself, It will be fun to try all the crazy colors this summer and much more affordable.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the base coat and they work so well with my LED light.  I also love the fact that they are both 1/2 ounce size which is very generous unlike other brands.</li>
    <li> The IBD brand of polishes is one of the better products out there.  I rate it above the gelish brand, you get a larger bottle for your money and IMHO it lasts better without peeling or chipping.  This one is a definate yes if you do gel polish.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE GREAT PRODUCT!!! LOVED IT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS!! I WOULD SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!!</li>
    <li> I have tried this base coat 3 times so far &amp; the longest it has lasted is 6 days.  While this is longer than regular polish for me, I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> I think that this base coat works well to help bond the gel polish, also its priced very well. I dont see any problems so far. I also havent used any other base coats to compare it to.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well with my UV light for my gel nail kit. It think it helps make them stronger but I dont have much to compare it to.</li>
    <li> When I used this as a base coat it really did not bond to my nail I was able to easily peel the entire gel polish from my nails two. days later. I used it with a IDB color and a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also maybe I&#x27;m just impatient and should of used a faster shipping method than the free shipping, I did not like that it took 10days to arrive.</li>
    <li> It looks nice for a while but chips very easily, as easily as regular nail polish (in my opinion). I&#x27;ll stick with gelish from now on. I have used the IBD colors with gelish base and top coat and that works fine.</li>
    <li> works just as good as Harmony gelish and so much more decently priced!! will be a frequent buyer!! love it!</li>
    <li> I use this and a competitor product.  My manicure always peels off when I use this product.....stays on with competitor product.  I bought because of the price.  However, from now on I will spend the money for the better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve being doing gel manicures at home for about 2 years now, IBD gel Base Coat is one my least favorite products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This base coat WILL cause your gel polish to PEEL off*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note-their colored gels are a hit or miss depending on the color- i&#x27;ve purchased colors that are amazing (parisol) and others which were very streaky/watery/runny (hot springs)</li>
