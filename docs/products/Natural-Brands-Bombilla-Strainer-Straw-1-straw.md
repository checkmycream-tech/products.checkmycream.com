      <li>Easy to clean (I clean with warm water and a little soap if needed then blow through the straw to get out any remaining water), beautiful, recommend!!</li>
      <li>One thing that would be nice if the mouthpiece were wood/not metal because it gets really hot.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap at all.</li>
      <li>Two days before Christmas I get a note that this is no longer available from Nutricity, despite their page saying they are in stock and can ship immediately.  </li>
      <li>Very fun and unique.</li>
      <li>A fun purchase!</li>

      <li>The bombilla is a very sturdy metal and appealing to look at.</li>
      <li>A handsome product, but it compromises too much the experience of drinking tea for both of us.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>There have been reports of mouth cancer from drinking very hot liquids through a straw.</li>
      <li>High quality bombilla - this straw seems very well built and not flimsy like some others I own.  </li>
      <li>Good way to drink loose tea.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it so far! It&#x27;s the second bombilla I&#x27;ve had and the first of this particular style. Both my husband and I tend to choose this one over the other one when we drink Yerba Matte.  I will say, however, that I actually don&#x27;t like the look of it. The gold bead-looking thing with the red dot look really cheap and silly to me and I would have appreciated a simpler look. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 out of 5. Great bombilla!</li>
    <li> Looks nice I wish it was a little bigger</li>
    <li> This works great for my yerba mate.  Some smaller particles still got through, but I looked up different ways of preparing my mate.  You need to shake the larger parts around the straw to act as a secondary filter.  As others have said, very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The straw is curved on top and bottom, which is not realy visible in the picture.  It is very pretty and the holes on the bottom are small enough to keep tea leaves from getting into your mouth.  I happily gave one as a gift and got one for myself.</li>
    <li> I have received this product as a gift from my friend. She knows I love to drink tea! I have had those little tea ball brewers, but by far this is really neat. Put the amount of tea into your cup and brew away. I also like how I can use the Bombilla to mix any natural sweetener like a spoon. The neat part of this product is you can even get every last drop from the bottom of the cup with just a slight tilt. In agreement with other customers the Bombilla is easy to clean. The quality is nice, and product is heavier then it looks this is a good thing because it is nice and sturdy. The red ruby studs add a nice \\&quot;royal\\&quot; touch.</li>
    <li> This straw makes it so easy to prepare and drink loose leaf tea. I&#x27;ve always wanted to drink more tea this way, but I guess I was too lazy to go through the process of straining or using one of those little ball-filters. Now all I have to do is dump my tea in the cup, stick the straw in and enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is my first yerba mate tea straw... I hope to use it for other loose teas as well!! I&#x27;m so very thankful for other reviewers to help me make the right choice!!! God bless you guys!!</li>
    <li> I first gave this bombilla 5 stars but after regular use for less than one year the holes rusted. I called the company who makes it and they said they had change suppliers (so no longer making this bombilla) and would not do anything about mine which rusted. I do NOT recommend this Bombilla nor any made/carried by this company!</li>
    <li> Love this bombilla.  As other users have said, it&#x27;s easy to clean and filters well.  It also has a better feel on the mouth than a stock bombilla I have that came with a gourd.</li>
    <li> esta bombilla es muy Buena para tomar mate( this bombilla is very good to drink Mate, very satisfied.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect. It keeps out the dried tea leaves and it&#x27;s quite easy to clean. &#x3D;o)</li>
    <li> I chose this bombilla after reading the reviews of several different brands.   Everyone seemed to like this one best, and many reviewers were able to compare it to others.  I had used one other brand years ago, it was okay, but not as nice as this one.     It is truly a joy to use, and although I have yerba maté that is extremely fine ground, it truly does strain it all out.  It has a nice heft to it. Goodbye to tea strainers and french presses, this is my new favorite way to drink maté!!  PS, The shipping was the same for two as for one, so I bought two.</li>
    <li> With the great reviews I ordered this over a month before Christmas.  Did I get it? NO.  Two days before Christmas I get a note that this is no longer available from Nutricity, despite their page saying they are in stock and can ship immediately.  VERY UNHAPPY Christmas for the family involved.</li>
    <li> I mean... it&#x27;s a straw. You can&#x27;t really go wrong with a straw.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a bit too short, though. You can probably find a cheaper version of this product that is longer.</li>
    <li> it a great piece or art , so happy with it,&lt;br /&gt;I am surprise of getting such an excellent product</li>
    <li> This loose tea straw brings a welcome lift to my everyday life.  I didn&#x27;t know I wanted it until I saw it advertised in a magazine.</li>
    <li> Our dental hygienists suggested we stop drinking tea to minimize staining on our teeth between cleanings. An alternative, we read, is to use a bombilla to route the hot liquid past the teeth. This is a very attractive straw, but since it is metal it conducts heat too well to both fingers and lips. Also, using a bombilla disinclines us from testing the heat of the liquid well enough--something we&#x27;d usually do automatically as we got close to the hot liquid to take a sip. And maybe most importantly, the inhalation of the aromas and the first taste at the tip of the tongue as the hot tea enters the mouth are crucial to the experience of drinking hot beverages, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We considered finding a wooden/bamboo bombilla, but since this piece remains in our kitchen utility drawer as a curiosity, we&#x27;ve decided instead just to double up on our visits to our dental hygienists. A handsome product, but it compromises too much the experience of drinking tea for both of us.</li>
    <li> High quality bombilla - this straw seems very well built and not flimsy like some others I own.  It&#x27;s my go to bombilla for my yate drinking.</li>
    <li> I like to drink leaf tea and this allows you to sip it without using a teaball because it strains the tea as you drink it. I do have one warning though: be sure to explain that is for drinking tea because it looks a lot like a pipe and your co-working might wonder what you are REALLY doing on your break!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first bombilla so I can&#x27;t compare to any others; but this is what I have experienced:&lt;br /&gt;*  It never clogs and it is always easy to sip from.  This is a good thing as this bombilla does not allow for internal cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;* It gets extremely hot in newly prepared brews.  The plus is that it forces you to wait for the tea to cool. There have been reports of mouth cancer from drinking very hot liquids through a straw. Nevertheless, my next bombilla purchase will definitely be wood unless there are metal bombillas that offer some insulating properties&lt;br /&gt;* It is exactly one inch too short for the vessels that we drink our tea from so we have to &#x27;fish&#x27; the bombilla out before drinking.  If you use a tall glass you might want to measure the height before ordering.</li>
    <li> I am new to Mate. I have wanted to start drinking it for a long time. Just bought the tea (would recommend getting brand other than Guayaki, maybe their San Mateo is better!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...for the Bombilla, it is great! I would recommend. It doesn&#x27;t come apart so there may be times when it is hard to clean. But it is very sturdy and genuine looking. I like it a lot! thumbs up :-)!</li>
    <li> Works great with fine-leafed teas and will purchase another for another family member.</li>
    <li> It works great. And so far it hasn&#x27;t changed colors when I wash it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product for a good price. Would definitely recommend. One note: I was surprised as I thought the tea straw had a red crystal or bead recessed in the handle, but it is painted with a red dot. It does not take away from the beauty or quality though.</li>
    <li> This is a very good straw, probably the best I have ever owned. it is also pretty as it comes with a little artsy detail. It&#x27;s not too big and the holes are small enough to prevent leaves from going in. I also like that it has a slightly curved shape that helps with staying still in my cup.</li>
    <li> I bought two more, this one is very good.  A bit smaller diameter straw than others, but that&#x27;s no problem.  The metal has not tarnished yet.</li>
    <li> I adore. Keeps my teeth white while drinking tea or other beverages. Easy to clean (I clean with warm water and a little soap if needed then blow through the straw to get out any remaining water), beautiful, recommend!! Loose leaf tea of Yerba Mate helps the enviroment also because tea bags are not being used. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Hey, why filter the pot? Just filter what you&#x27;re sipping! This is a very nicely constructed bombilla (admittedly, my first). The expressed purpose is for drinking yerba mate, but I actually used it on some loose-leaf tea I had on hand, and it works great for that, too! A fun purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful bombilla, works great with my Mate.  What was not clear to me is that the picture shows only the straight part of the straw when in fact, the whole length starts with brass curved lip piece then what you see in the picture followed by and opposite curve (S curve) to where the spoon shape filter is. All is silver with the exception of the mouth piece.   This is much prettier than the picture shows.</li>
    <li> a bit more plastic feeling than i would have liked, but great for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome design and great utensil. Very fun and unique.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very stylish.</li>
    <li> Really nice, seems well made, pretty long so good for tallish mugs, and works perfectly. Glad I got it for those not-so-well-sealed teabags.</li>
    <li> Steep &amp; sip herbal tea straight from the cup without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it means less time in the kitchen, waiting to steep and strain.&lt;br /&gt;Do let it cool a bit before drinking as it conducts heat...</li>
    <li> I have used this bombilla for about a year with no problems or issues. It does a great job of filtering Yerba Mate and other loose leaf teas and herbs. The decoration on this bombilla are nice and add a touch of class. The bottom of the straw does not detach and I think it is advertised to detach for easy cleaning. However it still very easy to clean by running water though it backwards. I will buy more of this brand.</li>
    <li> unlike some other bombilla&#x27;s, this one has a clean draw, a clear taste and no bitter metallic aftertaste. this is the second bombilla I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have to say that this is the better of the two.</li>
    <li> So far, the straw filters well with both CBSe and Guayaki yerba mate. I&#x27;ve tried cold and hot tea and it still functions well. No sediment or leaves coming through! One thing that would be nice if the mouthpiece were wood/not metal because it gets really hot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shorter than my other bombillas, but still works just fine if I&#x27;m using a mug or gourd. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> my dad loves this, i bought it as a gift to go with his gourd.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great for loose teas. Had trouble with mate getting through other filters. Use for green tea too. Loose leaf is so much more economical than tea bags too. This works way better. Have been using it every day for past couple weeks. Doesn&#x27;t seen to get too hot. The ring in the middle helps with that too. Great product! Helps to have a little tea straine later to get loose leaf out of the cup</li>
    <li> Awesome straw, love it, great quality</li>
    <li> The first bombilla straw that I got from a friend let a lot of leaves through but this one works quite well.  You may get a little if you move it around too much or stir with it but it definitely works as intended for normal use. I really like the way it looks, too!</li>
    <li> I have several Bombilla Straws for loose tea and so far this is the best!!  Definitely keeps out tea leaves -easy to clean! Melody</li>
    <li> This bombilla is great.  It doesn&#x27;t clog because of the flat curved base.  I&#x27;ve used other bombilla&#x27;s and this one works the best.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of mate and have multiple bombillas. This is a sturdy straw that works well but the only downside is that the filter doesn&#x27;t separate, making it harder to clean. I would recommend a bombilla that screws apart at the bottom for easier access to the little leaves that may get stuck in there.</li>
    <li> This bombilla works perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t clog easily. In actuality, it has never clogged on me once. The design and appearance is easy on the eyes. It is a good product overall</li>
    <li> The straw is good, but the package was crushed. I bought it for a gift -- decided to just keep it since the box was damaged. I now have many more than I need!</li>
    <li> Yerba Mate tea is loose leaf and this straw has a filter on the end so you can drink the tea and the leaves stay in the cup. It is the traditional way that Yerba Mate tea is drank in South America. Authentic. :) Enjoy.</li>
    <li> A piece of crap. Rusted after few uses. Made in China, of course.</li>
    <li> I was looking to purchase a replacement bombilla and this one definitely works. I gave four stars only because I am not a fan of the &amp;#34;jeweled&amp;#34; embellishments. As far as functionality this bombilla is far superior to my previous one that had a removable strainer. I am able to use it to scrap my gourd after my matte has washed out and it is more than up to the task. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why I bought this.  Hot stuff through a metal straw.  What was I thinking? Stupid buy on my part.</li>
    <li> Good way to drink loose tea. The bombilla is a very sturdy metal and appealing to look at. It is, as others have mentioned, a bit shorter than it looks from my photo. Mine measures about 6.7\\&quot; inches long. Maybe that is normal if using a gourd, but it&#x27;s shorter than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Minor detail there, I&#x27;m otherwise very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Great quality. Very pretty. Doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap at all. Much nicer in hand than in photo.</li>
    <li> Stylish and functional! Never experienced clogging with this when drinking my yerba mate.</li>
    <li> The finish is coming off after a few weeks of use. But for the price this is the best bombilla you can find on the Amazon. Filters extremely well.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Great straw!</li>
    <li> Performs as expected, looks as described.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works well. Would like to have one designed for taller tea cups.</li>
