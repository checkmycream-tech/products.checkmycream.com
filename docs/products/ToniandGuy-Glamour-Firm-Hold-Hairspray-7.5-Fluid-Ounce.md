      <li>It is the best styling product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This has a very good hold and it provides excellent volume.</li>
      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>The best I can say, is that it has a pleasant scent.</li>

      <li>The Toni &amp; Guy conditioners and shampoo I&#x27;ve tried have worked great</li>
      <li>I love the Toni &amp; Guy conditioner however, which is why I would think my hair type isn&#x27;t the best for this product.</li>
      <li>Toni &amp; Guy are known for superior product and this soufflé like product is great.</li>

      <li>Odor is unobtrusive but pleasant.  </li>

      <li>There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as good as products I already have.</li>
      <li>Which means lots of static and fly away hair.</li>
      <li>so I was very glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the Tono&amp;Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that&#x27;s another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I&#x27;d be set.</li>
      <li>and this stuff keeps my curls nice with a bounce but not flaky or oily.</li>
      <li>This is kind of a waxy cream.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you what the smell is, but it&#x27;s not the kind of smell that tweens go in for -</li>
      <li>It does have a nice texture and scent.</li>
      <li>product is kind of a pain to use.</li>
      <li>Just a nice shine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice, but the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong and was rather nondescript to me.  </li>
      <li>anything, one might tend to use MORE than you really need for the best effect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not something I plan to use every day, but it will help me feel good about my hairstyle when I want it to look nice and full.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a very light product because of the whip name, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>stress that hair can be the most important fashion accessory, and I tend to agree -- a good cut, and the right products can help a person look good, and feel confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that pumps up my hair that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily.</li>
      <li>My hair has never felt better than it does not with using the regiment of Toni&amp;Guy products.  </li>
      <li>which remains my favorite).</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance as it reminds me of Summer.  </li>
      <li>I have always used Rusk volumizer spray before blow drying and straightening and it provided more root oomph.</li>
      <li>The shorter my hair was, the more volume I got at the roots.  </li>
      <li>so it mike work better on better behaved hair.</li>
      <li>My hair seemed to have a bit more shine, too.  </li>
      <li>I think for thicker hair it probably works much  better because there is more hair to get better volume.</li>
      <li>and I bet this would have better plumping power on longer locks than mine.</li>
      <li>On top of that, my hair tangled more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have tried several and this is the best one.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll continue to search for better, if it exists.</li>
      <li>I really love this hair product.  </li>
      <li>Nice fragrance, and works well to lift hair for a full look after drying.  </li>
      <li>I used mostly around my roots, but lightly spread throughout my hair.  </li>
      <li>; may have been a bit much for my chin length hair, but it still feels good.</li>
      <li>It goes on \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and is easy to work with.</li>
      <li>A-line, and its texture is baby fine, although I have quite a bit of hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d call the smell &amp;#34;unisex,&amp;#34; for it would be fine for a man.</li>
      <li>After a long winter this is a most welcome thing.  </li>
      <li>this will work just fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily.</li>
      <li>Although a little pricey, [[ASIN:B00CCYOHPQ Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 Hour Sustainable Volume Spray-4.2 oz.]] is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Even on a second day blow out, it still kept the fly aways under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The consistency of the plumping whip reminds me of cheap conditioners that I used to purchase from the grocery store before upgrading to Matrix (purchased from Ulta Beauty).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a light smell that isn&#x27;t offputting.</li>
      <li>it is light once in</li>
      <li>Good product for soft fullness</li>
      <li>In Seattle on a humid day I have the recipe for a disaster right on top of my head.  </li>
      <li>The point is that you&#x27;ll find out what works best for you after a couple of uses—but start out small and go from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and doesn&#x27;t really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell.</li>
      <li>If your hair is fine and stubborn, this is the right styling product for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for products that add body, but unfortunately, most hair styling products have way too much scent for my taste.</li>
      <li>Love this new Toni &amp; Guy product!</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>It never has that horrid crunchiness that some gels and mousses give to hair, so my feels much more free and natural.</li>
      <li>think this would work better on softer styles, maybe on shoulder length hair where a soft wave is wanted, not so much for shorter more geometric styling where volume is desired.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t an inexpensive product - although certainly not as expensive as some salon products - but I will probably purchase again if I continue having the same good results.</li>
      <li>I then blow dry my hair with a brush/dryer and always get good volume.  </li>
      <li>The product is lightweight and easy to apply, and it kept my wavy-curly hair soft and free of flyaways and frizz.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t be fooled by the light texture, this will really give you a root-lift and a bit of all over shine you will like.</li>
      <li>so I think it is well worth price.</li>
      <li>Best on wet hair and only on the roots.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth pampering your hair and feeling like a million bucks afterward.  </li>
      <li>The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyone with thinning hair might want to pay special attention to this one, as it does make it look like you have more hair, and is so simple to work with.  </li>
      <li>It took me a bit of time to figure out the right</li>
      <li>Realistically, I think the amount of volume that it added was about the max that I&#x27;m going to be able to get without weighing down my baby fine hair while still leaving it looking clean and shiny, so I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I really loved this plumping whip, but with such a small pot I imagine I&#x27;ll go through it too quickly for it to be worthwhile!  </li>
      <li>sort of liked what it did, but it&#x27;s a lot of trouble for something that doesn&#x27;t really work better than anything else.</li>
      <li>It protects your hair from the curling iron and really makes my fine hair very manageable.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length hair that is kind of thick but very fine and straight.</li>
      <li>My hair looks clean and not dull or sticky like some products.</li>
      <li>a little before I felt good about the results.</li>
      <li>For my fine hair it weighed it down more than plumped it up.</li>
      <li>product is about volume and one can do so many things to create different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(oh, yes, the &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34;) to my hair as instructed on the package.</li>
      <li>Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp.</li>
      <li>I am a bit of a nut when it comes to my hair and buying a whole line to try it out is so worth it.  </li>
      <li>and it really does work!</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying a product like this</li>
      <li>Obviously the price here is better.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t love the product personally</li>
      <li>Overall, it was an ok product.</li>
      <li>That was the first positive thing I noticed about the Toni &amp; Guy &amp;#34;Glamor Volume Plumping Whip&amp;#34; (too much of mouthful of a name!)</li>
      <li>I have straight short brown hair and this helps with me styling it the way that I want and most importantly holds my hair for several hours after</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Oh my hair is so damn unruly and this stuff keeps my curls nice with a bounce but not flaky or oily. Just a nice shine. I bought two.</li>
    <li> Amount smaller then I expected.  Haven&#x27;t used it that much to really judge what was promised</li>
    <li> I really love this hair product.  Have tried several and this is the best one.  Nice fragrance, and works well to lift hair for a full look after drying.  This is a product I will re-purchase for future use.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for ways to give my hair&#x27;s volume a little boost. Toni and Guy&#x27;s plumping whip sounded like just the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is not what I expected. It&#x27;s basically just a sticky styling lotion. I put some in my roots and the rest of my hair. It didn&#x27;t really do much for me. My hair is now grey and a little wiry so it mike work better on better behaved hair. It didn&#x27;t give me volume at the roots or control anywhere else. On top of that, my hair tangled more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, smell great.</li>
    <li> What can I say, great product. A little goes a long way. Don&#x27;t use too much as it will feel heavy and greasy. Best on wet hair and only on the roots. My hair lacks volume and looks like something from the 60&#x27;s no matter how hard I try.  A little bit of this product on the roots of my bangs and front half of the scalp, I get enough volume to give a little bounce</li>
    <li> I really loved this plumping whip, but with such a small pot I imagine I&#x27;ll go through it too quickly for it to be worthwhile!  The product is lightweight and easy to apply, and it kept my wavy-curly hair soft and free of flyaways and frizz.  It never has that horrid crunchiness that some gels and mousses give to hair, so my feels much more free and natural.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about how well Toni&amp;Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip would work on my medium-thick course hair.  The product has the look and consistency of face cream; I was sure it would be too heavy and oily. To my surprise, a walnut-sized dollop of the product applied at the roots of towel dried hair really did increase the volume and bounce of my hair after blowdrying. My hair seemed to have a bit more shine, too.  As an added benefit, the Glamour Volume Plumping Whip has a pleasant fragrance. This isn&#x27;t an inexpensive product - although certainly not as expensive as some salon products - but I will probably purchase again if I continue having the same good results.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair that is kind of thick but very fine and straight. I used this Toni&amp;Guy Volume Plumping Whip to give my hair a little volume and lift at the crown. A lot of volume adding products are too heavy and just weigh my hair down, but this one was different. I applied a little less than the walnut sized amount that they recommend to the roots of my hair right after shampooing and messaged it it, then blow dried it. It was light, so my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and it gave it a small amount of lift and volume. My hair looks clean and not dull or sticky like some products. Realistically, I think the amount of volume that it added was about the max that I&#x27;m going to be able to get without weighing down my baby fine hair while still leaving it looking clean and shiny, so I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully (use less than recommended because my hair  is short and somewhat thin).  Gave plenty of volume, hold and smellswonderful</li>
    <li> This looks like a cold cream when you open the jar.  It&#x27;s just a bit thinner than a cream like that.  You towel dry your hair, then apply it at the roots.  As it dries, it gives you a bit of root stiffies that actually plumps the hair up away from the head, so it adds some volume and thickness.  It works a bit like a mousse, but is a good bit stronger than that.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt though.  Even after brushing, my hair felt a bit dirty, like it does with heavier products.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, but the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong and was rather nondescript to me.  I suspect it might work best on shorter hair that needs a lot of volume and a more sculpted look.  For long hair, there&#x27;s just more comfortable products that give the same amount of volume.</li>
    <li> Long, curly, baby fine hair.  In Seattle on a humid day I have the recipe for a disaster right on top of my head.  The Toni&amp;Guy plumping whip was made for me!  It increases the volume, and leaves my hair soft and not stiff.  Can either let it go curly, or dry it straight.  Pop it into my gym bag and no worries about leaking all over my stuff.  It distributes easily into hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky mess all over your hands.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the great results from the Toni &amp; Guy Plumping Whip that I&#x27;d hoped for. For my fine hair it weighed it down more than plumped it up. I think for thicker hair it probably works much  better because there is more hair to get better volume. My hair is shoulder length as well and I bet this would have better plumping power on longer locks than mine. I love the Toni &amp; Guy conditioner however, which is why I would think my hair type isn&#x27;t the best for this product. The Toni &amp; Guy conditioners and shampoo I&#x27;ve tried have worked great so I was a little surprised when using this product that it didn&#x27;t give my any added boosts because normally I get great results with their products.</li>
    <li> This product was open &amp; half used. awful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune buying hair products that promised to help my thin, fine hair, to no avail.  Toni&amp;Guy Volume Plumping Whip is one of only two products I can think of that really work for me.  I dip my fingertips lightly into the product, then rub it gently into the roots of my hair from front to back while it is still damp, but not soaking wet.  I think the key is to use less and not more. I then blow dry my hair with a brush/dryer and always get good volume.  My hair is a few inches below my ears...not really long or short, but medium length.  The shorter my hair was, the more volume I got at the roots.  I&#x27;m sold on this whip as is my husband.  I caught him using it one day and he raved about it.  His hair is thick and curly, but it helped smooth out his curls.  I&#x27;m a convert and will be using this product from here on out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months and bought it at a discount department store for $15.99 before it was available here on Amazon. Obviously the price here is better.I love what it does for my thin, straight hair. It increases volume at the roots. Gives my style a bounce and maintains volume somewhat into the second day. I don&#x27;t use any other styling product but this.....don&#x27;t need it now.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that is currently past my shoulder blades.  It is very thin,especially towards the front crown area after the birth of my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this product on towel dried hair and dry as well.  Both times I was left with a greasy, shiny look that was rather stiff.  I started with a very small amount because I do know that my hair is thin; regardless of the amount used, the same effect was -begrudgingly achieved!  It did tame fly-away hairs but then it looked and felt greasy.  As far as bounce and plumping qualities they were not anymore prevalent than when I ordinarily wash my and style my hair that first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend this product for thin hair.  Felt as if I was applying cream to my hair and expecting a miracle.  There is no way that thinner hair can have a thick cream based product applied and expected to be bouncy and volume-ized.  Too little product for the price even for those that achieve what it states.  Look somewhere else.  I have always used Rusk volumizer spray before blow drying and straightening and it provided more root oomph.</li>
    <li> This did not give my hair volume. It did make it very soft which actually weighed it down more.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair sticky and weighed down. Save your money</li>
    <li> Good product for soft fullness</li>
    <li> Want a salon experience then use Toni&amp;Guy products.  This plumping whip adds tons of volumn to even the most difficult of hair and you look like you just had it professionally done.  Love the fragrance as it reminds me of Summer.  After a long winter this is a most welcome thing.  My hair has never felt better than it does not with using the regiment of Toni&amp;Guy products.  It&#x27;s so worth pampering your hair and feeling like a million bucks afterward.  I am a bit of a nut when it comes to my hair and buying a whole line to try it out is so worth it.  I really, really recommend this.</li>
    <li> Not as good as products I already have.</li>
    <li> Over the last 52 years I have made demands on my body and backed it up with miracle products. I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I&#x27;m at that &amp;#34;I need a haircut&amp;#34; stage where I&#x27;m not sure what I want to do with it, so it&#x27;s sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&amp;guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn&#x27;t really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn&#x27;t stick out and that worked too, so if you&#x27;re doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the Tono&amp;Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that&#x27;s another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I&#x27;d be set.</li>
    <li> This is kind of a waxy cream.  I used mostly around my roots, but lightly spread throughout my hair.  It did provide some volume but I expected more.  You really need to use a hair dryer to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; the volume; this product does not do much if you let hair just air dry.  It did not make my hair particularly greasy or cause it to get dirty any faster than usual.  One thing I did not like was that it tended to make my scalp itchy, possibly due to the scent used in the product.  Overall, an average product but expensive.  Volumizing sprays are the same or better with less fussing (spray, comb &amp; go).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 6 months. It is the best styling product I have ever used. A very small amount goes a long way . It protects your hair from the curling iron and really makes my fine hair very manageable. A jar lasts me a couple of months so I think it is well worth price. I used to get it at Walmart or Target but they aren&#x27;t handling it anymore so I was very glad to find it on Amazon. I got it in just 3 days on regular shipping.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love the product personally but it wasn&#x27;t bad.  This was my first time trying a product like this and it wasn&#x27;t for me.  As described, product met all expectations.  Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I had to practice with this product a little before I felt good about the results. It can be sticky and make my hair feel greasy if I use too much, so I have to be careful. If I don&#x27;t use enough, then it doesnt&#x27; really do anything. After I used it a few times, I felt like I had learned the best way to use it for my thin hair and make it look fuller and thicker. Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t a lot of whip in the small jar, so I wasted quite a bit practicing with it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy another jar, though, because I like the results. It&#x27;s not something I plan to use every day, but it will help me feel good about my hairstyle when I want it to look nice and full.</li>
    <li> I have thin not-quite straight hair that looks pretty lifeless without styling. I&#x27;m always looking for products that add body, but unfortunately, most hair styling products have way too much scent for my taste. That was the first positive thing I noticed about the Toni &amp; Guy &amp;#34;Glamor Volume Plumping Whip&amp;#34; (too much of mouthful of a name!) - it has a lovely subtle smell. I&#x27;d call the smell &amp;#34;unisex,&amp;#34; for it would be fine for a man. I can&#x27;t tell you what the smell is, but it&#x27;s not the kind of smell that tweens go in for - it is subtle in a sophisticated way, and as a not-young woman, I appreciate that greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the cream (oh, yes, the &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34;) to my hair as instructed on the package. A &amp;#34;walnut sized amount&amp;#34; may have been a bit much for my chin length hair, but it still feels good. After a complete blow dry, I can barely feel the product in my hair. Another big plus, to say the least. My hair looks natural but thicker, with no frizzies and flyaways. It may be a tad less shiny than usual, but I will not complain because this product does what it says. Five stars (and believe me, I&#x27;m a tough reviewer!)</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. I was hoping to plump my hair at the roots and have some volume for my blah hair.  I tried it on three occasions, each time working a small amount into towel dried hair (as the instructions state).  I noticed nothing.  No volume, no lift.  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time I used less and less, and still ended up immediately with a greasy feeling in my clean hair.  In fact, it seemed to weigh down my hair more than anything else. Plus, I had to rewash immediately to get rid of the oil feel. Ick.  Not only does it feel gross, but makes me wonder what is going to get on my skin....sometimes hair products that are oily can cause pimples and breakouts.</li>
    <li> If your hair is fine and stubborn, this is the right styling product for you. Now I have volume, waves, and hair!</li>
    <li> Love this new Toni &amp; Guy product! I have been hit and miss on their products but this one works great with my hair type. I have straight short brown hair and this helps with me styling it the way that I want and most importantly holds my hair for several hours after and I dont have to constantly be looking in the mirror worrying about it. Loved the texture on my hand as well as the smell. Price was a little high but it is a high end product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Toni &amp; Guy are known for superior product and this soufflé like product is great. Just a small amount  is needed to perk up and styly your hair, with more volume than you might have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, one might tend to use MORE than you really need for the best effect. don&#x27;t be fooled by the light texture, this will really give you a root-lift and a bit of all over shine you will like. The ad&#x27;s for Toni &amp; Guy stress that hair can be the most important fashion accessory, and I tend to agree -- a good cut, and the right products can help a person look good, and feel confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with thinning hair might want to pay special attention to this one, as it does make it look like you have more hair, and is so simple to work with.  This can also be used for touch-up&#x27;s during the day, into night.</li>
    <li> Toni&amp;Guy was a new-to-me brand before I decided to try out the plumping whip. My hair is cut into an above-the-shoulders A-line, and its texture is baby fine, although I have quite a bit of hair. One of my biggest frustrations is never getting as much volume as I would like when it&#x27;s just me styling my hair. I&#x27;ve tried powders, sprays, and other products that have a similar texture to Toni&amp;Guy plumping whip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the plumping whip reminds me of cheap conditioners that I used to purchase from the grocery store before upgrading to Matrix (purchased from Ulta Beauty). Before adding in the plumping whip, I let my hair air dry for about fifteen minutes. The directions are a bit confusing as to how much product to use; they suggest a walnut-sized amount, but does that mean with the shell on or without? Trial and error with the plumping whip allows me to recommend that if you do try out this product for yourself that less is better. If you have a short hair style, then a dime size amount should work just fine. If you have longer hair, you may want to double or triple the dime size, depending on your length, texture, etc. The point is that you&#x27;ll find out what works best for you after a couple of uses—but start out small and go from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair took much longer to dry with the volume plumping whip, and felt sort of sticky to me once it was &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34; Trying to straighten out my light, natural waves with a flat iron after using the plumping whip proved frustrating. I could not get the strands of hair shaped into my desired form, and the after effect was greasy looking, even though I&#x27;d just washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mornings after using the plumping whip, my hair looks even worse, especially around the crown. I never want to leave the house—even for the gym—if my hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a few days. I also lose whatever shape I managed to do the day before the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave Toni&amp;Guy afair shot, but it&#x27;s just not right for my hair type. Oh, and as far as volume goes? The plumping whip does nothing for me in that respect. It&#x27;s a bit too heavy for my hair despite being lightweight itself, and makes my hair lay just as flat as it would without it, though possibly even flatter.</li>
    <li> This has a very good hold and it provides excellent volume. It goes on \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and is easy to work with. If you work it through evenly on damp hair it will give you noticeably fuller volume hair if you blow dry and use a round brush or otherwise a technique that is designed to add volume as well. The only thing I&#x27;m not fond of is the chemical smell. It does dissipate once it&#x27;s on your head but it is a little overpowering. This is now one of my main go to products (along with [[ASIN:B002TYF8XE Catwalk Your Highness Thickening Gel Cr&amp;egrave;me By Tigi, 7.27 Ounce]] which remains my favorite). If you have fine, thin hair that is prone to looking/feeling greasy and oily with too much product give this a try. Although at first glance you&#x27;ll think it too heavy it is light once in and it really does work!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and I&#x27;m cautious of maintaining it before of chorine damage. I gave this product a try as an alternative method of styling. After using it a few times, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is kind of a pain to use. It&#x27;s meant to be used a little while after getting out of the shower. Even then, it&#x27;s hard to really get this going to style your hair even if you follow the direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sort of liked what it did, but it&#x27;s a lot of trouble for something that doesn&#x27;t really work better than anything else. If you&#x27;re looking for a plumping whip, you might want to give this a try, but I wasn&#x27;t all that enthused.</li>
    <li> Not for me! To goopy and thick for the volume I want-</li>
    <li> I’m always looking for something new to improve my difficult hair and this Toni and Guy Volume Plumping Whip was my latest experiment. I keep my hair short and it manages to be wavy and fine at the same time so I’ve used some very stiff and waxy styling products on occasion and somehow thought this would be similar to what is usually called a wax to keep the style in place and add however much volume or fullness as desired. This styling cream is not that stuff. It left my hair soft and easy to brush without adding any residue or buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would work better on softer styles, maybe on shoulder length hair where a soft wave is wanted, not so much for shorter more geometric styling where volume is desired. I will continue to use it when I need some extra moisture or protection from the elements, but not so much when I’m looking for volume and stiffer control.</li>
    <li> With 2.82 fluid ounces, I had to remind myself to follow the instructions by using a walnut sized amount in one application.  I used this to style my girls&#x27; hair and it was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is about volume and one can do so many things to create different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are parabens in this whip.  Parabens are associated with some cancer tumors but not proven to cause them.  Knowing this takes a little of the fun out for me, but I like it otherwise.</li>
    <li> Both times that I experimented with the product, I found the results unsatisfactory. It made my hair a bit smoother, but I couldn&#x27;t achieve any real volume with it. The best I can say, is that it has a pleasant scent. (But those with fragrance sensitivities/allergies may find themselves bothered by it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I must agree with several reviewers who sagely noted that the components of the product are less-than-healthy. The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward. Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp. Ultimately, this made me way too nervous to continue to use it, so I tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are number of better, more effective, less expensive products on the market. Although a little pricey, [[ASIN:B00CCYOHPQ Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 Hour Sustainable Volume Spray-4.2 oz.]] is amazing!!! And completely natural! Give that one a try.</li>
    <li> Although it looks a bit disgusting to look at initially, it does work on my thin long hair reasonably well. However, it did have problems with maintaining the look for an extended length of time. Overall, it was an ok product. Would I use it again? Probably not, I didn&#x27;t quite like the feel of my hair with it on.</li>
    <li> I have medium strong long hair and use this to add volume to the front of my hair.  It has a good thick consistency that doesn&#x27;t dry to an itch.  You can get a little build-up after regular use but I usually switch hair shampoos midweek to deal with this issue so it&#x27;s a non-issue for me.  Odor is unobtrusive but pleasant.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> From my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length, thin, flat, professionally colored/highlighted hair.  I was expecting a very light product because of the whip name, but it wasn&#x27;t. It was thicker than a mousse, but lighter than a cream. It does have a nice texture and scent. They recommend using a walnut size amount. That may work for thicker hair. I found the more I used, the more I felt like I had a heavy hair product on my roots, even when my hair was dry. This product did not add any extra volume to my flat hair than a normal blow dry would. It does control fly away hair. Even on a second day blow out, it still kept the fly aways under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product depending on your hair texture and needs. Right now it&#x27;s winter where I live and the temperature has been low twenties. Which means lots of static and fly away hair. So I have been using this product, just in smaller amounts than recommended.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair in a chin length bob. I used a small amount of product on clean towel-dried hair. My hair ended up looking really greasy, with no volume. Was really disappointed - even had to spray in some dry shampoo to try revive it and make it look less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Was trying to find a cheaper alternative to the Oscar Blandi mousse that I love, which is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> This is a product you need to use judiciously.  Too little and you don&#x27;t get the volume you want.  Too much and your hair can get a greasy, over-product, look. It took me a bit of time to figure out the right mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light smell that isn&#x27;t offputting.</li>
    <li> It definitely adds volume and shine but it can be a tad &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; in your hair. I continue use because I&#x27;d prefer volume to my flat, fine hair than not and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that pumps up my hair that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily. It&#x27;s a decent product but I&#x27;ll continue to search for better, if it exists.</li>
</ol>
