      <li>This conditioner is great.  </li>
      <li>The smell is great too.</li>
      <li>which was a great combo but having run out, I was shopping for a sale and spotting ABBA at a good price I purchased the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>Good price.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this conditioner after doing some searching for good products for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>so I need a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>this is probably a good product for you....</li>
      <li>that was good too! :-)</li>
      <li>kind of like coconut</li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle at the hair salon and found this to be a great savings.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, and really softens hair.</li>
      <li>it works well, just not my favorite.  </li>

      <li>-Interesting scent for this line</li>

      <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
      <li>I love Abba products.</li>
      <li>I will say that I love the way the shampoo smells.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now</li>
      <li>I love that this is a vegan conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Hope this helps. :-)</li>
      <li>My very curly/Caucasian hair curled even more and more defined as well, which for me I liked.</li>
      <li>-A liter retails around $30, I was able however to get this on a great sale at Ulta for $14.99 (which is about the same price as the 8oz version of this product!)  </li>
      <li>I would prefer that my hair products smelled fresh &amp; clean instead of like some kind of food, but this still smells good and the scent doesn&#x27;t really linger after washing hair</li>
      <li>And it created &#x27;huge&#x27; hair volume-being a Leo-</li>
      <li>Sulfate free</li>
      <li>the smell is light ...</li>
      <li>i put this in and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Do I enjoy it?</li>
      <li>Although, if you&#x27;re looking for something that is specifically 100% Vegan, Synthetic Dye free and</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a sulphate free &#x27;color protect&#x27; conditioner that works and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky...</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>The smell is clean and not overpowering</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft and manageable and smell good and fresh.  </li>
      <li>This product is good enough that I will use it up, but I would not buy again.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it really protects the vitality of my color.  </li>
      <li>The price through this seller is very competitive-you won&#x27;t find a better conditioner at this price point.</li>
      <li>(it has a mild coconut-fruity scent).</li>
      <li>probably a more realistic tip for salon usage.  </li>
      <li>My order came quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
      <li>Ofcourse not as much suds as the sulfate shampoos (that is fine by me) and</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overly powerful, just something light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is excellent for my thick hair it leaves it soft and tangle free, no retail product is even up to the task</li>
      <li>I tried the 6.76 Ounce size out and loved it so much that I bought the big 33.8 Ouncer!</li>
      <li>My hair has been damaged from dyeing and just from having a thin hair follicle, so this is great stuff for it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, though I rarely have colored my hair over the years.</li>
      <li>This conditioner hits just the right balance of moisture without heaviness or oiliness.  </li>
      <li>I have long fine hair that tangles easy</li>
      <li>It does seem to be effective &amp; gentle enough that it cleans and does not fade color</li>
      <li>Also, when dry, I run my fingers thru and the very ends of the curls snag and knot more easily.</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and makes your hair super soft.  </li>
      <li>at 38 I finally like my hair :)</li>
      <li>So glad I purchased the big bottle.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting</li>
      <li>It really does make my highlights pop!</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife based on the positive reviews, but she hates it.  </li>
      <li>When I first applied it I really thought of flea and tick shampoo.</li>
      <li>This bottle good price on amazon last a long time.</li>
      <li>I do color my hair and am not sure if it really \\&quot;protects\\&quot; the color, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling great</li>
      <li>Protects color, conditions hair without leaving it limp, rinses easily, and is environmentally friendly.</li>
      <li>I really like this hair conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>but my hair does not feel very hydrated/conditioned after using the shampoo/conditioner set</li>
      <li>While those are important factors for me, it is not enough for me to continue using this product.</li>
      <li>It causes my hair to break and is much frizzier than before I used the product.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I can think of with this particular product that was promising for me was that it is sulfate and dea free.</li>
      <li>-Cap is a push-snap top up and down  </li>
      <li>Love the absence of many common chemicals.</li>
      <li>This product is priced well and had decent reviews.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, which is always consistently high quality.</li>
      <li>It may just be my hair type because I saw this product got great reviews from others, but it hasn&#x27;t worked for me unfortunately.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend Abba Hair products, it&#x27;s not harsh on your hair and it leaves it feeling so soft and very manageable.</li>
      <li>Keeps color alive - no fading!</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny, healthier and even thicker!</li>
      <li>, the 33.8oz is pretty large and kind of awkward to hold and pour in your hand, especially when it&#x27;s full of product &amp; wet; I would recommend a pump  </li>
      <li>As far as conditioning power I would call this run-of-the-mill.</li>
      <li>It does not, however, leave my hair soft, and I&#x27;m not overly fond of the fragrance.</li>
      <li>If you are a person that is natural like me, than this product is for you.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>As far as the product conditioning properties, it has not provided any of the softness that I saw others post about.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best product! My hair is soft, shiny, healthier and even thicker! The smell is great too. Found this at Target a year ago and they stopped carrying it so thank God I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s great! I do color my hair and am not sure if it really \\&quot;protects\\&quot; the color, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling great (it has a mild coconut-fruity scent). I also like the thickness of this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have enviable hair, long, wavy, thick, lots of it.  It&#x27;s just on the dry side from living in the desert.  This conditioner hits just the right balance of moisture without heaviness or oiliness.  My hair is SO soft and the curls stay apart with minimal frizz without the need for any additional products.  Just a touch of product now for the frizz, even with air drying.  Love the scent...  coconut and something else.  Love the absence of many common chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and would not use anything else. Protects color, conditions hair without leaving it limp, rinses easily, and is environmentally friendly. PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the ABBA Color Protect Shampoo.  I selected this brand to try because I get highlights and didn&#x27;t want to worry about my color fading.  It does seem to be effective &amp; gentle enough that it cleans and does not fade color but my hair does not feel very hydrated/conditioned after using the shampoo/conditioner set - I think this is alright and I will use the rest of the bottle but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.  One thing this conditioner does suggest is to leave on hair for 10-15 minutes under a hair dryer for \\&quot;extreme conditioning\\&quot; - maybe this would help my problem with my hair not feeling conditioned enough but that&#x27;s just not realistic when you&#x27;re washing your hair at home, I&#x27;m not going to condition my hair, get out of the shower, blow dry for 10 min and get BACK in the shower... probably a more realistic tip for salon usage.  I&#x27;d recommend Brocato Vibracolor or Redken over this brand.  Although, if you&#x27;re looking for something that is specifically 100% Vegan, Synthetic Dye free and Sulfate free this is probably a good product for you.... it works well, just not my favorite.  Packaging:  -Pretty plain, white &amp; red bottle, the 33.8oz is pretty large and kind of awkward to hold and pour in your hand, especially when it&#x27;s full of product &amp; wet; I would recommend a pump  -Cap is a push-snap top up and down  Price:  -A liter retails around $30, I was able however to get this on a great sale at Ulta for $14.99 (which is about the same price as the 8oz version of this product!)  Scent:  -Interesting scent for this line, I&#x27;d describe it as cherry-almond  -Typically I would prefer that my hair products smelled fresh &amp; clean instead of like some kind of food, but this still smells good and the scent doesn&#x27;t really linger after washing hair</li>
    <li> My go to for non-fuzzy hair.</li>
    <li> I color my hair and have had to use some sort of antifrizz serum for years......but once I switched to this shampoo and conditioner I no longer need any other product! I have hair with a little wave in it....and can even go a day or two between washings.  I am very impressed. Ofcourse not as much suds as the sulfate shampoos (that is fine by me) and the smell is light ...kind of like coconut....but I can deal with that........at 38 I finally like my hair :)</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I love Abba products.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I bought my first bottle at the hair salon and found this to be a great savings.  Especially buying the larger bottle.  I am also going to try the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because it had great reviews but I was very disappointed with it. It causes my hair to break and is much frizzier than before I used the product. It may just be my hair type because I saw this product got great reviews from others, but it hasn&#x27;t worked for me unfortunately.</li>
    <li> My hair has been damaged from dyeing and just from having a thin hair follicle, so this is great stuff for it!  After I used it, I did not have to even add a leave-in conditioner to help my my breakage or fly-aways.  Great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  It also smells very good!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> I used ABBA years ago and it was a wonderful product! Silky hair and shine, nice light fragrance. I have been using Biolage, Humectress/Nexxus and Paul Mitchell-&amp;#34;The Conditioner&amp;#34; which was a great combo but having run out, I was shopping for a sale and spotting ABBA at a good price I purchased the shampoo/conditioner. I didn&#x27;t use the color protector formula before so I can&#x27;t say how it is supposed to work-but these are my results. My very curly/Caucasian hair curled even more and more defined as well, which for me I liked. And it created &#x27;huge&#x27; hair volume-being a Leo-that was good too! :-) On the other hand, the scent that comes after the initial scent(coconut-which I don&#x27;t prefer but can put up with e.g.Nexxus) is distinctly like sweaty wet dog. Seriously, it has that coppery metallic funk that hits you in the back of your nose and throat-really weird! When you rinse it and your hair is still wet, it lingers but I have always used a drop or two of essential oil to dry in the hair, so that &#x27;covers&#x27; it, but I don&#x27;t use essential oil to &#x27;cover&#x27; smelly hair. Also, when dry, I run my fingers thru and the very ends of the curls snag and knot more easily. So, A for volume and definition, C for shine, B for deep cleansing and removing dullness and FFF for WTF is that &#x27;wet dog&#x27; smell! Will I use it? I&#x27;m not in a position to waste. Do I enjoy it? No. Buy again? No Way! Hope this helps. :-)</li>
    <li> This product is great and is a wonderful price.  It shipped quickly and makes your hair super soft.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and I have no complaints.  Needed something without sulfate and this did the trick without paying salon prices.  Big savings buying from Amazon compared to the salon.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product!  Really softens the hair without weighing it down.  Keeps color alive - no fading!</li>
    <li> I color my hair and wash and blowdry everyday. This stuff dies not way my hair down bug conditions my hair well. This bottle good price on amazon last a long time. The smell is clean and not overpowering</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a sulphate free &#x27;color protect&#x27; conditioner that works and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky... this is it!  I have very thick, naturally curly hair and this conditioner leaves it soft, but not sticky, without destoying my curls.  I tried the 6.76 Ounce size out and loved it so much that I bought the big 33.8 Ouncer!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair conditioner.  Makes my hair feel soft and manageable and smell good and fresh.  Good price.  My order came quickly and was packaged well.  Would buy from this seller again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year now and it is the BEST! I have thick, very long hair that I style frequently with heat and I have no split ends at all. The price through this seller is very competitive-you won&#x27;t find a better conditioner at this price point.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend Abba Hair products, it&#x27;s not harsh on your hair and it leaves it feeling so soft and very manageable. If you are a person that is natural like me, than this product is for you. So glad I purchased the big bottle. The price was great too!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife based on the positive reviews, but she hates it.  She says it does nothing for her hair and doesn&#x27;t make it any easier for her to comb after a bath.  She left it in for five minutes before rinsing and it didn&#x27;t make a difference.  It was pretty much a waste since she won&#x27;t use it.  The only other explanation I can think of is if the product I got was counterfeit, but I have no way of knowing since it&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve ever bought it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Unfortunately, since I&#x27;m a self professed product junkie....I have a lot of products to rotate through....when I use it I like it though....It really does make my highlights pop!</li>
    <li> I love that this is a vegan conditioner.  It does not, however, leave my hair soft, and I&#x27;m not overly fond of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> smells great and it is so conditioning.  I scuba dive quite often, and my hair will be knotted strawcicles.  i put this in and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is priced well and had decent reviews. I was a little worried about the comments about the smell of the product which maybe made me ultra sensitive, but IMO it does have an odd after-smell in the shower. However, after your hair dries the odd smell is gone and there is a slight fragrance left in the hair, but as soon as I use mousse or hairspray, you can&#x27;t smell the conditioner anymore. As far as conditioning power I would call this run-of-the-mill. I have long fine hair that tangles easy so I need a good conditioner. This product is good enough that I will use it up, but I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t make your hair as soft as I like, but I got some Abba leave-in conditioner, and use a little after hair is dry. all in all, Abba makes good products!</li>
    <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, though I rarely have colored my hair over the years. It smells great, and really softens hair. I highly recommend this product, which is always consistently high quality. What a great deal on Amazon, too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner after doing some searching for good products for color treated hair. This product with the shampoo had some of the best reviews, and responses. I did not go out and smell this somewhere else, so I went based strictly off the reviews. I will say that I love the way the shampoo smells. It has an almond scent combined with something else I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. It isn&#x27;t overly powerful, just something light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The conditioner has a completely different scent. When I first applied it I really thought of flea and tick shampoo. I am not sure that it has that scent, but it definitely makes me think of times when I have bathed my dog. I have seen other promising reviews, so maybe my chemistry does not mix with it. I have tried mixing up the conditioner, and I&#x27;ve used it a couple times hoping that it was just a fluke, sadly that hasn&#x27;t been the case. When I use this product I am left smelling like a wet poodle. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As far as the product conditioning properties, it has not provided any of the softness that I saw others post about. My hair is thick, and I do need conditioner as part of my regime. The only thing that I can think of with this particular product that was promising for me was that it is sulfate and dea free. While those are important factors for me, it is not enough for me to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great.  I love the smell and it really protects the vitality of my color.  Makes my hair so soft and shiny.  I will definitely continue using this line.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for my thick hair it leaves it soft and tangle free, no retail product is even up to the task</li>
