      <li>There may be \\&quot;better\\&quot; creams, but I haven&#x27;t tried them -- mostly because I don&#x27;t feel the need to experiment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Been using this cream for a couple of months now and I&#x60;ve never used anything better.</li>

      <li>Wish it was available in stores in the U.S.</li>
      <li>I really like my luxury shaving creams and soaps, but Palmolive shaving cream is every bit as good as most of my High End creams.</li>
      <li>For those of us who wet shave this cream is really great.  </li>
      <li>I love Palmolive Classic shave cream.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite.</li>
      <li>Palmolive cream produces lather more abundantly than other, more expensive creams and has a distinctive aroma with an ideal presence--not too powerful, not wimpy either.</li>
      <li>Amazing lather, simple, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>The customer service from DirectKart was so nice, helpful, &amp; generous, that I simply could not recommend them more!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Love the old fashioned scent and price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>for the soap review: In my own personal opinion, I found the soap to work just as it should!</li>
      <li>It is very slick, provides a lot of cushion, and lathers incredibly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced this in the past from another vendor of Palmolive cream shipping from England.  </li>
      <li>Good shave soap but not the same as the old US made stuff.  </li>
      <li>The only drawback is that you can&#x27;t seem to get it in the U.S. and it costs more to ship than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Even with the outrageously high shipping rates here it is still a better bargain than most other creams.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product in Germany on a rhine river</li>
      <li>It has potential, but there&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
      <li>I only need the smallest dab I can squeeze out, rubbed carefully over my face (preferably with a dampened shaving brush, but not necessarily), for a great smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Available there in most supermarkets and small convenience shops as well.</li>
      <li>I really recommend both this soap and DirectKart the seller.</li>
      <li>Why isn&#x27;t this available in North American stores?  </li>
      <li>Very creamy and lathers well.</li>
      <li>Really softens whiskers.</li>
      <li>This works really well.</li>
      <li>It provides both the cushion and slickness necessary for a good wet shave.  </li>
      <li>When it comes to many things in life, the old addage is true, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  When it comes to Palmolive shaving cream this is not true...</li>
      <li>one can get a decent lather shave cream</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many many of the expensive boutique brands.</li>
      <li>your store offers Proraso for a reasonable price, by all means buy it.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and how long one tube will last.</li>
      <li>I believe their home office is in New York.</li>
      <li>I also found warming the tube in hot water prior to application increases the lather.</li>
      <li>First tried it last year in Europe.</li>
      <li>But the Amazon standard for packaging quality is higher than Direct Kart attains.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, it&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
      <li>If you buy the original italian palmolive,it is softer then here in usa which is too dry.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised that the product has moved to Europe and changed its name.</li>
      <li>The seller from whom I purchased, Direct Kart, needs work on their packaging.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had three shaves with this so far.  </li>
      <li>First of all, coming from an overseas seller I expected it to take forever to receive it, and I was prepared for that.  </li>
      <li>Will really load up when I go back next month.</li>
      <li>..outstanding and well worth a little wait.</li>
      <li>My husband was so hoping this would be the same as the old Palmolive he had used for years.  </li>
      <li>use it by taking a pinky nail size dollop and placing it in the middle of my moist brush and complete a face-lather.</li>
      <li>The cream itself is a light green color, but lathers up to a nice white and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry, itchy, or uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>Has a very slick feel on my face and a little bit lathers nicely.</li>
      <li>Two were very mediocre, one was good.  </li>
      <li>The tube is pretty stiff</li>

    <li> This is one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried; it smells good, provides excellent protection, plenty of slickness, and lathers up super easy. For the quality and the price this is 5 stars all day, everyday.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how long one tube will last.</li>
    <li> The customer service from DirectKart was so nice, helpful, &amp; generous, that I simply could not recommend them more!&lt;br /&gt;Now for the soap review: In my own personal opinion, I found the soap to work just as it should! I love the scent, it&#x27;s hard to explain. The cream itself is a light green color, but lathers up to a nice white and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry, itchy, or uncomfortable. I really recommend both this soap and DirectKart the seller. Great price, great soap, great costumer service! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from them in the future!</li>
    <li> nice lather...great scent...</li>
    <li> works great smells great...its got a great lather...it lasts forever &#x27;&#x27;figuratively&#x27;&#x27;...will buy again</li>
    <li> Did not see any thing that would make me buy more.  Standard off the shelf works as well if not better and less messy.</li>
    <li> Good shave soap but not the same as the old US made stuff.  I like it but still prefer Arko.  Good travel companion.</li>
    <li> This product is an oldy, but a goody. My dad used it; I would watch him shave when I was a child. Now my sons use it. The only drawback is that you can&#x27;t seem to get it in the U.S. and it costs more to ship than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> great price, quality product, free delivery, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I remember buying Palmolive shave cream in a larger tube and with the same scent as Proraso.  This new Palmolive shave cream remains excellent and provides a comfortable, close shave.  The reasons for 4 stars (rather than 5) are (a) the scent is not as alluring as it used to be, and (b) the size of the tube has decreased, so you receive less product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;If your store offers Proraso for a reasonable price, by all means buy it.  If not, you will be happy with the Palmolive.</li>
    <li> This works really well. Nothing fancy. Great lather, cushion and slickness. The smell is pleasant. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> A cream my grandpa would use. Great old school scent. Performs wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years . It suits me , that is why I keep buying it.</li>
    <li> When it comes to many things in life, the old addage is true, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  When it comes to Palmolive shaving cream this is not true...you get so much more than what you pay for it.  First of all, coming from an overseas seller I expected it to take forever to receive it, and I was prepared for that.  I believe it came in like three days.  For those of us who wet shave this cream is really great.  It is very slick, provides a lot of cushion, and lathers incredibly.  I really like my luxury shaving creams and soaps, but Palmolive shaving cream is every bit as good as most of my High End creams.</li>
    <li> I like this shave creams, it lathers well and provides a smoorh shave with a DE razor. I use it with a badger brush. Has a slight woodys scent. As noted by one other reviewer, this is sold in England for about $2. Wish it was available in stores in the U.S. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for a couple of months now and I&#x60;ve never used anything better. What kills me is you can&#x60;t find it anywhere in the u.s. and if I&#x60;m not mistaken Colgate Palmolive is a u.s.company and hasn&#x60;t moved over seas.  I believe their home office is in New York. Whats wrong with this picture?  Anyway I&#x60;ll keep on ordering it over the net if thats what it takes.  Try it and you won&#x60;t regret it.</li>
    <li> ..outstanding and well worth a little wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three shaves with this so far.  Two were very mediocre, one was good.  It has potential, but there&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product in Germany on a rhine river cruise.seems americans are to lazy to use a brush,and would rather use a can.its to bad that here in the US you can&#x27;t find  product like this in a CVS OR WALGREENS.the only place one can get a decent lather shave cream is in an expensive&amp;#34;Pand G&amp;#34;shave shop.thanks for making it so easy for me.Do you sell shaving brushes also?&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;ralph gelper</li>
    <li> Amazing lather, simple, fresh scent. Would be a 5-star if the scent was stronger/last longer but that&#x27;s personal preference. The tube is pretty stiff so it tends to force out some cream as soon as you open the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it by taking a pinky nail size dollop and placing it in the middle of my moist brush and complete a face-lather. You could use a cup if you like. I also found warming the tube in hot water prior to application increases the lather.</li>
    <li> My husband was so hoping this would be the same as the old Palmolive he had used for years.  His chief complaint is that the lather is too dry and does not soften his beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived promptly, so no complaints there, but the product is just not what he&#x27;s been looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the old fashioned scent and price can&#x27;t be beat. Has a very slick feel on my face and a little bit lathers nicely. My new favorite.</li>
    <li> Processed on time and meets the need. I was surprised that the product has moved to Europe and changed its name. Still, the quality is maintained.</li>
    <li> I use this with a brush and it lathers up great use just a small bit and it works great.............</li>
    <li> I love Palmolive Classic shave cream.  It makes great lather.  It provides both the cushion and slickness necessary for a good wet shave.  The scent is wonderful.  No, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, but I don&#x27;t want that in a shave cream.  It moisturizes.  If I follow with an aftershave splash or balm, it&#x27;s because I want to, not need to.  It is my go-to cream, I like it better than Proraso.  There may be \\&quot;better\\&quot; creams, but I haven&#x27;t tried them -- mostly because I don&#x27;t feel the need to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only four stars?  The seller from whom I purchased, Direct Kart, needs work on their packaging.  The shipping was prompt and cost-effective, but there was no packing material to cushion the product.  I ordered two tubes plus one shave soap stick.  One of the boxes of the cream was damaged, as was the outer box of the soap stick.  The shipping carton seemed to be a box found somewhere within the shipping area that was JUST big enough contain the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced this in the past from another vendor of Palmolive cream shipping from England.  I don&#x27;t know if this is typical of UK vendor (I would hope not) and no, having pristine boxes doesn&#x27;t affect product performance.  But the Amazon standard for packaging quality is higher than Direct Kart attains.</li>
    <li> Why isn&#x27;t this available in North American stores?  It is the best product of its type by far.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and lathers well. One of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> If you buy the original italian palmolive,it is softer then here in usa which is too dry.  Edoardo</li>
    <li> works.  Not my flavor though.</li>
    <li> I only need the smallest dab I can squeeze out, rubbed carefully over my face (preferably with a dampened shaving brush, but not necessarily), for a great smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read what other men have written about Palmolive shave cream, but I only tried it recently. Palmolive cream produces lather more abundantly than other, more expensive creams and has a distinctive aroma with an ideal presence--not too powerful, not wimpy either. Lather texture is creamy and silky. No shaving connoisseur should neglect to try this humble brand. You&#x27;ll be delighted!</li>
    <li> This is unquestionably the best of the inexpensive creams. In fact, it beats practically ALL shaving creams and I&#x27;ve tried many many of the expensive boutique brands. Pleasant, barber shop type smell. Really softens whiskers. Provides a great moisturizing and lubricating lather. First tried it last year in Europe. Ended up buying a few at around US$1.60@ or so to bring home. Will really load up when I go back next month. Available there in most supermarkets and small convenience shops as well. My days of spending any more than this on shaving cream are over. Even with the outrageously high shipping rates here it is still a better bargain than most other creams. A little bit goes a long way. Makes a great lather in a scuttle or on your face or in your hand. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
