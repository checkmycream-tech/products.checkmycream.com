### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The price is steep but for some of us the end results justifies the means and indeed, the results are very impressive.</li>
      <li>I received this Zeno mini, and was immediately impressed by</li>
      <li>I wound up not taking it, and hoping for the best.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear especially good at treating blemishes, I can say</li>
      <li>think this product would be best for people who get one or two zits at a time.</li>
      <li>I used it on 4 pimples, and it was very successful.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so the mark was visible for a couple of hours before it faded.</li>
      <li>It has a great feel to it that inspires confidence in that it will do the job at hand rather than being a toy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Upon unboxing, the device was very nicely packaged, with quality construction of the unit itself.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a perfectly good strategy.</li>
      <li>manual also states that the Zeno Mini \\&quot;does not replace good hygiene\\&quot;, and to continue with your existing skin-care treatment.</li>
      <li>Also, be fair</li>
      <li>The Zeno Mini is in fact, best used \\&quot;at the first sign of a pimple\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I kind of \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; the sequence of steps.  </li>
      <li>Zeno Mini is nicely constructed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m not the most zitty of guys around, but I still get my fair share</li>
      <li>For those, it proved to be rather effective, for the others, chemical treatments are preferred.    </li>
      <li>He also thought the device was warm, but tolerable.  </li>
      <li>It needs to warm up for about a minute.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, nothing truly worked.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from acne and knew I had to own this.</li>
      <li>This thing is kind of a pain to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>handy one day.dy</li>
      <li>It does do a good job of clearing up the skin faster, and that is something that many people want regardless of anything else.</li>
      <li>(The tip of the Zeno becomes very warm but the sensation, for me, was not unpleasant).</li>
      <li>Well, if you think the pros and the cons all sound good then it can not hurt.</li>
      <li>For best results you need to start early when you can basically feel the pimple</li>
      <li>Just when I&#x27;d think the device didn&#x27;t do much, it worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had to treat any acne more than that,</li>
      <li>A heating pad would be better.</li>
      <li>I was able to treat that acne with proactive.  </li>
      <li>However, my skin continued to break out more and more after time.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why; the tip didn&#x27;t seem especially hot.     </li>
      <li>These were more \\&quot;developed\\&quot; than my sons, beginning to come to a head and about 4-5 mm in size.  </li>
      <li>the kind that is raised and filled with goo (whatever you call what&#x27;s inside of a pimple).  </li>
      <li>And, it seemed to work better for me than it did her.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, over-the-counter treatments can treat more than</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m going to try rechargeable batteries to see if that&#x27;s any better.</li>
      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that if you have more than a handful of pimples to treat this device will not be the one to use.  </li>
      <li>At this time, I doubt that I&#x27;ll buy the replacement top for another 45 uses.     </li>
      <li>At that point, you have to wait 2 minutes to do more treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found that when I used it on pimples that were just starting it worked best and prevented the pimple from developing (it mentions this in the owner&#x27;s manual).</li>
      <li>My friends and family can see the results and I LOVE not having to wear makeup.  </li>
      <li>I highly reccomend the zeno and am very glad I found it!</li>
      <li>Handy and sometimes useful, but hardly a perfect solution for occasional acne.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use -- basically just clean the tip with alcohol, turn it on, wait for it to hear up (there are beeps that tell you what to do) then hold it against the pimple.</li>
      <li>Zeno Mini is an effective, but fairly pricey way to treat pimples painlessly and with no mess.  </li>
      <li>warned that this thingy isn&#x27;t the most comfortable experiance.  </li>
      <li>editing this review to add: I have now used the Zeno several times, and it works brilliantly.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a good product!</li>
      <li>, the product is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Clogged pores, whiteheads, blackheads - doesn&#x27;t do anything for them - better to exfoliate and use a salicylic/glycolic acid combo to keep those clean.    </li>
      <li>It fits easily in even the smallest hand bag or make-up kit.</li>
      <li>I really wish Zeno would offer an a/c adapter to help make the unit more cost effective.</li>
      <li>It feels nice in your hand, and is pretty easy to use.    </li>
      <li>This is great if you get a couple pimples a day or 2 before a special occasion and want a clear face.</li>
      <li>Would fit easily into luggage for travel.  </li>
      <li>Not a big deal, but something to keep aware of when determining when to use the Zeno (i.e., it&#x27;s best in the evening before bed</li>
      <li>Just putting this out there in case you missed the fine print.</li>
      <li>If you have one spot, every once in a while, then it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, it goes through batteries fairly quickly, so make sure you&#x27;ve got plenty of AAA batteries</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly convenient in size, and the battery power makes it nice for travel.</li>
      <li>This was a great purchase for my husband (he actually wanted one)</li>
      <li>and if you have an adverse reaction, feel free to comment on this post so others can read it).     </li>
      <li>I listed the cons/drawbacks and withheld one star because the advertisements don&#x27;t really tell you in advance what kind of blemishes it does not treat, so</li>
      <li>You can decide if you fit into the \\&quot;obsessed\\&quot; category.      </li>
      <li>Press the button again, and a 5-tone sound indicates that a treatment cycle has started.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>I have the original zeno and this one.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the original Zeno from Walgreens twice and both would not charge.  </li>
      <li>the Zeno is entirely worth the investment!</li>
      <li>read the instructions twice, and used it successfully, but on subsequent attempts</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most people (including my husband) don&#x27;t like to take the time to read the directions, but you really need to with this one as you are supposed to take the batteries out when not in use for optimal battery performance.</li>
      <li>Therefore, it starts out cool and at the end will feel lukewarm on your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very simple, and it felt good on an irritated pimple.</li>
      <li>Very simple, and it felt good on an irritated pimple.</li>
      <li>When you spend $89 on this product you&#x27;re getting a cell-phone sized device thats good for 45 individual uses.  </li>
      <li>works on mild or full pimples</li>
      <li>This unit should be used for mild acne and not for cases of severe whiteheads.</li>
      <li>An affective way to treat mild and medium pimples.  </li>
      <li>I wish I there was a tip for it that you could use more than 45 times, but I&#x27;m sure there will be in the future.</li>
      <li>I have used many other devices and have yet to find anything as effective.  </li>
      <li>: the Zeno is quick (two and half minutes per treatment), painless (for me), concentrated (it addresses just the area that requires healing), and really cute!!</li>
      <li>It might seem a bit pricy at first, but to know what you are buying will work makes it well worth the cost!</li>
      <li>It is a significant amount of heat, but not \\&quot;burning\\&quot; hot.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sound like much time, but while you are doing it it can seem like an eternity.</li>
      <li>I say appropriate because, as the instructions clearly state, it does nothing for blackheads or cystic acne.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the money and did nothing for my acne.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a bit of time holding the Zeno to your face/body, but worth it to get rid of the blemish in a non-pinching way.</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t fun.  </li>
      <li>I own the regular Zeno, but bought the Zeno Mini for my husban.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that each zit will require from 1-3 treatments (in my experiments I required 3 treatments per zit over the course of 24 hours to achieve desired results) so effectively for your initial $89 purchase</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had success with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin looks healthy clear and youthful.  </li>
      <li>The harder you press, the most significant the mark, so use a light touch.</li>
      <li>While nothing truly does that with perfection, this does it with more finality than most other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have many blemishes, the treatments of 2.5 minutes per blemish could take a significant amount of time, daily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While the mini seems to help speed up the healing of spots, the battery life is awful! Usually I&#x27;m only able to use it 2 or 3 times before it starts giving me the signal of low battery life.</li>
    <li> We tried different brands in the drugstores with no real results.  A friend told us about this device and let us try hers.  Within a couple of days, skin had cleared up.  It might seem a bit pricy at first, but to know what you are buying will work makes it well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the Zeno. I had seen it in stores but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay what it costs without knowing if it worked. When my Zeno Mini arrived, I had no noticeable zits on my face (about which I&#x27;m not complaining, though it did make it difficult to try the device out!). Finally, a small one surfaced. I tried the Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works by heating up a small, round metallic tip, which you hold against your zit for 2.5 minutes (the Zeno keeps track of the time for you, and helpfully beeps every 30 seconds so you know it&#x27;s still going). The temperature was just short of uncomfortable; I think it might even be soothing on one of the big, painful zits that I occasionally get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pimple I tried it on never got any bigger, and seemed to go away pretty fast. I can&#x27;t be absolutely positive that the Zeno sped up its departure, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides, other than the cost, are the fact that the Zeno tip is only good for 45 uses, and then you have to replace it (replacement tips are available at Walgreen&#x27;s and probably other local stores). The replacement costs just under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other drawback is that the Zeno leaves a noticeable circular mark on the treated zit. If you use it at bedtime, that shouldn&#x27;t be much of a problem; the mark definitely disappeared overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product would be best for people who get one or two zits at a time. If you had a lot of acne, it would be a real hassle to treat each zit individually with the Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m editing this review to add: I have now used the Zeno several times, and it works brilliantly. The kind of zits that used to last for several days now go away within a day or two when I use the Zeno on them. If Amazon would let me, I would up my review to five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback I&#x27;ve discovered is that the Zeno really goes through batteries (but it uses triple As, so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re particularly expensive batteries). Still, I highly recommend Zeno.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I used it three times or so and each time it made the pimple worse, even if I used it at a very early stage. Most of my pimples are occasional and due to clogged pores, so maybe it&#x27;s just the wrong sort of acne. In any case, this product was no good for me.</li>
    <li> The on/off button (which must be depressed for several seconds at certain points during the use of the product) occasionally &#x27;folds&#x27; to one side, rendering this product virtually unusable. Be careful with how you depress the button.    Other than that, the product is easy to use. As per the instructions, using this product at the first sign of an outbreak helps. Otherwise, it is of little use. The timeframe of use for each application (150 seconds) would be quickly add up if if were used numerous times in one day.    I didn&#x27;t see enough effectiveness from this product to warrant a recommendation to purchase it at its selling price.</li>
    <li> I received this Zeno mini, and was immediately impressed by it&#x27;s small size and sleek design. It fits easily in even the smallest hand bag or make-up kit. The instructions were clear and detailed. So far, so good. Having two teen sons and the occasional break-out myself, I had plenty of opportunities to test the device on pimples of varying size and severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found: it seems to work best on pimples that are at the red and slightly raised stage. None of us found the tip painfully hot. It&#x27;s definitely hot, but it actually felt soothing on more inflamed pimples. And it does seem to clear pimples that are treated as directed. It&#x27;s not instant, but all appropriate pimples seemed to clear by 3 treatments. I say appropriate because, as the instructions clearly state, it does nothing for blackheads or cystic acne. Seriously. Don&#x27;t waste \\&quot;zaps\\&quot; on blackheads or deep, cystic pimples because it&#x27;s a wasted use of the expensive tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side for me is the cost of use. As everyone has mentioned, this thing sucks up batteries. For a teen, or someone with a lot of pimples, you&#x27;ll need to buy batteries in bulk. But at least you can find bulk batteries cheaply. The replacement tips, on the other hand, are expensive and proprietary. The cheapest I have found a 45-use tip is $16. They generally run about $20. When you consider 2-3 treatments each for most pimples, this gets expensive fast. I really wish Zeno would offer an a/c adapter to help make the unit more cost effective. Especially since the device does work and would make life as a teenager much easier for a lot of kids.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Zeno Mini (pink) and was excited to use it.  On my second use, the tip was so hot the plastic tip broke into two pieces.  I plan to return it ASAP.  How disappointing and inconvenient!  I had high hopes for this product after reading positive reviews.  :(</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that if you have more than a handful of pimples to treat this device will not be the one to use.  It takes 2 1/2 minutes to treat each pimple, and each one will need to be treated at least twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zeno Mini is nicely constructed.  It&#x27;s about the size of a candybar cellphone, and has only one button.  It is quite portable, and travels well.  Zeno is very simple to use: turn it on, wait about a minute for the ready signal, push the button again, and then hold it on the pimple for a full 2 1/2 minutes.  (Still, instructions printed on the device would have been nice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m well into my 20&#x27;s, so I don&#x27;t have full-blown acne anymore.  I used it for the occasional pimple on my back or face.  When you first place the Zeno on your pimple, watch out, because it is HOT!  After the initial shock, however, it&#x27;s not painful.  After about an hour I noticed that my pimples were smaller and less red. None of them completely disappeared, however, even after multiple treatments.  I found that when I used it on pimples that were just starting it worked best and prevented the pimple from developing (it mentions this in the owner&#x27;s manual). Its biggest benefit is that it does not dry out your skin like acne creams tend to do.  Be aware that it does not work on pimples caused by an ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment tip needs to be cleaned before each use, and replaced periodically.  The Zeno will let you know when it needs replacement.  Additionally, it goes through batteries fairly quickly, so make sure you&#x27;ve got plenty of AAA batteries available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... it&#x27;s a great device for the occasional pimple, especially if your getting ready for an upcoming event, but it&#x27;s a bit expensive for what you get. Keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you may get different results.</li>
    <li> I own the regular Zeno, but bought the Zeno Mini for my husban. It works just as well as the regular model with full pimple resolution within about 12-24 hours. Unfortunately, most people (including my husband) don&#x27;t like to take the time to read the directions, but you really need to with this one as you are supposed to take the batteries out when not in use for optimal battery performance. This was a great purchase for my husband (he actually wanted one) as I no longer have to share mine, plus he is the type that needs regular batteries anyways (he is very forgetful when it coms to charging.</li>
    <li> This unit should be used for mild acne and not for cases of severe whiteheads. The treatment regiment is basically a heated tip, and those tips are to be replaced (more on that later).  Upon unboxing, the device was very nicely packaged, with quality construction of the unit itself.  It has a great feel to it that inspires confidence in that it will do the job at hand rather than being a toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being charged, the unit is easy to use and is not possible to mess up on.  You simply apply it to your face over the acne spot and the device times everything with confirmation beeps and shuts off the heat automatically.  It&#x27;s hard to say how effective this unit is without a scientific study, but in my limited use I couldn&#x27;t conclusively determine how well this unit actually does against other acne regiments.  The good old reliable regiments of benzoyl peroxide, and just plain face washing are things people should be doing if they do have acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the tips, the manufacturer has set up the device so that they can rack up recurring charges.  Similar to ink jet cartridges, you need to purchase the tips because they will no longer function after so many times.  The manufacturer claims this is so hygiene purposes.  These tips result in recurring costs, so don&#x27;t expect to just pay the cost of the machine.</li>
    <li> I noticed absolutely no difference in the size of those random pimples that pop up every once in awhile...maybe effective on bad acne, but for someone with normal skin, didn&#x27;t help any.</li>
    <li> I never had acne until my junior year of high school due to stress and not eating properly.  I was able to treat that acne with proactive.  This worked until my 2nd year in college.  My skin seemed to have gotten use to the product.  I was prescribed Differin 0.1 gel.  It made my acne horrible for a short period but then cleared up most of it.  However, my skin continued to break out more and more after time.  In an attempt to clear my skin I tried everything and the result was dry/red skin all the time.  I purchased the 39.99 zeno online that contained about 80 treatments and was amazed!  It killed the acne and I barely have to wash my face now.  My skin looks healthy clear and youthful.  It is worth every penny!! My friends and family can see the results and I LOVE not having to wear makeup.  It is so freeing!     F.Y.I. I purchased the original Zeno from Walgreens twice and both would not charge.  Apparently, the internal battery can go bad after it has been sitting on the shelf for some time.  So I purchased the Zeno Mini.  It takes two triple A batteries and is very compact.</li>
    <li> I believe/ hope I got a defective unit.  The batteries die after about 10 zaps, no good!  Also, Amazon refused to return product.  Luckily, the Zeno corporation was very peasant to work with exchanging this product.</li>
    <li> I am a life-long acne sufferer, and I&#x27;m a 41 year old woman.  I have tried everything any dermatologist has ever thought was going to solve my dilemma.  Honestly, nothing truly worked.  I did two rounds of Accutane many years ago, and the acne came back within a year, just as bad as it was before.  After having two babies, my skin did all of a sudden get clear, but lately, is breaking out again. Hormones are probably to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the pink Zeno 4 months ago, and it really does work. This smaller, less expensive unit that I was able to test, works pretty much the same way.  Cost per treatment w/ this Zeno mini is $1.98, based on the $89 price, as there are 45 treatments in the removable &amp; replaceable treatment tip. The typical price for the pink or teal unit is $159, so each treatment w/ that is $1.77.  As mentioned in the product description, neither Zeno works on cystic acne or whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I feel a zit coming on, it&#x27;s time to fire up the Zeno.  It does take what seems to be a long time for a treatment, but I do feel that it is effective.  I just sit at my bathroom counter, resting my elbow there so I don&#x27;t slip the round Zeno tip from it&#x27;s target. Some acne is more stubborn than others, so I treat it two times, at opposite ends of the day.  I haven&#x27;t had to treat any acne more than that, but of course, we are all different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on a longer trip recently, and while I wanted to take my pink Zeno with me, I was afraid that I would either lose it, or somebody would steal it from my luggage.  The pink Zeno is a bit heftier than the mini Zeno. I wound up not taking it, and hoping for the best.  So if you are like me, maybe you would like to buy the Zeno mini instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other difference between the pink Zeno and the mini is that the mini runs on 2 AAA batteries.  The pink comes w/ a charger, which you won&#x27;t need very often.  Oh and also the pink comes w/ a black leather protective case, which is a little unnecessary, but might come in handy one day.dy one day.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is a strange little device.  It is very aesthetically pleasing.  It makes nice mannered little beeps when it is used, and appears very professional.  It feels nice in your hand, and is pretty easy to use.    Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure what it would be useful for.  It doesn&#x27;t appear especially good at treating blemishes, I can say that after several tries.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt, so I don&#x27;t think it is going to worsen your acne...but I&#x27;m don&#x27;t think that it is going to replace your regular skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> So, what is considered severe acne you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quote from the ZENO mini product manual:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Inflamed (red) pimples and pustules (visible accumulation of pus in skin) with severe deep nodular lesions (solid mass of skin like a knot, can be raised or felt under the skin).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on to state:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Zeno Mini will not work when used on blemishes such as blackheads or white heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Zeno Mini should not be used by persons with severe nodular or cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if that doesn&#x27;t paint a pretty picture eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, what the manual does state is that it is \\&quot;a medical heat-dose treatment device for the treatment of individual acne pimples in people with mild to moderate inflammatory acne\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what is mild to moderate? Or a better question would be: What is the Zeno Mini expected to treat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, quoting the manual:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild: Several inflamed red pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moderate: Many inflamed red pimples and pustules (visible accumulation of pus in sku).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confused yet? Ya, me too. Didn&#x27;t the manual just state that it was not for use with red pimples and pustules? Anyways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the section: Treatment Recommendations and What to Expect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Use Zeno Mini at the first sign of a pimple...If necessary, treat the same pimple again after 4 to 12 hours. You may need to treat the pimple a third time 4 to 12 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After treatment, you may see redness where the treatment tip touched your skin. This is normal and should fade in a few hours. Within 4 to 24 hours of the first treatment of a pimple, you should notice that the pimple gets smaller, less red and/or less tender\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual also states that the Zeno Mini \\&quot;does not replace good hygiene\\&quot;, and to continue with your existing skin-care treatment. The Zeno Mini is in fact, best used \\&quot;at the first sign of a pimple\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as administering the treatment goes, it is very simple. You turn on the device, and apply the metal tip to the affected area. This is a mild warming sensation as it works, and it turns itself off when the treatment is complete. Very simple, and it felt good on an irritated pimple. You may notice some clearing after the first treatment, according to the manual, however I had to do all three for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you have severe acne [...], then the Zeno Mini is not for you. However, if you are looking to stop a pimple BEFORE it becomes red and inflamed, then I can personally attest that the Zeno Mini works well at prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: This was a really hard one for me to rate, so I chose the middle of the road. I mean, what is the lifespan of a zit anyways? Three days? Coincidence here with the treatment? You decide. Each persons skin is different, and will react differently to the treatments. For instance, my skin never became red after a treatment, however my wife&#x27;s did. And, it seemed to work better for me than it did her.ery simple.

    <li> The Zeno Mini is a portable version of the Zeno Pro, which claims to improve or eliminate new pimples in 24-48 hours with low-level heat. The device has a metal tip that heats to a temperature that feels hot against the skin. The theory is that applying heat to a new, slightly inflamed pimple will kill the Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) that causes acne. I doubt it. That idea doesn&#x27;t hold up to scrutiny. It seems more likely that the heat accelerates the immune response, so the blemish heals faster. That&#x27;s a perfectly good strategy. I&#x27;ve often used a heat compress on particularly stubborn blemishes, just as it would be helpful for any stubborn, relatively mild infection. It works. So I expected the Zeno Mini to be a more convenient and more expensive version of that old remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zeno is intended for mild acne, defined as several inflamed pimples, and moderate acne, defined as many inflamed pimples and pustules. It&#x27;s not for blackheads, which are not acne, or for whiteheads, which are too far advanced. The instructions say that the Zeno should be used on pimples in an early stage, when they first become visible or inflamed. One treatment is 2 ½ minutes long. Each blemish should be treated 1-3 times as needed, 4-12 hours apart. The Zeno takes one minute to heat up, then a 2-tone sound and a green light indicate that it&#x27;s ready to use. Press the button again, and a 5-tone sound indicates that a treatment cycle has started. Press the treatment tip to the pimple. The Zeno beeps every 30 seconds to let you know where you are in the treatment cycle. You can do up to 3 treatments in a row, on different pimples. At that point, you have to wait 2 minutes to do more treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderate acne, which means a lot of small pimples, most of which will never turn into something big and ugly, but too many that will. I located some new pimples that seemed threatening, slightly inflamed, but still very small and tried the Zeno on them. I tried it on 10 pimples. I did 3 treatments on each pimple. It didn&#x27;t do anything. I was a little surprised. I expected to see some improvement, as I would expect from a heat compress. It may be that the heat treatments are not long enough. Normally I would leave heat on a skin infection for at least 10 minutes. Treatments do leave a red mark on my skin for a couple of hours, so don&#x27;t do this right before you go out. Once it caused a very minor burn. I don&#x27;t know why; the tip didn&#x27;t seem especially hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zeno Mini is a well-made, well-designed device. It is powered by 2 AAA batteries (included). It comes with a treatment tip programmed to deliver 45 treatments. At that point, you have to replace the tip for $[...]. This is how the company makes money. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me as well as a cheap heat compress that I can throw in the microwave. To find out if the Zeno will work for you before buying, just put a heat compress on your blemishes for 2 ½ minutes, up to 3 times, and see if it helps. Make sure it isn&#x27;t hot enough to burn your skin. If that works, the Zeno might be a convenient -though more expensive- way of applying heat treatments to mild, occasional acne. But for moderate acne, there are too many pimples for it to be practical anyway. A heating pad would be better.id 3 treatments on each pimple. It didn&#x27;t do anything. I was a little surprised.

    <li> I want to like this little device so much! I&#x27;ve probably not had enough of the precise type of blemish to give it a solid review, but I&#x27;m noticing that instead of them going away after treatment, it seems to cause them to come to a head more quickly. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad, but I&#x27;d certainly rather they just go away! I don&#x27;t find the heat to be too uncomfortable, but it is certainly hot. For the price of the unit and the necessity for and price of replacement heads, I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t bother. a total scam and the replacements never last past 10 treeatments. serious waste of money. I will never buy zeno again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately in our family we have lots of people with acne, and&lt;br /&gt;many different types to try the Zeno Mini on. Although the descriptions below may be a little gross, it may help you to decided if this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we tried it on 3 pimples on my adolescent old son on his back.  These were in the \\&quot;red\\&quot; stage, had not come to a head and were 2-3 mm in size.  One disappeared after 1 treatment,  one faded away significantly and the third developed but not as large as the \\&quot;control\\&quot; pimples on his back that we left untreated.  He complained that the device was a bit warm, but not intolerable.  It did leave red marks on his back, which had faded after 2 hours to be unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we tried it on 3 pimples on my husbands face.  These were more \\&quot;developed\\&quot; than my sons, beginning to come to a head and about 4-5 mm in size.  He also thought the device was warm, but tolerable.  Two noticeably decreased overnight, one seemed not to change much.  Red marks faded in one hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried it on the blemishes I tend to develop once a month.  These were at the stage of just starting, sore but not very distinguishable in color.  I used it on 4 pimples, and it was very successful.  Three went away and never developed.  One needed two treatments but then also faded away.  I found the heat from the device comforting, but it also left  red marks for about an hour.  These were easily concealed with a little foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two and a half minutes feels like a long time when you are sitting there. Do something else like watch TV.  Also the reason the others only had 3 treatments is that after 3 treatments the mini Zeno shuts itself off for 2 minutes for \\&quot;safety delay\\&quot; and my son and husband were not willing to sit still any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a solution if you have many, many pimples as it would be too expensive and too time consuming.  But for certain types of pimples, or the times that you just can NOT have a pimple it is worth trying.</li>
    <li> This thing is kind of a pain to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me silly, but I like my electronics as idiot proof as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions twice, and used it successfully, but on subsequent attempts, I kind of \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; the sequence of steps.  I simply treated it how I would assume a curling iron works.  Plug it in, it heats up, and I put it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the case with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You turn it on.  It needs to warm up for about a minute.  When the power button flashes green again, you need to press the button again.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when doing that, (if you hold the button too long) it turned the unit off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are all these \\&quot;misuses\\&quot; counted against the number of times I can use the particular head.  (the tip has a specific number of uses, that must be replaced after so many uses)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially if I weren&#x27;t to use this every day, I&#x27;d feel like I need to \\&quot;relearn\\&quot; the operating instructions each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on a separate topic, how am I supposed to know it&#x27;s working?&lt;br /&gt;Am I supposed to \\&quot;predict\\&quot; how bad a zit would have been, if I hadn&#x27;t used this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm...that&#x27;s a little tricky.  Many times, my zits don&#x27;t ever reach a \\&quot;white head\\&quot; status.  They simply get red, and then go away.  Making it impossible to objectively tell if this thing is working on not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I noticed no difference in the size, or term of the few sample zits I zapped with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the unit is probably worth it for moderate to low acne, and with that said, I think it would be a shame to give someone false hope that this can make a significant difference in a more serious acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplement after using this unit for a little longer:&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to have had a SLIGHT shortening of the lifespan of very small to medium size zits.  Meaning, it seemed to make a zit bypass coming to full \\&quot;white head\\&quot; maturity, even with that being said, I would not recommend this product, based on its operation, cost, and replacement head costs.ed on its operation, cost, and replacement head costs.</li>
    <li> I found the Zeno to work moderately well. Specifically, sometimes it worked well and other times had no visible effect, other than the redness, when used on similar pimples. Just when I&#x27;d think the device didn&#x27;t do much, it worked beautifully. Sometimes one treatment was all that was needed.    However, I find the length of treatment to be a bit long for any sort of regular use. And, as another reviewer has said, the redness makes me reluctant to use it in the morning or any other time I&#x27;ll be going out; this lessens its usefulness. Depending on the spot where applied, the device can be really hot at first, hot enough to feel scalding.    It&#x27;s certainly convenient in size, and the battery power makes it nice for travel. In fact, that&#x27;s likely how I&#x27;ll use it. At this time, I doubt that I&#x27;ll buy the replacement top for another 45 uses.     So, in essence, this little device gives me a mixed reaction. Handy and sometimes useful, but hardly a perfect solution for occasional acne.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this.I mean a device that is supposed to get rid of pimples? I have used this for almost a month on the occasional break out and it really does cut the healing time down to half.Where it usually takes a week for my pimples to vanish,it took 3 days with the zeno.    Basically you place the head on your blemish, the zeno heats up,supposedly customizes to each persons body temp.,You leave it there for several minutes and that&#x27;s it! It does feel warm but by no means is painful.    The head does need to be cleaned and replaced occasionaly but for what it does the process and upkeep is minute.I highly reccomend the zeno and am very glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Directions for use are not clear and product does not perform as stated. It also has a very short battery life. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> This was a great idea, but poor product. It only worked after about a dozen uses and then worked no more. It was pretty disapointing. I would not recommend it to anyone that is looking for serious help for acne cause you won&#x27;t get it with this. I guess it&#x27;s back to the doctor.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t read what anyone else had to say about this product. I wanted to write a review on its own merit, especially since my first impression was that this is kind of a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; item sold to the image obsessed.  While there may be some truth in the latter portion of that statement, let me simply list the pros and cons. You can decide if you fit into the \\&quot;obsessed\\&quot; category.      PROS:   It worked, and it did so in only a couple of treatments.  The treatments take only a few minutes, but it also takes a few minutes to warm it up, first. Not a big deal if you turn it on before you brush your teeth.  It is not painful, but somewhat uncomfortable.  It is a significant amount of heat, but not \\&quot;burning\\&quot; hot. I have very sensitive skin and it left me a little red for only about 15 minutes after treatment. I could easily cover the remaining redness with a thin layer of foundation and powder, no cover-up.  It makes large pimples disappear quickly.  I&#x27;m talking about the bumps that start out small and stick around for weeks. Usually in inconvenient places. The ones that seldom respond to acne medications.  It is small and convenient. Would fit easily into luggage for travel.  Could save your face if you had a major event coming up and developed one of the aforementioned blemishes.  This is far more comfortable than the shock treatment used in facials and spa settings where blemishes are \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; with low level electricity, feeling a lot like a minor electrical shock.    CONS:    It isn&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; but does cost far less than spa treatments and injections by dermatologists (not including the pain of making an appointment and waiting to get in).  The replacement cartridges are around $15 and the device can only be used around 75 times before you will need one.  If you have a low tolerance for heat, or burn easily, this is not for you.  It will cause irritation if used simultaneously with acne medicine.  If you have many blemishes, the treatments of 2.5 minutes per blemish could take a significant amount of time, daily. Something to consider.  Finally, it tells you on the label that it cannot be used on \\&quot;white head\\&quot; or \\&quot;black head\\&quot; pimples, just the \\&quot;headless\\&quot; kind. For those, it proved to be rather effective, for the others, chemical treatments are preferred.    Overall, I gave this 4 stars because it delivers what it promises. I listed the cons/drawbacks and withheld one star because the advertisements don&#x27;t really tell you in advance what kind of blemishes it does not treat, so someone buying this to treat chronic blackheads (which, by the way is simply very clogged pores and should be treated with an acid-based cleanser) would be disappointed.</li>
    <li> First, let me be clear that this device did work for me. However, I am returning it because I had to replace the 2 AAA batteries every 6 to 9 treatment cycles. (It was 6 cycles with the batteries it shipped with, so I thought it was just old, tired batteries. But it lasted just 3 extra cycles using fresh Duracell Ultra batteries.) I think it&#x27;s a huge waste of money to be replacing these batteries every 2-3 days, so I&#x27;d rather try the one that plugs in. I do think that the Zeno is a terrific product, but the Mini is disappointing with its battery performance.</li>
    <li> I hate items like this in a way because I have learned to distrust them. After years of using hundreds of things for the little engine you wish would not, you find that all the invasions in the world cannot stop blemishes from thinking they can. That means a lot of time hoping away the ravages of stress and long hours, hoping instead for that one little ugly thing to go away so you can set the perfect impression a couple of days later. While nothing truly does that with perfection, this does it with more finality than most other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When buying this product, read what you are buying because there are specific things you need to know. First, you have to buy \\&quot;refills\\&quot; for the thing and I really did not understand that. Perhaps that was stupidity on my part - still, I thought that the little beastie did all the work for me. Second, the thing works off of heat. While that might not bother everyone, some people I have talked to do not like the idea of drying out something so rapidly. I personally do not find a problem with that - a 24 hour cure is a 24 hour cure to me - but some people think otherwise. Third, it sometimes takes a while to heat up and accidentally not getting everything right : well, you spend a refill in some rather dumb ways while learning the new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, do I recommend it? Well, if you think the pros and the cons all sound good then it can not hurt. It does do a good job of clearing up the skin faster, and that is something that many people want regardless of anything else. Some people are not that way, however, and those people should know that this product does have some downsides as well.&lt;br /&gt;Not for every household. A little side note: read the enclosed pamphlet on use and on buying the refills. Also you only get 45 uses with this particular one, but the website where you buy the refills has other types available with more uses on the refills and better equipped for your particular needs. It does adapt to your skin type and does not burn or hurt.urn or hurt.</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne and knew I had to own this. When my Zeno arrived and I tried it right away, I must say, what was a pimple the day before was a smaller red spot the next day, and that just doesn&#x27;t happen with me. When I get a zit it likes to hang around for a least a few days. The Zeno Mini does work! The only problem I personally had was it was too hot to keep on for the full 2.5 minutes for some parts of my face, like my temples and jaw. I keep it on for as long as I can and have to give my skin a break for a second or two during each application. Other parts of my face have no problem with the heat. I wish I there was a tip for it that you could use more than 45 times, but I&#x27;m sure there will be in the future. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this before you go out and do stuff, unless you can wear makeup, because your skin where you used the Zeno will be red for a couple hours afterward. I gave it 4 starts because it works, but if you get more than a few pimples a week, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s economical to use everyday. Once my 45 uses were up the product no long heat up. This is great if you get a couple pimples a day or 2 before a special occasion and want a clear face.</li>
    <li> The Zeno system does work, but it&#x27;s not magic - it basically can help limit or prevent moderate size pimples by using heat to kill the bacteria that causes the pimple. It is not meant for the small stuff - whiteheads and the like - or the really large cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works well, and the instructions are very clear. I encourage you to take the recommendation in the manual to try it out on your arm first to get an idea of how hot the tip gets. I found it very tolerable, but if you&#x27;re very sensitive to heat it could be considered uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get mostly small whiteheads, and those are very effectively treated using standard over the counter stuff, such as the creams and washes that use salicylic acid. Once in a while, however, a larger pimple comes along that is immune to conventional treatment. That&#x27;s when the Zeno comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use -- basically just clean the tip with alcohol, turn it on, wait for it to hear up (there are beeps that tell you what to do) then hold it against the pimple. Don&#x27;t press hard - just hold it against the skin. For best results you need to start early when you can basically feel the pimple but it is not (or barely) visible. Wait too long and you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside is that you have to be patient -- you need to apply the tip for 2.5 minutes. Doesn&#x27;t sound like much time, but while you are doing it it can seem like an eternity. The other point to keep aware of is that it will leave your skin red where it was used. I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so the mark was visible for a couple of hours before it faded. The harder you press, the most significant the mark, so use a light touch. Not a big deal, but something to keep aware of when determining when to use the Zeno (i.e., it&#x27;s best in the evening before bed so the red mark will fade overnight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it so far against two pimples. The first one it stopped in its tracks -- only needed one treatment to do so.  The second time the Zeno was a bit less effective -- despite three treatments the pimple did develop. On the plus side, it stayed small, and faded away faster than normal, so Zeno was effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product. While it is not perfect, it does help.eno was a bit less effective -- despite three treatments the pimple did develop.

    <li> I was really excited to get ahold of this little doohickey, but in the end to say that I was underwhelmed would be an understatement.  I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m not the most zitty of guys around, but I still get my fair share &amp; I can&#x27;t remember a time that I&#x27;ve ever really welcomed one.  Now in this case I was hoping to just erupt with the explosive little goobers, but as is my wife &amp; I could only come up with 2 :(.  Anyway, the 1st one we zapped (or \\&quot;zitilated\\&quot; as we like to say in our household) left us with an inconclusive result.  We used it one night before bed, &amp; by morning the zit was still there though had come to a head.  This may&#x27;ve been a result of the machine, but may&#x27;ve just as easily been the human body doing it&#x27;s thing.  Also, be fair warned that this thingy isn&#x27;t the most comfortable experiance.  You&#x27;re basically burning the boil from your body (supposedly destroying it from within), &amp; having to apply this thing with pressure for 2 &amp; 1/2 minutes isn&#x27;t fun.  Also, know that using this thing leaves a red mark wherever you use it, so be sure not to use it before work (or school I guess for the younger crowd out there), better to use it at night when you&#x27;re in for the evening.  The next thing about the item is the battery life of the product.  We were going to use it for the 2nd time &amp; the battery was dead.  This pretty well discouraged us from really caring to mess with the stupid thing anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go, that&#x27;s our experiance with this thingy.  To me... I don&#x27;t know, it seems pretty gimmiky &amp;[...] it&#x27;s kind of an expensive gamble for nothing more than a novelty item.  Buyer beware</li>
    <li> Actually. it does help, but you have to treat the spot 2 1/2 minutes, 30 seconds at a time.  After 30 seconds it shuts off and you have to wait before it will restart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good idea, poorly carried out.  If you have one spot, every once in a while, then it&#x27;s fine.  To someone with a major problem, I would imagine this worthless.</li>
    <li> I have the original zeno and this one.  (I keep the mini with me when I travel.)  They both work extremely well!  I have used many other devices and have yet to find anything as effective.  My son is beginning to need to use it too and it works on his acne.  I recommend this product to all my peers and my son is beginning to tell his friends about it!  Thank you for making such a good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a thirty-something professional woman who occasionally (maybe once or twice a month) must contend with a blemish. So, take this demographic into account while reading.    Though the price-tag on the Zeno seems daunting, rest-assured, the product works!! In our instant-gratification society, this little wonder fits-in nicely. Blemishes subside rapidly and with no discomfort. (The tip of the Zeno becomes very warm but the sensation, for me, was not unpleasant). After two treatments (several hours apart), my blemish was virtually unnoticeable with the help of my mineral-foundation.    Now, it may interest you to know that I&#x27;ve used Renova for over six-years, so I was a little hesitant to use the Zeno (though I saw no contraindications in the booklet). (For those who are unacquainted with the product, it is a Vitamin-A derivative which must be prescribed by a physician or dermatologist ... while it encourages collagen growth, reduces fine-lines, and exfoliates, it also leaves your skin vulnerable to sunlight and various other elements.) I have used this product on two different occasions with no side-effects. (I am only speaking for myself, of course. So, be sure to take care if you are in a similar situation ... and if you have an adverse reaction, feel free to comment on this post so others can read it).     The Zeno is now a permanent part of my beauty \\&quot;arsenal.\\&quot; Between the Renova, [[ASIN:B000V990SS Bare Escentuals]] (as recommended by my dermatologist), and the Zeno, my skin is absolutely pristine and glowing. A minor miracle ... and, as one reviewer stated and I firmly agree, I wish this was available when I was a teenager!    Bottom-line: the Zeno is quick (two and half minutes per treatment), painless (for me), concentrated (it addresses just the area that requires healing), and really cute!! (Aesthetically speaking, it is super slick!!) In my opinion (and I am a tough critic!) the Zeno is entirely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> the instructions are a bit confusing so i just researched in the internet how to use it properly.  still acne here and there this thing just lower the size of it. but does not get rid of them</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work. wasted my $$</li>
    <li> I had already been using acne creams every day, so keep that in mind.  It seemed to work best for me on either very small red pimples, or the ones where you feel a little bump and maybe some soreness (the kind that usually turn into huge, painful pimples), but nothing is really visible yet.  If you wake up with a big pimple, don&#x27;t get your hopes up.  It&#x27;s also very time consuming  so if you have more than a few pimples, you&#x27;ll be sitting there all day with this thing.  And it didn&#x27;t make the pimples completely disappear as quickly as I had hoped, but it did make them fade, not get as big, or disappear faster.  So overall I would say it&#x27;s a decent weapon to have in your arsenal.  My biggest complaint is that the batteries die after about 4 or 5 uses!  What the hell is that about?  So I&#x27;m going to try rechargeable batteries to see if that&#x27;s any better.</li>
    <li> Worked a few times, then failed. Replacing the batteries with brand-new ones does not help, nor does resetting the device. Judging from other reviews (which I wish I&#x27;d read before buying this dud), it&#x27;s a common problem. Utter waste of money.</li>
    <li> Zeno Mini is an effective, but fairly pricey way to treat pimples painlessly and with no mess.  How does it feel?  As you apply it on the pimple, a heat will slowly be applied.  Therefore, it starts out cool and at the end will feel lukewarm on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Portable*  With the dimensions of 4 x 1.5 x 0.5 inches, Zeno Mini goes wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*No Mess, Quick and Painless*  No mess whatsoever.  Apply and minutes later, your treatment is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Only works on mild or full pimples*  It will only work on pimples.  It will not work on severe acne, moles, scars on any other type of blemish.  It will not even work on blackheads, which was disappointing, even though both blackheads and pimples go under the category of sebaceous gland inflammation of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pricey*  Because it only works on pimples, one must wonder if paying extra is worth it when they can buy a much cheaper alternative treatment at the pharmacy.  Furthermore, over-the-counter treatments can treat more than just pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Recurring Pricing*  Each Zeno Mini comes with a cartridge that is good for approximately 45 treatments.  Each pimple treatment usually lasts 2-3 applications, as per claim(even though my mild pimple was gone after just one,) which means you may need to buy additional cartridges later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  An affective way to treat mild and medium pimples.  While affective, it is pricey over other alternatives.</li>
    <li> First things first, this isn&#x27;t the cheapest of options for dealing with early stage acne.  In fact at $80-90 its rather expensive in comparison to the myriad creams, rubs, tubes of topical goo out there not to mention a visit to your doctor/dermatologist if you have a decent medical plan.  That being said, to deal with a certain type of acne (mainly fresh young pimples that have recently popped up and not yet at the whitehead stage) Zeno&#x27;s sleek and tiny little device does pack quite a punch and effectively kills said young zits from going supernova on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lets go back to the cost issue.  When you spend $89 on this product you&#x27;re getting a cell-phone sized device thats good for 45 individual uses.  Keep in mind that each zit will require from 1-3 treatments (in my experiments I required 3 treatments per zit over the course of 24 hours to achieve desired results) so effectively for your initial $89 purchase you&#x27;re treating 15-20 zits.  Once you&#x27;ve used this product 45 times (there is a microchip that keeps track of your usage) your device is basically useless unless you purchase a replacement tip cartridge (around $20) for another 45 uses.  Rinse, lather, repeat.  If you are prone to excessive and frequent breakouts you may want to consider other options if you want to avoid going to the poorhouse in the long run.  If you do get the occasional zit now and then, then by all means - indulge.  The price is steep but for some of us the end results justifies the means and indeed, the results are very impressive.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other reviewers . . . it works well on a specific type of blemish (for me at least) - the kind that is raised and filled with goo (whatever you call what&#x27;s inside of a pimple).  Clogged pores, whiteheads, blackheads - doesn&#x27;t do anything for them - better to exfoliate and use a salicylic/glycolic acid combo to keep those clean.    Only drawbacks are that you can only treat a few blemishes at a time and each treatment takes about 2 1/2 minutes.  That&#x27;s a bit of time holding the Zeno to your face/body, but worth it to get rid of the blemish in a non-pinching way.</li>
    <li> After reading everyone&#x27;s reviews, I kind of feel bad that we did not have the same results. I have used it and I let my teen daughter use it with my supervision.  Nothing dramatic happened to report.  However, with that said, I am now letting my 21 year old son give it a whirl and I will report back my findings and edit my review!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this once; like some other reviewers I&#x27;m no longer a teenager and only have pimples once in a while.  It does feel a little warm on your face, but after doing it a couple times on the same outbreak it seemed to dissipate.  It would be nice if it worked on pimples that are just beginning, but it says it&#x27;s only to be used on them when they get red.  Maybe it can be further developed to work on the new outbreaks before they get obvious.  It does seem expensive especially when you need to buy replacement tips after 45 uses.  However, if I was a teenager with severe acne I would think this is the ultimate way of getting rid of them.  Wish it had been around years ago!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my teenage daughter to try out.  She was quite excited about the product and felt that it helped her to clear her skin more rapidly than normal. It took a little more effort and patience than she would have liked, but overall she is pleased and has recommended it to her friends.</li>
    <li> Unit came as prmoised.  I have only tried it once, it is time consuming.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money and did nothing for my acne.</li>
    <li> I ordered this quite some time ago and am just now getting around to the review.&lt;br /&gt;At that point there was very little information available on the device, and I thought, okay, well, can&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, per the documents that came with it, it&#x27;s not intended for use on just ordinary pimples or whiteheads... just acne. Only acne.&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up not using it. Just putting this out there in case you missed the fine print. It&#x27;s well designed and if I ever started having problems with regular acne I&#x27;d probably try this.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the said purpose of it. I tried it for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t clear the area as it promised. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I lost about 50 lbs in 3 months.  My face FREAKED out.  At first I thought this was working so well.  But then I realized the battery dies SO FAST.  I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.  It is the most useless item I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t help my acne at all, and then it broke after a month anyway. What a waste- get the Evis blue light tool instead, it&#x27;s pricier but works better, covers a larger area, and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve had success with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Evis-MD-Platinum-Blue/dp/B002H0621C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1366631103&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;evis+blue</li>
    <li> Dealing with adult acne since having kids was driving me crazy.  Tried this product but it was too strong, burned my Asian skin.</li>
