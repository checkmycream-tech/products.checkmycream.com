<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> * Smells good!  It has a divine orang-ey aroma.&lt;br /&gt;* Does a great job of cleaning my face, hair and body.  No matter how sweaty or stinky I am, it thoroughly cleans me.  I love how silky and shiny it makes my hair look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;* Works great as a bubble bath.  Sometimes I&#x27;m in the mood to soak in bubbles, and this body bath is perfect for those times.&lt;br /&gt;* One of the very few body washes I can use on my ultra sensitive skin.  I have trouble with most body washes; even those especially made for sensitive skin will make me itch for hours.  After trying My True Nature, I now have three I can use without problems (this one, Babyganics Baby Shampoo + Body Wash, and Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Past Baby Bath).  So far, My True Nature is my favorite of the three.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and body wash combination is quite handy. I used it for traveling and the combination saved space in my bag. It smells fresh and citrus-y. If you are used to shampoo foaming on your head, you might not love this because it doesn&#x27;t foam, due to lack of sulfates. However, it does get your hair nice and clean with no harsh chemicals. It makes a nice smelling body wash too.</li>
    <li> This wash is about as pure and natural as it gets. I use it on my baby and my 5 year old daughter. It’s completely non-irritating, moisturizing, and it smells great. It has a very mild citrusy scent. Most importantly, it cleans really well. I would easily use this again</li>
    <li> I would give this a much higher rating for it&#x27;s certified organic ingredients, but two things stand out to me as slightly problematic about this product.  The first being that it&#x27;s not tear free (or at least I couldn&#x27;t find anything about it being tear free on the product itself) and that&#x27;s something I would expect from a body/shampoo wash for an infant.  The second is that while all of the ingredients are free of GMOs, paragons, petri-chemicals, phthalates, sulfates, synthetic dyes or fragrance - it contains a long list of well-known &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; photosensitizing extracts, including grapefruit, lemon peel, orange peel, lime peel extract, and tangerine.  These just seem to harsh to use on sensitive skin, but maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho...  I originally ordered this thinking I could use it on my dog who has really sensitive skin and eyes; he doesn&#x27;t do well with &amp;#34;dog shampoos&amp;#34; but tearless baby shampoo keeps his coat shiny without irritating his eyes.  After reading through the ingredients and realizing it was not a tearless formula, I decided to use it for myself primarily as a body wash (once/twice as a shampoo; but this couldn&#x27;t quite manage cleaning my long hair).  I really love citrus scents, so this really appealed to me in that regard.  It doesn&#x27;t sud/later much, which overall, I half expected.  I think it&#x27;s a nice &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product, but personally, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for a baby or for use on sensitive skin just because of the photosensitizing ingredients.</li>
    <li> We have been using this for the past week now. It works up a nice lather and smells very strongly of that standard citrus scent. It is also very fluid though... I would like it if it could be thicker. It is also very clear/ water colored, which can be good or bad depending on the person.</li>
    <li> First thing, you&#x27;ve gotta love the citrus scent of lemons!  If you do you&#x27;re in for a treat because natural benign ingredients are always best as nature in it&#x27;s simpliest form works quite well here.  This shampoo and body wash does clean and does so without any drawbacks that are noticeable.  It will leave your scalp nourished yet make your hair lively and  manageable.  If you have small children the choice should be that much easier.  The only thing that could be better is if the amount was more generous.  Truly a joy to use and recommended.</li>
    <li> My family is all natural and organic for food and washes. There&#x27;s not a lot of options out there for kid washes. We use Tom&#x27;s, Burt&#x27;s Bees and some others that are partially organic or all natural (like Method). I was really excited to try this brand because we were looking for something fully organic for our youngest for bath time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that he loves this! The lemon smell is great and he immediately took to it. (He mistakenly thought this was bubble bath because of the picture, but it made enough bubbles after use to hold him over.) He smells great and looks and smells clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side for me is how light this is. What I mean is that on the scale of water to paste, most washes are slightly more thick. This one is very thin and runs right out of your hand quickly if you aren&#x27;t careful. And at only 8 ounces I can see losing quite a bit to how runny it is. I still really like this, but I recommend going straight for a wash cloth other wise you may lose some of this.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this on our daughter, and generally she likes it. My daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it, either. It&#x27;s a natural product but works as well as any other soap or body wash. It doesn&#x27;t suds as much as other body washes--not surprising, since additives are often used for suds--but that&#x27;s not a big deal for us. The soap has a bit of a citrus smell to it, but no lingering, perfume-like odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is obviously aimed at kids, but adults might like this as well. With the kid focus in mind, the soap came with a sheet or two of stickers.</li>
    <li> I will say off the top that I only used this as a face and body wash, so I don&#x27;t know how it works as shampoo. But for a face wash, it&#x27;s great - gentle on skin, smells lovely without overpowering, and has clean ingredients so I don&#x27;t worry about rubbing carcinogens into my face. It doesn&#x27;t lather TOO well, but good enough for me. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent choice for a baby shampoo/wash where you do not have to worry about the side effects from \\&quot;better living through chemistry.\\&quot;  It has a very nice scent, the product is effective and causes no irritation, and best of all, it does not cost and arm and a leg as some specialty products do.  Good choice - particularly if your baby has sensitivity to the ingredients in some ingredients of standard soaps.</li>
    <li> Both my 12 yr old and my 6 yr old like it, so I have no complaints with the product and will probably purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> Not too bad, but the smell is too fruity and synthetic.</li>
    <li> I used it on my 3 year old and for myself. It lathers better than Burts and Bees Baby wash I have been using and smells better too. The smell is a little strong for a baby wash but not unpleasant. It bubbles well too.</li>
    <li> Great for my kids hair and body. Smells nice but not a fake scent at all.</li>
    <li> Every product we&#x27;ve tried from this company has been great and Daisy&#x27;s 2-in-1 Shampoo with Body Wash is no exception! It&#x27;s got none of the bad stuff and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> We just love this product.  My daughter has pretty bad eczema on her legs and this shampoo/body wash has worked well with it.  Plus, I can use it on both of my children who have completely different skin and hair.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This easy pump bottle makes it simple to squeeze out the proper amount. No struggles to shimmy out the remaining shampoo from a tube. When it is near empty, I take off the cap and fill with a bit of water, shake it up, and your able to get the entire amount with no hassle. I look for these types of pumps in all my products now and consider them &#x27;no hassle&#x27;. This is a creamy, gentle shampoo. I can even use it on my face to wash off makeup, and the skin on my face is very sensitive and prone to sudden rashes. So far I have not had this problem. I usually have a reaction right away if a product is going to cause a rash. I love the smell as well and the ingredients. Very friendly to people with problem skin. It was also very gentle on my scalp (which has its own set of problems). Since I perm and color my hair, my scalp is extra sensitive. I felt no burning, itching, etc. with the use of this product. This would probably make a great gift. You could use it as a stocking stuffer, but I would put it in a plastic ziplock bag first. If the handle got accidentally turned before use it could leak all over the stocking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite strong smelling.  Not an unpleasant smell, but a strong smell.  Quite floral.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my older boy, but not my little one who has very sensitive skin/eczema...</li>
    <li> I love the light citrus scent of this shampoo/body wash. It seems like it has a hint of vanilla, or some other lightly sweet scent. It is just enough to soften up the citrus and make it smell really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light foamy lather and rinses away easily. It leaves the skin smooth and soft and does not seem to dry it out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent does not linger too long on the baby and is not too strong even when you do smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is made in the USA and is free of sulfates, synthetics and other &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and body wash has nice citrusy smell. It does not foam too much. It goes on hair and skin very nicely. Tried it on both my son, who has eczema, and on myself. It leaves skin feeling nice and soft, very pleasant, with no irritation. The shampoo comes out of the bottle as a thick liquid, and this is my only complain - I like it when it is in foam form - foam is so much easier to apply to a small child who hates water on his face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this on my son now since there are no chemicals,like other body washes and shampoos have.He has very dry skin and a flaky scalp,so I needed a safe product for a 3 year old,and this seems to be working.I&#x27;m using this as his shampoo,and body wash,smell is okay,non-irritating.I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural and not harmful</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo and body wash that doesn&#x27;t create flakes on my 7mo old&#x27;s scalp.  I&#x27;ve tried Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s and the episencial wash with disastrous results.  It&#x27;s very gentle on his skin and leaves him smelling great.</li>
    <li> This has sodium benzoate which is known to promote cancer. No Thanks.</li>
    <li> i thought that this product is good,cause it&#x27;s natural and all that,but the smell is really bad! i would not recommend this product to any perent.</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo for our toddler son. It smells great and is safe for his sensitive skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the strong fruity scent or the texture - it was like pouring heavily scented water into my hands. Since I didn&#x27;t like the smell I didn&#x27;t like the way it lingered on my skin after the shower for a while. Thinking I may not be objective enough I let a friend borrow it who likes lotions, washes and shampoos that smell like fruit. To my surprise she felt the scent was almost chemical in its strength. Like a house cleaning product. Did it wash my hair okay? Nothing special -- except I would rather not smell that heavy smell after I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have used My True Nature 2 in 1 Shampoo and Body Wash several times now with excellent results.  It is nice to find a product that truly helps relive the itching and dryness of my skin and scalp.  Imagine, using one product for all of your needs. the fragrance is nice without being overpowering and the product is silky smooth going on my skin and my hair.  I didn&#x27;t even need to use conditioner for my hair. It took very little product to get a good lather on my sponge and hair, so it may be very affordable.</li>
    <li> Gentle shampoo and body wash for kids of any age.&lt;br /&gt;No Sulfates, dye or fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Gentle but effective</li>
    <li> This shampoo and body wash is simply the best! Our entire family uses it, and we have since My True Nature very first launched its amazing product line. We are devoted -- it is gentle and non-irritating for newborns, kids and adults, and the lightly lovely scent is divine. I simply can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
    <li> We find that, for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin, only 100% natural products will work for us. There are only a handful of companies out there that provide truly natural &amp; organic kids bath products, that are free of parabens, sulfates, and other irritants. My True Nature is the best there is! The shampoo &amp; body wash has a rich lather, but it is super gentle on the skin and is also tear free.  A little goes a long way, so it lasts a very long time! And more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s skin. All this, AND it smells yummy! Such a great product!</li>
    <li> I use this body wash for my 5 year old, 3 year old, and 11 month old (and as a shampoo on the baby too).  I love the silky texture and subtle scent.  It rinses easily and just leaves skin and hair perfectly fresh and clean.  I love that I can trust the quality and wholesomeness of the ingredients too.</li>
    <li> Nearly every ingredient in the Daisy&#x27;s 2-in-1 is organic, and that&#x27;s what sold me initially. I was excited that I could have a product that would be safe for my newborn. However, when I tried it I was beyond satisfied. Lathers up better that anything with SLS. A little bit goes a LONG way. I say one pump covers an entire wash. Maybe 1/2 more if we have lots of hair :) My True Nature went beyond expectations with this one! A MUST buy!!</li>
    <li> My son has severe eczema and this is gentle on his skin. I love that it&#x27;s all natural. I use it on all 3 of my children and I give it as gifts to all my mommy friends. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am so glad My True Nature products are now available on Amazon. As a Grandpa I have use their products for a couple of years but have been hard to find and is great to use with my Amazon account. Having this organic two in one solution is great and helping bath my grandkids as a fumbling grandpa this is the perfect product.</li>
    <li> My son is autistic and I choose to use organic products and since I bought them my son has shown changes. We love the shampoo, body wash, the bubble bath. He enjoys from beginning to the end every single experience in the bathtub. Definitely they are great products. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I feel really good about using this product on my children.  One has dry sensitive skin and this works nicely on him.  It&#x27;s non-irritating and gentle.  I love having a pump to dispense it - makes it extra easy to clean the kids.  Plus having it be a head to toe product means I only need one bottle of soap in the tub.  I like to buy this in the gallon size which I hope will be available soon here on Amazon.  Finally, I love supporting local, small businesses like this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a frequent buyer of shampoo/body washes for little ones because I have small twins. This is a real specialized 2-in-1 shampoo because of the ingredients, feel, and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids&#x27; hair smells fabulous and their skin is easily cleaned when we use this product. I love the fragrance. One has to read the ingredient list to appreciate how special this is. The first ingredient after purified water is aloe barbadensis leaf juice. This is rejuvenating and everybody seems to like it in skin and hair related products. Glycerin is another great skincare ingredient. The tea leaf extracts add lots to the scent. Olive oil is not among the first ingredients in the list and the product does not feel oily.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell, but it&#x27;s OK and not too strong.  Love the way it makes my skin feel and my hair look and feel.  Need to get a better quality pump assembly - mine broke almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo for my daughters, smells great and cleans great. We bought this brand since it was in the safest category rating on the skin deep website</li>
    <li> The ingredients in My True Nature Daisy&#x27;s 2-in-1 Shampoo with Body Wash are the best selling point.  The surfactants are gentler than Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.  There&#x27;s also no GMOS, parabens, phthalates in there.  There&#x27;s lots of aloe, which is cooling and soothing for the skin, and it&#x27;s a nice touch that the olive oil in the formula is organic, even though the biggest differentiator in olive oil isn&#x27;t whether it&#x27;s organic or not, but whether it&#x27;s extra virgin (pressed mechanically) or not (expeller-pressed and then chemically treated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is easy to use and there were no design issues.  The liquid is smooth, and it&#x27;s also wetter and less viscous than most shampoo or body washes.  It&#x27;s comparable to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in texture, if you need a reference point.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on the skin.  After a couple uses, I can report that the shampoo/body wash doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin very much, but I&#x27;d still advise using lotion or conditioner after washing if you or your kid has sensitive or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bunch of extracts in the ingredient list, but the soap smells overwhelmingly of oranges.  It&#x27;s very strong, so if you or your child dislikes citrus scents, this isn&#x27;t the body wash or shampoo for you.  The strong scent is the major reason I can&#x27;t recommend this to everyone.  On the plus side, the smell doesn&#x27;t cling or linger.</li>
    <li> I really like this baby shampoo/wash, and will probably buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three of my kids of eczema, and this doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate their skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the lemony smell, although it&#x27;s not what I would call a baby-ish smell - it smells like real lemons!  The consistency was thinner than what I am used to, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect how well it works, because it make tons of bubbles.  A few squirts in the running bath water resulted in a whole bathtub of bubbles!  It lathered up well on my kiddos hair, and rinsed out thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only detractor is the size of the bottle; i wish that they offered it in a bigger bottle so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy it so often.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re all natural in this household and up until this purchase, we were using castille bar soap for the baby. Now that she&#x27;s got a lot more hair, I searched for a good shampoo without nasty chemicals. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. It leaves her hair fluffy like down and the natural citrus scent is just enough - not too strong and smells refreshing. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for my three year old&#x27;s hair and body in the bath. I like the all-in-one aspect of the soap being usable both as shampoo and body wash. That&#x27;s very handy. The texture is nice and it makes a good lather, It leaves a clean feeling. The only reason I give it four and not five stars is because last time I used it a little got in my child&#x27;s eye and my child was irritated. I thought it was supposed to be &amp;#34;tear proof,&amp;#34; so that confused me. Still, I like using it and have no problem recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> This lathers nicely and has a pleasant, non-chemical, mildly citrus-y scent.  I especially like this one for my preschooler, because the lather is full enough to get worked through her hair.  And it doesn&#x27;t have parabens and the like.</li>
    <li> My True Nature Daisy&#x27;s 2 in 1 Shampoo brings a light hearted attitude, gentle, vegan ingredients to your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My True Nature takes on a role that makes it a suitable natural shampoo for children or adults. The characters on the packages are fun.  Furthermore, this Shampoo / Body Wash comes with a strip of stickers sporting the company&#x27;s characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a delicate citrus that most should find pleasing.  It is not overpowering.  Certainly, adults enjoyed the product in our household.  The vegan ingredients are not only earth friendly, but treated adult hair well.  The product clearly cleans while at the same time being gentle and somewhat nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is the very watery consistency of the product, but this may in part be down to the ingredients, so it is a balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, both children and adults will likely enjoy this product.  The only downsides could be the price for the bottle size, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t scream luxury when you use it.  Those in our household declared it &amp;#34;a good cleaning shampoo that is gentle.&amp;#34;  None felt it carried the luxurious feel that a high end hair care product might sometimes possess.  Overall, recommended product.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this shampoo are simple and non toxic.  It works fine as a soap, but does not lather a whole lot for shampoo.  This would be comparable to say Burts Bees baby wash and shampoo which doesn&#x27;t lather either, but with a baby its not that crucial.  The package needs some refining - the pump on the bottle would never unlock so it doesn&#x27;t work.  This is a major design flaw that hopefully the company can sort out, since the product is one of the safer body washes on the market.  It also does not have a fragrance which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since bringing home my son from the hospital. He has a slight case of eczema and this body wash doesn&#x27;t make his skin inflamed. It smells really nice and it makes fluffy suds. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I wish I could remember how we originally came across this product. It was recommended online somewhere so we tried it...and fell in love. The best part of course is its safety and lack of harmful ingredients. However, it has a very light pleasant scent that doesnt seem to linger on baby and it works fabulously! I have a very busy one year old boy and I will never use anything else on him. In fact, I have purchased multiple bottles of this to keep at the grandparents&#x27; houses. There is nothing negative about this stuff. If you are considering purchasing this product, wait no more! It&#x27;s wonderful and you will love it! We sure do!</li>
    <li> Daisy&#x27;s 2-in-1, and ALL My True Nature products, is absolutely fantastic. It lathers up, leaves my daughter&#x27;s long, fine, curly hair soft. A little does go a long way and it&#x27;s shampoo and body wash. We have the travel sizes so we always have it with us. I love that it&#x27;s natural and smells great, too.</li>
    <li> The most amazing product ever! I can&#x27;t stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter skin is better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to every one.</li>
    <li> I love these bath products...&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo &amp; body wash along with the Lotion  worked like magic for my son&#x27;s eczema. It doesn&#x27;t dry up skin like other soaps/ body washes and also smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.....</li>
    <li> I have been using My True Nature Daisy&#x27;s 2-in-1 shampoo with body wash, for almost a year now &amp; I have to say that it is the \\&quot;only\\&quot; soap/shampoo that I am able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause me to have an irritated skin reaction. If you&#x27;ve tried other hypoallergenic bath products &amp; still have a reaction, try this one to see if it works for you; I&#x27;ve found it to be very calming to the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the lite sent and as always the organic ingredients to My True Natures Daisy&#x27;s shampoo and body wash. I have very sensitive skin and this is absolutely the best soap for me. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the first products - shampoo, body wash and lotion from My True Nature for a friend whose infant was struggling with skin eczema.  She loved the products and they were so soothing and didn&#x27;t promote more breaking out.  Since I have purchased more products for my son&#x27;s two babies and have given the products as baby shower gifts.  All who have received them are always pleased and impressed with the products.  The lack of toxic additives gives such peach of mind.</li>
    <li> I LOVE knowing this is safe for our baby and love, love, love that I only need this one bottle to bathe our baby and toddler.  It keeps the clutter to a minimum and smells great too!</li>
    <li> Not really a body washer for me but clarifying shampoo yes it works great i dont know it I will repurchase again its to small.</li>
    <li> We love how clean this rinses and the smell is wonderful!  I like the pump top because it make it easier to use while wrangling my child in the tub.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice to have products being offered that are organic, good for you, and reasonably priced. This &#x27;cleaning solution&#x27; smells great and works well. As long as you don&#x27;t have any broken skin that is. The lil woman has some cracked skin on her hands and has been using lotions and stuff to help get rid of it. I let her try this in case she was allergic to any of the soaps she was using. I believe it&#x27;s the citric acids that make her hands burn, so it didn&#x27;t work too well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that it cleans well, smells good, and is chock full of organic ingredients, and even comes in a plastic bottle that has been made with 100% recycled materials. Oh, and it came with a pack of stickers I would guess for the bottle or the kids will enjoy them.</li>
    <li> This body wash and shampoo has a fresh scent. I love the way my daughter smells when she is done in the bath. it is made with all natural materials so I am not at all worried about it getting in her eyes. I highly recommend if you are looking for something other than the standard</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that is all natural and good for your skin this is a great product. It has a faint lemony smell and surprisingly it suds up very nicely. It is a watery shampoo/body wash which is probably the only thing about this that I don&#x27;t like. I love that you can open and close the pump, I will definitely be re-using the bottle when it is all gone. Nice product!</li>
    <li> My youngest son has highly sensitive skin.  We usually stick with hypoallergenic baby washes because of his sensitive skin.  Even though My True Nature Daisy’s 2-in-1 Shampoo &amp; Body Wash does not claim to be hypoallergenic, it’s made of natural and organic ingredients and claims to be great for sensitive skin, so we decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My True Nature Shampoo &amp; Body wash did indeed work great on my son’s sensitive skin.  He’s nice and clean with that fuzzy hair I love so much, and his skin shows absolutely no signs of irritation; it looks calm and feels baby soft.  The shampoo &amp; wash lathered up easily, and the citrusy scent was kind of nice, perhaps a little strong right at first but it faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also unexpectedly received a sheet of My True Nature stickers depicting cute, little animal characters bathing.  My children were naturally much more excited about the stickers than the 2-in-1 shampoo &amp; baby wash.  As a parent, I’m pretty happy with My True Nature Daisy’s 2-in-1 shampoo &amp; baby wash because it gently cleanses my son&#x27;s sensitive skin without causing any irritation.</li>
    <li> I love this all-in-one body wash/shampoo for my little guy.  With a loofah, I only use one pump to clean his body and 1 pump to wash his hair &amp; face so it lasts great too!</li>
    <li> My family and I love this shampoo and body wash!  My son has sensitive skin, so we love that it&#x27;s organic, non-irritating, and smells wonderful! We highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  My children don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but we love it because it is all natural  and works so well.  My children are ages 6+, they love the scent and find it very easy to dispense themselves.  It lathers up really nicely.  This body wash is great for kids of all ages.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> We bought this for our daughter when we realized she had some really bad skin on her head and behind her ears. We wanted all natural products and that did not test on animal&#x27;s. Two baths latter and little coconut oil, and bam it was gone! I&#x27;m impressed. As for her hair, it did feel a little stripped after using the soap, so we added in a conditioning oil after the bath. Her hair looks beautiful and we can brush the little fur ball with out a single tear! We will defiantly order again.</li>
    <li> good quality and it is very nice for babies</li>
    <li> If you LOVE the smell of lemons you won&#x27;t have any issue with this product. All other shampoos were giving my 3 year old cradle cap and dandruff. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this shampoo at all! I personally love the smell but it could be bothersome to some</li>
    <li> Love the clean fresh lime scent!&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my 6 month old daughter and we like it.  She doesn&#x27;t have any allergies or sensitive skin issues.  Before this, we just use regular Johnson&#x27;s Baby Wash - whatever we got at the baby shower.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not too worried about &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; and such...I mean...yes, try to live as healthily as possible - but for the most part, a lot of it is going to be pretty unavoidable in this day and age.  This product seems to kind of try to be on the &amp;#34;healthy side&amp;#34;, advertising as &amp;#34;Cruelty Free&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Dairy Free&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Gluten Free&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Nut Free&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s free of the &amp;#34;ickies&amp;#34;.  It still has things like Sodium Coco-Sulfate and Sodium Benzoate though...I don&#x27;t know what that means exactly, but my point is, it still has some ingredients that may be questionable.  Most of it sounds good enough, it&#x27;s made of a bunch of extracts.  This listing has great pictures of the entire label, so I won&#x27;t list the ingredients here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this body wash:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Cute company - they sent stickers with the product which is a touch of detail and care that is not so common nowadays.  I appreciate that!!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Lathers up nicely and didn&#x27;t seem to be gentle on all her body parts.  I&#x27;m pretty sure some watered down bubbles may have gotten a little in her eyes when I was rinsing her hair...and she may have eaten some bubbles that were on her hand...but she was fine.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Leaves baby feeling clean, fresh, and without any excess scent.  Does not leave residue on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt; - Citrus Fresh Scent - I may be narrow minded, but citrus fresh scent is what I choose when I&#x27;m cleaning the kitchen, washing dishes...maybe for the bathroom...and nice for the hardwood floors and wood products.  I don&#x27;t really like this scent for washing my baby.  Maybe because I now associate lemony scents to harsh/chemical cleaners?  That&#x27;s where Johnson&#x27;s got it right...their smell is very often directly associated with babies.  So this is a change that my brain and nose object a little too.  Not enough to hate the product...just enough to complain a little in the back of my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice company that seems to care.  The product is good, it works well, rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate baby.  The container works well even though I needed to spin it, close to a million times, before it opened and was ready for use.  There was no spillage upon delivery.ssociated with babies.

    <li> This is the best body wash and shampoo product that I have found, and I tried out a lot of different products when my 5 year old son was born.  I love that the product is all natural, easy to dispense and smells great!</li>
