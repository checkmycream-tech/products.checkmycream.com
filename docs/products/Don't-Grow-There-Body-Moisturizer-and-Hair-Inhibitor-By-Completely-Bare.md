      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Ok product, it smells good and moisturizes</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m recommending it to every girl I know for sure.</li>
      <li>I think it is working but need more time</li>
      <li>I will buy more</li>
      <li>Perhaps the longer it&#x27;s used the more results you&#x27;ll see.</li>
      <li>okay, though.</li>
      <li>but I do wish it was better.</li>
      <li>Still searching - the old Jergens Naturally Smooth lotion worked so wonderfully, keep hoping I will find a replacement...</li>
      <li>Pleasant smelling lotion, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Completely Bare products are great.  </li>
      <li>Seems to have worked great for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helps reduce risk of ingrown hairs (used along with bikini bump blaster) and I only used it once a day.</li>
      <li>It comes in a great big 6.7 oz and it lasts awhile.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good reviews on this and have not had any problems with it so far.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t my whole arm !!!</li>
      <li>this freakin product really works!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good just as a lotion and the tube is quite large, so you get a lot.</li>
      <li>Pretty good lotion, it really moisturized my legs</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to order more.</li>
      <li>I have been using this lotion for over a year and have noticed that I don&#x27;t have to shave very often at all any more.</li>
      <li>It burned so fast and so much !!!!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with products like this in the past, but I figured I would give them one more try, hence my purchase of &amp;#34;Completely Bare Hair Growth Inhibitor.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I am using it on coarse hair, of course, and perhaps it does a better job with fine</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing and is now a necessary staple to my beauty regimen.</li>
      <li>I can actually afford to have an amazing beauty product.</li>
      <li>It takes faithful use over a period of time to notice a difference, but for me its worth it.</li>
      <li>the only thing that&#x27;s nice about it is it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it as I tried other products and this is the best so far!</li>
      <li>For fine hair it seems to work fine - but for coarse it does not seem to work at all as still have to puck the hairs every couple of days</li>
      <li>keep skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
      <li>first thank God</li>
      <li>As for the price: this is an absolute steal.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>and I really can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s any difference.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for unwanted hair.  </li>
      <li>but I did not see much of a reduction in hair growth.</li>
      <li>So I have to say that for me it did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>This is a good product It does slow growth rate of hair  </li>
      <li>I mean, a lotion that moisturizes, smells good, AND inhibits hair growth?</li>
      <li>and I saw decent results.</li>
      <li>The smell is alright, I expected it to be strong chemical-y</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic, is a lot bigger than I thought, and arrived a lot sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>Everywhere that I&#x27;ve used this lotion has completely changed however and I didn&#x27;t even use it near as often as recommended.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this is not causing any adverse reactions, which is another point in its favor.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in my facial hair yet.  </li>
      <li>If u stick with it, it really works:.).I am dark haired and have the rapid regrowth after shaving which is a real pain, as I was for years doing this daily.</li>
      <li>But the hair grows at the same rate, or nearly the same rate, for me, regardless of whether I have used this product or not.</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical at first because what hair removal/inhibitor product would be so cheap if it REALLY worked?</li>
      <li>but since ive been using completely Bare hair inhibitor I only have to pluck every week now.</li>

<li> I have used it everyday for about 1 month, but so far no results whatsoever</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work in the long term though</li>
<li> It takes a very long time for results to start showing.</li>
<li> The smell is amazing, but the product did not work for me :-(</li>
<li> The whole process is very very slow but affective.</li>
<li> It actually works and you see results after a few uses.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it until the tube is empty, and if I start to see some effects, I&#x27;ll update the review and the product rating.</li>
<li> I have trouble with facial hair on my chin and the sides of my face</li>
<li> i wish it wasnt too late for me to send it back.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m feeling less hair and that means less waxing.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m plucking less often.</li>
<li> I tried using this on one leg after shaving, and a plain Jergens lotion on the other.  </li>
<li> It works especially well if I start using it immediately after waxing an area and must use at least once everyday, I hardly ever did twice</li>
<li> and I pluck EVERYDAY</li>
<li> I have also tried this lotion in a few areas where I don&#x27;t epilate.</li>
<li> It takes a while but over time the need to shave does slow down.</li>
<li> and then I use this (daily) in the areas where I&#x27;ve epilated, with the idea that it will inhibit or slow regrowth (since epilation is painful, after all!).</li>
<li> It would hurt to shave unless I waited over a week (which meant my legs looked like fur covered logs)-- and as for &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; I was always embarrassed by the sensitive skin and insane amount of razor bumps.</li>
<li> I was completely wrong.</li>
<li> ; I&#x27;m sorry to say, but I think I will not purchase another hair growth inhibitor</li>
<li> I was so skeptical about this.</li>
<li> However, I am doubtful as to whether this will be the case, since it&#x27;s been at least 90 days and the product is advertised to work in 30 days.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> Waste Of money !!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this! It actually works and you see results after a few uses. Within a week or two you notice the hair is growing at a slower rate.</li>
    <li> Seems to have worked great for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helps reduce risk of ingrown hairs (used along with bikini bump blaster) and I only used it once a day.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Did nothing at all for me.</li>
    <li> Used for over a month daily and saw no results at all.</li>
    <li> Good stuff will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought mines from target and tried it on my arm first thank God it wasn&#x27;t my whole arm !!! It burned so fast and so much !!!! I don&#x27;t know what everybody is talking about don&#x27;t buy this s*** !!!</li>
    <li> After 30 days, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in thinner hair and it grows back slower. I&#x27;m plucking less often.</li>
    <li> If u stick with it, it really works:.).I am dark haired and have the rapid regrowth after shaving which is a real pain, as I was for years doing this daily.It takes faithful use over a period of time to notice a difference, but for me its worth it.</li>
    <li> For fine hair it seems to work fine - but for coarse it does not seem to work at all as still have to puck the hairs every couple of days</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over a year and have noticed that I don&#x27;t have to shave very often at all any more. It takes a while but over time the need to shave does slow down. Great moisturizer too!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smelling lotion, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a good product It does slow growth rate of hair  It also gives you bumps and the hairs are ingrown Don&#x27;t recommend for face or bikini</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, is a lot bigger than I thought, and arrived a lot sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good reviews on this and have not had any problems with it so far. I thought this was makeup primer sized but this is lotion sized and I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product I purchase from Target about 2 weeks ago (Last Bottle) I was a little skeptical at first because what hair removal/inhibitor product would be so cheap if it REALLY worked? WELL.... to my great surprise this freakin product really works!!! I have trouble with facial hair on my chin and the sides of my face and I pluck EVERYDAY but since ive been using completely Bare hair inhibitor I only have to pluck every week now. This stuff is amazing!! Smells good, feels good, and i feel feminine again. Not to mention, IT&#x27;S CHEAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sky</li>
    <li> I have used it everyday for about 1 month, but so far no results whatsoever and I frankly don&#x27;t expect anything to happen either. Waste Of money !!!!!</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference with this product.</li>
    <li> It takes a very long time for results to start showing. The whole process is very very slow but affective.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer but have not noticed reduced hair growth.</li>
    <li> THIS DOESN&#x27;T WORK, IT&#x27;S A GREAT MOISTURIZER BUT DOESN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING ELSE. DON&#x27;T BUY IT.</li>
    <li> this product does not work at all. gives you immediate pimples. the only thing that&#x27;s nice about it is it&#x27;s fragrance. i wish it wasnt too late for me to send it back.</li>
    <li> Pretty good lotion, it really moisturized my legs but I did not see much of a reduction in hair growth.</li>
    <li> I think it is working but need more time</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical about this. I mean, a lotion that moisturizes, smells good, AND inhibits hair growth? I thought: no way. I was completely wrong. This product is absolutely amazing and is now a necessary staple to my beauty regimen. I&#x27;ve used it EVERYWHERE (including my bikini area), and after about 4 weeks of use, I cannot believe the difference it has made! My hair has always been coarse and unmanageable. It would hurt to shave unless I waited over a week (which meant my legs looked like fur covered logs)-- and as for &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; I was always embarrassed by the sensitive skin and insane amount of razor bumps. Everywhere that I&#x27;ve used this lotion has completely changed however and I didn&#x27;t even use it near as often as recommended. My hair now grows only sparsely and has an unfamiliar fineness to it that makes shaving a total breeze. THANK YOU to whoever invented this. I&#x27;m recommending it to every girl I know for sure. As for the price: this is an absolute steal. I can actually afford to have an amazing beauty product.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, but the product did not work for me :-(</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with products like this in the past, but I figured I would give them one more try, hence my purchase of &amp;#34;Completely Bare Hair Growth Inhibitor.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry to say, but I think I will not purchase another hair growth inhibitor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple of months now and I really can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s any difference. I epilate in my bikini area once weekly and then I use this (daily) in the areas where I&#x27;ve epilated, with the idea that it will inhibit or slow regrowth (since epilation is painful, after all!). I have also tried this lotion in a few areas where I don&#x27;t epilate. But the hair grows at the same rate, or nearly the same rate, for me, regardless of whether I have used this product or not. I am using it on coarse hair, of course, and perhaps it does a better job with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a pleasant smell and is non-greasy. It&#x27;s pretty good just as a lotion and the tube is quite large, so you get a lot. I&#x27;ve been using the same tube since I bought it and there&#x27;s still plenty left. I have sensitive skin and this is not causing any adverse reactions, which is another point in its favor. I&#x27;m going to keep using it until the tube is empty, and if I start to see some effects, I&#x27;ll update the review and the product rating. However, I am doubtful as to whether this will be the case, since it&#x27;s been at least 90 days and the product is advertised to work in 30 days.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it works, says to use twice daily for 28 days, lots to chemicals in this stuff</li>
    <li> Completely Bare products are great.  I use this inhibitor cream on my legs after hair removal and it works.  It comes in a great big 6.7 oz and it lasts awhile.  Hope this product will continue to be sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried using this on one leg after shaving, and a plain Jergens lotion on the other.  After using every day for a month, there was NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL between the two legs.  So I have to say that for me it did absolutely nothing. Still searching - the old Jergens Naturally Smooth lotion worked so wonderfully, keep hoping I will find a replacement...</li>
    <li> I use this for my Brazilian. Not only have I noticed a difference in hair growth, but so has my esthetician. I use it twice a day and there was a noticeable difference in 4 weeks. I can now go longer in between my waxes! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It smells good and minimizes hair growth. I highly recommend it as I tried other products and this is the best so far!</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my 3 bottle. Great after waxing.</li>
    <li> I have seen no results from using this product. I faithfully used for over a month following a wax and did not see a reduction of hair regrowth. The product is also cumbersome to use, needing to apply twice a day to areas of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> It does diminish hair over time but I do wish it was better. It seems to do it&#x27;s job okay, though. Perhaps the longer it&#x27;s used the more results you&#x27;ll see. Has an awesome scent though and leaves your skin really soft! Not greasy! I&#x27;d almost buy it just because it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Ok product, it smells good and moisturizes but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for unwanted hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and I don&#x27;t see a difference.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in my facial hair yet.  The directions states it takes 30 days to often see results.  I like the smell and it moisturizes my skitn.</li>
    <li> The smell is alright, I expected it to be strong chemical-y but it wasn&#x27;t. It works especially well if I start using it immediately after waxing an area and must use at least once everyday, I hardly ever did twice and I saw decent results. Doesn&#x27;t work in the long term though</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;m feeling less hair and that means less waxing.  I&#x27;m ready to order more.</li>
    <li> Works well I will buy more</li>
    <li> Help unwanted hair on my  legs. keep skin smooth and soft all day. Love it. I used it day and night.</li>
