<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very thick marker tip is perfect for bold eyeliner! Lasts all day when I&#x27;m at work!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect liner to do wings with, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to apply and goes on very smooth. It also doesn&#x27;t smear easily and dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-side is that is does dry out fairly easily, as it is a marker.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be like my other felt tip liquid eyeliner. I was wrong, this is more crappy eyeliner than the dollar store. i used it once, it was a musty gray color on my skin{ i am so pale, my friends asked me if i was albino}, after that i went back to my gel eyeliner and gave this to my 6 yr old cousin for dress-up. her mother called me the next day and told me that she {6yr old cousin} threw it out because she didn&#x27;t even like. If care about your appearance DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> i really liked this eyeliner, easy to use and blendable.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner!!!! It&#x27;s so easy to use, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with drying out. I come out with perfect winged eyeliner every time. It goes on so smooth, easy, and effortless. Not to mention it was cheap,  it arrived quick, and the packagaing was in tact. This is a winner people.</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier then expected, and I love it is alot easier to use then any other one I have ,good quality</li>
    <li> Smears like crazy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within three hours my eyeliner was all over my bottom lid raccoon style and usually my eyeliner stays put through the whole day with other brands!</li>
    <li> Lines go on thicker than expected. Other reviews say it is light, but mine is pure black. Not sure how long the pen will last, but its got some weight to it. Hopefully that is all product.</li>
    <li> It smell like marker, but love it tho.</li>
    <li> I READ THE REVIEWS BUT FIGURED I WOULD TRY ANYWAY.  THIS PRODUCT DEFINITELY DRIES OUT TOO FAST.  NOT WORTH IT.  WON&#x27;T USE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Got here user fast. I love it. It makes doing eyeliner wings perfect. I can do them so fast without a mistake. I love it. I tried it as soon as I got it. It just takes a minute to get used to using it. I love it love it love it</li>
    <li> It was really dry when it came.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter. She didn&#x27;t care for it. Not dark enough. Must use multiple coats and still see through it.</li>
    <li> I like it pretty well. Stays on nice and all day. Order was not right, but quick adjustment and all was well. Really appreciate cellars like that.</li>
    <li> My new favorite eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;It is like a marker and goes on so smooth</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and easy to wipe off also&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!  I would highly recommend this item for anyone who uses eyeliners</li>
    <li> OMG MY NEW BFF!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a little intimidated to use an eyeliner pen because I thought holding it would be weird and I&#x27;d end up drawing all over my face, but honestly once I got a comfortable grip I was good to go! It applied so smoothly and I didn&#x27;t mess up! One time was all it took! I loved that I could hold it straight and make the inner lid line thinner and then I angled it down pressing on my lid and was able to make the line thicker on the top and outer lid. I love this pen omg!</li>
    <li> Creates a nice thick dark line with one sweep. Easy to control because of the marker like tip or the liner. Very easy to create a nice cat eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is... when it arrived, the post man said I owed him $1.88 in shipping, which was kind of annoying that they miscalculated the price or postage.</li>
    <li> It is really ilke a marker only it doesn&#x27;t really stick to your eyes.  It was not for me, I ended up putting an old eyeliner I had on over it so it would make a real line.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is simple to use and glides on very well. Lasted almost all day w/o having to touch up. Stoked on arrival came 2 days early. Just wish the tracking feature worked. Other than that it&#x27;s wonderful (:</li>
    <li> I have tried pencil liners, gel liners, the deadly liquid liners and they are all so hard for me!! I just can&#x27;t draw a perfectly straight line with a super thin line. It is just not possible for me. Especially after already getting my eyeshadow done... then ruining it.. ugh. So I found this &amp;#34;sharpie&amp;#34;  LA girl mark my eyes liner and it works for me! It has a think point and then gets fatter. So you can lay it on your lid and get a medium line, or you use the point for a thin line but the maker is fat so it fits in my hand and the sharpie like point made it a lot easier for me!</li>
    <li> Ran out very quickley i used it on myself then on my sister then it ranout!</li>
    <li> This was the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this eyeliner. I love it SO much. This eyeliner never smears and it wears all day long. I use it everyday and it lasts for quite a while. This is a superb product!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is way too stiff for me, it is hard to use without making a mess</li>
    <li> If you do not have this in your collection of makeup... you are missing out... This thing is a beast.... Love it... Will not being doing pencils ever again.... this is the business right here....</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner that was easy to put on, and it stayed. But four stars because the tip worn out pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I have very long eyelashes so liquid liners always got messy and all over even tho i have a steady hand. THIS EYELINER is the best ever. The point it perfect and the eyeliner stays well. I&#x27;m also allergic to many eyeliners that aren&#x27;t the pencils, But this one is very delicate on your skin. MAKES THE MOST PERFECT BLACK LINES. if you wanna go bold or super thin it works!</li>
    <li> So i was very excited to receive this eyeliner and when it came it was the wrong one! Completely a different brand. Ill still use it because im a girl and we work with what we got lol but still when you order something i expect to get what i ordered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good eyeliner so far. I got it way earlier than expected and I like how it&#x27;s a felt tip liner.</li>
    <li> This was a great product, and I recommend it to everyone who wants bold marked out eyes. My sister tried it on for the first time today and it was nothing like e.l.f. or Maybelin, it was better. Plus I ordered this on the 30th of July and recived it 1 day after! What a buy! I will deffenatly be buying from L.A. Girl again and again. THANKYOU!</li>
    <li> Good bold definition at first, but has begun to fade. very tip does not produce much ink so i have to go back over the line over and over. still better than other eyeliner markers i have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought it was a sharpie when I first got it, but it works great, so i recommend it for sure. I tend to use a little bit to much of liner and pens work better for me and this one did the job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent but the liner is very faint</li>
    <li> Cool product. Fast shipping. They make my morning routine easy and breezy since it really is like a sharpie for your eyes.</li>
    <li> Really can get a better marker than this it comes on sheer</li>
    <li> Always get so many compliments. I have found this eyeliner in stores but most are already dried out. These are never dried out... They are awesome!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed this eyeliner for darker lining of the waterline than other eyeliner pencils.  I use this to give a smokier effect on the eye.  Well worth the price.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good price and nice color but the felted tip lost shape quickly.</li>
    <li> Does the job, maybe not the best eye liner I own but great for the days I don&#x27;t feel like busting out the gel and brush!</li>
    <li> Its great at first but soon the tip of it ends up getting flat and it dries out fast , not enough eyeliner in it.</li>
    <li> stays on all day but is also easily removable if you&#x27;re deliberately trying to take it off. easy and precise application as well.</li>
    <li> The goes on better than any other eyeliner I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> After a few uses the tip started to bend and would not create as smooth of a wing. It sometimes smudged along my eye if I didn&#x27;t set it with a spray afterwords.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It hasn&#x27;t dried out yet.  The tip is still pointy.  It lasts for a good while.  It is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I bought this product first in Aruba Jan. 2012 in a clothing store where the owner told me he could hardly keep it in stock it sold so fast. I have used it everyday since. I love it. In 6 months I have gone thru 3 of them... Try using a \\&quot;Sharpie\\&quot; every day for a minute or two....they dry out too... For the price and ease of use I&#x27;m not complaining...Just Happy to get the look I&#x27;m wanting so easily. I use the black and have Egyptian looking made up eyes and thrilled with the \\&quot;Thick\\&quot; one most.</li>
    <li> It fades easy and dried out fast. takes several strokes to get a line.</li>
    <li> easy to use . dries quik , good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for an easy to apply and long wearing, liquid eyeliner. I find the bigger marker types, easier to use and this was a wonderful discovery! I suck at drawing straight lines, and this seems to be forgiving, along with a q-tip. I live in a very humid environment, so it&#x27;s important to have a non running liner.</li>
    <li> Good marker, but not extremely dark. You do have to go over it at least once or twice. Over all though I like it and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> SUPER WOW PRODUCT !!!!  Love it !!!</li>
    <li> This was the most stupid thing I ever bought, the eyeliner was like a really light grey and I thought it was going to look dark dark black , I highly recommend y&#x27;all don&#x27;t buy this product :( !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i think it was i great buy, because of price and quality for eyeliner lovers this is a must have!</li>
    <li> One of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used and have not purchased another brand since I&#x27;ve found this one.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I loved this. It&#x27;s easy to use because it wider than the usual eyeliner and you do a line as thin or thick as you want. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply but it smudges within a few hours. Most of the eyeliner wore off by the end of the day. I would not purchase this again. The only other good thing was the price.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to apply. Like a magic marker. I have tried all kinds of eye liners and this is by far the easiest.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! It Allows me to do my winged eyeliner fast and precise! I love it!</li>
