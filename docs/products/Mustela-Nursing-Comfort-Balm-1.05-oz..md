      <li>Best balm ever!!!</li>
      <li>so this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Great lotion for your ta-tas, ladies!</li>
      <li>I also accidentally discovered that it also works as the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>Plus, you don&#x27;t have to wash it off, which is awesome</li>
      <li>If you are nursing you deserve a good soothing cream like this!!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I love this product!!!</li>
      <li>very good product.</li>
      <li>This product is very good</li>
      <li>Loved this stuff!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>My advice is to load up on this balm and you&#x27;ll have a pleasant nursing experience.</li>
      <li>She loved it.</li>
      <li>I started using it when I was like 5 months pregnant because my nipples got cracked, it worked perfect for me.</li>
      <li>breast feeding my first son and thought it was excellent!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to rinse off.</li>
      <li>and I think they both help in their own way.</li>
      <li>but Mustela was best by far.</li>
      <li>For some reason I liked the Lanolin Plus better and ended up using tat one for the most part.</li>
      <li>I thought the Mustela cream had a pleasant smell, rubbed on easily and smooth, helped keep my nipples moist which prevented severe cracking and bleeding.  </li>
      <li>but I ended up liking the Lansinoh better.</li>
      <li>I recommend this cream to any mother who is going to breastfeed, just make sure you have it BEFORE the baby comes</li>
      <li>My baby does not seem to mind the cream&#x27;s taste and it is safe to use with baby.  </li>
      <li>Made breastfeeding much more comfortable!</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to trying this since many of the reviews gave it lots of praise.  </li>
      <li>My friend was using regular lanolin and she was very happy with that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>It really works great</li>
      <li>This balm is okay</li>
      <li>This is my favorite nursing cream.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I was able to breastfeed with this for one year.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t pull at my skin when I put it on</li>
      <li>This cream smells much better than either of those.</li>
      <li>I love this balm.</li>
      <li>Mustela is non-sticky, smells nice and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Best cream out there for sore and chapped nipples due to breastfeeding/ pumping.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other creams through nursing 2 babies, and this is by far the best (even better than prescriptions).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really worked!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of other nipple creams - mother love, earth mama, and medela and lansinoh and this is by far the best for comforting sore nipples.</li>
      <li>b/c you will want to use it right away!</li>
      <li>I love this and highly suggest this for any woman experiencing cracked and sore nipples!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products but this is by far the best and is baby friendly.  </li>
      <li>I recommend to all my pregnant friends.</li>
      <li>and I think that for me personally the lanolin does a better job at preventing my sore nipples from sticking to my bra a lot better.</li>
      <li>I took this to the hospital with me and it honestly eases away the soreness like no other nipple cream.</li>
      <li>I LOVE that this cream is natural and does not need to be wiped off before nursing.  </li>
      <li>I started using this cream and received relief the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>This saved me when I was nursing my first child.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t give up breastfeeding without trying this first.</li>
      <li>so it was my first time to breastfeed.  </li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today and wish I had it from the start.</li>
      <li>I used it last night for the first time, my skin looks so much better and restored.</li>
      <li>This really helps with sore nipples!</li>
      <li>This is by far the most comforting cream for new nursing days.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, after the first application I, almost immediately, experienced a burning sensation and needed to clean it off with soap and water and use another cream to help ease the pain.  </li>
      <li>and I have not had as much pain and soreness.  </li>
      <li>I really like this nursing lotion.</li>
      <li>I just had a baby and have been very sore from nursing.  </li>
      <li>This really works, just used it after each feeding and no sore nipples.</li>
      <li>...will get again thanks</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I used this balm in the hospital post partum - it really helped keep everything moisturized and prevented blisters.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other options, but this has by far been the best product.</li>
      <li>Way better than other solutions.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey but it is worth every penny, especially for that first month of nursing.</li>
      <li>Other nipple creams with Lanolin caused worse problems for me but this item is wonderful!</li>
      <li>I bought before I had the baby and was using but my nursing consultant told me a little hind milk squeezed onto the nipples would be better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than Medela and other brands she tried following her first pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Due to the price I only bought one tube to give it a try, but after the first day of using Mustela I bought three more tubes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a new mom</li>
      <li>I like to give it to new breast feeding moms</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells</li>
      <li>1 oz isn&#x27;t very much, go ahead and order a bigger size (or</li>
      <li>We are very sensitive both to pain and in that we react to elements and products often.  </li>
      <li>I usually do not like using any creams for my body</li>
      <li>It has a faint but pleasant scent, and I didn&#x27;t think it was greasy or sticky.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s hypoallergenic with hardly any smell.</li>
      <li>And I do not have sensitive skin and have never had an allergic reaction, or any reaction for that matter, to a skin product.</li>
      <li>I tried other creams when I first started breastfeeding</li>
      <li>I had high hopes to breastfeed for a long time, and I wouldn&#x27;t have survived the 1st weeks without this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and saved my bleeding, cracked, blistered and very painful nipples.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t make it through the first few weeks of nursing without this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My 2nd baby has an awful latch and resulted in massive cracking and bleeding and this cream has by far shown the best results in healing, so I will be buying lots of it!</li>

    <li> This saved me when I was nursing my first child. I used it every time I finished nursing and I never had cracked or bleeding nipples. It has a faint but pleasant scent, and I didn&#x27;t think it was greasy or sticky. Great lotion for your ta-tas, ladies!</li>
    <li> I guess this would work. I bought before I had the baby and was using but my nursing consultant told me a little hind milk squeezed onto the nipples would be better.</li>
    <li> I usually do not like using any creams for my body it&#x27;s just feels so greasy to me and not confutable on my skin, but we all know that when you breast feed you have to use some of protection. I did give it a try. This product is very good I have never had any issues with my nipples. It really works great and I actually like the feel of it. So, 5 star!</li>
    <li> I bought this one along with a couple other balms/creams/lanolin products. For some reason I liked the Lanolin Plus better and ended up using tat one for the most part. I would say this balm is another regular moisturizer for nipples.</li>
    <li> I used this at the beginning of nursing and while still uncomfortable, the nursing comfort balm really helped get me through it.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other options, but this has by far been the best product.</li>
    <li> A must for nursing! I recommend to all my pregnant friends.</li>
    <li> I used it last night for the first time, my skin looks so much better and restored. 1 oz isn&#x27;t very much, go ahead and order a bigger size (or order 2 at a time).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite nursing cream. I have also used the Lansinoh and Medela creams. This cream smells much better than either of those. I also like that Mustela&#x27;s balm is not sticky and has a bit of cooling effect. It is pricey but it is worth every penny, especially for that first month of nursing.</li>
    <li> I just had a baby and have been very sore from nursing.  My baby actually made my nipples bleed a bit and I dreaded feedings because they were painful.  I started using this cream and received relief the first time I used it.  I apply it now after every feeding and I have not had as much pain and soreness.  My baby does not seem to mind the cream&#x27;s taste and it is safe to use with baby.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I swear by this. I tried other creams when I first started breastfeeding but Mustela was best by far. Due to the price I only bought one tube to give it a try, but after the first day of using Mustela I bought three more tubes.  I still say it is pricey, but your definitely getting what you paid for, COMFORT!!  I would and have recommended this product to any breastfeeding mom.</li>
    <li> Best cream out there for sore and chapped nipples due to breastfeeding/ pumping. I exclusively pump for my 7 mo old twins and have spurts of extreme misery!

    <li> I was looking forward to trying this since many of the reviews gave it lots of praise.  Unfortunately, after the first application I, almost immediately, experienced a burning sensation and needed to clean it off with soap and water and use another cream to help ease the pain.  I can&#x27;t even bring myself to try it again because I&#x27;m afraid it will happen again.  And I do not have sensitive skin and have never had an allergic reaction, or any reaction for that matter, to a skin product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It&#x27;s really worked!!!</li>
    <li> bought for a friend that just had her baby. she likes it and baby doesnt mind it...will get again thanks</li>
    <li> Like with many other Mustela products, I tried other cheaper products and they failed me snd my kids.  We are very sensitive both to pain and in that we react to elements and products often.  I can&#x27;t make it through the first few weeks of nursing without this stuff.  Way better than other solutions.  It smells a little like school glue to me, but I just think of it as gluing me back together.  No need to wipe it off before nursing again, which is critical for me.</li>
    <li> This really works, just used it after each feeding and no sore nipples. Made breastfeeding much more comfortable! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister in law. She loved it. It&#x27;s better than Medela and other brands she tried following her first pregnancy. Plus, you don&#x27;t have to wash it off, which is awesome</li>
    <li> I really like this nursing lotion.</li>
    <li> I used Mustela Nursing Comfort Balm while breast feeding my first son and thought it was excellent!  I ordered it again for my 2nd son who is due in June.  I LOVE that this cream is natural and does not need to be wiped off before nursing.  Sore nipples are no fun during the beginning stages of breast feeding and wiping off greasy cream can be very painful.  I thought the Mustela cream had a pleasant smell, rubbed on easily and smooth, helped keep my nipples moist which prevented severe cracking and bleeding.  The cream helped make the painful process of newborn latching less intense.  I recommend this cream to any mother who is going to breastfeed, just make sure you have it BEFORE the baby comes b/c you will want to use it right away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products but this is by far the best and is baby friendly.  At least baby doesn&#x27;t frown and won&#x27;t want to nurse when I use this vs. others.  My advice is to load up on this balm and you&#x27;ll have a pleasant nursing experience.</li>
    <li> After disliking the sticky feeling of chafed skin against my bra because of Lansinol (not to mention PAIN), this Mustela balm was just what the doctor ordered (figuratively speaking)!! It is creamy (unlike lansinol&#x27;s vasaline-texture) and does not leave your sore skin sticking to your bra or shirt.  Definately the best!</li>
    <li> Best balm ever!!! This is the reason i could breastfeed my son. Love it!</li>
    <li> Breastfeeding can be so hard - and painful! I used this balm in the hospital post partum - it really helped keep everything moisturized and prevented blisters. And a little goes a long way, so it will last a long time.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Ahhhhhh!!!!!  RELIEF!!!  This is the BEST cream for sore nipples!  I love that it doesn&#x27;t pull at my skin when I put it on and it actually numbs the nipple a little. It&#x27;s wonderful and saved my bleeding, cracked, blistered and very painful nipples. I was able to breastfeed with this for one year. I almost gave up after a few days because it was so painful. I&#x27;m glad I found this wonderful product!  Just bought two to use when my next is born!  I want to be prepared!!</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff! It was the only thing I could find that actually helped with pain. I like to give it to new breast feeding moms</li>
    <li> I have tried many other creams through nursing 2 babies, and this is by far the best (even better than prescriptions).  My 2nd baby has an awful latch and resulted in massive cracking and bleeding and this cream has by far shown the best results in healing, so I will be buying lots of it!</li>
    <li> This really helps with sore nipples! It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to rinse off. I also use this on baby&#x27;s chapped lips.</li>
    <li> I love this balm. I&#x27;ve been using Lansinoh and its definitely helpful but I don&#x27;t&#x27; like it stickiness. Mustela is non-sticky, smells nice and absorbs quickly. I also accidentally discovered that it also works as the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried. It immediately took care of my chopped lips - something that even a super expensive products failed to do. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most comforting cream for new nursing days. I took this to the hospital with me and it honestly eases away the soreness like no other nipple cream. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of other nipple creams - mother love, earth mama, and medela and lansinoh and this is by far the best for comforting sore nipples. I do like the medela for helping nipples not stick to pads or clothing if there is some cracking and I also prefer medela as a lubricant when pumping but for all other purposes the mustela is a must have for your nursing mama pampering aresenal!! If you are nursing you deserve a good soothing cream like this!!</li>
    <li> This product is a lifesaver!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new mom so it was my first time to breastfeed.  After over a week of breastfeeding, my nipples started getting sore and it was excruciatingly painful to breastfeed.  I had high hopes to breastfeed for a long time, and I wouldn&#x27;t have survived the 1st weeks without this product.  Its cooling effect lasted long enough to provide comfort.  No rinsing required.  Definitely recommend this! Don&#x27;t give up breastfeeding without trying this first.</li>
    <li> I started using it when I was like 5 months pregnant because my nipples got cracked, it worked perfect for me. But I don&#x27;t know if the cheaper cream would would work same. My friend was using regular lanolin and she was very happy with that.</li>
    <li> very good product. I have been using this product since 2008 on my son. I am having it again for my coming baby. The product was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This balm is okay but I ended up liking the Lansinoh better. I used mustela from the beginning and applied it after every feeding. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was helping so I switched to the lanolin and I think that for me personally the lanolin does a better job at preventing my sore nipples from sticking to my bra a lot better. I do use both now though and I think they both help in their own way.</li>
