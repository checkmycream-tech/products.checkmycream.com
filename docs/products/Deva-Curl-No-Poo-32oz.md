<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far my hair doesn&#x27;t curl well with this at all. It has a lot of frizz.</li>
    <li> I just love what this does for my curly hair! It leaves it feeling clean and allows the natural curl to come through.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have naturally curly hair, and I have used everything from Frizz Ease, Bumble and Bumble, to Wen. This leaves my hair feeling soft, detangled and clean. I won&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
    <li> Received the product in a timely manner.  Purchased for my 16 year old granddaughter who has very frizzy and curly hair.  The product tames the frizz and loosens the amount of tight curl. My granddaughter has expressed she is pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> The only stuff I&#x27;ll wash my dry, brittle, curls with. No lather, but no need. Although.... you will use 4-6 squirts per wash (long hair) so be sure to buy the big bottle.</li>
    <li> I started having problems with my naturally curly hair, since using this product, everything was resolved. I just love it</li>
    <li> I love the Deva products. NoPoo is similar to the Wen products, in that it will cleanse your hair without harsh detergents or sulfates. This is especially good if you have lots of tangles. Leaves hair smelling great too.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product keeps my hair feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is great for any head of hair, not just curly.  I even blow out my hair and it always feels fantastic.</li>
    <li> I use product  all the time. Good on hair, because it had no sulfates.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly or wavy hear.  It has a nice fragrance, and does not take away from color.   Hair is clean, and easy to comb after use.  I highly recommend it, especially easy to use in this quantity since it is very thick. It comes in many sizes, but this is a bargain and will last a long time and since it has a pump it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product takes some getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t foam up. It&#x27;s kind of like a conditioner which makes your scalp tingle a little, but it cleans great too. Most products tend to make my bangs oily after awhile but this does not. Also I can get away with not using a conditioner sometimes because of it&#x27;s conditoning properties.No tangles!</li>
    <li> I havn&#x27;t any problem with the product but the tightening of the bottle lid should be looked into. The bottle was wrapped in plastic but in the plastic some of the product had leaked out, about 2 tablespoons. Otherwise it was great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with &#x27;no poo&#x27; when I was used as a model at a beauty show, so I immediately purchased it with the conditioner and the gel.  I loved it the first few times, but then my hair began to feel dirty, heavy &amp; somewhat greasy.  I&#x27;ve attempted a purifying shampoo a few times in between, and it works but then what&#x27;s the point?  I also never got used to the no lather part.  The conditioner is great in the way you instantly feel softness in your hair (the no poo does that too) so I still use the conditioner on my tips only.  The Angel Gel that came in the kit, I never liked it makes your hair feel gritty as soon as it dries.   sadly this line didn&#x27;t work in the end, for me. I&#x27;m going back to Nexxus phyto Organics.</li>
    <li> Bought Deva Curl instead of Wen, mainly cause I liked the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Wen for 3 years and it is a brilliant product, BUT I have to say Deva Curl \\&quot;smells\\&quot; better.&lt;br /&gt;I have spent the best part of my life looking for a product to help me manage, VERY curly and sometimes frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say it was a good choice to switch from Wen, so for me the price and fragrance are the main things that will push me to Keep using Deva Curl, like Wen, it is a great product, hope it works for you too.</li>
    <li> It feels like conditioner on your hair.. making it soft, manageable and looking and feeling fabulous! Not just for curly hair.. great for fried andover processed hair too!  The only down side is, it builds up on your scalp and your hair.. so you need to use a clarifying shampoo after about 3 or 4 shampoos with the no poo</li>
    <li> The product works ok, it is the strong, way too strong, smell of the Rose that is unbearable. It clings&lt;br /&gt;to your hair all day. This is not an essential oil Turkish Rose, it is a chemically based perfume. This&lt;br /&gt;negates any benefits one gets from not using shampoo. They ought to make it in a neutral scent.</li>
    <li> Great products... no split ends, hair very manageable, clean and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;delivered in fast time.</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;m a Deva product girl - but I would almost bet this is not true Deva product!  It smells really like perm solution  -  I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ve been duped!!</li>
    <li> Deva products are second to none for curly hair. This shampoo is sulfate-free and very gentle on your locks!  This is all that I and my fiancee use.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BRAND.  Been using for years with super curly unmanageable hair.  Can definitely tell an improvement with this product. Not as much fly aways and cleaner, softer, better curls.  Hair straightens beautifully, too now.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite no shampoo poo :)</li>
    <li> Theres no way for me to know for sure (of course) but I&#x27;m pretty confident this product is not pure. It smells much different than the product used at my salon and more importantly it feels much different! I won&#x27;t buy online again. I&#x27;ll buy direct.</li>
    <li> Best product I have bought in a long time.  Really does clean your hair without striping your hair of moisture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Wen user, but decided to try DevaCurl as it is a lower price. It is every bit as good as Wen:    Left my hair clean and silky  Keeps it clean for a week or more  Diluted, works as a great daily conditioning spray    It also has a divine rose scent!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cleanser for my natural hair!!! It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair &amp; it leaves it moist,soft &amp; manageable!</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair and have used wen as well as the Sally beauty version of cleansing conditioner.  I like how my hair looks and feels with cleansing conditioner.  Deva  curl is by far the best.  I have short hair and do not have to use much but feel like it really cleans my hair.  My hair is colored and this product extends my hair color tremendously.  my hair color is auburn and as you know this fades fast.  Great buy and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years and it leaves your hair in great shape.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizing shampoo for curly hair.  I have the conditioner as well, but most days I just use this stuff.  The only slight complaint I have is that you have to use quite a bit.  However, I have ridiculously thick hair.  I don&#x27;t mind too much since I don&#x27;t really have to use the conditioner much.  Deva Curl is the best stuff for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Using Devacurl for over 8 years I suggest using one-condition for shampoo, conditioner and styling cream but if you must \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; this is perfect!</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves your hair soft and silky. I use this in combination with the One Conditioner and the deep moisturizer but the shampoo seems to leave your hair in better condition.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly dry hair!</li>
    <li> This product is great, better than Wen. It is called &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for a reason. The suds are gone. Yay!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp that gets dry, itchy, and flaky with other products. I leave No Poo on for several minutes when I wash my hair and haven&#x27;t found a shampoo that works better for me and my sensitive skin.  I definitely recommend you give it a try!</li>
    <li> Original message:  I purchased a 4 oz travel size No Poo to try it out.  It was fabulous!  My hair was shiny, soft and I could go 2-3 days between washings.  Every day was a good hair day so I invested in a 32 oz size bottle.  After 3 weeks my hair turned dull, greasy and felt like it was coated with something sticky.  What happened?  Has this happened to anyone else?  Any tips or advice are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I withdraw my one star review and change it to 5 stars plus!  As it turns out it was the silicone in the leave-in products I had been using that weighed my hair down.  Deva Curl has no harsh detergents that will remove silicone.  The remedy is to use a clarifiying shampoo one last time to remove all of the silicone residue and after that use only Deva Curl No Poo and One Condition.  Remember - no silicone products while using Deva Curl.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, thick coarse hair.  I absolutely love this product.  It gives my curls a soft and healthy appearance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and what I got this time looks, smells, and feels completely different that what I got the first time.  If the problem is that the formula changed, WOW - that&#x27;s a dramatic change.  I have a feeling that what was in the bottle I ordered isn&#x27;t No-Poo at all.  The fragrance is so strong I can smell my hair all day.  This product is drying and not very gentle.  I&#x27;m disappointed and won&#x27;t order it again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> (please refer to my before and after pics) I made the mistake of putting a keratin treatment on my hair about 8 weeks ago. What a disaster! I will never do that again. I was so miserable I wanted to cut all my hair off and start over, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like my hair short so I was in a bit of a quandry: rat&#x27;s nest, or divorce (well, he probably wouldn&#x27;t have divorced me, but who wants their husband to hate their hair?). Then I found The Curly Girl&#x27;s Handbook and Deva products and fell in love. My after pic is taken after using the method&#x27;s described in the book and the Deva products (one conditioner, no poo shampoo, AnGel) for only 1 week! Nothing else will ever touch my hair again. Thank you, Lorainne Massey. You saved my curls, my marriage (haha), and my self-esteem.</li>
    <li> Survival of my children&#x27;s hair requires this product!  Curly, nappy hair does not win when using this product. Combing is no longer a big deal.</li>
    <li> No poo is the perfect shampoo for the caucasian usual curl types which tend to be dry. I love this product and the Devachan system itself.   My hair has never looked better, however, I have two suggestions for users.  First No-Poo is a botanical scalp cleanser.  Splay your fingers and cleanse your scalp. Go along the hairline and through the whole scalp.  Don&#x27;t rub it into the hair itself.  Second,  rinse, rinse, and rinse again.  This product needs to come out before you move to the next step. Since it doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s easy to think you have rinsed enough.  Once you have rinsed the \\&quot;poo\\&quot; out use the Devachan One Condition.  If you have fine hair, be sure to rinse MOST of the conditioner out, save for the very ends.  Thicker hair, tighter curls? You can rinse less conditioner out.  It&#x27;s not magic, but the Devachan products really made a noticeable difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> needs better packaging. product  is good</li>
    <li> As a Curly Girl routine follower I love being able to guy these larger bottles at a lower price. Love the product, I alternate between Low-Poo and No-Poo (no-poo about once a week) and that works for my hair.</li>
    <li> these products are great, but the shampoo and conditioner must be used together a number of times before your hair feels clean and healthy in my experience, and don&#x27;t use anything else in between. other products have drying agents that make it so that your scalp gets dirty very quickly. with no poo and one condition, i wash my hair once a week and condition it (to restyle) a few times a week. i used to have oily hair with regular condtioners. i have thick, wavy hair and this is the only thing that brings out the curl and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dirty. also doesn&#x27;t break out my skin, for those of you that have that problem from other conditioners.</li>
    <li> love this product and it smells soooo good</li>
    <li> I noticed some folks are talking about Low-Poo too. Yes, No Poo is not for oily hair. The Curly Girl book tells us that too. Use Low-Poo. The stylist washed my hair w/No Poo today even tho I told her it would be too heavy and sure enough, way too heavy. PI don&#x27;t like the way it feels -- like conditioner needing to be rinsed out. Sshe also used Angel and some other leave in thing. Too much on the goopy side, and too much fragrance for me. plus I don&#x27;t like the smell of the products. I prefer fragrance free.  I personally don&#x27;t mind my frizzy curls. I like hair that doesn&#x27;t look wet, and curls that don&#x27;t look man-made. I have Boticelli plus wavy curls, plus oily. I get compliments on my hair all the time, when I don&#x27;t use product in it, and when I don&#x27;t use Deva Curl. I love the cutting method, not the products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off for a few years.  I have very curly, kinky, thick and coarse hair and have worn it long and short and everything in between for years.  I also have used many different products for years and always seem to come back to No Poo for the best cleansing for my hair.  My hair also feels moisturized before even using a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the shampoo that my hairdresser uses, i have curly hair and it&#x27;s the best shampoo I have ever used. I will continue to use this shampoo for a very long time</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair and a great price, would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Give it a try! you will like this over normal soapy/foamy shampoo! feel so much better on scalp! makes hair very soft too!</li>
    <li> I used to be like every other woman with naturally curly hair, switching shampoos and conditioners every few months and always looking for the perfect styling products.  Until, that is, I found Deva Curl.  My hair stylist (who also has curly hair) started carrying the Deva Curl line and recommended the products to me.  I was skeptical for sure, but I have been using Deva Curl No Poo, One Condition and AnGell for about two years now and I&#x27;m never going back!  \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; does not lather, as the name suggests, and feels more like conditioner.  But it will clean your hair!  I can&#x27;t speak to issues with oily hair, because my hair only gets oily when I don&#x27;t wash it for 2-3 days.  Although, \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; seems to cut through the oil in my hair on those rare occasions too.  Also, \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; allows you to wash your hair everyday without drying it out, because it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals in it.  Personally, my hair can&#x27;t be restyled after sleeping on it without washing and drying it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... you should be careful about what other styling products you use, because some styling products with synthetic components will remain in your hair and build up over time. (i.e. \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; cannot remove them from your hair).  Specifically, my hair stylist mentioned any product with silicone in it (like Frizz Ease Hair Serum).  So, avoid those products if you use \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot;!  I suspect that some people who had negative experiences with \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; were simply using the wrong styling products.  This really is a case of using the whole Deva Curl line, because the whole line of products really do work best together.  If you don&#x27;t want to use the whole line of products, try to stick with a natural line of styling products like Pureology, Abba, or Aveda.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best, especially when used with the DevaCurl system. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my curls anymore! This is a great price, as long as you don&#x27;t mind the big bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive personal care system I have ever purchased!&lt;br /&gt;I used Deva Curl Low Poo, One Conditioner and the Ultra Defining Gel in my morning shower. During the day I started to feel itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Three hours before my flight the following morning I got out of bed to find my face swollen and blaze red. I had a rash from head to toe!&lt;br /&gt;Allergic Contact Dermatitis! WooHoo. Lucky me!!! NO this has NEVER happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;To avoid a possible medical emergency on my 7 hour flight it was determined that my vacation should be cancelled - airfare, rental car, hotels etc.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of jetting off to vacation land I spent my morning in the ER to be a grateful recipient of a steroid shot.&lt;br /&gt;The week of vacation time was spent alternately trying to scratch off the top layer of skin and slathering on lotion to combat the itch.&lt;br /&gt;I think I can safely say that this product will never enter my home again.</li>
    <li> I had been a faithful user of Biolage&#x27;s Ultra Hydrating shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years. I liked how my hair felt but noticed that my hair started falling out. My hairdresser even noticed how thin my hair had become. She recommended No Poo for my wavy, frizzy hair and WOW what a difference! My hair stopped falling out and became thick and full again. I still struggle with frizz, but it&#x27;s not anywhere near as bad as it was before. It was odd getting used to, but I absolutely love how my hair feels when using this product. I am able to use it pretty much every day and I don&#x27;t notice any buildup. In fact when my hair is feeling gunky and gross from styling products, this is able to clean it up quite well while leaving it moisturized. I have tried other shampoos since using No Poo, but I always go back to it. My hair feels much better, and looks much better, using a product that doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
    <li> This took a while for me to get used to, having no lather.  I do feel that my hair and scalp are getting clean and my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be weighed down.  It also helps with the frizz factor that my curly hair has.  Good product, and buying a larger bottle is more economical.</li>
    <li> My hair became wavy after having my children so I&#x27;m fairly new to the products available.  A friend recommended the Deva Curl No Poo so I purchased the sample sizes (which have a good amount).  I have to say I really like what it does to my curls - soft and springy, and I haven&#x27;t found anything else yet to match that.  I have two problems with it and the conditioner however.  First, the No Poo smells like my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom: Dove soap &amp; artificial rose scent... not terrible, but not that nice, either.  The One Condition smells like a storage closet of cleaning products and candy hearts!  Also, less \\&quot;bad\\&quot; than \\&quot;weird\\&quot;.  The second problem is that if I use it more than twice in a row, my scalp gets a buildup and my hairline breaks out.  I have fairly oily skin so maybe it just can&#x27;t take it.  All in all, I will continue to use this product but only occassionally.  Will I continue to buy it?  I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about this cleansing conditioner but first off the scent is terrible! and my hair smelled like it all day, also it was a lot more drying then it should have been. After using WEN, which I loved, I ran out of it and figured I would try the DevaCurl to see if there was something I could purchase locally without having to order. Unfortunately I will be returning this product and stick to Wen for my long curly hair</li>
    <li> hi everyone that might read this...let me first start off by saying that the ingredients/quality of this cleanser (more like co-cleanser) are very good and anyone that is looking for something more &#x27;natural&#x27; should give this a try..but let me also make some other things clear:..if you have rather damaged/dry hair then this may not be for you...you see, because it is so light (the ingredients are natural and not &#x27;heavy&#x27; on your hair) this isn&#x27;t going to aid much in helping to rebuild or strengthen hair..but if you have hair that is considerably &#x27;normal/healthy&#x27; then you will probably find this an enjoyable cleanser...now real quick let me tell you my experience...as a background, I have curly hair (Caucasian) that is very dry/frizzy and very very fine...I am always on the hunt for something that would be nice to my curly hair...now my hair isn&#x27;t very curly, like its not corkscrew curls, just wavy with a few ringlets...now to the first impression: when I first used the cleanser, I rubbed it into my hair and scalp (like the instructions say)..the product made my hair itself very soft (like you would imagine since it has a creamy texture)...but for my scalp...wow...it might just be me, but there is something in this that made my hair fall out like nuts!! it just kept coming out loll...only in the shower though...now don&#x27;t be scared off, I&#x27;m pretty sure it was something like peppermint or another &#x27;invigorating oil&#x27; that irritated my scalp (I have kind of a sensitive scalp)...I cant be sure though exactly what it was...I used the matching conditioner afterward, and my hair wasn&#x27;t moisturized enough..(that has to do with the no silicones thing)...I tried it again a month or 2 later and it had the same effect...so youre probably wondering why I gave it 4 stars if I had a bad experience loll...well, im rating the product, not my experience...so in closing, this is a great product for someone with hair on the healthier side and if you try it, don&#x27;t worry about the hair-fall thing, since it might just happen to people with more sensitive scalps like myself...hope this helps, and have a nice day :)</li>
    <li> The strangest thing about this shampoo is that there is no lather/suds.  It does a great job on cleaning my hair but I must be carefully to rinse it really well.  Because you do not have to shampoo every day this size last months for me.  I find in the winter I still need to use some conditioner since I live in an area with dry heat.</li>
    <li> the only curl shampoo I use.</li>
    <li> Love Deva Curl--so nice to have this big bottle for my shower.</li>
    <li> Great product! I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the no lather but I love the way it makes my hair feel/look.</li>
    <li> Love the product inside, but pump does not work well.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but very pricey. I hope they will price it moderately so common people can use repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! So good for my wild curly hair!  I love that I can get it on Amazon and don&#x27;t have to go through my hairdresser friend.  And I love the big bottle.</li>
    <li> Okay product for my 4B hair, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
    <li> I have had thick, curly hair my whole life.  I&#x27;ve always believed that big frizzy hair was just my destiny unless I blow dried and iron it into submission.  I&#x27;ve tried a plethora of moisturizing shampoos, conditioners &amp; anti-frizz products and they never gave me defined, bouncy, soft curls.  It was either frizzy \\&quot;big hair\\&quot; or a flat stringy lifeless mess.  Then I started the \\&quot;Curly Girl Method\\&quot; along with the DevaCurl No-Poo cleanser.  I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; for about 4 weeks and I FINALLY love my hair!    I strongly recommend reading the Curly Girl Handbook by Lorraine Massey.  I found it really helpful in making the switch.  A few points to ensure success- READ all the ingredients in all of your other hair care products.  You MUST NOT use any silicones when you go no-poo.  These products will build up on your hair unless you use a harsh, sulfate based shampoo to remove them. here are a few of the silicone ingredients to avoid when going \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot;: Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Amodimethicone and Cyclomethicone. Also, massaging the product onto the scalp using your fingertips and a a circular motion really aids in the cleansing ability of the product.  I found that after learning the correct method, I used alot less of the product and it worked even better.    My hair is divine since I gave up harsh shampoo and I only wish I had done this years ago- loving my curls for the first time in my life!    EDITED TO ADD: I&#x27;m Caucasian.</li>
    <li> Love my DevaCurl.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without this or the conditioner.</li>
    <li> It is a bit weird to wash your hair with no foam, but it really works. I have a very thin and dry curly hair, and it uses to be very ugly, but now is much better.</li>
    <li> As an African American great products are not always easy to come by it has been difficult for me to find products that give me a soft smooth result at home like I receive at the salons. The Deva Curl brand does that for my hair which is 4C I enjoy the product and the shipping and condition of the product was great timing and in new condition. Thank you</li>
    <li> My local Target store is always sold out, so this is the most convenient way for me to buy it. Get the big bottle! It keeps my dry, long hair well hydrated.</li>
    <li> turns my hair into straw</li>
    <li> What a life changing product for regular or leave in use! Light, but thick enough to quell the frizz, smells great and changes the stexture of your curl in a positive way! Use w no poo conditioner when needed to reduce build up. Simp,y incredible and worth the cost as it is not full of alcohol, chemicals, or water. Lasts a while and it is a product uused daily by two people! Wotks on African Ametican or thick Italian hair.</li>
    <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this produt. I was skeptical at first, but my hair really loves this stuff! The one concern I have is that it&#x27;s hard to work the product up to the scalp. I have really thick, unrelaxed curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp as well as I would like. I may have to just work more product directly onto my scalp. But overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product and it really does amazing things for my curls.</li>
    <li> I have fine moderately curly hair that can look like a bad perm on a humid day. Deva Curl has helped sooo much. I love it and am very excited to turn my curls over to Deva!</li>
    <li> Best hair cleaner for my curls and no allergy problems!</li>
    <li> I found this a little heavy for my hair.  It also left my scalp feeling oily.  I can say that I did appreciate the fact that my hair was not dry as usual but this was too much.  My hair is thin, fine and can easily be worn curly or flat ironed to a sleek style and while it is dry from coloring and damage related to chronic illness and medications, this product was just more than it could tolerate.  If you have thicker or dryer hair than I do, this very well might work for you but I would recommend trying a travel size or something of that nature until you are certain.</li>
    <li> Switching from non-Deva Curl products to exclusively Deva Curl products has been like night and day for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, my hair was always flat, curls (I have 3a/b) wouldn&#x27;t bounce or have consistent  volume... and when I did nothing with my hair, I just had a straight up frizzy white girl afro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Deva Curl... It admittedly took a couple weeks for my hair to get used to. But once it did... oh man. My curls are shiny, they have loads of volume, and they hardly frizz anymore. Even when I don&#x27;t do anything with them, they still stay somewhat under control. I can go to bed with wet hair, and wake up looking like I just got done styling my hair. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest any of Deva Curl&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> Great and gentle on hair for clean hair without stripping. Perfect for color treated hair as well. My family enjoys all deva curl products</li>
    <li> I have been using the DevaCurl No-Poo, One Condition, and AnGEL for about two weeks and my hair is now drier, coarser, frizzier, and more disgusting than it has ever been in my ENTIRE life!!!  I don&#x27;t know how these products got such great reviews. Maybe the bottles I purchased are FAKE as some other reviewers have said.  All I know is that my hair looks awful and these products are terrible.  I would give these products 0 stars if I could.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype is about this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works the same as normal shampoo or conditioner. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I love everything about the Deva Curl system. It has totally changed the way I take care of my hair. It makes it look amazing!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this shampoo, and the price was less than the company was selling it for. This no poo shampoo have natural cleaning ingredients that does not strip your hair. I use it only once a month and it serves its purpose. If you are looking for a natural no poo shampoo without silicones, then this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> i cant say enough about this product. i&#x27;m addicted</li>
    <li> i have curly hair and when i found about devacurl i was in heaven! this is a complete line for curly hair/different types of curls.&lt;br /&gt;my hair feels soft, it looks healthy and i adore the way my curls look.&lt;br /&gt;the cleanser is gentle and the conditioner is very rich both smell really good.&lt;br /&gt;the gel and the other products of the line smell really good too.&lt;br /&gt;these are a MUST have for someone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Sure my hair looks better, but the rose scent is so strong, it woke me up at 3am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the point of the strong scent Deva? Are you trying to cover something up?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the DevaCurl and DevaCare products....No-Poo is by far my favorite. It is truly a cleansing conditioner...my hair feels clean yet nourished after every use. Honestly, I was disappointed by the DevaCare products; I do not recommend. I prefer the DevaCurl products.</li>
    <li> I tried this product about a year and a half ago, but I had to stop using it because it left my hair looking very oily.  After I switched to using the low-poo, I was able to move onto this product after about a month.  The low-poo was actually too drying for my hair, and I prefer this formula a lot more.  I have tried using conditioner to wash my hair, and this nourishes my hair a lot more.  I notice a big difference in the texture of my hair when I use this.  It&#x27;s a great product for anyone with curly hair, who wants to stop using sulfate shampoo. I ordered the big bottle because I don&#x27;t plan to ever go back to regular shampoo. I have tried hundreds of shampoos, and the no-poo works the best on my cherub curls.  If you can get past the initial period of scalp shock, you won&#x27;t regret using this product.  I love my hair now, and its largely due to the fact that I stopped using sulfate shampoos.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist with curly hair. Started using the about 10 months ago. At first my hair was less frizzy and the curl got better. Could go a couple of days without washing my hair. Now hair at scalp is oily. Hair is dull and frizzy and I get this Nasty odor behind my ears and on my scalp that won&#x27;t go away.  I have swapped to matrix cleansing cream for curly hair and their curl cream. My hair feels awesome, my shine is back and no bad smell on my scalp or ears.  I now get lots of compliments on my curl</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair or even natural waves, this product is amazing.  I don&#x27;t need conditioner with it because it cleanses without striping my hair with suds.  It is shiner, healthier and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine, but curly tresses.  I have used the product for three years - it doesn&#x27;t become ineffective over time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after being recommended the \\&quot;No-Poo\\&quot; at a Beauty First salon and also purchased the conditioner to match it. This is NOT for naturally oily hair! My hair is naturally wavy/curly, very thick and shiny. It&#x27;s fairly fine, not coarse whatsoever and frizzy depending on the weather.  I purchased DevaCurl hoping it would help my hair keep some of its moisture during the winter.. it is awful! I have been using it for three weeks and my hair looks dirty after every wash (and i&#x27;ve been using DevaCurl almost everyday). I used to use regular shampoo/conditioner and only had to wash my hair 3-4 times a week. With this product, my hair looks filthy after every shower!  I&#x27;m not a complainer, in fact I love trying new products, which is why I purchased this. However,  this is NOT for naturally oily hair! I do not recommend this and will not purchase it again. Using \\&quot;Low-Poo\\&quot; may have been a better choice but I will not spend the money on it again.</li>
    <li> My wife has worked hard to get her naturally curly hair to look great and this product has been a big part of that. She loves how the Deva products have helped her hair and I have to say that I agree. Her hair looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I were cursed with thick unmanageable curls.  My stylist recently introduced us to Deva Curls product and I&#x27;m so glad she did.  We use the shampoo, conditioner, angel and arcangel products.  Our hair doesn&#x27;t even need brushing now, just run our fingers through our hair and go!</li>
    <li> This shampoo does wonders for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  It makes her hair soft and tangle-free and it allows her curls to curl nicely.  This was an easy order and delivery process which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> If you have long or thick hair you may use more than you want to but you only have to wash your hair 1-3 times per week. This stuff cleanses, softens, and makes miserably curly hair more manageable...and living in South Florida, life as a frizzball is in the past! Hooray Deva Curl.</li>
    <li> I get wonderful curls when I use this shampoo.  I love it.</li>
    <li> my hair is long, fine and slightly wavy but has become dull and I used this at my sisters house and loved it, (she has curly thick hair) but with day to day use not seeing quite the same results.  still needing to add some conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells good, seems like it will last 2 months or so.</li>
    <li> As a naturally curly girl with long hair, I appreciate how well this product cleans and moisturizes my hair. I used to fear the stripping effects of other shampoos, but I know that when my hair starts to feel dry, it is time to &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and condition. I use Deva Curl No Poo and One Condition leave-in with Set it Free moisture spray and my hair is soft and controlled with awesome curls. This is my favorite combination of hair products. It also rinses out nicely so there is no midweek build-up. I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; unless my hair feels dry -  the exact opposite of what I used to experience. I used Abba products for years and while they are wonderful, there is no comparison here.</li>
    <li> No Poo Cleanser is fabulous! Only a little dab goes a long ways and my hair feels so soft after just the cleanser, then super soft after the conditioner!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time in 8 years last night. Did it always smell like Turkish roses? I don&#x27;t think it did, but I like the product. The smell of roses is a welcome new experience for hair, and there&#x27;s no build-up on my scalp; it feels pretty clean. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, however, because of the price. I paid $16 for a 16 oz. bottle at my local flea market. I do like it, though, and I do recommend it to those serious about the Curly Girl method of hair care.</li>
    <li> great for little kids and adults alike with curly hair. Leaves my daughters hair smooth and shiny with no tangles. I personally like the scent, but my husband doesn&#x27;t, so that will depend on your taste.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo because there is no lather to strip my hair. My curly hair is in better shape then it has ever been!!!</li>
    <li> cleans pretty good for no lather. can go longer between shampoos with this vs. regular shampoo. just more costly.</li>
    <li> My haristylist turned me on to this years ago &amp; I never looked back. I feel like my scalp can breathe after using this and love how gentle it is on my curls. Suds are for sponges!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Anytime I buy a product over and over I know how much I love it.  This shampoo has NO suds and cleans my hair (very curly hair) with just one washing every few days - leaves it in perfect condition - looks great from day 1.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Excellent price!</li>
    <li> My hair smells clean and is clean from this no-poo (meaning no suds) hair &amp; scalp cleanser.  I think it contributes to my hair health, which is pretty good.  It&#x27;s lustrous and nice.  What more can we ask?</li>
    <li> Basically, No-Poo is a light conditioner with astringent properties to clean scalp and hair without surfactants. does not foam/bubble. if you have fine, wavy hair, this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m a fan of Devacurl Low-Poo (low surfactant shampoo), the No-poo has no surfactants whatsoever. This causes limp, greasy hair at the crown/bangs (where you need volume), and actually caused acne all along my hairline due to the residual. I was going crazy for weeks trying to figure out where it was coming from-- after careful evaluation it turned out to be the no-poo. Again, this would happen if you use any conditioner as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have heavy, curly, thick hair that needs taming and gets dried out if you wash it every day, this is a fantastic product--it doesn&#x27;t overstrip and has a great detangling power that doesn&#x27;t need much conditioner afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you have fine, wavy hair and are acne-prone, forget it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Stopped using shampoo over 2 yrs. ago and my hair is so much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;The price is much cheaper thru Amazon then buying it at Ulta.</li>
    <li> I know I know a review for shampoo. Totally weird. But this deserves a review and I NEVER write reviews. I have been doing the no poo straight (no conditioner no styling products nothing) for about 2 weeks now and I am finally starting to love my curls. My hair has been dyed. Cut. Straightened. Hot rolled. You name it I&#x27;ve done it and I thought I&#x27;d never get my hair back but it is!! My curls are soft and bouncy. I normally have a very dry flaky scalp. This has cleared it up. My hair stays soft and wonderful for a few days. I wash my hair twice a week. If you have curly hair you really shouldn&#x27;t wash it every day it dries out. ANYWAY after the first wash I was skeptical. No conditioner? I ALWAYS use a ton of conditioner but okay I&#x27;ll try it. Boy was I shocked at how soft and supple my hair was the next morning. And the morning after that. Wash. Go to bed with wet hair. Wake up with great curls and less frizz than I have ever seen. Why are you still reading this?! Go buy it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the worst smelling product I have ever used on my hair. Totally disappointing.  I thought it would smell ok considering that the styling cream smells wonderful.  Needless to say I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> THE BEST # 1 NON LATHERING CLEANSING CONDITIONER ON THE MARKET ! BETTER THEN WEN AND HAIR RULES CHEAPER PRICE !&lt;br /&gt;I WAS A BIT SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BECAUSE I WAS A RAVING FAN OF WEN AND THEN &amp;#34;HAIR RULES&amp;#34; !&lt;br /&gt;AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF FAILED PURCHASES AND UNSUCCESSFUL ORDERS FOR &amp;#34;HAIR RULES&amp;#34; !!!&lt;br /&gt;I DECIDED TO GIVE &amp;#34;DEVA CURL &amp;#34;NO POO&amp;#34; A TRY AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID !!!&lt;br /&gt;DEVA CURL NO POO CLEANSER WAS NOT ONLY CHEAPER BUT , AS IT TURNS OUT WAS EVEN &amp;#34;BETTER&amp;#34; THEN ALL THE OTHER NON SUDS-LATHERING CLEANSING CONDITIONERS !!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT , I&#x27;M SOLD !  WILL CONTINUE TO BUY !!!&lt;br /&gt;CAN EASILY FIND IN ALL STORES AND ON LINE !!!</li>
    <li> Deva Curl No Poo leaves my hair smooth and easy to manage.  Making the transition from lots of lather to no lather was \\&quot;interesting\\&quot; but the end results are GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 times now. The first time I used it I thought it was a miracle. Now, after a few uses, my hair felt exactly the same as it does with any other shampoo. In fact, as I was rinsing it after shampooing with this, my hair felt kind of \\&quot;dry\\&quot; in the shower, just as it would after regular shampoo. The first time I used this, it was the first time my hair did NOT feel that way. But, it seems it was only a miracle the first time I used it. The only thing I can think of is the first and second times I used it, I styled with the B&#x27;Leave in product but then the next time I used a sample of curl creme from the deva line that they gave me when I purchased. Hmmmm.</li>
    <li> Now, I am a licensed professional and always review products honestly as an unbiased expert on product knowledge. With that being said, this product is amazing! I gave it 4 stars only because of the expensive price tag. For my curly clients or dry haired clients, this is the shampoo I reach for. Not only is it sulphate free, but it cleanses the hair gently while hydrating the hair, smoothing the cuticle, and giving you beautiful smooth and gorgeous hair. BOOM! Pair it with the conditioning mask and you have amazing, smooth and healthy hair. No regrets purchasing this amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro, Owner of Glamour Couture, Pa, NJ, NY</li>
    <li> I love this product! I find that it works best if used in combination with the Devacurl styling products. I have short, fine curly hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a recommendation from a blogger whose daughter has ringlet curls like my daughter. I am clueless with curly hair and was washing my daughter&#x27;s hair with her baby wash because I didn&#x27;t know any better. This no-poo has been a total game changer! No more frizz or tangles, just shiny, bouncy curls! We are in love! I wish it was tear-free, but you can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not really supposed to be using this because I have stick-straight hair. However, it is very overprocessed and was frizzy due to the damage I had done to it. I had been using Wen, which I do like, but it is super expensive and I was looking for a good alternative. I found it because this stuff works pretty much as good as Wen or maybe better. I found that when using this my hair gets clean, and my scalp produces much less oil (I can go longer without washing it, which is good when you have damaged hair). I like the smell but if you didn&#x27;t like lavender you probably wouldn&#x27;t like it. Since the price is so great and the results good, I&#x27;ll keep buying it! The one thing I like about Wen over this is that it doesn&#x27;t have the amount of peppermint that Wen does (which feels good on my scalp). For the price difference I&#x27;ll stick with this considering the Wen would be like 80 dollars for the same amount of shampoo.</li>
    <li> Truly changed the texture of my hair!  I have very thick, relatively coarse hair and after just a few weeks, this remarkable product tamed my hair and made it so much more manageable and silky.  Have used it for 3 years now and still love it.</li>
    <li> I love how moisturized and clean my hair feels! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair or scalp down like Wen does. Plus it&#x27;s much friendlier on the budget.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is a great price. I live near the source- \\&quot;Devachan Salon\\&quot; in NY, NY but their products are cheaper online than in their store! who could resist?</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves my scalp feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and deva curl products were recommended  by my stylist.  All I have to say is gross! I felt like I had wax in my hair. It felt heavy and weighed down. I will never purchase  this product again. Happy for those who love it, It was horrible on my hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the manufacturer or the seller is to blame, I only know that this is NOT the product that I&#x27;ve been using happily for the past ten years.  This is supposed to be &amp;#34;zero lathering.&amp;#34;  Unfortunately, however, the shampoo lathered, so there&#x27;s definitely &amp;#34;poo&amp;#34; in this product.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to, no lathering up.  But if you have curly or wavy hair it is worth it.  When using this product, my wavy hair is actually curly.  And I have noticed when using this and the once curl conditioner, I can use my normal curl creme (not a devacurl product) and scrunch when wet and go.  It will dry a nice wavy, almost curly beachy look.  And if I use my diffuser and actually dry it, it is downright curly.  Only draw back is how much of the shampoo you use.  I recommend buying a larger quantity bottle of the no poo cleanser and a smaller one curl conditioner.  It has worked great for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Deva Curl No Poo for years and it is a good truly sulfate free shampoo. I had never purchased the large size before, but I will again, as the pump is nice. I searched ingredients for a long time looking for true sulfate free shampoos before I found this one, and even though it is lather free and even smells unusual, I know my hair is clean and not dried out. The most important thing to me is that my hair used to knot up very badly when washing with traditional shampoos, and I ended up spending so much time trying to detangle without breaking and pulling out handfuls of hair. Even the most vigorous shampooing with Deva Curl No Poo -- no knots. I will definitely continue to buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best no lather shampoo. It is non drying and leaves your hair clean without frizz.</li>
    <li> Never shampooing again!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, curly hair and most products either weigh down my hair so much it has trouble keeping its curl or dry it out so much it gets frizzy. Before DevaCurl I had the most luck with Redken Fresh Curl shampoo, conditioner and curl boost spray as well as L&#x27;Oreal Leave-In Conditioner for curls, but even that combo would dry it out a bit too much. My stylist recommended the DevaCurl product line &amp; I am so grateful. It is very moisturizing without being heavy &amp; even the most frizz-prone bits of my hair have spiraled into perfect curls. I tried using some DevaCurl combined with the above-mentioned other brand products I already used &amp; that was an improvement, but once I switched to exclusively DevaCurl stuff every aspect of my hair &amp; curls improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this stuff works wonders! My curls are very happy with me now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It took a little getting used to at first since it doesn&#x27;t foam up like standard shampoo. But sooo worth it! I won&#x27;t use anything else now! No-Poo cleans my hair without drying it out. Both my hair and my scalp have gotten healthier since I started using it.  Now, when I try using other shampoos, I can really tell the difference. I highly recommend trying this product for anyone with curly or wavy hair. I recommend trying it for at least 2 weeks before deciding if you like it. Not only has my hair and scalp gotten healthier, but I also am able to go longer without washing it now. Thanks DevaCurl!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!!! Absolutely love the way it makes my hair feel. So soft &amp; silky. Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I have used Deva No-Poo consistently  for at least a year now, and it is by far the best way to cleanse my curly hair.  I am Hispanic and my hair is fine, with a medium-to-tight curl pattern, and it is color treated.  Using regular &amp;#34;sulfate -free/ silicone-free&amp;#34; shampoos are still quite harsh in cleaning my hair---it always looks and feels really dry, even with a leave-in conditioner to follow.  However, my hair looks hydrated, is clean, and the curls look much better after using Deva No-Poo.  I love the fresh, slight mint scent as well.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best way to wash your curls. This wonderful, cream based cleanser gets the gunk out without stripping your hair of what it needs. If you are a curly haired girl, you have gotta get this!</li>
    <li> I use DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser every other time I wash my hair. The other times I use the Low-Poo Cleasnser. Deva Products are the best for Curly Girls.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived I found it was not wrapped correctly in the shipping box so it leaked all over. Amazon&#x27;s customer service was excellent and they quickly processed a refund for me.  However, I did notice that this product does not have the same fresh scent of the no poo I bought at the salon. I had some of the salon product left and did a smell test and found this online product does not have that same pleasant minty scent.  It almost smells like old perfume or that it has been altered. Beware shoppers, I suggest the Deva website for authentic products. The website also lists salons in your area. I am not affiliated with the company.</li>
    <li> Great product and part of the Deva Care line of hair care products for curly hair.  You have to get used to the idea that you can have clean hair with no bubbles.  It is very moisturizing, which curly hair needs.  It is meant to be used with the rest of the product line, for example conditioner.</li>
    <li> I started using Devacurl products last July after a friend recommended them to me and after reading &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; by the founder of the company. It takes some getting used to not having the lather but my hair has never looked so good! I recommend using it with the One Condition conditioner and the light defining gel for a finished look. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Hated it.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.  My scalp itched.  And my husband said it smelled bad.</li>
    <li> DevaCurl No-Poo cleanser is a great product, it cleans you hair really well and I plan on order it again.</li>
    <li> I have found the BEST product on the market out there for my very, very, very, kinky/curly hair.  Thank you Deva Curl!</li>
    <li> My curly &amp; thin hair loves it and my husband&#x27;s hair (thick hair) too. The small is gorgeous and &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; (not a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell).&lt;br /&gt;I was on the low-poo before, I didn&#x27;t particularly notice a difference but the no-poo does make a difference compared to classical shampoo. My hair seems stronger, less aggressed. My sensitive scalp appreciate it too. After years and years of Head&amp;Shoulder shampoo, my hubby still had dandruffs... now the problem is solved!&lt;br /&gt;Only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;: it&#x27;s pricey &amp; I&#x27;m thinking about making my own no-poo.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter in law who has VERY curly hair. She loved it! She asked for another bottle.</li>
    <li> I have gradually come to terms with the fact that my hair is curly. After spending years blowing out my hair and straightening it only to have it poof up with a hint of moisture in the air I decided to give up and embrace the curl. I&#x27;ll admit I did not know how to care for curly hair and started doing some research. On a recommendation I looked into deva curl. After trying pain co washing for a few weeks I finally splurged on the deva curl. I have never bought into the hype that the more expensive the product is the better it is but in this case there is no comparison between normal drug store brands and Deva Curl. My curls are more defined and almost completely frizz free, which I never thought possible. I am currently using the no poo, one condition and either the ultra or light defining gel. While the products themselves make a major difference knowing how to use them properly produces even better results. I was using them for a few weeks with decent results but after watching some videos about how to use the three step and having it explained in person as a hair model at the Deva Curl academy my hair looks great. Not only are the before and after pictures on the web legit they are easily repeatable at home. While I can&#x27;t say this is the best curl product out there it does work and I would suggest anyone unhappy with their curly hair to give it a try or look into other curl friendly products. I&#x27;ve seen some complaints about the smell of the product. It does have silght chemical, I&#x27;m in a salon type smell I actually liked it. You may want to try with a smaller size or go with the deva care line if you think this may be an issue for you.</li>
    <li> my hair feels really soft after I wash with this cleanser. It has help me keep my color longer and my hair more shinny</li>
    <li> Always the best hair products out there! I&#x27;ve never in my life experienced anything negative when using Deva Curl products. I&#x27;m in love with this conditioner, I just tried it after using the Deva Curl One Condition. And, let me tell you, Must Have for you curly headed folks!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I had been out for a while now and had forgotten how nice it is. Smells great and is so nourishing.</li>
    <li> Previous to this shampoo I used a shampoo that sometimes did not produced any suds. The shampoo was not a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; shampoo, and I don&#x27;t think there was anything wrong with it.  I believe it was because of all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I had on my hair and in my scalp. So, I expected the feel of  this &amp;#34;No Poo&amp;#34; to be what I felt when I didn&#x27;t get suds from the other shampoo. It was not the case at all!  I am not reviewing the quality of this shampoo over another, although I do like it. I am reviewing that I love the feel. It was not at all what I expected no poo to be like. It is so creamy and it feels so nice to be swirling this cream in my hair.</li>
    <li> My poor husband.  His head always smelled dirty by the end of the day no matter what he started the day shampooing with.  (He tried everything from suave to heavily perfumed axe like stuff to brown soap. )  our pillow cases needed to get changed a few times a week to keep the funk away.  This was a game changer. I started using this on my long curly hair.  He has very short straight hair.  He shampoos with this and his hair looks good and smells good and we no longer have the dirty head smell anymore.</li>
    <li> While I admit to sometimes missing the satisfying feeling of a good soapy lather while shampooing, I can attest (after years of using this stuff) that it cleans well, without stripping oil from my dry, curly hair. I have also not had any issues with dandruff since switching to this product, and it had been a minor issue in the past. It smells good, too, without being too perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended only washing my hair 1-2/x a week which seemed infrequent, but my hair is clean and much healthier. She also suggested concentrating only on washing the scalp, and this has worked for me. Most of the time I shower, I either leave my hair alone completely, or just condition it. The big bottle lasts me nearly a year, so it&#x27;s also saved me a lot of money on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re mixed-race, or simply have wild and wonderful curly hair, I would suggest giving it a try!</li>
    <li> Smells the same but feels watered down.</li>
    <li> Used this product on my curls for years. No lather but no need.  Just massage scalp w it and let product run thru hair when rinse. Doesn&#x27;t deplete oil in hair which is the key to beautiful curls</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for maintaining moisture while gently cleansing between styling. Unlike many no poos, it does a sufficient job of eliminating light dirt or buildup from the scalp. The peppermint does a great job of stimulating the scalp. Also, it is so moisturizing and creamy, it has great slip for detangling in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Diva Curl products for about 2 years already.  No Poo doesn&#x27;t foam, but it cleans exceptionally well.  Absolutely stops curly hair from feeling dry and brittle.  The scent of this shampoo is clean and lovely.</li>
    <li> I loved it! Makes my hair feel wonderful! Saves me loads of time. Looks great and makes me feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to it, but once you learn how it really works, it REALLY WORKS! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> love this no poo. it does not lather but my hair and scalp feels clean.</li>
    <li> It worked just like the rest of the time...this will be my 3rd bottle I used and my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> This review goes for the ultra creamy daily conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my life, I&#x27;ve been embarrassed about my hair. It&#x27;s been too wild and unruly to wear down even in front of my closest friends and family. I was bullied in middle school about my hair (the one period in my life when I wore it down naturally every day because it was too short to put in a pony tail). The only time I ever wore my hair down was when I straightened all curls out of it, and even then, I was afraid one curl might spring back into place and all would be lost. I was afraid to look in the mirror when I wore my hair down, afraid of the frizz and curls that reminded me that I wasn&#x27;t and could never be truly pretty. And even when I straightened my hair, I didn&#x27;t really like it, because I didn&#x27;t look like myself and somehow I found that hurtful in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, a guy I was dating asked why I never wore my hair down. I couldn&#x27;t really explain it. He begged to see it down and I just shook my head and said no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It broke my heart, because I felt like I was hiding a part of myself--not just from him but from everyone I cared about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the curly girl handbook a few days later, and never used shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only hair products I use are this no-poo cleanser in addition to the conditioner and light gel that comes in the same line. I blot my hair dry with an old T-shirt. I do not brush or comb my hair (except with my fingers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has improved drastically. The thing that I never understood was that curly hair IS beautiful. The key is not to get rid of the curl, but define the curl so that it isn&#x27;t hidden by frizz. This is what DevaCurl accomplishes. It accentuates the curl and eliminates frizz so that your hair can be as beautiful as it was meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of this review may have sounded a little silly/cliche. But I honestly feel this way. Devacurl products allow me to be who I really am. I will never straighten my hair again because that is a way of hiding a part of myself that I now realize is beautiful. It&#x27;s incredible how many times I&#x27;ve shocked people: &amp;#34;Wow, I didn&#x27;t know you had curly hair,&amp;#34; they all say. Simply because I always wore my hair in a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you want my advice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop hiding yourself from the world. Let your hair down.</li>
    <li> Makes the most out of thin wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I switched to Deva Curl from Wen. What a difference. My hair stays fresher longer. I wash my wavy hair only twice a week now. Probably could go a week if I really wanted to. Deva Curl products are the only ones I will ever use.</li>
    <li> I used this today for the first time. I have been doing cowashing with conditioner do I&#x27;m use to the no suds theory. I do like how this made my hair look, however the smell is WAY too strong. I washed my hair six hours ago and still smell like a French whore house. It&#x27;s horrible and I&#x27;m taking it back. I did like the small of the low poo formula. The one condition isn&#x27;t bad either. I use the low poo, one condition and ultra hold gel and I like the results. I thought I would branch out and try more devacurl because I&#x27;m using suave conditioner as a cowash once week and I use the low poo twice a week. It&#x27;s just not doing well though. The other product I was trying to branch out with is mister right, it also stinks.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I use. My hair is super curly and normal shampoos make it dry and coarse. This shampoo makes my hair feel clean without losing any moisture or causing damage. LOVE.</li>
    <li> My cousin told me about the Deva Curl products, when I started wearing my hair curly. I love the fact that it is a healthy product. No parabens, sulfates and silicone free. It&#x27;s very gentle on the hair. I use it with the Deva Curl One Conditioner! First time in all the years that my husband and I have been together that he mentioned how good my hair smells!</li>
    <li> Originally got this product for a friend with curls (who loves it) but decided to try it myself (I have straight hair).  Made my hair very soft and shiny (my hair is usually dry with split ends), and has a nice scent.  Takes some getting used to (not having the lather), but don&#x27;t let that deter you from using this awesome product.</li>
    <li> No poo, no frizz, and it&#x27;s fun to say. I run around trying to make everyone else use it.  Yes, I love it that much.  I do have curly hair.  But everyone can benefit from not putting harsh shampoo on their hair. I got this for my mom and my dad used it one day and he called me and said that for the first time in 30 years his scalp wasn&#x27;t flaking and itching.  So, there you go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using No-Poo for years, first at the Devachan Salon and then hunting for it it stores, more of which now carry it, but it&#x27;s nice to  be able to get it on Amazon. Instead of stripping my hair like shampoo, it leaves it feeling soft and conditioned.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> No-poo is the best! My mom introduced me to this as one of the first sulfate-free shampoos. I use this when I style my naturally wavy hair curly, with the DevaCurl Light Defining Gel. I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with it but I often do. So often you have to build hair back up from shampooing, using products to get it back to that shiny, easy-to-manage condition, but No-Poo cleanses your hair without removing all of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; stuff. Also love the large bottle and pump, really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Absolute best shampoo investment. I can tell the difference in the softness of my hair after only one week. I absolutely love the way it brings my hair to life. It was a bit pricey but it is worth every cent. TRUST ME. This is the first time I ever rate an amazon purchase because I have never been more satisfied with a delivery product.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo in the world for curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have already used this product and I love it, that&#x27;s why I got such a big size. It really helps my curls and keeps my hair feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  It left a residue in my hair after a few washings and I had to start using something else.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to because there is no amount of suds in your hair.  When used the way it was explained in the book, &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34;, it is a good product.  Hair and scalp are left really clean but without the residue of most &amp;#34;shampoos&amp;#34;.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  Cleans my hair, doesn&#x27;t make it frizz.  Win win.  I use with the One Conditioner and the Angel.</li>
    <li> Only Deva Curl products for this girl&#x27;s curly hair...especially the No-Poo! Nothing else touches these locks!</li>
    <li> I love this product, worth the price, thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, somewhat coarse, hair that is also color treated blonde.  I blow dry and flatiron my hair about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  For a long time I thought it didn&#x27;t like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn&#x27;t found the right product to style it. Up until recently I was using (and loved)a Livingproof No Friz product for curly/wavy hair, but then they seemed to have discontinued the one I was using.  I thought about switching to something else in their line but since I was also annoyed that they discontinued their largest size (having thick, long-ish hair, I&#x27;m all about buying in bulk), I decided to keep my options open.  I discussed it with an employee at Sephora who also had wavy hair.  Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I&#x27;d be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I&#x27;d like DevaCurl better.  Initially I wasn&#x27;t keen on switching my shampoo and conditioner since I&#x27;d finally found a system that worked (I&#x27;ve been using Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel 2x a week to counteract brassiness, and Davines Oi the rest of the time for moisture).  But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  So I figured, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  If it didn&#x27;t work out, I could always return it.    So I ended up purchasing the [[ASIN:B000NE6QP6 DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser, 945 ml / 32 oz]], [[ASIN:B000HJ4IPW Deva Devacurl One Condition Conditioner, 12 Ounce]], [[ASIN:B006K26D9E Devaconcepts DevaCurl Styling Cream, 5.1 Oz]], and [[ASIN:B003E0Z3JQ Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz]].    I&#x27;ve been using them for a week and I absolutely love this system.  My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  My waves stay putall day and look beautifully defined.  I&#x27;ve also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair still looks great even straight so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.  From reading other reviews here it sounds like I might need to use a clarifying shampoo every so often to reduce build up, but for now this seems fine, especially since my hair is naturally dry and when I wear it straight actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days.    So far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.</li>
    <li> Deva products are wonderful for curly hair. Make curls relax just a little, cuts down on frizz and adds moisture to hair.</li>
    <li> I am a curly girl and I have been using this product for years. It makes my hair feel clean and smell great!</li>
    <li> I love DevaCurl products.  My curls have never been happier.  I have been using the no-poo for a couple of years now, and my hair retains more moisture, which means better curl form and way less frizz.  Love these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this no poo for over a year and my curls love it! Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased the large container because it came with a pump, however, the pump and cap were so damaged upon arrival, I had to replace them. The product is great.</li>
    <li> So far I like how my hair is curling and I use it on my grandson too.</li>
    <li> Love it! so happy I bought it and received it quick!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and it helps so much with my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s very course, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even have curly hair and use this stuff, makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> We love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it in conjunction with the Deva Daily Conditioner and The Deva Light Defining Gel and my hair has never looked or felt better. I have long, thick, permed hair and this stuff does wonders. It was good at first but the more you use it the better it gets. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. Using a no-lather shampoo takes some getting used to, but this one is great. It smells great and keeps my naturally wavy hair light and bouncy. I find I use more of this than I would normal shampoo, so the bigger bottle is great</li>
    <li> I love these products for my curly hair.  They are always shipped quickly and are a good price compared to salons.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  I have fine curly hair that has taken me years to learn how to care for.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the Deva No Poo.  Like most curly girls, I have tried countless products trying to find the perfect one.  I keep coming back to the Deva No Poo.  It leaves my hair feeling clean, without being stripped.  One key to feeling clean with a cleansing conditioner has a lot to do with other products that you put on your hair.  Many silicone based products need real shampoo to remove them from your hair or you may start to get a build up.</li>
    <li> Love all the DEVA Curl products</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for curly hair.  I won&#x27;t use any product that lathers in my hair -- the lathering agent is unnecessary and dries out hair.  There&#x27;s no need for it, except that most people like having suds in their hair or need the suds to be convinced their hair is getting clean.  I don&#x27;t need that -- just clean my hair, using as few drying ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works to that effect.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2+ years, and I barely need any curl-defining product anymore, so healthy are my curls and so little is my frizz.  This is the only shampoo I&#x27;d recommend if you have curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried too many curly hair products to count, and this is by far the best shampoo for curly hair I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Great price! Only shampoo I use for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is my all time holy grail favorite creme cleanser and I will always have a bottle of this in my shower. Cleanses and conditions in one fell swoop, I love the smell so clean and refreshing. I will never stop using this amazing product. Buy it if you have curly hair, or even straight and dry hair!!</li>
    <li> Best products on the planet for curly or wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Nice product, broken dispenser</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva Curl faithfully for almost a year but I&#x27;ve been purchasing it at a local shop.  Having now found it on Amazon for around 40% less, I purchased it and I am so disappointed.  It is NOT the real Deva Curl.  My hair color is now fading quickly, unlike when I purchased it locally.  My hair dresser noticed immediately that my color isn&#x27;t lasting like it had been.  I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working at all any more.  I am so disappointed that I got such low quality knock off merchandise over Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent for 4a and 4b hair. Hair really feels clean after.</li>
    <li> Suds from other shampoos is like dish washing soap.. it leaves hair dry and frizzy.. this cleanser has no soap in it so your hair is left soft and frizz free. This is the only cleanser I have used for 3 years.</li>
    <li> i am using it but its not working on my hairs. my hair are still falling .  i try to do my best for any kind a care.</li>
    <li> I love this product only brand of shampoo I use for my curly hair</li>
    <li> Love the price, love the customer service. Great product, helps define my curls without drying my hair out.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well.  I use it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and my hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> excellent!! I love it! everything arrived i´n proper condition!!</li>
    <li> At first it was weird using a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather but after using it for a few weeks it works great and I love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. It&#x27;s intended to hydrate  frizzy, curly hair but it works great on straight hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I started dyeing my hair in middle school so it got very damaged over the years. I started using Deva Curl and it made a huge difference. I am no longer stripping my hair of natural oils with shampoos full of sulfate. It helped my hair get strong and healthy. I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry or style it. I jump out of the shower and it air dries perfectly. It&#x27;s smooth and silky; I don&#x27;t even use a brush to detangle it, I use my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;ve used it on long and short hair&lt;br /&gt;2. My hair is medium thickness and straight and there is A LOT of it.&lt;br /&gt;3. I use this at least 4 times a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it&#x27;s a huge bottle and lasts forever; it has a minty smell to it so you feel extra clean; your hair is super smooth and silky&lt;br /&gt;Cons: you must wash it out completely or it will look a bit creamy/greasy at the roots. Also, if you use it on straight hair IT WILL be extra hydrating and can make your hair a bit heavy and flat. If you&#x27;re going for a voluminous look, don&#x27;t use it. I don&#x27;t have to use my straightening iron when I use this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Deva products for curly hair for about 6 years now, and they are phenominal!  To top it off, I have been having my hair done by a Deva certified hair stylist in my local area, and she has also taught me how to get the most from these products.  All of the products are natural, and do not have \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; or any crazy chemicals.</li>
    <li> Ok, wow.  Seriously, WOW!  My hair is naturally curly, or at least it used to be.  I used to have beautiful soft loose ringlets, but my hair slowly lost it&#x27;s curl and got quite frizzy.  I attributed it to getting older (44) and greyer, and I assumed my dyed hair was dry, even though I never used a hair dryer or flat iron.  I tried just about every shampoo on the market for curly hair, from $2 to $15 a bottle, looking for something to bring my curls back.  I then decided I would not take this anymore! I had naturally curly hair- that doesn&#x27;t just go away without a real reason, so I started to research.  I found the Deva brand, and first tried the low-poo along with One Condition conditioner and thought it wasn&#x27;t bad; my hair looked better.  After I used that bottle I went for the No Poo, and WOW.  My soft ringlets are back!  I&#x27;ve used this for one straight week and I will never use anything else again.  Each night, I use a decent amount of no-poo in the shower and scrub my scalp.  Rinse and put in the One Condition and let it sit.  At the end of my shower I rinse it off and let my hair air dry.  I can comb through my wet hair without one tangle now.  In the morning all I need is a little bit of water and Deva Curl \\&quot;Mister Right\\&quot; and I&#x27;m done, with fabulous ringlets that I can&#x27;t believe are back!  As one poster said, these are not inexpensive products, but one of the few shampoos on the market that are sulfate free and really do work, especially in conjunction with the other products in their line.  I&#x27;ll gladly give up one coffee from Dunkin Donuts a day to save the money I need for these products to have hair like this.  Thank you Deva Curl!!!  I urge everyone with curly hair to try it.</li>
    <li> I like the FACT that there is no drying chemicals in this product. I take a while getting use to no subs. My hair is dry and curly. No- Poo Cleanser and the who line make my hair soft, shiny  and manageable. With the 32oz is a savings</li>
    <li> Switched from DevaCare Low- Poo (orange colored one) to this and it was definatley a mistake !! It took me awhile to figure out it was giving me dandruff which I have never ever had before !! Beside it smells awful and feels like its harsh even though its not suppossed to be.</li>
    <li> Has made my hair so much healthier, I will never again use another product. Recommended for all you wavy/curly haired people</li>
    <li> I wish this product had been invented 25 years ago!  My hair has never been so soft and healthy looking.  I used to just blow dry my hair straight because it never looked good curly - it was essentially a big frizzy mess.  Now it is soft with nicely defined curls.  For new users, you need to give it at least two weeks before you see results.  Regular shampoo dries out curly hair and it takes several uses of Deva Curl before you see a difference.  I wear my hair curly several days a week now and it is so nice to have the option.  It is also much better for my hair to not be blow drying it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy wavy hair.  This product makes my hair feel clean and it smells amazing.  I love the no-lather.  It makes my hair curl when shower at night and go to sleep with it wet.  It also looks great when I blow dry straight.  I use the No Poo with the One Condition conditioner.</li>
    <li> Why is Deva Curl so much better than any other curly hair product out there? I am not normally one to spend this much on hair products. I was introduced to the Deva Curl line at a salon, and was amazed at how frizz-free and soft my hair was for days after. I finally decided to overcome my reservations and invest in the no-poo, conditioner and gel, and now it&#x27;s hard to imagine going back to any other products. I looked around a bit online and this 32 ounce bottle on Amazon was the lowest price I could find. For reference, I have ringlets that are prone to frizz and need a lot of moisture.</li>
    <li> Always a consistent product, my hair smells good and keeps the frizzies away.My hair is also very shiny if I follow the Deva curl way of drying my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Deva products before, so I know about the product itself and really like it. The reason for 4 stars was it arrived with product that had leaked from the top of the dispenser, perhaps during shipping?</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for all hair, and especially curly hair. My hair has never been so healthy looking or soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: If you are used to putting products in your hair, you will probably need to cut way back. This stuff doesn&#x27;t have sulfates/sulfites/etc. so you don&#x27;t get that foamy lather, and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair. This is a *good* thing. However, if you&#x27;re used to normal shampoos, and you use product with this, then your hair might feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and purchased this product to get a little more curl into it.  My hair was so flat after using this and the conditioner and gel that it looked like I used a flat iron.  I could not believe it. Tried for three days. Each day got worse.  I will never use again. Not sure if this is a fake or not. Just horrible.</li>
    <li> We have officially been converted. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! A little goes a long way so this will last months. This will not get a lather but don&#x27;t be worried your hair will love you for using this. Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I thought I was making a great decision buying this conditioning cleanser but I was very disappointed with the results. I have long wavy/curly that is at times hard to manage so I need to make sure I use good products with little to no harmful chemicals. I made sure I read all the ingredients and the reviews this product had before buying, and realized that even though there are no harsh chemicals there was no difference in my hair. My hair became so rough and dehydrated. It felt as it would with a cheap shampoo! Strands of my hair started falling out as I was trying to detangle my hair and I grew so concerned that I washed the product out as quickly as I could. I wouldn&#x27;t even try and fix the hydration problem with the deva curl conditioner. I will definitely stay as far away as I could from these products. My only advice would be try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Just one of the steps in my hair care routine with DevaCurl.  It took some getting used to not having lots of sudsy lather in the wash step, but the No Poo makes my hair very soft without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> We are all used to the foaming of shampoo right? Well this product does kind of make you wonder at first if it&#x27;s really workiing because of no foam or lather. I&#x27;ve now been using this product for years and it&#x27;s so good for your hair, especially color treated hair. I highly recommend any of the Deva Curl products.</li>
    <li> Too harsh for my hair!  I bought this to try when I first started the curly girl method.  I don&#x27;t really like it, because it always leaves my hair feeling dry and coarse.  I much prefer aloe or a lightweight conditioner for scalp cleansing.</li>
    <li> I love the DevaCurl products. I always used products my hair stylist recommended and my hair looked good. But in the last eight months or so, a lot of my hair started falling out and it just looked limp and frizzy no matter what I did. I went to Sephora around Christmas and they recommended DevaCurl. I tried it and I really like what it does to my hair. My curls have definition without frizz and it somehow makes it look like I have more hair than I really do. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the scent. But I can live with that because the product itself works great.</li>
    <li> I have extremly thick and waivy/curly hair. Devacurl calms my hair, makes it more curky and more managable. Have been using it for 2 years now; even take it with me when I travel overseas.</li>
    <li> On its own, this product is horrible. I switched from another co-wash that had left my hair with beautiful curly waves to this Deva Curl and my hair became something else after only one use. It was stringy, frizzy and dry. My hair basically stopped curling, too. It suddenly had next to no curl definition whatsoever. I couldn&#x27;t believe how drying and awful this &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; product was. It does not condition at all. Maybe with another dozen products it would have been okay, but this product can&#x27;t hold its own. I gave it a very good chance to redeem itself, going through just under half the bottle, but I missed my curls and switched back to Renpure that I can get at Target for six bucks. First photo shows what this product made my hair look like (sorry for poor quality, I didn&#x27;t take many photos when it looked like crap), and two other photos on different days to show how it looked after I switched back to Renpure (which I used as both a co-wash and a leave-in). No one should have to use ten different products to make your hair look halfway decent.</li>
    <li> I have color treated, dry, somewhat wavy hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz.  I purchased this product because I was out of Wen and the sales associate assured me it would work equally well.  But it didn&#x27;t!  My hair never really felt clean after using No Poo and it was hard to rinse out.  It also weighed my hair down considerably.  I also don&#x27;t much like the fragrance.  I used the entire bottle because I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, but I was happy to get back to my beloved Wen.  For me, there&#x27;s absolutely no comparison of the two.  Wen leaves my hair light and shiny whereas No Poo left it heavy and unresponsive to styling.  I&#x27;ve heard that No Poo was developed for those with curly hair and although my hair is wavy, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be able to benefit as well.  But it&#x27;s definitely not for me.  I&#x27;ve been using Wen for years and will continue to do so.  Leave No Poo to the curly headed among us.  It&#x27;s really not suitable for those with wavy, medium fine hair.  Wen remains my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have thick, wavy, color treated hair and this is all I use.  Makes my hair easy to manage and stays clean for days.  Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent at first, but the benefits are worth the rose scent.  It&#x27;s also a great face cleanser.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Seems to still get hair goo out from days of product usage.  Smells wonderful.  A little on the expensive side, though.  Have tried just using the One Condition to cleanse the scalp, but it doesn&#x27;t quite work for me.</li>
    <li> Hate it!!! Makes my hair look super oily no matter how long and hard I scrub it. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> This is the only product for curly hair that my hairdresser suggests, and the only one she carries in her shop which specializes in curly hair.  I am very happy with the product.  I have tried others and found the best results with this one</li>
    <li> It helps keep the color in my hair.</li>
    <li> It took my hair a while to get use to this product, but now my hair feels silky smooth.</li>
    <li> is this the best shampoo in the world? this is the best shampoo in the world. people ask me...how? what? what shampoo do you use? and i tell them. this shampoo. nothing else. not the conditioner. not the cleanser. not the whatever variations. just this. since i shower twice a day (you would too if you worked at a hospital) i use the cheap Whole Foods shampoo when i won&#x27;t be seen by the world, and this product when i&#x27;m going to be seen. it seems to balance things nicely. i have tried all sorts of expensive shampoos. and cheap shampoos. they all sucked. except this one. this shampoo is the only one. this shampoo has changed my life.</li>
    <li> My son had super curly hair and this product has helped us finally control them.  He has autism and this was easy to use and he is able to do it himself.  He loves that he can take care of his hair without mom fussing over him.</li>
    <li> Before I was pregnant, my curls were insane.  So easy to manage, and I loved them, but after I gave birth and the years that followed, the hair texture changed and with it my fabulous curls.  So needless to say, I have been on the hunt for the perfect curl product.  I finally tried Deva Curl and I was hooked. I originally purchased this product a few months ago, but in the smaller size.  I really liked it so just purchased in the larger size. I see a huge difference in my curls and even my hairdresser asked what I was using. She couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair had become.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Sulfate free shampoos feel a little weird at first but this product has done wonders for my corkscrew curls.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Keeps my hair shiny and my curls strong.  I have short hair and swim often, which means I have to wash my hair daily, sometimes more than one in one day.  Still, my hair is not dry at all, because I use the No Poo Conditioning Cleanser.</li>
    <li> Other shampoos dry my hair out, this one is gentle on my hair. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> DevaCurl solves all three of my issues: ultra sensitive scalp, wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz, and REALLY hard water where I live. It works on any ethnicity and on any hair type from baby fine to super course. I know, because I have friends in all of those categories that live it!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and creates soft girls :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at the best price I could find.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely great!</li>
    <li> Great for curls - love it</li>
    <li> My everyday shampoo for soft, moisturized curls, great fragrance, plus the added benefit that the lack of &amp;#34;sudsing agents&amp;#34; reduces color fading. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Leaves my thin hair &amp;#34;un&amp;#34;tangled enough I can forgoe the conditioner. Leaves hair clean and shiny</li>
    <li> Used as directed. Still pooed. Lower body hair is now silky smooth. Continued use only exacerbated the latter and did nothing for the former.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 11, a low maintenance girl in a high maintenance body. Deva Curl products are a blessing, helping her keep her curls under control and beautiful. Now her hair is wash and wear!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair sticky and won&#x27;t rinse out until I use a different shampoo over it! I do not suggest and I bought it from my salon!</li>
    <li> I love this No Poo cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t strip the hair like most shampoos do. The only thing I never liked about this, its the smell. Not the greatest smelling but not to bad either.</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with DevaCurl products. Every time I wash my hair, I feel as though I am treating it and making it healthier. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love No Poo and have been using it about a year now. I have very straight hair and my friend recommended it because my hair would get so oily by the end of the day. I no longer have that problem. The No Poo doesn&#x27;t strip out the natural oils from your hair so you hit a balance and it stays nice naturally. It works for dry or oily hair because it lets your body regulate the amount of oil and doesn&#x27;t strip it out and then try to add it back in like most commercial shampoos do. After about 6 months of using it my hair had more body and even would hold a curl when styled. This is something that it never did before. Really love this product I just wish they would market it to all hair types and not just curly hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with my curls and hated the crunchy gel feeling but couldn&#x27;t find anything silicone/Sulfate free. This stuff is amazing! Not only is my hair soft but my curls have exploded!! Paired with the moisture spray and a little bit of bed head foxy curls spray I have the best curls I&#x27;ve had in my life!</li>
    <li> Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!</li>
    <li> This is a gentle cleanser (botanical) that doesn&#x27;t damage my fine hair.  I also love the way it smells.  My hair is in much better condition since I started using Deva products and better quality hair color.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used! My hair is basically a giant bird&#x27;s nest of curls and doesn&#x27;t play nice with others! The No Poo somehow manages to clean my hair while also de-tangling and conditioning. It&#x27;s minty and a little tingly and has a very calming smell. I highly recommend it to anyone! Even my husband uses it and he has fine straight hair!</li>
    <li> Hard to use a different shampoo after using this shampoo .</li>
    <li> This was suggested to me a few times by different stylists.  I have very thick, curly and wavy hair that tends to be very dry and frizzy.  I&#x27;ve been reluctant to try this product line because of the price but Ulta finally offered a sample so I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- What I initially thought looked like a very generous sample size turned out to be only just enough to wash my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;- My hair felt strange afterward; waxy, heavy, dirty and weighed-down looking.&lt;br /&gt;- My scalp did not feel clean at all.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That day my hair was curly, but they were gross, limp, greasy-looking curls.  The next day my hair had returned to afro status so I heat-styled it as I normally would every four or five days.  I usually don&#x27;t wash my hair more than once or twice a week, so I style it and then just refresh it as needed throughout the week, but I usually only have to heat style it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I heat-styled it on day 2, and on day 3 my hair was a disaster all over again, but now it felt gritty on top of everything else.  I actually haven&#x27;t had an afro this enormous in a while.  It is SO BAD.  I finally washed my hair again tonight with my own shampoo and will style it tomorrow, and never give Deva Curl another shot after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; also lists alcohol as its second ingredient, which is something I have heard many times is not good for curly or dry hair, as it is drying.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Have struggled with my curly hair for years. My hairdresser recommended it. Definitely go to a Devacurl stylist.</li>
    <li> i RECIEVED THE PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MATTER. THE PRODUCT IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT TO USE.i REALLY AM ENJOYING IT AND I ALSO CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN MYT HAIR.</li>
    <li> the curls are unbelievable and quite honestly i never knew i could&lt;br /&gt;curl-up like this.  i would suggest checking out youtube or the mydevacurl dot com  websites&lt;br /&gt;online videos so you can get a good feel on how to use this great system.&lt;br /&gt;deva curl smells better than the deva care system( no-fade for colored hair)..but they are both exceptional products.  if you can&#x27;t grasp the noo poo cleanser thing(zero lather).. try the low poo(mild lathering).  i low poo as well if i want an extra boost of clean.&lt;br /&gt;i like fresh curls daily so i condition my hair on the days i don&#x27;t no poo or low poo..&lt;br /&gt;my color stays longer ..this is a fantastic product line and i am happy to own it.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is healthy with shine and no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no poo or low poo the scalp and rub fingers in circular motions(result makes scalp really clean)...not much cleanse really needed to the length of the hair.  i wash hair upside down most of the time. i do use a t-shirt instead of towel for the no frizz factor.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, dry, curly hair that I wash every morning after a very sweaty yoga practice. No poo is extremely gentle while cleansing and smells amazing!  I use the One Conditioner afterwards and the results are beautiful, soft curls.</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to get used to the no lather and the scent, but now I love it.  My hair looks so much better--it appears thicker, curlier, and shiny.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I started using this &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; shampoo when my hairdresser recommended it for my curly hair. I have now been using it for months, and I noticed a difference after about a month I would say. If you are switching directly from regular shampoos to this No Poo, it can be quite different, as it does not lather. It requires quite a work in, I generally scrub pretty vigorously with my fingertips, focusing on the roots of my hair and allowing the no poo to coat the rest of my hair naturally.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is a no poo product and requires a vigorous work-in, I have found that sometimes I don&#x27;t do as great of a job in scrubbing and am left with some dandruff. This just tells me I need to scrub a bit harder next time, to get that dead skin off and out.&lt;br /&gt;After about a month using this product, I have noticed my hair is in much better shape - it curls better and I have less frizz. It just feels a whole lot healthier! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair, and especially to someone who has had problems with frizz or lackluster curls.&lt;br /&gt;(I do use this product followed by the Deva Curl One Condition and the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel)</li>
    <li> I have very curly/wavy hair that looked horrible until I started using their products. The shampoo foams up just enough without residue.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good conditioning shampoo. My hair is more wavy so it probably works best for very curly hair. I like WEN conditioning shampoo best but I&#x27;ll keep using this due to the price difference. Once you start using conditioning shampoos you&#x27;ll never go back. My hair is in much better condition. I tend to have an oily scalp with dry ends and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using DevaCurl products for about two years with success and satisfaction. I recently purchased a new 32 oz No Poo to replace my almost empty bottle. Within a couple weeks, my head was itching like crazy and I was scratching and finding residue all over my scalp! I had heard that the formula changed back around 2009, and it made me wonder if that happened again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, I just compared the two bottles, and the formula has changed! Among other differences, the newer bottle had the betaine ingredient (the \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; part) much lower on the list, which I&#x27;m guessing caused the buildup. If you are a repeat customer, I encourage you to compare the ingredients. If you need more info, comment here and I will copy down the two different ingredients list.</li>
    <li> I use DevaChan products all the time now so I figured I might as well get the giant size and refill the smaller bottles.  I even bring No-Poo on One Condition with me when I get my hair colored and I tell the colorist that I need to use this.  Love getting my hair cut at DevaChan and love their products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t just have curly hair. I have wild, crazy, untameable, thick, obstinate, curly hair. All my life I have been in search of just the right products and have usually settled for things that were close but not exactly what I wanted - until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is amazing! It was as though my hair was hysterical, and early 80&#x27;s Billy Dee Williams walked in and said, &amp;#34;Calm down,&amp;#34; and my hair said, &amp;#34;Okay, Billy, whatever you say.&amp;#34; I felt a difference in my hair as soon as I started to rinse it out. Since then, my hair is much easier to handle and looks the best it has looked in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I have had to use all natural hair shampoo for the past year because I was progressively having allergic reactions even to Aveda products.  The no poo method was the only thing to keep scalp from itching.  So when I purchased this product...silly me...I assumed it was all natural...it isnt.  Alcohol is listed as one of the first ingredients and fragrance  the last...among other things.  I have 36oz of something that I can&#x27;t use...I can only say I  disappointed and warn you to look at the ingredients...</li>
    <li> Wavy hair lady. Product I used to use wad discontinued and I have final found my new replacemnt! I am using the no poo shampoo. Conitioner and the light gel! Use lore product than you think you need!!! Does Not make my hair crunchy. I use the products then scrunch with a towel, add light gel then use diffuser w hair dryer. It probably  would air dry nice too. Super soft feeling! A must try for wavy / barely curly hair</li>
    <li> No Poo has worked wonders for me. I have fine S&#x27;Wavy hair and dry scalp. Using No Poo completely changed my hair. My scalp is no longer dry and it&#x27;s very easy to make my hair curly. I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference product makes! If you feel like the No Poo is gunking up on you, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re using too much, or you&#x27;re not using it right. You need to apply it to your wet scalp with your head upside down. Work it through really well and then add more water and work it through some more. I don&#x27;t always have to follow with conditioner, but if I do, I use the Deva Curl and only focus on my ends. Again, head upside down, work the product through your strands, then scrunch. Rinse out.    To get the curlies, squeeze out water (you can use an old T-shirt to dry your hair so you don&#x27;t have frizz) and add [[ASIN:B003E0Z3JQ Deva Curl Angel 32oz]]. I&#x27;ve used the ArcAngel, but it leaves too much residue for my taste. I can go 3 days without washing now, and all I have to do to reactivate the curl is spritz it with water and scrunch.    If you have color treated hair, use the Deva Care No Poo and Conditioner. It saves your color!  Watch the vids to get tips on how to make your curls look faboo! [...]</li>
    <li> Excellent Cleanser for for curly hair. It smells great. A long time user of this product. It doesn;t have a feminine fragrance. Thank-you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this no poo for a few years now.  I have hair that alternates between curly and frizzy and in the summer in particular it is just a nightmare.  A similarly kinky haired friend turned me on to no poo and for me it has been no looking back.  My hair is rarely dry and lifeless anymore.  I am not in love with the scent (though it&#x27;s not bad...  just mintier than I like) but am in love with the result.  It definitely cuts down on the frizz and keeps more of the curl.  Initially it was kind of a weird experience to have a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather, but I got over that pretty quickly one I saw the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair this with the deva curl conditioner.  Another great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  If you&#x27;ve got a kinky, curly, frizzy mop like mine, this shampoo will quickly become your best friend</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo...even if it&#x27;s a little spendy!</li>
    <li> This has made such a difference with my hair. This is the first co-wash that I have ever used and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now, and I have to say that it&#x27;s results are average.  This product does clean my scalp and gets build up. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super dry, but it doesn&#x27;t make it super moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The price of this shampoo is way more than the value of it. I honestly only buy this because the 32oz bottle last a long time. My honest opinion: buy this stuff at a discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also bottle has broken pump, so be wary when ordering from here</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for curly hair.  My curls stay in and require no blow drying.  Highly recommend to anyone with curls.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well and is good for my very curly hair. Love the smell. However, after a few weeks of using it, I feel like I HAVE to use a sulfate shampoo at least once to get product out of my hair more thoroughly. Then I go back to No-Poo.</li>
    <li> This product is great for co-washing...smells amazing and makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair. Been using it for years now and my hair has seen great improvement. Light &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;, smells like lavender and have a refreshing feeling afterward. The price is great for this purchase!</li>
    <li> love the product itself but after 3 uses with the pump it stopped pumping - with such a big bottle without that pump working its a little bit of a pain</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my curly hair and when I first found Deva Curl products I figured I had nothing to lose. I&#x27;m so glad I did because Deva Curl Conditioner and No-Poo Cleanser are totally improving the condition of my hair! The more I use it, the better my hair looks and feels! Getting used to no suds when washing my hair was weird but it&#x27;s totally worth it! I highly recommend this product, it has made a huge different in my curly hair!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! This is my second purchase of this size. The first one lasted me a year, and my hair is thick and to my lower back. It took a little getting used to it not lathering up but you can definitely feel it working.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these products.  She has curly hair and the DevaCurl products make it easy to manage and the hair look clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> YAY! the word requirement is absolutely, positively ridiculous.  i can&#x27;t imagine why you want to torture your customers this way.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo.  hate the salon in NYC.  But the product is awesome.</li>
    <li> The lack of foam (thank you marketing) is something that I had to get used to but, I really like this shampoo for curly hair. I do occasionally still have to use regular shampoo with all of the chemicals as I use tons of product in my hair but, for every day use, this is great stuff. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and really does get it clean, in spite of the lack of foaming action.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of No-Poo and had no real expectations. I was completely surprised when it transformed my hair. I hadn&#x27;t realized how much regular shampoos were drying it out. After using No-Poo, my hair felt wonderfully moisturized and silky.  It made a dramatic difference in the condition of my hair. This jumpstarted my interest in enhancing my own natural curl.  I no longer flat iron my hair and have adopted the Deva Curl philosophy.  My hair has never been healthier and has become very low maintenance. I highly recommend No-Poo and the Deva Curl line of products.</li>
    <li> I have joined the curly-girl revolution, and this is my first step! Smells (literally) like roses, very provencal. This is a creamy potion that is rubbed vigorously into the scalp to loosen up any dirt, grime, or funk. Despite the lack of suds, it works beautifully, cleaning my scalp without drying it out, and without leaving behind any residue. I like using it with the Deva Curl One Condition, and Deva Curl Arc Angel. The scents combine well, and leave my hair smelling heavenly, and looking &amp;#34;like a mermaid!&amp;#34; according to my coworkers. Since starting the deva curl regimen 8 months ago, my previously wavy/frizzy hair is now much more well-defined, my frizz is tamed, and I constantly get compliments on my &#x27;natural&#x27; hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> If you have curly or tangly hair, you should be using this or some other no-poo product. The difference between this and other sham-poo or half-poo products is dramatic. One of our daughters has fine straightish (beautiful of course) hair that gets tangly when she sleeps, and the other has the ringlet curls of a cherubic angel, and this stuff treats their hair right. It&#x27;s sooo much easier to run a brush through their wet hair after a bath if you use this stuff - you barely need detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution - it makes the tub really slippery even the next day, and it kindof leaves a scummy ring around the tub if you don&#x27;t wipe the tub down after a bath.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged and just as described</li>
    <li> this is one of the only shampoo&#x27;s that actually gives my hair some volume.  I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoo&#x27;s and been continuously disappointed. This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for quite some time even though I blow my hair out. My hair remains shiny and conditioned curls or no curls!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wen and this is a much better product and for less expense.  I love it and I intend to continue using it. It has a great texture and a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly hair.  Use this with their conditioner and you will see how nice your curls will last all day long.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so silky and delicious in the shower! Only have had this product a few days so can&#x27;t speak to its overall effectiveness for my curls. But I love knowing I&#x27;m not putting chemicals in my hair and I don&#x27;t really care that it doesn&#x27;t lather up. You can tell it works when you&#x27;re washing it out and your hair left feeling smooth and silky!! I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore. Just this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost two years and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> great value, great price&lt;br /&gt;fantastic for my curls&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, very happy with the results with every wash</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works really well.  I&#x27;ve used WEN before, but WEN is thicker and much more expensive.  I feel lucky to have found Deva Curl because it works great for me and is half the price.  It does smell like roses, but I happen to love that scent and my hair is very soft, shiney, full of moisture and has much less frizz.  I will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of this until my stylist used it on me at the salon. My hair was softer than it had been in my teens. It does a very good job cleaning and is mild enough to use every day. If you use a ton of silicone-based products, you&#x27;re going to need to use a clarifying cleanser every once in a while, but if you just wash, condition, and the use the Deva Curl line of styling products, this will do the trick. You really don&#x27;t need lather to clean your scalp.</li>
    <li> Deverick Curl is the only thing I use on my hair since I have discovered it.&lt;br /&gt;The reason being I have curly hair.</li>
    <li> Recommended by  my Hair Dresser for my curly hair. I also use DevaCurl Mist-er Right to revitalize my curls in between shampoos.</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  Works as hoped.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and this cleansing conditioner makes my hair soft without the frizzes. I workout and sweat badly, but it cleans my hair well. I can use this product only (no additional shampoo or conditioner) for about 4-5 days before I have to use a shampoo, but then I condition with it.</li>
    <li> Wife swears by this stuff and much cheaper than buying locally.</li>
    <li> Ahh...the smell, terrific; the clean is fabulous and my hair feels good, not tangled.  Wish I needed to wash my hair more often.</li>
    <li> This stuff dries out my hair and makes it all puffy and weird.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, good price.  I usually use Wen.  Devapoo is half the price but not as potent....unsure if thats good or bad.  Sometimes Wen can be over conditioning. Jury is still out.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, works wonders for my straight/wavy short hair! You definitely need to use a lot of it, though.</li>
    <li> If you like a none lathering shampoo, you will like Deva Curl No Poo.  It works great and smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have clients at the salon with eczema, and dry scalp - this shampoo is relieving to them.&lt;br /&gt;Also in-valuable for clients who have had Keratin treatments.</li>
    <li> Works great for dealing with hard water and curly hair. Our well water is not just hard water, it has sulfur in it as well. I have curly ginger hair and it turns almost black with our well water:( My curl specialist recommended this and it almost seems too good to be true- lightens my hair back to its natural color, and actually detangles unlike the aubrey organics (which i have to use after this to add moisture back in). Only negative is it&#x27;s a bit drying- I add aubrey white camellia conditioner in for the last wash, and use the aubrey for a light leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Seriously in love with Deva Curl, it&#x27;s all I use on my curls! It works great at cleaning the hair. Just need to apply to the scalp and let it rinse through the rest of your hair, and it smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> It smells disgusting. But worse than the smell, it dries out my hair. I tried it 3 times, and threw it out.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and love Deva products.  This is perfectly formulated and keeps my hair clean without causing dryness.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 5 years now, and love that I can now get it conveniently shipped to my doorstep rather than finding a local salon that sells it.</li>
    <li> I used this for several months. This worked really great at first but then seem to be drying on my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by it. Her stylist recomended it a few years back and has been using it ever since. Her hair always looks great!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this shampoo!  My only complaint is that it is shipped with the pump assembly in the bottle and twice not is has been clogged up and required cleaning before it was functional.  In this last shipment, I couldn&#x27;t get the pump to work at all.</li>
    <li> SeeMs like this is making my hair more straight than curly.</li>
    <li> great product, changed my hair totally</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair and curls (beachy waves naturally, with fine thick hair) feel amazing and look amazing.  However, you have to use 5-6 pumps to feel like you actually got your hair clean.  I do have a LOT of hair, but that seems really excessive.  I am sure that if it created suds, I&#x27;d feel like less pumps cleaned better, so it might just take some getting used to.  I can say though, I switched from using John Frieda frizz ease to this, and my hair is like night and day better.  Such a dramatic change! LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Good quality, I was worried about fakes, but this was a good product.  Works wonderful on my 3 yr olds angel curls.  Finger comb and there were no major snarles the next morning</li>
    <li> I definitely am still trying to get used to the No Lather, I am probably using way more than necessary, but I will admit it does a good job of cleaning.  I absolutely love the minty fresh scent, it&#x27;s so clean.  I&#x27;ll admit, if there was a way to add lather without compromising the product, I would definitely prefer it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you&#x27;re a curly girl looking to start cowashing. I started using it in place of a lathering shampoo and my hair has been super healthy, soft, and bouncy every since. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking oily; it leaves it looking silky and less frizzy even without adding additional products to style. So happy it&#x27;s silicone, paraben free, too.</li>
    <li> I really love this.  My hair is not curly, but wavy, and it frizzes in the heat and humidity.  I love the way it made my hair look and feel, and it cleaned my hair well.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product line for those of us with super curly hair! In my 39 yrs of product trying its a big sigh of relief. I think it even allowed my hair to grow faster, which was awesome!</li>
    <li> There is indeed no poo in this product. Tastes great.</li>
    <li> Deva products give lots of body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one of those people who spends $45 on a bottle of shampoo. I&#x27;m not a suburban diva; I&#x27;m thrifty and do lots of volunteer work. That said, I have tried so many curly hair shampoos, both the drugstore ones and (occasionally with much guilt) the fancy stuff. A couple worked for a while; most left my curls dry and frizzy or limp and almost straight. (The expensive ones usually did the limp.) But this. This works. It smells great, it cleans without stripping, it&#x27;s nasty-chemical-free, and not nearly as pricey as many of the ones that didn&#x27;t work well. I don&#x27;t need to shampoo every day anymore, and seldom need conditioner at all, and use fewer styling products. My hair just is better, both the day I wash it and the next day. It feels healthy and balanced, if you know what I mean. It&#x27;s curly without being frizzy, and it&#x27;s fuller all the way up to the roots. Feels stronger and breaks less. The only other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that felt like this Renpure Cleansing Conditioner (mint), though that took a few days to normalize. Deva Curl is even better, from Day 1. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Get so many compliments on my hair now. It smells, feels and looks great! Could not be happier that I gave this wonderful brand a try!</li>
    <li> I have thin, wavy-curly hair, and I have to be very careful about what products I use.  I need a balance between clean &amp; fresh and anti-frizz, without weighing down my curls. This product brings out the best in my hair, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not used to being shampoo-free, do a little research first.  Many of the poor reviews I saw for this product were due to people&#x27;s misconceptions about what it is or how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cleansing conditioner.  It does a great job of cleansing the hair and scalp without the harsh detergents found in shampoos, while also leaving hair soft and manageable.  It is NOT a shampoo!  It won&#x27;t lather.  It&#x27;s not supposed to.  Lather is not indicitave of cleansing power. Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll get through the lather addiction with time.  Stick with it.  It&#x27;s worth it!  Again, this is not a shampoo, so if you use heavy product, especially products with silicone, it won&#x27;t be able to dissolve the silicone.  Go silicone-free, and this will work like a dream.  Or, if you aren&#x27;t ready to go completely shampoo- or silicone-free, use this in-between shampoos as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just as clean as when I used shampoo (I used to shampoo daily!  So bad for my hair), but it is soft and less frizzy.  I don&#x27;t even need a separate conditioner.  The scent is fresh and sort of herbal, and it has a hint of peppermint for the slightest tingly-clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to get used to being shampoo-free.  Stick with it!  Remember that your scalp will initially rebel-  it will likely become more oily for a couple of weeks until it adjusts to not having to over-produce natural oils that were getting stripped by your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this out, get clean, happy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have tried the carol&#x27;s daughter co-wash and the Deva Curl No Poo and they are comparable but the No Poo is cheaper. So given you get the same outcome I purchased this product again.</li>
    <li> I use the No Poo (and Lo Poo once a week) but use the conditioner every time. It works great! It conditions, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser for naturally curly hair !!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have been using Deva Curl No Poo for several years and love it.  This is a must if you have frizz that you would like to turn into curls!</li>
    <li> So nice to not be using shampoo that strips my hair, especially&lt;br /&gt;since I color mine.  I like this product considerably tho it&#x27;s the only&lt;br /&gt;hair cleanser I&#x27;ve used.  I had to get used to not having my hair&lt;br /&gt;squeaky clean but realized that squeaky stripped my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a suggestion from a hair stylist. I hated it. Made my hair feel dirty and sticky. I threw it out and never went back to that stylist.</li>
    <li> My 3 yr old daughter has curly hair and I was in desperate need of a good set of shampoo and conditioner.  This has done the trick!  After one use, I could tell the difference.  The scent is nice and light and I love that there are no harsh chemicals.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> love how it makes my hair shine- but still need to use regular shampoo</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Deva Curl, and I love that my hair is not frizzy any more.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I dont like the smell.</li>
    <li> A great solution for hair that is curly, fine, and thin. My hair damages easily and No Poo has helped improved the condition of my hair. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to regular shampoo.  My hair feels &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; after using No Poo.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair, and although this product is intended for people who have curly hair I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;All in one purpose.&lt;br /&gt; - I don&#x27;t need conditioner, it is already like a conditioner to begin with. I have been tempted to try the conditioner just to see how lush my hair might feel, but I just don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;  - It&#x27;s a great cleanser. I have had motor Oil, grease, dirt, chlorine, paint, diesel fuel, bleach, and god knows what else in my hair, it always manages to get whatever is in my hair out of it in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt; - Everyone who smells my hair, or smells the room when I get out of the shower agrees makes sure to let me know.&lt;br /&gt;The texture and feel of my hair lasts for days without a wash, my hair is generally less oily with this shampoo than with any other I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;At first my hair was greasy but as soon as my head balanced out from the lack of Sulfates it was never better, that took about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt; Maybe takes a bit of getting used to, if you are used to lather, but not for me. I am used to this.</li>
