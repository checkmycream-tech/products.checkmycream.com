      <li>My daughter and wife love it.</li>
      <li>which is how they are able to sell for less..verdict, take advantage...</li>
      <li>I appreciate quaility over quantity and this has a lovely earthy floral pure rose scent.</li>
      <li>I like it, but the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong to me.</li>
      <li>More costly, but really special.</li>
      <li>It has a bit of rose aroma, but I guess by using more than rose petals, the chlorophyll or whatever gives it a different odor.</li>
      <li>Rose is difficult to find in good concentration and this has worked beautifully for me and my use.  </li>
      <li>it does not smell like pure rose Otto oil...</li>
      <li>I mixed some drops with pure Shea oil for a delightful body oil.  </li>
      <li>Especially at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>This product, although very pricey for it&#x27;s size, has amazing fragrance.</li>
      <li>When applied to skin before going to bed, it definitely has a great effect on the senses.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is very uplifting and goes great in uplifting blends used straight, in diffusers.  </li>
      <li>It makes an excellent perfume on its own or mixed with a carrier oil such as sweet almond oil.  </li>
      <li>I am enjoying it very much.</li>
      <li>I love to use Rose essential Oil.  </li>
      <li>I get that the best rose scents are extremely expensive, and this is not one of those.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  </li>
      <li>This a nice natural blend oil.</li>
      <li>It is full strenngth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 3 stars only because the person I gave this to loved it.</li>
      <li>The bottle was full.</li>
      <li>I like the product and how quickly it arrived.</li>
      <li>I received genuine Bulgarian rose damascena essential oil (steam-distilled) with no adulterants, under $30 for 5 mls!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Lovely all around--I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived in good time, well packaged, and has been by far the best quality pure rose oil I have tried in the past few years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really a totally inferior rose oil.....</li>
      <li>This is a perfect oil If you are buying it to mix with other products or for spiritual type work.</li>
      <li>But the reviews guided me right...</li>
      <li>the rose oil was as I expected the price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying from Miracle Botanicals again VERY soon!</li>
      <li>Pretty smell</li>
      <li>Oh it will probably keep bugs away at a very high price.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing aroma.</li>
      <li>It is very deluted smelling</li>
      <li>Very concentrated.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it for someone who wants to wear it as a perfume oil.</li>
      <li>so you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very spicy for rosé oil.</li>
      <li>This really smells divine.</li>
      <li>the real deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>has a very &amp;#34;fake rose&amp;#34</li>
      <li>The fact that this rose &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; is the same price as their jasmine oil is an indicator that this is man made, SYNTHETIC essential oil!  </li>
      <li>This smelled like dried up dead roses at best.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a small bottle, but rose</li>
      <li>Johnson, I highly recommend you.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>If you want perfume grade, it smells nice, but if your are looking for therapeutic benefits, spend your money elsewhere, although it is very difficult to find pure therapeutic grade rose essential oil that has not been adulterated.</li>
      <li>This smells great and wasn&#x27;t as expensive as the others I found.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine addition for blending perfumes and for other uses.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more, a bigger size maybe, even though just a little goes a lonnng way so as not to overpower.</li>
      <li>The rose smell also smells like real roses instead of the fake powdery kinds, which is what I&#x27;m looking for</li>
      <li>Overall, I really like this product.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so concentrated or because Bulgarian roses naturally smell like chemical.</li>
      <li>It is somewhat difficult to find \\&quot;real\\&quot; rose oil these days.  </li>
      <li>I use it mixed with coconut oil and nutmeg as a facial scrub, mixed with jojoba or coconut oil as a leave-on facial treatment, or put a dab directly onto any stubborn under-the-skin zits before bed!</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;m forking over more cash for the real thing, because this was a disappointment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product.  Rose is difficult to find in good concentration and this has worked beautifully for me and my use.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This surpassed my expectations. Both the scent &amp; the effect--very concentrated, very pure, &amp; for me, it&#x27;s like a natural tranquilizer (a sort of reaction I&#x27;ve never experienced from lower-quality essential oils). Lovely all around--I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for scent to give the aura of roses to a project.  This smelled like dried up dead roses at best.  It could have ruined the thing but removing the sachet I&#x27;d made allowed it to air out before it was finished.  Maybe damask roses don&#x27;t smell like the roses I have smelled.</li>
    <li> I love to use Rose essential Oil.  This is my favorite type and brand.  I use this will Almond oil.</li>
    <li> Yes loved it. Added it to face cream. Great quality</li>
    <li> smells slightly artificial to my nose, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I will try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!! I always keep it on hand! I use it mixed with coconut oil and nutmeg as a facial scrub, mixed with jojoba or coconut oil as a leave-on facial treatment, or put a dab directly onto any stubborn under-the-skin zits before bed! :) I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Now this is what I call quality.  I appreciate quaility over quantity and this has a lovely earthy floral pure rose scent.</li>
    <li> Just what I love my lady to smells like...</li>
    <li> I searched around for a low-priced, real rose oil. This smells great and wasn&#x27;t as expensive as the others I found. Good product.</li>
    <li> Very concentrated. Smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is so lovely.  Just a couple of drops is all that is needed for a beautiful rose fragrance.  I use it in the bedroom and the fragrance travels throughout the house.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil for face cream.  It&#x27;s a small bottle, but rose oil is so expensive, if you&#x27;re looking of for just a bit then this is your ticket.</li>
    <li> This really smells divine. I always use a few drops of it in the bath and it&#x27;s heavenly. The rose smell also smells like real roses instead of the fake powdery kinds, which is what I&#x27;m looking for so yupp, all in all, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells amazing and feels great on my skin. I mix it with jojoba oil and apply to my face and neck twice daily. Have and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Long-lasting scent not for daily commercial use. Comes with excellent instructions on how to dilute oil. I use it for spiritual purposes--smells like a bed of roses from the angelic realm. The bottle was full. Very concentrated--you only need a few drops. This is a perfect oil If you are buying it to mix with other products or for spiritual type work. I would not recommend it for someone who wants to wear it as a perfume oil.</li>
    <li> This product is beautiful, the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in good time, well packaged, and has been by far the best quality pure rose oil I have tried in the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Hope Johnson, I highly recommend you.</li>
    <li> It is somewhat difficult to find \\&quot;real\\&quot; rose oil these days.  Especially at a reasonable price.  This product met both criteria.  I mixed some drops with pure Shea oil for a delightful body oil.  Very soothing aroma.</li>
    <li> I leave it on my night stand, even with cover on, I can smell the light fragrance at night,  rose fragrance is pleasant, when it is diluted, I apply it on my skin, it stays for 5-10 minutes, no side effect on the skin.  Overall, I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This product, although very pricey for it&#x27;s size, has amazing fragrance. My daughter and wife love it. I mix a drop of this with other butters I make at home. When applied to skin before going to bed, it definitely has a great effect on the senses.</li>
    <li> On my firstnreiki appt, i had a heart blockage. Jeanne suggested rose otto and rose quartz. I dont feel mush with the quartz but the rose otto, is very strong, i rub it in a circular motion at the heart chakra as needed. Pretty smell so i guess people think im wearing perfume? Love this stuff</li>
    <li> The scent is spot-on, and lasts forever!  It is expensive, but I believe it is worth it for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended as part of the aroma therapy healing tools that could be used to support and cleanse my energy and I absolutely love it. Plus it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> it has a funky chemical smell that goes away after a while but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so concentrated or because Bulgarian roses naturally smell like chemical. I&#x27;ve had several essential oils that correctly capture the essence of the plant, but this one worried me. after 10 minutes of soaking into the skin, it smells how it should: like roses. I doubt the quality of this oil and I&#x27;m sad because I bought 2 bottles (1 as a gift, 1 for me). I&#x27;m giving 3 stars only because the person I gave this to loved it. I&#x27;m too embarrassed to show this oil off to anyone for fear that they will tell me that I got hustled.</li>
    <li> I like the product and how quickly it arrived. I believe it was a bargain for the price. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the smell of roses.</li>
    <li> Very potent!  Excellent value, but be sure to dilute it about 1:10 with a carrier oil or you will get a burning rash.  Don&#x27;t ask how I know this.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in a concoction I make with lavender, neroli, and tea tree oil, for my rash-prone skin and for my daughters&#x27; eczema. I use two drops of the mixture in my daily moisturizer, or three drops in my girls&#x27; after-bath baby lotion. It&#x27;s helped both of us: when we use regularly, I have no irritation and the open sores my daughters both tend to get are reduced to small dry patches. Definitely plan on getting this brand again.</li>
    <li> Just an update.  I&#x27;ve used this in a lot of blends since my last review, some which I&#x27;ve created and others from formulas in books and on the interwebz.  This has been a hit addition, esp for women, but can be used in some male blends too.  It smells great, muscle tests great, gets great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very uplifting and goes great in uplifting blends used straight, in diffusers.  It&#x27;s a fine addition for blending perfumes and for other uses. I will be ordering more, a bigger size maybe, even though just a little goes a lonnng way so as not to overpower.</li>
    <li> This a nice natural blend oil. I am enjoying it very much. The aroma it very nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most beautiful scents! More costly, but really special. And the fact that I&#x27;m Bulgarian was another tie-in for me!</li>
    <li> It was just like the stuff my grandmother brought back from Bulgaria years ago. Will definitely buy again. It&#x27;s very spicy for rosé oil. This isn&#x27;t the stuff you&#x27;ll find in the hippy stores.</li>
    <li> Just love it one drop in bath water is devine.  It is full strenngth so you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
    <li> Great product. It has an uplifting and energizing effect.</li>
    <li> I like it, but the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong to me. Here are some more words for you. I don&#x27;t like this requirement for reviews!</li>
    <li> I get that the best rose scents are extremely expensive, and this is not one of those.  It&#x27;s okay, not what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> there must have been a batch mix up or something..... I got geranium oil in the rose oil bottle.... it is being returned</li>
    <li> There is no way this is 100 percent anything.  It is very deluted smelling and it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses but citronella or something.  A rose by any other name it stinks.  Oh it will probably keep bugs away at a very high price.  They figure they got you if your are not a chemist.</li>
    <li> the rose oil was as I expected the price was very reasonable. Will buy it again.  It has a very delicate scent</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical because this company was less expensive.. But the reviews guided me right...I will skip on adding the benefits of rosé as if you know how great it is...then you know..usually I only write about the product but when I was looking to save money all I wAnted to know was of this seller/product was on the level and it is. I think with this company we are not paying the middle man..which is how they are able to sell for less..verdict, take advantage...it&#x27;s the same as really expensive ones.</li>
    <li> The fact that this rose &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; is the same price as their jasmine oil is an indicator that this is man made, SYNTHETIC essential oil!  When I opened the bottle, I felt duped.  My son likes it, so I kept it, but I won&#x27;t be buying any future products from this company.  If you want perfume grade, it smells nice, but if your are looking for therapeutic benefits, spend your money elsewhere, although it is very difficult to find pure therapeutic grade rose essential oil that has not been adulterated.</li>
    <li> Really a totally inferior rose oil.....do not order....it does not smell like pure rose Otto oil...very disappointed....has a very &amp;#34;fake rose&amp;#34; smell.....</li>
    <li> No one would smell this and think they just buried their nose in a bouquet of roses. It has a bit of rose aroma, but I guess by using more than rose petals, the chlorophyll or whatever gives it a different odor. Next time I&#x27;m forking over more cash for the real thing, because this was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I received genuine Bulgarian rose damascena essential oil (steam-distilled) with no adulterants, under $30 for 5 mls!&lt;br /&gt;This is what heaven must smell like AND it was shipped via Priority Mail (for free!) so it arrived in 3 days. I&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I&#x27;ll be buying from Miracle Botanicals again VERY soon!</li>
    <li> Just a drop of this essential oil will last a long long time, yet it is not overpowering.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product smells just like roses and the scent lasts forever. It is a little pricey but the small bottle lasts a long time since you don&#x27;t have to use very much. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This fragrance just knocks me out.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  It makes an excellent perfume on its own or mixed with a carrier oil such as sweet almond oil.  I add it to unscented body lotion to turn it into an exquisite layer of fragrance.  This will be a staple in my cupboard from now on.  No more commercial perfumes for me!</li>
