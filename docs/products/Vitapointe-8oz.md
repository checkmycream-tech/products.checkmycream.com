      <li>It was made by Clairol previously and was great, light and not oily.  </li>
      <li>Great product, used it for over a decade.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes dry hair and gives it the natural looking healthy sheen&lt;br</li>

      <li>Let me tell you, first of all on Amazon,this product says Clairol on it, however, when I received it it did not.  </li>
      <li>It is a light, non-greasy hair conditioner that leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>

      <li>Be aware that the picture and description for this item are both incorrect.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>It holds together or what I think is called bonding my very small fly away strands after a herbal or</li>

      <li>thank you so much</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smell like the product I remember.</li>
      <li>It really helps to improve shine for my curly hair.</li>
      <li>Did not receive the product advertised ...not Clairol and very liquid consistency....</li>
      <li>I am still searching for the Real Vitapointe that worked so well to leave my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>Better price than other retail stores.</li>
      <li>The product is as close as you will get but it is not the same as the original formula.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works wonders on older peoples hair</li>
      <li>A hairdressers secret trick for many years, a tiny amount of Vitepointe adds a healthy youthful sheen while retaining volume and movement.</li>
      <li>I read where people have tried their salon formula, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is really any better than this, since they don&#x27;t list the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>less old, brighter. :)</li>
      <li>Since it only requires a tiny bit that was fine.</li>
      <li>If you live where it is humid, this is your go to product.  </li>
      <li>Tames those new hair growths, adds shine &amp; texture with some weight if you are looking for a straighter, sleeker look.  </li>
      <li>When I was first introduced to it, it was made by Clariol--and, later sold to another company.</li>
      <li>The consistency of this product is thicker and the color has a grey hint to it unlike the original which is white.</li>
      <li>As far as I know the Clairol product is now unobtainium.</li>
      <li>This is NOT anything like the old product.  </li>
      <li>I am 50 years old and have been using Vitapointe since preschool.</li>
      <li>great for dull salt/pepper hair,  a little goes a long way and shine stays till you wash off.  </li>
      <li>It does my african american daughters hair very well.</li>
      <li>This product is quite different from the original Vitapointe which was fluffy and creamy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this stuff for years and love it! I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because the consistency seems a bit different than in the past, but it still works the same. Just go lightly when applying it to your hair.</li>
    <li> for dry curly hair it nourishes and leaves shine and manageability</li>
    <li> great for dull salt/pepper hair,  a little goes a long way and shine stays till you wash off.  Get lots of compliments on my shiney silvery hair.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving three stars is because this is not Clairol Vitapointe as the picture says. My jar does not say Clairol as the picture and description states which is why I specifically purchased this product from this seller. I am 50 years old and have been using Vitapointe since preschool. This photo is what the jar used to look like before Clairol sold the company. The product is as close as you will get but it is not the same as the original formula. The consistency of this product is thicker and the color has a grey hint to it unlike the original which is white. Had I Known that I was not purchasing the original Clairol Vitapointe I would have just looked on eBay. Please update this product photo and description to show what you actually get. My jar says Vitapointe along with a lot of Spanish writting on the jar. All in all, the product does the job!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read a rave review about how shiny, shiny, crazy shiny it made hair and I&#x27;m always looking for a good product that does that.  This one, however, is not any better or worse than any other shine product I have tried.  I have thick, dry, curly/wavy hair.  If you have finer hair, or thin hair, I wouldn&#x27;t try it at all as I&#x27;m sure it will be too thick.  The good news is that if you love this product, there is a LOT of it in this jar (8 oz) and the shipping from this shop was super fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years or more..My hairdresser introduced me to it.I use it once a week it keeps my hair shiny and easy to comb thru.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product that I previously purchased from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  It was made by Clairol previously and was great, light and not oily.  This product is a greasy, heavy mess and weighs downy hair.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It does my african american daughters hair very well. Keeps their hair very hydrated and full off life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clairol Vitapointe for years.  And when my local store discontinued it, I turned to Amazon!  Clairol Vitapointe does not disappoint.  It is a light, non-greasy hair conditioner that leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> If you live where it is humid, this is your go to product.  Tames those new hair growths, adds shine &amp; texture with some weight if you are looking for a straighter, sleeker look.  Using this wonderful product since 1970.  Wow that long and still luv-in it.  I keep an extra on hand in case Clairol discontinues this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years so I say Kudos its not  thick ,but nice and creamy</li>
    <li> This is NOT anything like the old product.  I pitched this in the trash, it was garbage.</li>
    <li> I would NOT purchase this again! I wish I could give it 0 stars. This was such a waste of money</li>
    <li> Always a winner. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 28 years.</li>
    <li> A hairdressers secret trick for many years, a tiny amount of Vitepointe adds a healthy youthful sheen while retaining volume and movement. Dull and damaged hair is instantly revitalized.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product on his hair and loves it and it is not available in the stores</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  holds my hair in place without feeling greasy and gives it a slight wet look</li>
    <li> Very good price here.  I&#x27;ve bought this for years.  People come up to me in stores and ask me about my hair, and I&#x27;m old, and my hair is white!  This stuff just makes it look...less old, brighter. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I found you.  Item arrived before I thought it would.  Will order more.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is an old product that&#x27;s been around for a long long time but no matter, a tiny dab puts shine in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s outstanding for conditioning color treated or permed hair. Probably straightened hair which also takes a hit by heat hair tools but I&#x27;ve not actually done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have always bought it in a small tube. Since it only requires a tiny bit that was fine. Today Amazon only offered the economy size but at such a economy price who could say no. Hence, I&#x27;ve got a life time supply, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia Strasbaugh</li>
    <li> I was a great fan of Clairol Vitapointe.  When it was discontinued by Clairol, I was dismayed. This product is quite different from the original Vitapointe which was fluffy and creamy.  This formula is heavier.  It is not a bad product and some may prefer it to the original. I just miss the old Vitapointe which better suited my hair.</li>
    <li> This has made my hair noticeably less frizzy, but the first time I used it as a leave in conditioner since this is how my mom remembers using it. However, it left my hair stringy and greasy so I now use it before washing my hair and blow drying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 70 with a full head of hair. I believe that Vitapointe has helped. Thank you Cheryl for recommending it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair crème I&#x27;ve ever found for my dry hair.  I hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for those who like to use a light cream instead of greasy products on the hair.  I recommend its use.</li>
    <li> happy with the texture is same texture  as  when I brought it in the store or as  I remember growing up ,</li>
    <li> Did not receive the product advertised ...not Clairol and very liquid consistency....jar exactly like the pic without Clairol on label</li>
    <li> Product formula is different since sale of company. It seems to have a &amp;#34;waxier&amp;#34; feel and texture. Prior to this change it had a lighter less greasy feel.  Therefore 3 stars for average!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Have been using it since 1953!!!  So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. My grandmother got me using this. It really helps to improve shine for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find Vitapointe online, since stores no longer carry Vitapointe.  This is not the same product I remember as a child.  The original Vitapointe was very light in texture, not greasy or waxy feeling.  I would use it on my slightly damp hair, and it would eliminate my &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; and my hair would curl into ringlets.  This product contains mineral oil and bees wax, you can just buy vasaline, you will get the same results for less money.  I tried a little on my slightly damp hair, and it did not &amp;#34;vanish&amp;#34; or make my hair shine, it was waxy and dull.  I had to use clarifying shampoo to get this stuff out of my hair.  I read where people have tried their salon formula, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is really any better than this, since they don&#x27;t list the ingredients.  I checked the maker, it is not made by Clairol anymore, some company named Idelle Labs in Texas makes this now, I will not buy anymore of this, I&#x27;m not happy with the change in formula.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product and the easy way of finding it at Amazon.  It was delivered quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> This is not Vitapointe by Clairol, it is awful.</li>
    <li> This product is like a refreshing drink to my dry hair.</li>
    <li> Great will need another order soon.</li>
    <li> formula must have changed and it is not as easy to use but still a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE I CAN GET IT NOW.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a woman friend of mine.  She is very pleased with it and i suspect that I will have to get more for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Item as described, good bang for the buck, delivered timely.</li>
    <li> I have used Vitapointe for at least 25 years. Loved the product. Recently I purchased two jars and I am very disappointed. The product is runny, has some different ingredients and  it did  not have a seal over the creme under the lid. Just totally different than the jar I am just finishing up and I had purchased locally. Most of all it does not make my hair soft  and shiny, just greasy. I hope I can find a better replacement from another manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Vitapointe is hard to find. I do love the product, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the big jar.</li>
    <li> I have used Vitapointe hairdressing for years, but it has become harder and harder to find. When I was first introduced to it, it was made by Clariol--and, later sold to another company. Although this other company&#x27;s label said, \\&quot;made and distributed by Idelle Labs of El Paso, TX,\\&quot; it seemed to be the same hairdressing that I got under the Clairol label. Now, I am having difficulty finding it and thought this was the same product--but it is NOT the same product. It is stiff and does not leave my hair shining--in fact, it dulls my hair. I am still searching for the Real Vitapointe that worked so well to leave my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for years and would not stop unless it was no longer produced. Better price than other retail stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using his product since 1964 and I love it. One jar lasts a long time and my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is getting harder to find on the shelf and I am glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The jars I have don&#x27;t have Clairol on them. I thought they would be like the picture, but they weren&#x27;t. It really doesn&#x27;t smell like the product I remember. I will use them because I wanted them.</li>
    <li> A product we were very much familiar with, just needed to find it</li>
    <li> The product was delivered timely and undamaged.  What does give me pause is the fact that the product is not manufactured by Clairol.  It is created by a firm I&#x27;ve never heard of, so I am leary of the quality and safety of the product. This looks like the product I used in the past, but as we all know, looks can be deceiving.</li>
    <li> works great. been using this since 1976</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use a very small amount as a daily hair dressing.  It gives my hair a healthy shine-- but never greasy-looking.  There is nothing on the market that can compare with Vitapointe.</li>
    <li> I probably will not order this again.  I find that it makes my hair too greasy and heavy. I use it very sparingly, it will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for curly hair.  It has control and staying power. Smells nice too. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Vitapointe for over 20 years until my last 2 orders. What was an  excellent product  produced by Clairol is now owned by Idelle Labs Ltd. The original products primary ingredients  list included Beeswax-Water, which has been now changed to Water-Beeswax . The container is the same without Clairol&#x27;s name on the label.&lt;br /&gt;The cream which was a paste is now like a jel. Apparently Water is cheaper than Beeswax, so is the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Clairol name should be removed from Amazons add</li>
    <li> Best hair product on the market will suchly come back for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitapointe for years and it ALWAYS makes my hair look and feel wonderful!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with my hair natural and with my hair all black and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I used it now and my hair is grey and relaxed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products and ALWAYS come back to vitapointe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have introduce other ladies to the wonderfulness of vitapointe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my hairdresser agrees it works wonders on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V-I-T-A POINTE---HIP- HIP- HOORAH!!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for years &amp; he still can&#x27;t find anything else that holds his hair as well as vitapointe.</li>
    <li> Would give it a ZERO if I could. Mom&#x27;s been using the original product for ages. This is NOT the same product. Totally useless. Do NOT buy.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Vitapointe for as many years as we have been married. At times for somes reason we have difficulty finding it</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, first of all on Amazon,this product says Clairol on it, however, when I received it it did not.  When I used this product today, I tried to wash it out and it would not wash out even after 5 shampoos. My hair is full of thick grease. I have to wear a shower cap on my hair tonight and try to wash it out once again tomorrow with another 5 shampoos which will probably, in the long run, do more harm than good! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT WHAT EVER YOU DO!!! Also,I lost a lot of hairs today due to this thick grease!</li>
    <li> The texture of the cream is thicker than I remember the original Vitapointe. Not sure I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t at all what I&#x27;d expected.  Smelled very strong and toxic.  Couldn&#x27;t use it and I&#x27;d order a large supply of it.</li>
    <li> Miracle product for dry hair</li>
    <li> Great product, used it for over a decade.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes dry hair and gives it the natural looking healthy sheen&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on older peoples hair</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitapoint for the past 20 years it is a lite cream that gives my a greaseless sheen</li>
    <li> I buy this for my long thick fine hair to make it beach wavey to keep the waves in all day. it gives you a bit of a wet look. this is my 2nd time buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, it does tend to build up in your hair over time.</li>
    <li> I got a good price for the very product I was ordering and in received it in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the price was amazing.</li>
    <li> Just what i wanted Thank yu!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my Vitapointe.  I&#x27;ve used the for many years and it still does wonders for my hair.  It truly gives your a beautigul sheen,  body and softness.  The Clairol.</li>
    <li> I ordered Vitapointe on my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation.  It works wonders on my dyed, coarse, curly hair.  It gives it the softness and shine that is sso needed.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Be aware that the picture and description for this item are both incorrect. You will not receive Clairol Vitapointe but a product with a different formulation from a company that has apparently bought the rights to the name Vitapointe. As far as I know the Clairol product is now unobtainium.</li>
    <li> i uesd this when i was 18 and its still the best for makes my hair look good  thank you so much</li>
    <li> A necessary vital part of my grooming. The only one takes just a little bit to tame my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for my curly hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> not good knock off product i sent it back.</li>
    <li> We could not find this product at the drugstore any more and could not order it through them. I always purchased the tube before and now I know that I am getting the same great product in a jar at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years so I suppose that speaks for itself :)</li>
    <li> This formula has changed since I last purchased this product- over 20 years ago- but it still seems to be something that I like.  I am happy for the purchase.</li>
    <li> We have been using Vitapointe for over a decade now.  Just a little dot of it can make your dull hair look shiny and healthy. As we get older we need stuff like this more and more!</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitapointe for about 20 years now and believe it or not this is the only styling product I use on my natural white hair.  It holds together or what I think is called bonding my very small fly away strands after a herbal or (now) on occasion a silver brightening  shampoo.  Just a dab will do.
