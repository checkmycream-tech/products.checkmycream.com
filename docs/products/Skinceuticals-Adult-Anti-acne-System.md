      <li>The clear times I was happy</li>
      <li>All fine under light makeup, mostly powder for me now.</li>
      <li>There are still some blackheads around my nose, but I have a tool that takes care of those easily and painlessly.  </li>
      <li>and after a week I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my face with skinceuticals.  </li>
      <li>fabulous product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue...</li>
      <li>The moisturizing lotion they make is awesome but other products not so much.</li>
      <li>But it is a good product, and with regular use, you will see improvement.  </li>
      <li>It has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
      <li>I will now be a loyal skinceuticals customer.</li>
      <li>Love the toner in particular.</li>
      <li>Other than that I love it!!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product line for a week and my skin is DRAMATICALLY smoother, softer, fresher, cleaner, and the best part- makes current break outs heal super fast and old ones are fading SO quickly I almost cannot believe it.</li>
      <li>Those product are amazing, but  one of those, came open...</li>
      <li>well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have never reviewed a product before, but this one is worth promoting.</li>
      <li>Miraculous product well worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and in sealed original new package as described!</li>
      <li>I would look other wise.</li>
      <li>Such a good product so far.</li>
      <li>However, after about a month of regular use, people  began to comment about how clear and bright my skin looked.</li>
      <li>Really helped my adult acne...need to get more.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the serum as part of the regimen, so I&#x27;m still waiting to judge the results.</li>
      <li>comments:&lt;br /&gt;-I have found that the overall texture of my skin is healthier, and it has a healthy glow.  </li>
      <li>My skin tone seemed to be more even and the red patches around my nose were gone.  </li>
      <li>After the first night using all 3 steps of Skinceuticals</li>
      <li>I used it consistently.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying the LHA system.</li>
      <li>Still using the product  , so far very satisfied With all items especially the blemish lotion.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I have battled acne for the past 20+ years and never had successful results until this product.  </li>
      <li>my skin is so much clearer and happier!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very excited to see how this works in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Skilceuticals Adult Anti-acne system for about a month now and my skin is finally looking better!</li>
      <li>I will warn you that my skin got worse before it got better, but it did heal more quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping to see more results in the long run with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing new or special about this particular acne system.</li>
      <li>REALLY wanted this to work for me but</li>
      <li>It is pricey but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>, I have very oily skin, and this has reduced the fluctuation.</li>
      <li>They really work.</li>
      <li>haha  </li>
      <li>Too much alcohol in my opinion</li>
      <li>The product got to me fast but was leaking in the box.</li>
      <li>She would mention this kit at each session, and I really though she was just trying to push product on me.</li>
      <li>But I really wanted this to work</li>
      <li>I tried so many other skin care lines once I turned 50.</li>
      <li>Other everyday since the product is strong and make your skin to dry!!!Buy togheter a nice moisturizer to use during the day.</li>
      <li>My skin is still pretty oily and my breakouts have been just as frequent as before.</li>
      <li>Adult acne became a huge issue after my second child.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product was as described,  but can&#x27;t honestly tell a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love these products. They really work.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It&#x27;s lightweight, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue...it also leaves your skin feeling super soft and wonderful! Would definitely recommend and but again!</li>
    <li> Incredible product! Applying it once a day. Significant improvement in 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> Great system!!!  The face wash is the BEST out there for people who have problematic skin!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!!I suggest starting to use. Other everyday since the product is strong and make your skin to dry!!!Buy togheter a nice moisturizer to use during the day.</li>
    <li> What a great bundle! Arrived quickly and in sealed original new package as described!</li>
    <li> I love this skin care line for keeping my pores clean and my skin feeling healthy. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the serum as part of the regimen, so I&#x27;m still waiting to judge the results.</li>
    <li> I never broke out as a teen.  Not one pimple until I was 36!  Oh my word am I ever making up for it now!  I tried proactive, clearasil, sea breeze, and Avon&#x27;s acne products. After the first night using all 3 steps of Skinceuticals I woke up with the breakouts dried out and my skin was softer.  I bought my Skinceuticals kit at my Asthetica office.  I&#x27;m starting to have hot flashes and breakouts and cycle \\&quot;discombobulated\\&quot; haha  You will not be sorry with this purchase. I was getting better and stopped using it for a few days and broke out all over again.  It lasts for a long time and a little goes a long way.  Use only what is suggested on the box not extra.  You don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after what I consider to be a severe cystic acne outbreak. Four cysts appeared at once in April.  As a 34 year old, it&#x27;s extremely embarrassing to be dealing with this issue. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different treatments and systems included ProActiv and Zeno Mini, with mixed results.  The best results I ever received were with Roslin and Bezaclyn, both only available by prescription and not covered by insurance since it was considered for cosmetic purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this a few days after I received it and am now about half way through the bottles.  Since I wear no make-up at all, I only wash my face in the mornings. Initially I used the cleanser with my Clarisonic, but due to laziness and forgetting to charge it, I now just work it in with my hands. According to the directly, the Clarisonic shouldn&#x27;t be used with acidic cleanser because the acid causes the brushes to degrade faster. But I really wanted this to work quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get immediate results like some reviewers seemed to get. However, after about a month of regular use, people  began to comment about how clear and bright my skin looked. My skin tone seemed to be more even and the red patches around my nose were gone.  I still had small bumps on my checks and forehead but my skin felt very smooth. I recently started washing twice a day and the bumps have now fully gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I still got a few cysts between the time I started the regime and now, they are now where near as disruptive nor last as long as before. Being that it is a hormonal problem, it wasn&#x27;t expected that it would completely disappear, just not be as severe.  There are still some blackheads around my nose, but I have a tool that takes care of those easily and painlessly.  Overall, I think system is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny last forever .... If u are like me 40 and still dealing with acne this is perfect for u ... now we can finally address the acne and the aging issue .... The anti aging treatment is the best it not only dries up your pimples it leaves your skin smooth not dry.... very pleased with this beauty regimen</li>
    <li> Those product are amazing, but  one of those, came open...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 and it didn&#x27;t work out for me at all. It didn&#x27;t help with my acne at all nor with the few expression lines I have.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is possible for any product to get rid of acne.  I too have used every product out there and after a week I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my face with skinceuticals.  I will post before and after pictures if possible.  A little on the spendy side but I am taking the advice to use as little as possible and I still see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning and night.</li>
    <li> Has really helped clear up my skin.  My dermatologist recommended.</li>
    <li> at 49 yrs i get this adult acne that seems unaffected by external and internal treatments prescribed by a dermatologist. fed up with \\&quot;postules\\&quot; that pop up on my face 3 or 4 or 5 at a time, I spent the money and bought this product. Since day one I have had  no breakouts, except the night I was out of town and skipped the regime. fabulous product. well worth the money. will stay with  it forever. my skin is so much clearer and happier!</li>
    <li> Worked better than any other product for my adult acne. I have tried so many products and nothing has worked as good or quickly as this product.</li>
    <li> Super fast, reliable and great products!</li>
    <li> Great price for great product s!</li>
    <li> I had lots of trouble with adult acne, but not since I started using this product. Even if I start to have a blemish, It is usually gone the next day. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I recently had a chemical peel in hopes to clear up my adult acne and the person doing it recommended this product.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and have really noticed a big difference.  No major breakouts.  I have been going to dermatologists for years and have tried everything.  The bottles are really big and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot each time.  I highly recommend this for anyone that suffers from adult acne.</li>
    <li> Not bad but not great. Didn&#x27;t clear up my skin but would at random times even tho I used it consistently. One week clear, one week broken out, then clear. The clear times I was happy but when I broke out it was worse than normal. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Love the product, my skin is already a lot clearer!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my esthetician who recommended it while I was seeing her for a series of chemical peels. She would mention this kit at each session, and I really though she was just trying to push product on me. Finally one day she wore me down and I purchased it and ever since then I have been so grateful to her. When I am strict about using this every night, my skin is beautiful and I get no blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser: It&#x27;s a nice gel cleanser. It does not take off makeup so I use a makeup remover prior to using this. I also use it with my Clarisonic Mia. This cleanser does not leave residue on my skin nor does it make my skin feel dry. I only use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner: Too much alcohol in my opinion but it&#x27;s effective and it dries quickly. I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum: I only need 4-5 drops for my entire face and neck. It can sometimes feel warming, other times I don&#x27;t notice that affect at all. It doesn&#x27;t play well with my day moisturizer, so I use it only at night. If I&#x27;ve been bad and lazy and have not been washing my face at night like I should be, this clears my skin back up in 1-2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep purchasing this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I struggle with adult acne at 46, which is awful.  Most products are too drying, but this system works well.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s stopped my acne, but it&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day without drying out my skin or irritating it.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with adult acne and this product takes care of both blackheads and whiteheads. I will definitely reorder. Amazon has the best price and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Such a good product so far. My acne it&#x27;s not gone, but I have around 6 weeks since I started with the product and my skin is changing for better.</li>
    <li> I was so/so about this product. The product got to me fast but was leaking in the box. I called amazon and they were a big help. As far as the products go I wouldnt order them again. The wash and toner did nothing for me, and the serum caused me to break out worse. I would look other wise. The moisturizing lotion they make is awesome but other products not so much.</li>
    <li> I tried so many other skin care lines once I turned 50. This has been amazing. My skin evened out, it is not dry. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> My face became a little dry after a few weeks so I only used the serum at night. Great and effective product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in only a couple days, and after one week my skin is almost entirely clear. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is just a little less shiny even. I&#x27;m hoping to see more results in the long run with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this product for about two months, I can say it is not the miracle I thought it was. As is typical with many facial cleansers and acne products, sometimes you just have a positive reaction when you switch to a new brand, but the results don&#x27;t last. My skin is still pretty oily and my breakouts have been just as frequent as before. I also noticed a lot of itching and random hives along my jawline and cheeks, so I had to stop using this stuff as much and go back to using tea tree oil cleanser every other day, which helped.  I&#x27;ll probably use up the rest of the product (because it was so fricken expensive) but won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 6 weeks now.  I am 37 years old and always had/have acne problems with scarring.  I have tried over the counter stuff, and prescriptions creams and pills. I was hoping for a miracle product, this is not.  But it is a good product, and with regular use, you will see improvement.  I would recommend this product to another person.  I am hoping in the next few weeks of continual reduction in breakouts to start chemical peels with my dermatologist to help reduce the scar tissue/marks.  I use this system, eye cream, and facial moisturizer as part of my daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Positive comments:&lt;br /&gt;-I have found that the overall texture of my skin is healthier, and it has a healthy glow.  It took about a month to really notice the change.&lt;br /&gt;-My make-up doesn&#x27;t have to work as hard (liquid concealer, raw minerals powder) when I need to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;-I still break out, but the breakouts have been greatly reduced.  I would estimate 70-80% reduction.&lt;br /&gt;-Certain times of the month, I have very oily skin, and this has reduced the fluctuation.</li>
    <li> This skin care system has given me the results I was searching for. It has cleared up some of my acne and is in the process of making my skin radiant and beautiful again. I will recommend to every body.</li>
    <li> Same old acne face wash. Nothing new or special about this particular acne system.</li>
    <li> Miraculous product well worth every dollar. Love the toner in particular.</li>
    <li> Tried different acne products ranging from cheap to really expensive ones. I tried this after getting good results from a sample that I received from my aesthetician. This gets rid of my acne without drying my face. It also prevented new breakouts and redness. My pores are also a lot smaller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with Acne my entire life and have tried everything! (ProActiv, Murad, etc...) I&#x27;ve been using Skilceuticals Adult Anti-acne system for about a month now and my skin is finally looking better! Not only have I noticed less breakouts but my skin is glowing like I&#x27;ve just had a $200 chemical peel. I have noticed some sensitivity so I only use the serum 1x a day (at night) and have to use a super hydrating moisturizer. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it continues to improve over the next few months.</li>
    <li> A friend&#x27;s dermatologist recommended Skinceuticals to her and her skin always looked perfect so I thought I would give it a try.  I saw results immediately.  I have been using this line of skin care for close to a year now and I love it.  It keeps my skin clear and the product lasts forever.  Definitely a five star product.</li>
    <li> Great job clearing up my acne.  You&#x27;ll experience a break-out at first as your skin purges all the gross stuff underneath, but after a few weeks, it clears you up and keeps you clear!</li>
    <li> i was already using the toner - so thought I&#x27;d try the rest. The wash seems to be good, but my issue is with the blemish/aging serum - it feels ok going on and seems to soak in. But every afternoon i find that i&#x27;ve got a huge oil slick shine on my face (all over -not just t-zone). It took me awhile to debug the issue - but eventually realized that skipping this serum gets rid of the miday slick. i wanted to love this - but i&#x27;m stopping its use.</li>
    <li> Used everything from Accutane to proactive. Adult acne became a huge issue after my second child. Thus product cleared up my face in 48 hours. Amazing! Gentle and effective!</li>
    <li> I work at a spa that sells skinceuticals &amp; only bought this product b/c I get a 40% discount.  After using the product, I felt like my already oily face got oilier &amp; I would still get breakouts on my upper lip, under my cheek bones, eyebrows, chin, randomly on my forehead... It was VERY frustrating b/c even with the discount, I still paid more than I wanted for a product that seemed to make my face worse.  When I ran out of the serum, I gave in &amp; bought ProActive (at one of those humiliating vending machines at the mall) for half of the price.  Within a FEW DAYS, I could see immediate results!!!  I&#x27;d been using the Skinceuticals products for MONTHS &amp; nothing.  ProActive less than a week &amp; my skin was clearing up!!  It does seem to overly dry my skin, so after this runs out, I&#x27;d like to try the &amp;#34;Exposed&amp;#34; skincare system.</li>
    <li> got the product on time. not satisfied with the results. leaves the skin red.&lt;br /&gt;most likely will not buy again</li>
    <li> Still using the product  , so far very satisfied With all items especially the blemish lotion.</li>
    <li> Really helped my adult acne...need to get more.</li>
    <li> I´ve been using the 3 steps by 6 weeks now, and I have to say I haven´t seen any improvement in my skin at all. My skin still have break outs, almost every day I get a new one. The soap and the tonner are good, and the serum, honestly, I feel like I threw my money away.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews for products, but I love this kit. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it due to the cost. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It has helped my skin tremendously. I had a few break outs here and there, but this has helped with that, tightened my skin and pores, and evened out tone. It&#x27;s a fantastic product and makes your skin feel amazing. I highly encourage it - it beats everything I&#x27;ve used to date (including scripts from my derm). You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Met expectations!</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews, but I had to attest to this product&#x27;s power. I am 28, have had issues with very angry, hormonal skin for several unfortunate years. I have been using this product line for a week and my skin is DRAMATICALLY smoother, softer, fresher, cleaner, and the best part- makes current break outs heal super fast and old ones are fading SO quickly I almost cannot believe it. My skin has been doing some lightly noticeable flaking around the areas the serum has been placed, but obviously that is to be expected with resurfacing. I use it twice a day, very small amounts only needed. I use it during the day with skinceuticals moisturizer and my face feels great all day. All fine under light makeup, mostly powder for me now. The serum burns and tingles for a little while but the results I am getting are worth much more pain, I&#x27;ll deal!! I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things, I am ready to go through my products now and get rid of all of the past... I will now be a loyal skinceuticals customer. At several points over the years I have wanted to call into work or not go to classes to even staying home from parties and events b/c my skin embarassed the heck out of me. I am so relieved to find this product. It is pricey but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will write a follow up review after a couple months use :)</li>
    <li> REALLY wanted this to work for me but honestly other than being severely drying, my acne remained exactly the same. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product works great on me and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> great system! finally something that actually works! Thank you</li>
    <li> I wanted to write an honest review, because I know sometimes the reviews on Amazon are bogus. I&#x27;ve been using skinceuticals for a few years now. My esthetician had to stop selling me skinceuticals though when the company moved to solely pharmaceutical sales. Ever since, I&#x27;ve been purchasing on Amazon. This was my first time trying the LHA system. I have to say that I am so thankful for this. I saw a review that someone put, stating that you can get \\&quot;the same salicylic acid at a drugstore.\\&quot; This is truly not the case. This is a high level serum that is specifically designed for acne. I love the tingly feeling after using the cleanser and toner. My pores are clearer than ever and I&#x27;m very excited to see how this works in the future. I&#x27;ve been using he system now for a few weeks and have already seen results. One warning, be careful not to get the serum around your eyes because it is strong and will cause your skin to turn red and it can be painful. Make sure to use moisturizer also because this can be drying. Other than that I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have battled acne for the past 20+ years and never had successful results until this product.  I have used both prescribed treatments and dropped major bucks on beauty products and chemical peels, only to be let down and disappointed. I will warn you that my skin got worse before it got better, but it did heal more quickly.  After a month now and 1/3 of the product used, I&#x27;m finally over the bad skin hump.  I have oily skin and the products have definitely minimized the production of sebum, so it doesn&#x27;t get trapped and progress to the acne stage.  I know what it feels like to have your confidence sink because you feel self conscious about bad skin.  I have never reviewed a product before, but this one is worth promoting.</li>
