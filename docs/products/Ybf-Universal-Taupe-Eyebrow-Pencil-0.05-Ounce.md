      <li>The pencil broke right away good color though</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the BEST eyebrow pencil you&#x27;ll ever use. I&#x27;ve tried them all (well,almost!!) and I am the biggest fan of  the YBF (&amp;#34;your best friend&amp;#34;) as the color you want is achieved by the amount of pressure you apply as you put it.on. I have a scar (from stitches) that prevented my eyebrow from growing back; this fills in that blank space perfectly, plus it  doesn&#x27;t rub off, great staying power!!</li>
    <li> Broke the very first time I used it, so I don&#x27;t know if it is good or bad. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> No matter what your color this product will work.  You control the shade during application and I normally go a lighter brown for daytime wear and a darker brown for after five wear.  One pencil does it all!</li>
    <li> Easy to use - you have complete control of the color - truly loved it.  I ordered some for the local cancer center.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> This is the very best eyebrow pencil I have every used.  You control the color and it glides on.</li>
    <li> I love my eye pencil using it every day and will tell every one where to get the eyebrow pencil at amazon.com</li>
    <li> In love with this product. My brows have never looked better!</li>
    <li> The Ybf Universal Taupe Eyebrow Pencil is wonderful - great color for fading eyebrows in an aging face!!  I used one up and ordered two more so that I would not run out of this product.</li>
    <li> I have very dark hair &amp; brows. This matches perfectly with the correct pressure. Blends nicely w the brush. Lasts all day, not smearing. An excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyebrow product I have ever used! I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to try it.</li>
    <li> ybf is the best eyebrow pencil i have used shame it cant be bought in uk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these pencils before and love them.</li>
    <li> I have no eyebrows and ive waisted big bucks on other eyebrow pencils. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Tahoe is the Colorado and it can do about 6 shades.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years and it&#x27;s the best brow pencil out there that doesn&#x27;t look fake after you apply.  You can adjust how dark/light you want it and the how-to tips to apply it are great for those who aren&#x27;t sure the best way to get the perfect brow.</li>
    <li> Only eyebrow pencil that I&#x27;ve ever used that does a great job without looking like you just drew on your eyebrows.  Always has a sharp point and love the built-in brush so you can get a feathered, natural look.  The taupe color works for most people.  Use a light touch for lighter complextions, and a heavier touch if you want to go darker.  Price is right and the product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I found it difficult to apply and keep the color light.</li>
    <li> I have had many eyebrow pencils over the years, and this one is the best one ever.  Nice point that is a clear stroke, and the point does not break when using it.</li>
    <li> Tried this product before, then tried others. Went back to this one because the color just can&#x27;t be beat! Other pencils are hit or miss. colors grey or dark brown. This one is JUST RIGHT!</li>
    <li> I like the product and have used it in the past but the pencil wouldn&#x27;t work and I had already thrown away the packaging and figured it would cost just as much to send back.</li>
    <li> I like it so much I reordered.</li>
    <li> Love this pencil. Stays on like no other through water, sweat etc. and it&#x27;s the only natural looking pencil I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> Love the retractable design &amp; the fine point but, the color is a bit dark for me....still better than most that I have tried.</li>
    <li> As someone who has never used a brow pencil before, this is a daily make-up routine game changer. So simple to apply, and I love that the end result looks so natural!  You literally cannot mess up applying this product!  Just blend with the brush end.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other pencil now.  This one matches my eyebrows perfectly unless I get a little heavy handed and make it too dark.  Comes off easily when cleaning my face, but also stays on all day with no touch-ups.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyebrow pencil for years now and have gotten countless compliments and countless people asking me what I use. Like the ad says, you just can&#x27;t mess up. I love this pencil, it is universal, it&#x27;s light when you need it to be, it&#x27;s dark when you need it to be.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  Total appreciate it and it is the perfect color for me</li>
    <li> I had heard A LOT of good things about this pencil, watched YouTube vids, etc... but the price? And owning at least 5 eyebrow pencils already it didn&#x27;t make sense to get another.      But those awesome videos...    I had some money sitting in PayPal and I had just moved and changed banks, so all the changes in PayPal was a pain to deal with.  So I had to spend the money. (So much easier!)    I got the pencil from another company that accepted PayPal. 6 days later it arrived.  And....?  I&#x27;ll be darned.  It lives up to its hype!    I goes on looking like a real, natural eyebrow color, and for some reason when you use the brush on the other end of the pencil, it looks even better!    I moisturize with coconut oil and am exposed to rain/mist/wet conditions of the NW and it stays on all day!    When I get un-lazy I&#x27;ll post before and after pics.</li>
    <li> I had watched a commercial on this pencil.  But, unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t get it to work the same way for me.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Universal is exactly right this is the perfect color brow pencil. and the price is amazing. I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and will continue purchasing from here.</li>
    <li> Blends in perfectly, no matter your brow color. It&#x27;s worked great with my hair being everywhere from dark brown to light blonde.  I&#x27;ve tried so many brands from Revlon to Benefit to Anastasia and this is the best out there. It lasts a long time, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m ordering 5 more in case they ever try to discontinue it…. :)</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly and it was exactly what  I expected!</li>
    <li> The best eyebrow pencil ever!</li>
    <li> Love...love...love. Easy to apply and remove.  I have used for years and can&#x27;t find anything better.  Lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this pencil for many years.  I love it and try to make sure I always have one.</li>
    <li> I have light eyebrows and this is the only pencil that works well for me.  If I choose a blonde shade, it shows up red or orangish when I go outdoors.  This is the perfect pencil for everyone.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I have dark eyebrows and it blended in well but it ran out 3 weeks after purchasing. Will try another brand.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is not waterproof. I think the little spoolie brush on the end is very good. The color is adjustable according to how much pressure you put on the pen. I found it easy to apply and have no complaints. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this eyebrow pencil!!</li>
    <li> only brow pencil i use.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and is long lasting. It is definitely I product that will more than likely order again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you YBF...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a great eyebrow pencil and this one is it!  Not too hard, not too soft but just perfect for shaping and blending.  It stay&#x27;s on all day too!</li>
    <li> I am blonde and this is a a very good color for me. I like the brush at the other end for a groomed look.</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for alternatives to filling in and shaping my eyebrows. This looked like a promising product/tool. The pencil casing was nice, made out of aluminum I believe. I used the pencil once and wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with my initial results. I wish I could say my second time around was an improvement but the lead fell out after removing the lid. I was going to exchange it but decided I would just take the loss and threw it away.  I didn&#x27;t feel like paying out of pocket for shipping to exchange a bad product. Unfortunately I would not recommend this product nor would I buy it again.</li>
    <li> its a nice pen&lt;br /&gt;i like it for eye liner also</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars as the lead pencil filler comes out of the casing and it did not last long. Maybe three weeks of use. And not everyday.</li>
    <li> Like these. First one I got worked but the pencil shaft was cheap and the end caps would fall off. The second one was better quality and sturdier. The pencil lead gives a very natural taupe-color, which is the color of most people&#x27;s eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyebrow pencil and found that the pencil itself was brittle and after a few uses crumbled and broke.  Save your money and look for something with better quality.</li>
    <li> it would be a five if the pencil didn&#x27;t loose their led so much, sometimes it gets stuck in the lid other times you loose it on the ground and you have just wasted your money.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this pencil broke within the first week I had it.. I likened the color and brush, but once the pencil broke off, it was useless..</li>
    <li> I use it every day as I my brow hairs are very light.  Easy to use - neutral color  Brush on end helps to even out color</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow pencil EVER! I love it, this is a reorder because I used up the first one, stocked up!</li>
    <li> Excellent brow pencil but very hard to find!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to get a light color on my brow. I have tried pressing lightly but it&#x27;s still a bit too dark. I do enjoy the staying power and the eyebrow brush on the other end!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner pencil ....</li>
    <li> If you want a great eyebrow pencil that is always the perfect color this is the one for you, give it a try and you will never use another!</li>
    <li> i love this pencil.  so easy to use, and the color matches everyone.</li>
    <li> Good product but HSN sells two of them for the same price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this works, because the product fell completely out after one day.  I am careful with things , not sure what happened.  But I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used YBF when it was sold on another shopping channel and loved the eyebrow pencil.  This one seems old and stale as it keeps breaking and does not go on the brow smoothly and evenly.  The consistency of the product is hard and uneven.</li>
    <li> As I am aging (I&#x27;m in my mid-40s) my eyebrows are thinning &amp; haven&#x27;t recovered from the overplucking of my youth so I need a good eyebrow pencil that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones and the Ybf eyebrow pencil is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. I was a sworn user of another brand that cost twice as much and this one is truly superior - both in price &amp; performance. I love the fact that the color is universal so I never run the chance of not being able to find my &amp;#34;shade&amp;#34; in the store. (Which has happened and it&#x27;s NOT pretty). I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it myself. My eyebrows look so natural and the color lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have orders placed for several other Ybf products &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try them. If they are as wonderful as this then I may have a new brand favorite.</li>
    <li> This produce is very good; however, I find it&#x27;s easy to get it too dark with very little pressure.  I also would like a refillable finer &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, but I am still open to trying other products.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> She loved it! Super fast shipping also!!</li>
    <li> Very hard. Color tone has more of an army green than the grey.&lt;br /&gt;It maybe that the vendors product is old. Tried using it twice then just tossed in the garbage. Wast of money.</li>
    <li> I use this every day even, even if just to comb my crazy morning eyebrows into place. It&#x27;s  a great shade and blends in pretty seamlessly.</li>
    <li> Anyone can use this stuff!!! It is the perfect color for everyone. You can make it darker or lighter how ever you want it!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this and keep multiple pencils on hand so that I never run out!</li>
    <li> Love love love this pencil! Only one I use.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in a New Beauty Test Tube and it was a surprisingly great product. I had never heard of the brand before, but after using it consistently on my brows, I can say its just as good as the Anastasia eyebrow pencil I had used, and its less expensive. I am happy to see Amazon is selling it because its sold out on the brand website. The color is perfect for my dark brows and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I have used these eyebrow pencils for some time, and love them.  They can go from a fairly light color, to however dark you want with how much pressure you use when applying.  Was so happy to find them on Amazon, as I used to get them from the shopping channel, and they have not been available there for a long time.  They are definitely one of my staples.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It provides excellent color for my eyebrows.  I love that I do not have to sharpent this pencil.</li>
    <li> It fades. I don&#x27;t even have oily skin so not sure why it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Had been ordering this from HSN - I love this eyebrown pencil  - super easy to apply and it really stays on all day and night - I wish there was as much product as it appears - it does run out very quickly - but other then that it looks like real eyebrow and that&#x27;s enough for me ..</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product ...</li>
    <li> I am blonde, but still need eyebrows. This is the MOST versatile pencil I have ever owned. Will buy it as long as they make it. Would highly recommend for ANYONE!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied ... Will re-order when needed!!</li>
    <li> this is by far my most favorite eyebrow pencil. it works so well that it is worth ordering in bulk!</li>
    <li> After watching all the hype, finally tried this pencil.  Lead flaked off while using. Eyebrows looked dirty even with the lightest pressure. Certainly does not perform as advertised. Will not order again.  Brush at end is nice; however, you can use any cleaned mascara brush and get same result.</li>
    <li> Used this pencil twice, on the third day the pencil was empty already. unfortunately I bought three of them will not reorder!</li>
    <li> An awesome product! Very easy to apply. Gives a natural look. Before I tried this pencil, I had troubles finding a matching color in various brow products (like Anastasia, etc). With ybf Eyebrow pencil I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore!</li>
    <li> It is very hard for me to get an eyebrow product since my brows are grey and sparse. This one is perfect.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but past few times I&#x27;ve had problems with applicator.</li>
    <li> Love It! I have been using Lancome for years, It is one of those you have to sharpen and it always crumbled once i got halfway to the end. So half the pencil was wasted because of this! I like the fact that this one you just twist and it works great! Plus it&#x27;s half the price of Lancome and I get the same effect!</li>
    <li> best eyebrow pencil i ever got.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> My 15 yr old daughter has blonde eyebrows and I bought this for her.  She prefers her eyebrows to be visible and this is perfect for her.  Not to dark, looks natural.  Ive used it a couple times (Im 51) but I don&#x27;t wear much makeup anyway.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I love finding quality cruelty free products. I like it, era specially how easy and the brush, but one color isn&#x27;t quite perfect.</li>
    <li> The pencil is good, but the caps do not stay on.</li>
    <li> I love the color -- truly universal.  However, the pencil &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; part fell out and broke within one week of using.  I had the same problem with the It Cosmetics Universal Eyebrow Pencil, so I thought I would try this.  Bummer!</li>
    <li> I love, love YBF Eyebrow Pencil and have been using it for years and will continue to keep using it as my only eyebrow pencil.  YBF please don&#x27;t stop making this product!  I have very short eyebrows due to age, over twee-zing, gray hairs and this fills in and adds to my eyebrow very nicely.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect.  You can go over your eyebrows to get a more dramatic look if that&#x27;s what you want.  Great neutral color at a great price.  A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I use the YBF eye brow pencil for years. I tried othe products but always returned to it.&lt;br /&gt;It will give the user a light or dark shade depending on the perssure used.&lt;br /&gt;Blond, brunets, and every shade in between can use it.</li>
    <li> In a word: AWESOME!!  I am always trying to find another better brow product either in pencil or powder.  I keep coming back to YBF.  I purchased this years ago on HSN and now I buy via Amazon.  Used with my Anastasia spoolie, Nars concealer as an under brow highlighter, and Maybelline brow gel - I&#x27;m set.  Told ya&#x27;...I&#x27;ve been shopping around.</li>
    <li> I like this product, the only problem I had is the pencil dropped out after a few uses and although I have pushed it back,  I am concerned it will break.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Can&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched and searched and now I&#x27;ve found the PERFECT eyebrow pencil. I can&#x27;t even begin to add up the dollars I&#x27;ve spent in the last few months trying to find the right eyebrow product. (Amazon can certainly verify this statement :-) Either the product was too dark or too light. Too thick and clumpy or too watery and left streaks after an hour or so. I even used one that flaked. What an attractive look, flakes on my eyelashes and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ybf pencil was perfect from the get-go. Pencil glided while applying. I swear, tears came to my eyes. And after using the eyebrow spooly brush to even out the look? A feeling of pure JOY. I now have NATURAL looking eyebrows. Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound stupid that an eyebrow pencil could make a person this happy? If you&#x27;re a 55+ woman, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first Ybf product I&#x27;ve used. The eyebrow pencil certainly makes me want to try other Ybf products.</li>
    <li> My favorite pencil.  I have bought this from other vendors and this one seemed a little darker.  This is the best price I have found on this product, so I will try again.</li>
    <li> The pencil broke right away good color though</li>
    <li> I love this brow pencil! Especially for my thinning brows. This is my second one.&lt;br /&gt;But when I started to use this one the whole lead fell out.</li>
    <li> I ordered the red pen received a different one the pencil was black and not the one that changes to match the brow color</li>
    <li> This is probably the best brow pencil I have used. It&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
    <li> YBF eyebrow pencil isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve ever had - it goes on too DARK with little pressure and it it still very difficult to apply when you do the 3 dots and apply lightly.  I agree with one thing - if your eyebrows are fair to good and shapely - this is a good pencil, however, if you have eyebrows like me - over-plucked, uneven, sparse in places then girls, it stinks.  Tracy has great eyebrows.  The pencil itself - the lead is too thick and they most definitely don&#x27;t give you enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best eyebrow pencil for uneven, sparse, over-plucked eyebrows is CLINQUE superfine line - this little diddy works great and it is really superfine.</li>
    <li> Different strokes for different folks….eyebrow color matching that is … light strokes for taupes/heavier strokes for brown-black shades.&lt;br /&gt;Another one of my I&#x27;ll walk around the world to find this product…been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Costly but wasn&#x27;t right for me with no eyebrows</li>
    <li> very nice. soft pencil which makes application easy. I think you can soften the color with the roller brush if it seems too dark. It is a neutral color. I think most people would be very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The taupe color is perfect - not too dark!</li>
    <li> What is this really?!.</li>
    <li> Only problems with the pencil is the price. A bit too expensive for only 1 pencil.</li>
    <li> Pretty pricey for eyebrow pencil with a eyelash brush on the other end. I could have taken an old eyelash brush and used it with any brow pencil and have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;It is handy tho for folks that don&#x27;t mind the price. For me , I hate that I bought it.</li>
