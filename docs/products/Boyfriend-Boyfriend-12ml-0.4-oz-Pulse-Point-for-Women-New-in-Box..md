      <li>it&#x27;s beautiful, not overpowering, and worth the $20 for the pulse point oil.</li>
      <li>and the fragrance is very strong.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m glad i did.  </li>
      <li>The men LOVE IT on me at work.  </li>
      <li>I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!  </li>
      <li>I love the scent have gotton so many compliments, its a shame its discontinued</li>
      <li>It is a favorite of my girlfriend.</li>
      <li>This has men leaning in to get a better sniff and women will ask what your wearing.</li>
      <li>Love this thing.</li>
      <li>We (meaning my man and I) simply LOVE this scent.</li>
      <li>most give me a headache or just aren&#x27;t my style.</li>
      <li>I oredered the pulse point and its perfect for a concentrated  dash of fragrance that goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I really like this by itself but it&#x27;s also great to layer with fragrances I find too sweet or floral.</li>
      <li>i strongly suggest trying it on before buying it.</li>
      <li>on me this has a wonderful woody, slightly [i guess]</li>
      <li>more mild than original</li>
      <li>also it&#x27;s blended with sweet almond oil</li>
      <li>Nice soft fragrance that stays with you all day.</li>
      <li>Once I learned not to go overboard applying it, I loved it!</li>
      <li>and i love it because it&#x27;s an identifiable ingredient.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad they brought the roller ball bottles back in style.  </li>
      <li>I first saw this product being featured on HSN as part of a set.  </li>
      <li>love the scent - is the only place to find it now</li>
      <li>its okay not quite as i expected.</li>
      <li>I was very tempted to order it, but decided against it because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it if I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
      <li>much like vanilla pipe tobacco and to me</li>
      <li>, I want straight up intoxicating vanilla)</li>
      <li>I had some left from my original one and there is no comparison.  </li>
      <li>I might have found my new fave perfume!</li>
      <li>finally found it at a local sephora and have been in love w/ it since.  </li>
      <li>but I feel this bottle is old as it is much darker in color</li>
      <li>But I find myself refreshing my pulse points with it anyway later in the day just because I like how it smells (reminds me of Tresor and Miracle Intense a little).  </li>
      <li>This perfume doesnt have the same sharp after scent of most perfumes.</li>
      <li>perfume depends a lot on your natural body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>Smells even better after the dry down.</li>
      <li>the dry down is a creamy sweet but not cloying vanilla.  </li>
      <li>Interestingly enough, the women barely notice the fragrance at all.  </li>

<li> I have had fragrance in the past</li>
<li> i&#x27;ve read that a few people have broken the roller balls</li>
<li> Just roll it on behind your ears, and on your wrists &amp; you&#x27;re set!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Kate Walsh has excellent taste. This perfume doesnt have the same sharp after scent of most perfumes. I call it the headache scent. So this is perfect for me, and it smells great. I do not believe this is for everyone. i strongly suggest trying it on before buying it.</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes! Love this thing. Throw it in the purse and I&#x27;m good to go! It&#x27;s a great scent, love the vanilla notes.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not a big buyer of commercial scents.  most give me a headache or just aren&#x27;t my style. i did a search on a perfume site for &#x27;vanilla&#x27; perfumes to see what was out there and hopefully find something simple. for some reason i clicked this one and i&#x27;m glad i did.  the notes are along the same lines so you don&#x27;t have an overload of varied scents mixed.  finally found it at a local sephora and have been in love w/ it since.  i bought the pulse point oil and haven&#x27;t tried the EDP.  perfume depends a lot on your natural body chemistry.  on me this has a wonderful woody, slightly [i guess] musk smell, a delicious vanilla, creamy sweetness, and a note i couldn&#x27;t put my finger on.  i finally realized it was tobacco.  much like vanilla pipe tobacco and to me it&#x27;s not offensive, but delightful.  the dry down is a creamy sweet but not cloying vanilla.  the roller ball is perfect and surprising because the ball itself it metal which is new to me.  also it&#x27;s blended with sweet almond oil and i love it because it&#x27;s an identifiable ingredient.  i&#x27;ve read that a few people have broken the roller balls [it&#x27;s glass] in their purses so as an extra precaution i leave it in the package in my bag.  all in all as a designer scent it&#x27;s beautiful, not overpowering, and worth the $20 for the pulse point oil.</li>
    <li> Just recieved this Fragrance Today, and it is a realy great Scent. Try it i know you will like it.</li>
    <li> ...if you like this scent, use sparingly! I got a sample of Boyfriend from my daughter and loved it!! I purchased this one and found it to be stronger than the sample. Once I learned not to go overboard applying it, I loved it!</li>
    <li> Happy to have found this perfume.  It is a favorite of my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> This scent reminds me of nag champa incense, vanilla and a bit of patchouli. I just love it! Smells even better after the dry down. I oredered the pulse point and its perfect for a concentrated  dash of fragrance that goes a long way. Just roll it on behind your ears, and on your wrists &amp; you&#x27;re set! You can throw it in your purse and do touch ups if need be but I find that my initial swipes last for hours. I recommend the pulse point.</li>
    <li> its okay not quite as i expected. more mild than original</li>
    <li> I think that this is &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; perfume - it appears to be cloudy, not clear which is why I think it was in the owners/sellers possession for a lengthy period of time before being sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like this by itself but it&#x27;s also great to layer with fragrances I find too sweet or floral.</li>
    <li> Im on a vanilla kick and Ive set out to find all the non-foody vanilla smells (I dont want to smell like a cupcake or a sugar cookie, I want straight up intoxicating vanilla) This one fits the bill. This has men leaning in to get a better sniff and women will ask what your wearing. Its not overpowering but has some good staying power. I like its an oil roller ball, so you dont need to &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34; a ton of it on.  I might have found my new fave perfume!</li>
    <li> love the scent - is the only place to find it now</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my sister - she loves it. Best gift she received.&lt;br /&gt;I will ask her to send me a picture as she applies Boyfriend Pulse Point.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product being featured on HSN as part of a set.  I was very tempted to order it, but decided against it because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it if I didn&#x27;t like it.  So, I chose Amazon.  Well, well, well. Let me tell you:  I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!  This fragrance mixes with my chemistry EXTREMELY WELL!  Not powerful, not overwhelming, just right. The men LOVE IT on me at work.  They have to get close to smell it. Sometimes too close (LOL).  Interestingly enough, the women barely notice the fragrance at all.  It lasts, and lasts, and lasts.  But I find myself refreshing my pulse points with it anyway later in the day just because I like how it smells (reminds me of Tresor and Miracle Intense a little).  Hats off to Kate Walsh and I will be purchasing it again (Pulse Point Oil) once I run out of this one.  I prefer to stick with what I know works on me [[ASIN:B004KXJRCK Boyfriend Boyfriend 0.4 oz Pulse Point Oil]].  Thank you Kate and thank you Amazon and Sephora!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, let me also add:  I&#x27;m so glad they brought the roller ball bottles back in style.  Good luck with your purchase.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice soft fragrance that stays with you all day.</li>
    <li> I love the scent have gotton so many compliments, its a shame its discontinued</li>
    <li> We (meaning my man and I) simply LOVE this scent. It&#x27;s very sexy.</li>
    <li> I have had fragrance in the past but I feel this bottle is old as it is much darker in color and the fragrance is very strong. I had some left from my original one and there is no comparison.  Would like to return this as it is not usable.</li>
    <li> Perfume is great. Delivered even earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Very good my wife loves it</li>
    <li> This is the best smell ever.</li>
    <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
