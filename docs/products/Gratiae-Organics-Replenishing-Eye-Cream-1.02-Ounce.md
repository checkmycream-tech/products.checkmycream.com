      <li>A great companion to the Gratiae eye serum.  </li>
      <li>I got them in October 2013 at 30 $ each and now just 10$. Great product, no issue.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this cream, it is great.</li>
      <li>Even with the expense of paying for both, it&#x27;s a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If the product is so great why can&#x27;t you get a refund if the items are unopened?</li>
      <li>The Yalmeh product works great.</li>
      <li>AND I SAY THESE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT</li>
      <li>Great as a hundred dollars face cream.</li>
      <li>This works great, have been using it for a while.  </li>
      <li>This has been a great product for my skin.</li>
      <li>Great age reducing results.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product, because I&#x27;m just about out of my Yalmeh eye cream, and I saw this had great reviews and was cheaper.</li>
      <li>The best we can do for our skins is keep it clean and moist with either a day or night cream, the cheapest that doesn&#x27;t irritate is the best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
      <li>I do feel better about always applying something.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT pay over $18.00 for this!!</li>
      <li>Love Gratiae!!</li>
      <li>This cream works, it tightens the skin, and has a very nice texture.</li>
      <li>Product feels very nice when applied</li>
      <li>and I thought it was amazing!</li>
      <li>My wife really liked Gratiae Organics Replenishing Eye Cream because it met your expectations!</li>
      <li>Liked the feel of the product, but not the $200 price tag!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Although after hours of wear it starts to peel off, the best under eye shadow cover I&#x27;ve found are the Meaningful Beauty Wrinkle Smoothing Capsules.  </li>
      <li>Get unscented version, it still has a pleasant honey type smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I am always looking for good organic product, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>The product is good to use and I see definate results for wrinkle reduction around the eyes</li>
      <li>I think it’s a rip off from the stores, but from amazon its a great price and an effective, quality product.</li>
      <li>Got it as a gift, mom loved it</li>
      <li>I take really good care of myself, but menopause and time was beginning to show.</li>
      <li>It makes my eyes feel good.</li>
      <li>The price is really good also.</li>
      <li>spatula is good to prevent contamination</li>
      <li>All good.</li>
      <li>It  smells nice, goes on good and feels good, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Exceptional product.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Very glad I bought this.  </li>
      <li>And we are very pleased that we these products through Amazon to get home in the Netherlands.  </li>

      <li>Absolutely the best thing yet!</li>
      <li>Good moisturizing effects which lasts most of the day</li>
      <li>They wanted $300 for a jar of that stuff, but there was no way I was spending that kind of money, so I started to walk away.</li>

      <li>Nice cream..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream</li>
      <li>Is a nice eyecream.</li>
      <li>This order arrived fast and in excellent condition--well packaged.  </li>
      <li>The serum goes on really nice, but does nothing for my puffiness.</li>
      <li>I love this product as it really works great!</li>
      <li>Many thanks, best regards,  Wilhelmus Holierook, Haarlem, Netherlands</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant but not ever powering, kind of like sweet almond oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is wonderful, it absorbs into your skin and leaves you feeling silky soft.</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the best and used with the serum.</li>
      <li>This is the best for my skin so far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am completely disappointed. The pot was sealed, but the cream inside was old and like glue. I am based in Europe and this was only about 10 USD, so it is not worth sending it back, but I won&#x27;t buy from this seller again. Gratiae in general is a superb product.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Glad i found it on amazon for a good price.  Helps the wrinkles</li>
    <li> It  smells nice, goes on good and feels good, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have tons of allergies and dark circles under my eyes. The cream seems to calm the puffiness down over night.</li>
    <li> NOT for people sensitive to Vitamin A. I found out too late that I can not use any products with Retinol which is Vitamin A. Now, I can not use any of the products and can not return.  Gave me a horrible rash, took forever to find out what was causing it. Too late to return!</li>
    <li> Sort of a duplication of other moisture products.  I have not reordered it.</li>
    <li> I use this morning and evening. I have used it about 5 weeks. This has been a great product for my skin. I have oily skin on my forehead and normal to dry everywhere else. The lines around my eyes have started to disappear before my very eyes.. I also use the Replenishing Eye Serum under the cream and I have not had dark circles or puffiness under my eyes for about 3 weeks. Under my eyes always seemed dry no matter what \\&quot;great\\&quot; product for eyes I tried. I can&#x27;t believe the dryness has seem to have disappeared. Also, I use it on the lids of my eyes, and have found the skin on my eyelids don&#x27;t seem to wrinkle when I put on eyeliner like they did before I used this. I have pretty much tried most face creams found in stores like Walmart, Target, and CVS. This is the best for my skin so far. I am 54, white, female. I don&#x27;t really know why this is better for me than any other, but it is so much better I have gone back and bought another jar so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft, but not sure what it does.</li>
    <li> It is fine but haven&#x27;t seen a difference on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased this product from a retail business and paid waaaay too much for it, although it was very effective. I purchased this time online for a greatly reduced price, but I think the product may have passed its shelf life as the consistency was quite thick and gluey, a much different viscosity not easy to apply evenly. The trade off for reduced price I suppose.</li>
    <li> Product feels very nice when applied&lt;br /&gt;No improvement in skin</li>
    <li> I like the cream although it is not as creamy as I would have anticipated, particularly for the sensitive eye area.</li>
    <li> This product is only so-so, in my experience. I&#x27;ve compared it to the Olay Regenerist and I prefer the Olay product. I&#x27;ve tried the Gratiae products in the past and been impressed, but they were WAY overpriced ~ will probably not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent .. It us the best</li>
    <li> Pro: If I get it in my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t sting! Some high end eye creams (lancome for example) will sting even if rinsed out repeatedly. The smell is pleasant but not ever powering, kind of like sweet almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;It applies very easily, not runny. Not too thick that it drags across my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Well, I don&#x27;t really see a difference after using it religiously for three weeks. (I&#x27;m 27 years old, Caucasian, minimal sun damage) I do feel better about always applying something.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT pay over $18.00 for this!! It&#x27;s nice, but not that nice. I read a few reviews that said they paid a couple hundred dollars in the mall- I&#x27;m sorry, you were taken;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotions that have worked well for me in the past: Malibu hemp, plain lotion about $5.00 at Walmart. I put it all over my face except nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;The Naked Bee: Absolutely the best thing yet! Get unscented version, it still has a pleasant honey type smell. I am an RN and it works great on my hands for work and face before bedtime. I was pregnant with twins in 2012 and rubbed it on my belly after showering, no stretch marks!! (I also drank tons of water, so that could be a contributing factor...)</li>
    <li> Great deal.. Don&#x27;t get suckered in at the mall w the high price for this product... Love this product!</li>
    <li> There was a little very hard wax on the bottom of the jar.  Looks like it melted - my wife was very disappointed</li>
    <li> Does not moisturize well, does nothing for the fine lines. I wasted my money on this on. I&#x27;ll be looking for something better</li>
    <li> I love this product as it really works great! I noticed the difference on the second day I tried it. thank you.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Mine does say expire in 2015 and does nothing for you.</li>
    <li> Saw product in LV and they quoted price of $225.  Way too much and found it online.  I really didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference between this product and other products though it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> I just got back from Las Vegas and was sucked in at the Miracle Mile store. They did one of my eyes and 3 days later it still looks great! My other eye has a dark circle under it and a little more puffy.  I just hope they didn&#x27;t use something other than the \\&quot;real\\&quot; stuff. I am ordering the eye serum and can&#x27;t wait to fix my other eye. I knew they were high pressure and was hoping I could get it online - YEAH!</li>
    <li> I love the replenishing eye cream as well. I was given a sample at the mall and it worked so well that I was prompted to order it as well as try the facial serum and eye serum. I&#x27;m enjoying all of them.</li>
    <li> Giving this a low score.  Have purchased this eye cream in the past and have been very pleased.  However this time the expiration date is within 2 months of date of purchase, thus the low score. Inventory needs to be managed better.  It takes me 6 to 9 months to use this product.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this satiny smooth product very much.  It does not melt and seep into eyes along wrinkle lines like some moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> This works great, have been using it for a while.  Makes lines around eye less visible.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, intact, and with seals in place.  This is a cream that really like but I will not pay the kiosk prices for it.</li>
    <li> Tions Gratiea Organics is fantastic, my wife is thus came into contact with our visit to Las Vegas.  For her, this is a great product, mainly because they suffer from allergies.  The Gratiea products for her as a gift from heaven.  Since they used it she sees a lot better, does not suffer from allergies of her skin.  And we are very pleased that we these products through Amazon to get home in the Netherlands.  Many thanks, best regards,  Wilhelmus Holierook, Haarlem, Netherlands</li>
    <li> Love love love Gratiae!  This eye cream is superb.  Moisturizes with out being greasy, not to mention ~ helps get rid of wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I have no adverse reaction to this moisturizer. A friend, who used to work at a kiosk recommended me buying this cram at amazon for a fraction of a price. It did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> If anything, the dark circles under my eyes seemed darker. Although after hours of wear it starts to peel off, the best under eye shadow cover I&#x27;ve found are the Meaningful Beauty Wrinkle Smoothing Capsules.  This Gratiae Eye Cream joins the bag of products on which I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy and fit my skin type! Improved and soothing under eye lines, keep skin supple and vibrant! I Like it!</li>
    <li> After using for a few days, I had to stop. It kept getting into my eyes and blurring my vision even though I used little and carefully kept it away from my eyes and just used it on the brow bone and low on the circle of my eye. I found that I had to remove it within a few hours because of this and because my eyes would itch.  Too bad, I would have liked to be able to use it; it is very nice and creamy and smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> Received free samples in Las Vegas, but was not willing to pay $100 and up. It&#x27;s not a  miracle, my wrinkles will never disappear but it&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve found in drugstores and certainly cheaper than anything at department/cosmetic stores.  Clean scent, absorbs quickly and does soften the under eye area.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t do better.</li>
    <li> wish i could find more</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift, mom loved it</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel like velvet. The scent is very light and  it goes on so smooth. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Yep, I&#x27;m one of the ones that got taken at the mall, but got about nine products for $300, so didn&#x27;t feel as bad. I really like the products, most especially the eye cream, which I use day and night. I bought like six of them and I put the cream into an empty pump-style dispenser, which keeps it fresh and easier to dispense. I&#x27;ve given a couple of these to my sister and my friend, and will continue to purchase on amazon because the product is good and the price is great!</li>
    <li> does not work for my puffy under eyes even after religiously applying it along with the serum for one month, did not make any other change to my under eye area. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Exceptional product.  As mentioned by many others, I purchased this eye care product from a kiosk at a mall for a hefty price.  It seemed to work wonders in the mall.  So, I purchased the product.  I used it sparingly and noticed a dramatic improvement in the lines around my eyes; especially in the winter when my facial skin gets dry due to heated buildings and lack of humidity.  I tried a few other products after I finished it; because it was so pricey.  And, to my amazement, I found it on Amazon at a fraction of the original cost!  I use this product in conjunction with the eye serum and will never go back to another product.  It has limited smell and goes on creamy; and, my skin drinks it up.  Remember, a little goes a long way.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Hello, Just have to tell you all..was at the Mall in Las Vegas last week and got dragged into the Gratiae store...long story short...the guy that dragged me in acually told me to leave his store and that I have wasted his time...was shocked...just because I told him I wanted to do my research on the products...well when I got home I did my research on the Gratiae products I was very impressed...so glad I was dragged into the store to find such a great product but not at the outrages price...Thanks for having this product at this price instead of the $245.00 he was going to sell to me for...By the way...he did give a sample of the eye cream and have been using it everyday...love love it...</li>
    <li> Because this was such a great deal at $18.09 - I had high hopes.  Sold on their website for $349.99 !!&lt;br /&gt;Are they kidding?  This is outrageous.  Unfortunately, it caused eye irritation.  These people are all over the country ripping people off for hundreds, thousands of dollars.  I believe that they sell under many different names.  My friend got duped for $500.00 in a small shop in Kennebunkport, Maine.  Beware!</li>
    <li> I like Gratiae products. They blend into your skin smoothly and quickly. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing. I first started with a sample, I was never going to pay the ridiculous amounts being asked for in the malls. I was excited to see this on Amazon at such a great price. It really helps with wrinkles and makes the skin look firmer. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Best products around!</li>
    <li> I am 50 and I look 35. I have used everything under the sun on my skin. I discovered this line a year ago and I will never go back. They are hands down the best products I have ever used. My skin is literally unbelievable!!</li>
    <li> Just using this product for the first time and am seeing good results...I use this product over the Gratiae Organic Replenishing Eye&lt;br /&gt;Serum ...both products are worth their weight in gold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Would not buy it again--doesn&#x27;t seem to do much that any other face cream would do.</li>
    <li> Bottle was not new had been used</li>
    <li> Very good relation quality-price. This cream works, it tightens the skin, and has a very nice texture. Use at night.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I received this in Las Vegas and feel in love with the sample. I was not going to pay a lot for it, so ordering it was perfect, very pleased</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had enough time to use this product, so I didn&#x27;t have real result yet, but im very excite to see.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> This order arrived fast and in excellent condition--well packaged.  my friends and I&lt;br /&gt;now all use the Gratiae  eye cream system,  really works and products last for&lt;br /&gt;almost a year.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye cream. Reduces lines and puffiness around eyes. I also use it on my neck as it works better than serum lifting products. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered six items from this same seller, and they came in vastly different conditions --- not very smart! One tub of eye cream came in perfect condition, while the other was already opened and used, with contents oozing out over the aluminium foil that is supposed to air-seal its contents. Very disturbing as to how little integrity this seller has to its customers! The same thing happened with the thermal mask, which was in much worse condition, almost like a cement paste that is completely unusable. The facial serum feels unusually thick and gooey when it came, even though I couldn&#x27;t tell whether it had been pre-opened or not. Definitely vet this seller Amazon! This does not look good for you!</li>
    <li> This product helps with the dry, puffy look under eyes that we sometimes get after not enough sleep. It firms that area while hydrating at the same time. Non-greasy. I can put my make up on almost right away.</li>
    <li> I received the eye cream 1 month before it&#x27;s experation date. It is extremely dry and thick. It is a complete disappointment</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream, not a miracle in a jar. It hydrates. I paid under 20. for it and it&#x27;s worth that, but no more!</li>
    <li> Give a smoother look and replenishes my dark circles.  This product needs to be used on a daily basis .  I was expose to this product by a Nail salon</li>
    <li> Use after the replenishing eye serum. Very good price on Amazon.  But worth the premium price to buy some at the Kiosk at Venetian and learn how to use all the products. Support our youth.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizing .Has to be use every day. Great as a hundred dollars face cream. Does not have a lasting effect.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but unfortunately the last shipment I received I needed to return because it was all crusty and dried up.</li>
    <li> Used it for over 6 months. Product did nothing for me. Will stick with Lancome.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I was a sucker that purchased this is vegas for alot before discovering it on Amazon.  It works great and you can see the difference immediately after applying.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product. I started using the GRATiAE product in the beginning of last year &#x27;13. I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon! I no longer have to deal with the parking at our very busy mall to purchase the product. This is wonderful, it absorbs into your skin and leaves you feeling silky soft. I love the fact it is organic. My eyes are hydrated and not greasy feeling. I have not experienced any smudging of my mascara. You do need to let it soak in before applying your mascara. I am sold out on GRATiAE products and am very thankful I have found it here. Thanks!! Regarding the shipping, it came faster than expected and was package nicely. Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to look and feel better about their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Found out about in Vegas walking along while shopping. Ran out, and looked on line to find some more.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best stuff to use on your eyes. Seriously.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Been using the products for awhile and love them.  This is one of my favorite products.  Try it.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream as long as you use it with Grataie eye serum.  The combination is terrific--the cream by itself not so much at least for my dry skin.  The combination works better than my previous $250 dollar eye cream.  Even with the expense of paying for both, it&#x27;s a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Business Lady</li>
    <li> My friend and I recently purchased products from Adore in the Grand Canal Shoppes in Las Vegas. We were, like everyone else, dragged inside the store by a very high pressure salesman and had several products applied to our faces which all worked wonderfully. The products were great, and we were given a \\&quot;special\\&quot; deal for so much cheaper than regular price, so they said. Anyway, we purchased the facial cleanser, toner, exfoliator, eye serum, eye cream, and the moisturizer.....all which did not work at all when we got home. There is absolutely no way that they products used in this store were the same thing we purchased. Clearly we were scammed. I&#x27;m so disappointed that this store is in such a reputable/high class mall. Consumers beware, do not buy these products!!!</li>
    <li> Is a nice eyecream. Soaks right in &amp; makes your skin very soft I use it around my lips &amp; on expression marks too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t moisturize at all.  Didn&#x27;t soak into my skin.  Avon products work better!  I started using Clarins Total Eye care and that&#x27;s the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It requires very little product to get results. Wrinkles disappear almost immediately. Great age reducing results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok..glad I didn&#x27;t pay retail! It&#x27;s a nice cream just nothing fantastic</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!!!!</li>
    <li> en, not bat, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Yesterday I narrowly escaped one of the dreaded mall salespeople. And yes, the experience was just as bad as everyone else here.&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t harass me but definitely gave the high pressured sales pitch, and the discounted price (two products for $199 vs $400). I don&#x27;t know where they find these people or if they somehow brainwash them but she was good.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this product.&lt;br /&gt;After my mall experience, I Googled the product and was ecstatic to find it so much cheaper here. Well, when something looks too good to be true it usually is, and this case is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this and the serum - the two products I tried in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the same. First, the seal on the moisture cream was broken. The box itself was shrunk wrapped but anyone can do that. Second, the smell was different. And most importantly, it did not deliver the same results. Within minutes of using the product in the store I noticed a difference. And since they only did one eye, and the effects lasted overnight, I was able to compare. The eye treated with this product did not show any change. Normally eye creams take a while, certainly. But, in the case of the serum and cream at the store, my results were noticeable within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do. This product is clearly fake but the salespeople at the mall are also scam artists. What&#x27;s a middle aged woman to do?</li>
    <li> Would not recommend.  The package was open and leaking upon delivery and the product stings my eyes after just one use.  Threw it out.</li>
    <li> unlike other reviews I&#x27;m finding this product last a long time and I can clearly see the difference on my skin</li>
    <li> I had a rash on my eyelid that would go away with cortizone cream but would come back within a few days after I stopped using it. Since I&#x27;ve started using this cream, the rash has disappeared and my 50 year old laugh lines are slowly filling in. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approx 2 weeks, I like the results, smooth &amp; no dark circles, however it seems to &amp;#34;leak&amp;#34; into my eyes, which is odd?  After applying, my eyes sometimes get cloudy, so I tried using less &amp; that seems to help.  Seems better for night use, then make up doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> I use this cream along with the replenishing eye serum. The area around my eyes are very smooth and soft and I&#x27;m 65!!!! A little goes a long way, plus I only use the two twice a week.</li>
    <li> Package arrived leaking. Treatment made my eyes red sore and swollen had to discard.this company also charges 375.00 for the same product in their retail stores with high pressure sales team</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing effects which lasts most of the day</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous!!</li>
    <li> I only recently started to use this (3 weeks) so I cant comment too much on its effectiveness but so far it brightens my eye area&lt;br /&gt;It is moisture rich, smells good and a good thick texture that easily dissolves when gently rubbed into the eye area&lt;br /&gt;The included spatula is good to prevent contamination&lt;br /&gt;I use twice a day and I am hoping so see significant results soon</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, because I&#x27;m just about out of my Yalmeh eye cream, and I saw this had great reviews and was cheaper. Bad idea. My eyes feel sticky, they do not feel refreshed, and turn red and look really weird when I use this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I&#x27;m completely dissatisfied and am purchasing the Yalmeh eye cream again. Here is the link for that: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXADQ4M/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1. The Yalmeh product works great. I initially bought it to clear up by dark eye circle I have either genetically or from rubbing my eyes from allergies I was born with or both. It doesn&#x27;t work for reducing dark eye circles, but it does stop the puffiness and makes it feel smooth, and when I use it in the morning my eyes feel refreshed instead of crusty, and same as when I apply it at night I wake up and my eyes feel great! I would suggest the Yalmeh product if you have similar symptoms that I experienced with this product, and it&#x27;s organic too!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this particular brand in Las Vegas about a year ago. I paid a much higher price but was very pleased with the product&#x27;s results. It has a wonderful feel to it and my mineral makeup goes on top of it flawlessly.  It seems to have tweaked the fine lines and made my skin seem more youthful.(I get compliments all the time. I am 65.) I am most appreciative that I can continue to use this product at such  large discounted prices from Amazon.com. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to reccommend Gratiae products to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used. Believe me, I have tried so many. This cream does wonders for the sensitive eye area. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to buy on Amazon and don&#x27;t buy in Vegas. The prices in Vegas are so expensive.</li>
    <li> This eye cream feels soothing to my eye area. I am careful not to get it into my eye, just underneath and a little above the eye lid. It is expensive, so I use sparingly, but I think it is worth the price!</li>
    <li> I usually love this eye cream, but what was sent this time was no longer spreadable even though the expiration date seemed to be 9/15.</li>
    <li> If I had a million $ I would but this product all day long!! My mother in law is obsessed with it...</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference when I tried this in Vegas, so decided to order, the product I received was exactly the same. It makes my eyes feel good. I noticed a difference in the tiny lines and texture under my eyes within 5 minutes of use. I am 49 and fortunate not to have a lot of wrinkles,so someone with a lot of wrinkles might take longer to notice a difference. I highly recommend. The product does have a smell that some people might not like, but because I had tried it I knew before hand it had it. I don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
    <li> This leaves my eye area feel so soft and I love the smell.  I can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference in the lines around my eyes though.  Been using it for several weeks now.  I should really take before and after pics to see if there really is a difference.</li>
    <li> WE TOOOO were persuaded in the shop and tolerated the same high pressure sales techniques, and stupidly bought without checking the real value. Returning the products next day were refunded within minutes. No problem. From our experience Le Savon is a company employing salesmen trained in high pressure sales techniques which doesnt make them untrustworthy.  Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same products are available on Amazon and other sites very much lower priced.  The immediate visible results the salesman  claims as miraculous occur with any cheap off the shelf moisturizer. We don&#x27;t believe the product works any better. That doesnt make Gratiea better nor worse, just much more expensive and therefore not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research will prove to you that in general no moisturizer - age defying-lifting-wrinkle reducing cream works. Theres no scientific proof at all. The best we can do for our skins is keep it clean and moist with either a day or night cream, the cheapest that doesn&#x27;t irritate is the best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
    <li> This eye cream made my eye lids swell and get a red rash; my eyes burned and ran tears for a week and it was two weeks before I could put anything on them. The fragrance was also very strong and not pleasant at all. I don&#x27;t like strong fruity fragrances in any form and this was overpowering; as was the facial cleanser. Both gave me allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> seems like I can tell there are not as many lines around the eyes. I use it every evening and I&amp;#34;m sure I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> it appeared that the eye cream had  been open and two thirds of the product was used already.  Finger marks and everything! I was very shocked but  use it anyway. I apply  it sparingly and it will be gone in no time at all! Do you send used product for such a discounted price?  I love the eye cream but hate the fact that most of it was missing!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar! I love this stuff! I first bought it in Vegas like so many others at an astronomical price. I will continue to by from Amazon for sure and will be able to buy different products to try because the price is reasonable. I do want to plug the eye serum too! I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so impressed with the difference it makes under my eyes! You can see the results right away!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very soft</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes but doesn&#x27;t help either.  There are better products out there.  Even inexpensive aquaphor works as well.</li>
    <li> If you paid $35 for it, that is. One thing that is confusing is that I&#x27;ve seen this product listed for upwards of $100 in other places. I&#x27;m not sure why there is such a price disparity. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it, because it seemed &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am always looking for good organic product, so I decided to give it a try. You get quite a bit for the price. I mistakenly threw out the white protective covering that seats itself under the lid, and soon found my lotion getting dry around the edges (totally my fault). I transferred it to an empty Lancomb container, and it&#x27;s done just fine since then. So, my one comment is that it would be nice to not have to have a secondary covering that you have to take off and replace every time you use the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it works, I&#x27;m pretty happy. A little goes a long way, so the only time the product doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; is when I&#x27;ve used too much. I don&#x27;t wear this under makeup during the day, only at night while I&#x27;m sleeping, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it does under makeup. But over all, it seems to be a solid product which is gentle and organic, and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite. I use it all the time,</li>
    <li> very good product fractions of the price of the website price</li>
    <li> I tried this in Vegas through a Vendor at Planet Hollywood,and it was awesome,  the product I ordered is evidently not the same as what they were selling for $300.00 even thought they appear to be the same....</li>
    <li> Awesome product, all the ladies in my family use it!</li>
    <li> love these products. makes your skin softer and feeling fresh and very moist</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best and used with the serum.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but had to since I can not contact Amazon to complain.  When I received the product the seal was there but you can tell that it was opened then placed over the jar opening.  And that some of the cream from within the jar was on top of the seal.  I then removed the seal and you can see that the cream was on the outside rig of the jar.  I used some of the product; thinking that the jar had fallen causing the issues I saw.  Later I thought what if who ever sold it to me filled the jar with a different cream.  Now that I used it once, I feel I can not get my money back from Amazon.  And I am scared I don&#x27;t actually have the product I think I purchased.</li>
    <li> A great companion to the Gratiae eye serum.  The jar is pretty.....good grief. I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say.</li>
    <li> Not all that like their serum but will use it up. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again though.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty picky about money spent on such things...good to try but not twice.</li>
    <li> the cream came out of the bottle, during shipping I guess, and it looked very dirty and smell old</li>
    <li> Used in tandem with the eye serum has worked wonders. Would recommend to anyone who wants high end product at a affordable price.</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old and have used this product for several years. I do believe it works as advertised</li>
    <li> I have only used this eye cream for a few days and it does leave skin soft although I cannot say that it reverses fine lines under eyes. Be careful not to apply too close to your eyes. I have sensitive eyes and just a small amount of this cream in the vicinity of my eyeballs irritated them for hours.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything</li>
    <li> Amazed to find this cream online at this price.  I have been using it for a year now and I love it.  This seller is THE BEST!!  I will continue to purchase from Amazon and this seller!!</li>
    <li> I first bought this in Vegas for an arm and a leg. Very happy to find the exact same product on Amazon for a zillionth of a fraction of the price. I love this eye cream and use it with the eye serum. My eyes look fresher immediately. Nice fragrance, silky soft texture, not drying. All good.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to brighten up my eye area and make me look more refreshed instead of tired. I would recommend this cream, it is great.</li>
    <li> It seems as though the company resells returned products.  But as far as Gratiae is concerned,  I LOVE IT. The rating is on getting a returned product.</li>
    <li> all gratiae products are wonderful</li>
    <li> NOT THE SAME AS IN THE MALL FOR SURE...WASTE OF MONEY...ON AMAZON...GOT IT THRU....TOP BRAND 4 LESS</li>
    <li> The product was a little thicker than normal and seemed like it had been an older product possibly.  Typically cream is like a lotion notthick and clumpy.</li>
    <li> lid of the cream did not fit, and it seems that the cream had seeped out a little.</li>
    <li> Must use this AFTER the eye serum!  LOVE this product! I have noticed less lines around my eye area.  Super smooth too.</li>
    <li> I love this product along with the serum.  You use very little of the product to see great results,  I will continue to use this on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the mall for $100... Works really well under my eyes and on my eyelids. So much better than anything I&#x27;ve purchased in a drugstore. However it makes my eyeballs very itchy and watery for hours after I apply it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it unless I actually thought it worked. I put it on before bed so it might do a good job while my eyes are closed. I can&#x27;t put this on before going out or to work during the day. It&#x27;s as bad as having really bad allergies. -no redness or swelling or rashes so I&#x27;m not sure if it IS an allergic reaction...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only took one star away because, like I said, it DOES work on dark circles, puffiness, and wrinkles under the eye.</li>
    <li> Very very good! I use it daily and I am very happy with it.  Very glad I bought this.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The ones who say it is more expensive on the kiosks- dont you guys understand that it is organic stuff and it needs even special storage temperature, otherwise it simply doesent work after a while!! The experation date means only until when it is safe to use it but not the time until the priduct gives the result!! Amazon is a wholesale place so do not expect the right storing of these products and the kiosk companies do make it soecial temperature and humidity and lightning and they are redponsible for the saving of quality of those products and that is why it is more expensive and works long time - because when you buy it the salespeople explain you everything you need to know how to make it last long. You dont get this info from amazon and do not expect too much from it, it will simply be a regular cream after 2 month if you dont treat it right!!! You cannot buy a good $350 (official website) cream for $40!!! You really get what you pay for! Better buy non-skin related stuff here, it is great place for that, but remember that you only have one face all life long and you need to think what you treat it with and why the price is so different.</li>
    <li> WHAT ELSE CAN MY DAUGHTER AND I SAY THESE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT AND WE LOVE THE ENTIRE LINE THANKS FOR BEING THERE AND THE PRICES ARE FANTASTIC</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye cream that would be easy to apply (I do not like the creams that come in tubes, such a waste) and also I needed a cream that would help for dark circles. I started using about 3 weeks ago and so far I have liked it, it is organic, has great reviews and it is very affordable. I cannot say it has dramatically smooth out my dark circles, but my main purpose is to keep the eye area care for. I think you need to give it a few months to really see the difference, but so far great product.</li>
    <li> I first tried this cream after I was \\&quot;captured\\&quot; by a very animated sales person at the Gratiae kiosk in the mall. Liked the feel of the product, but not the $200 price tag! Went home and searched the internet. On Amazon I found all the products I&#x27;d sampled at the mall, for a fraction of the cost. Paid about $20 for the eye cream, including free shipping. Been using it every night and notice that the dark around my eyes has faded. Will keep using the product.</li>
    <li> The other 2 prodocts we received are good. But we have yet to receive this one....so therefore I give it a 1* .</li>
    <li> I had a sample and loved it..found it here at this great price and decided to take a chance, all dry in the bottom of the jar..not at all like the sample I came to know and love.</li>
    <li> I tried a small sample before buying and thought it worked well. Over time, though, I was less convinced. Luckily I purchased it on Amazon and didn&#x27;t get REALLY ripped off like others did at kiosks.  There are much better product lines out there, take a pass in this one.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my face feel after applying but I havent seen much difference in under eye tone or firmness or with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time at a salon and paid 3X more over a year ago.  I was so glad to find out it was on Amazon.  This container should last a year. It is great at reducing the look of fine lines around your eyes.</li>
    <li> The cream was dry,if it were old,I open 15 days after I get why not claim.</li>
    <li> Love Gratiae!! I am new to Amazon, and have been buying this product for $20-60 for the last four years! It really works. I fell in love with it the first time at a kiosk in the mall and have used it every since. It works wonders for this lines you get around your eyes when laughing. Just a pinch of this serum whisks wrinkles away! I was not a wrinkle cream or serum user before I found this product at age 43 and I don&#x27;t appear to have aged a day since I found the product! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> buy them now ! I got them in October 2013 at 30 $ each and now just 10$. Great product, no issue. Is 100% organic. My wife has sensible eyes and she can&#x27;t use any product. That works , no irritation at all!</li>
    <li> Have purchased this item several times in the past.  This most recent jar has somewhat dried up.  Very strange.  But love this product, as well as other Gratiae products</li>
    <li> I like these products, but the prices at the mall are out right robbery. For the 4 products I got at the mall I could have saved over $300 if I had bought them on Amazon. I feel so very stupid and cheated. I hope this note helps someone else save money. I try to always check Amazon&#x27;s prices first.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. I definetly saw a difference within a couple days of using it. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for your eyes for the day - you see nearly instant results, and it does last all day.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t call this a truly replenishing cream over time.  You really have to start over each day.  But for the effect, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice cream..nothing unusual but pleasant for the skin.</li>
    <li> I had someone at the mall put this on me and I thought it was amazing! They wanted $300 for a jar of that stuff, but there was no way I was spending that kind of money, so I started to walk away. The guy was so angry at me! He was talking to me like I was stupid and pathetic!(I didn&#x27;t care.) Well, my friend told me she went through the same thing and told me to look on Amazon. Unbelievable! It was like $35!I got that and the serum. Thing is, it is nowhere near as amazing as it was at the mall. The serum goes on really nice, but does nothing for my puffiness. And the cream does nothing for my fine lines. I kind of want to return it, but I was completely out of eye cream anyhow.</li>
    <li> Insert the same remarks that I typed for the anti wrinkle serum. You can copy the remarks and the story.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is really great. Since this the first time I use an eye cream i can see the difference. I stopped buying it and&lt;br /&gt;I felt my eyes needed it. My face and eye area is really dry and I feel a great difference, it&#x27;s not for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Works great 1/4 the price they wanted in Las Vegas, will be ordering more in the future. My this stuff works</li>
    <li> Again, you only need a little, and it goes a long way. I wear contacts and if I use too much it seems to affect my contacts.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It really works. I will definitely purchase again. The price is really good also. This is the cheapest I have found it.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews about this product and thought I would try it out . After receiving it and it originally cost $100.00 you can see why after using it . I found an exceptional product for a true value here on Amazon . It feels like pure silk when applying and is starting to brighten up my eyes and reduce crows feet in just a month ! I highly recommend this product I barely have any crows feet , a sheer brightness , and a smooth moisturizing feeling when using .</li>
    <li> I too was scammed by the store in Las vegas at the TI Hotel/Casino. I was told I had 16 weeks (4 months) to return it if not satisfied. I went to my hotel that evening and researched the product. When I found all the reviews I immediately had buyers remorse and since I was promised an unconditional money back gurantee I went to the store. Only to find out that the sales guy was sneeky about the receipt with me too! I had never seen the NO refund policy or the plate on the counter (which they later showed me). These people are a bunch of liers. If the product is so great why can&#x27;t you get a refund if the items are unopened? Commond sence tells you because the product is \\&quot;not so great\\&quot; it sucks and most people want a refund so they create these \\&quot;policies\\&quot; and trick people into them. I am making it a point to post my misfortune everywhere! It takes me nearly 2 weeks to make the money that they stole from me in less than a half hour. I should have known better than to believe a sales rep and give up any of my hard earn cash. To add insult to injury the sales guy told me that he was \\&quot;rich\\&quot; and did not care about money this was a public service to him. he was there to help people look and feel better about themselves! Ya public service alright! It&#x27;s ok because in the end he will get his. Karma is nothing to mess with! What goes around comes around!</li>
    <li> Love this line of products!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was one of those Vegas visitors that get sucked into the little stores in the hotels and malls. I could see the quality of the product, but the price there was unreal. After seeing it on Amazon, I thought I would go ahead and try it at this price. I love it. At 50 years old, I was starting to see the signs of aging. I take really good care of myself, but menopause and time was beginning to show. I see a marked improvement. It was visible in 2 weeks. I will be leaving this same review for all of the products from this company that I order. I think it’s a rip off from the stores, but from amazon its a great price and an effective, quality product.</li>
    <li> Love that these products are organic, safe and pure.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this and like it.  I&#x27;ve used Gratiae products before and find them very good.  Less expensive than some other products, but still well worth it.</li>
    <li> results are visible within days</li>
    <li> Light and very moisturizing. I use it 2x daily. Love all of the Gratiae products</li>
    <li> My wife uses this with the eye serum,  she swears by it, she says her eyes look better since she started using this with the eye serum.  I have to agree I can see a difference around her eyes also.  Just don&#x27;t go to a kiosk,</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. I don&#x27;t see any difference after using it for a year. Besides, it is almost impossible to return it.</li>
    <li> Bottles were broken. Lost product in shipping boxes.</li>
    <li> Just arrived and opened the box.  The seal had been broken and product was leaking.  I am very upset!  I will never buy anything from ishophappy again!  I am so disappointed.  Now after reading other reviews, I see others share my same experience with this product. T always read reviews and of course the one time I don&#x27;t, I get have a bad experience. UGH! I am an Amazon Prime Member and I feel Amazon should not sell products from any companies that have customer complaints of opened products.</li>
    <li> My wife really liked Gratiae Organics Replenishing Eye Cream because it met your expectations! Comfortable handling the package. Surely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Have used for several years a great product</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d order in less than a week, awesome. But the product lacked the usual creamy texture. I appeared to be either old, or previously left open?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok eye moisturizer. Worth what it costs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year and love all of the Gratiae products.  I put it on before make up and at night.  I look refreshed and it plumps up any wrinkle around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Terrible disappointment. After reading all of the positive reviews, I was really surprised to see absolutely no improvement in the bagginess and darkness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> The cream was barely ok not great. The texture was a bit too greasy and tends to melt into the eyes, which cause slight burning and blurry vision. Does not absorb completely leaving a residue. Does not mik well with the make up making it run. And after 2 month of using it I noticed more pronounced puffiness and wrinkling above the eyes. Definitely going back to my old favorite eye cream from Yves Rocher</li>
    <li> The product is good to use and I see definate results for wrinkle reduction around the eyes but it does not live up to its promise to reduce dark circles around the eyes.  I like the texture and make up doesn&#x27;t gather in it.  So I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I Like this eye cream...very moist and feels great!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to write little bit about my experience. Yesterday 04/07/13 i was in a mall here in Spokane WA, and i was offered free sample.. i am only 24 and i don&#x27;t use a lot of make up but i have the worst dark circles and puffiness  around my eyes. So this girl put the eye cream on and instantly reduced the puffiness i was impressed she also said that dark color will fade too, the cream was on sale (costumer appreciation sale) so it was $150 she said she would give me 20% discount because i was trying to walk away i hate spending that much money on my self especially having two little kids. So when she said she would sell it for $100 i had to buy it, just to see if the dark circles will fade. I came home to do some research on the cream and found the price on amazon for like $35-40 i was shocked. i automatically called the kiosk and i spoke to the owner, i was so mad and frustrated i almost started crying i told him i will come to the mall and sit there for the next month and tell every and each person that walks by that they are a total joke, they lie and so on.. he told me that he if i come to the mall he will give me some free stuff just so i walk away happy. i want to thank him for giving me -free eye serum and lifting facial mask. if this stuff works like they say it works i will be buying it again regardless of the price.</li>
    <li> This is the same product I got suckered into buying for way more $$ in the shopping mall at Caesar&#x27;s in Vegas.  I do feel like it makes a difference in the appearance in the line lines under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t know that long term it is making a difference, but you can see the difference as it is applied and that is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Tried it a couple of years ago, then switched to something else.  Back to it now and will evaluate it soon.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s like hardened butter. the seal was opened and half of the cream looked already scooped and gone as I opened it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived, appeared unopened, but inside was not sealed and had leaked out.  Cosmetics4Less has agreed to send a replacement product.</li>
    <li> Since I ran out of this product &amp; tried one that was rated with more stars, my lines look worse. I am going back to Gratiae products!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because I&#x27;m wondering if the prescription products would do better.</li>
    <li> Best Eye Cream I&#x27;ve used in a long time!  Leaves the delicate eye area looking soft, velvety &amp; wrinkle free!</li>
    <li> So far so good, this product feels great.</li>
    <li> was gift for someone who had heard about the products on TV and wanted to purchase and get a better price with Amazon</li>
