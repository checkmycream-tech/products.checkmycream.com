<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have very oily skin so a toner is a must have for me. I was excited to try this Moroccan Rose Water. First, the scent. OH my gosh!! It&#x27;s like burying your nose in a bouquet of roses. HEAVENLY!!  But, it&#x27;s not a scent that stays for a long time so don&#x27;t worry that you&#x27;ll smell like a bouquet.  I love that this Rose Water is made of natural ingredients. After I cleanse my face I spray a cotton pad and in an upward motion, gently apply this to my face and decolletage. I am amazed at how much more dirt this will gets from my CLEANSED face!! My skin just feels amazing afterwards. My pores feel tightened.  This leaves no residue. My face just feels amazing.  I&#x27;ve had no reactions or breakouts after using this toner. I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This Moroccan Rose Water smells lovely. Using it as a toner it feels nice and cooling on my face, spraying on my neck is cooling and refreshing. I sprayed some of this Rose Water in my hair on a day when I wasn&#x27;t going to wash it to make it smell nice. I like to spritz just a little bit on my wrists and neck so I can enjoy the lovely smell of roses during the day. But I feel like a little bit goes a long way, too much can be too much. I received a sample for review.</li>
    <li> This spray recalls my summers in Georgia with the thick heady scent of roses in the garden. Mom and Dad planted beautiful roses, most of which released that storybook  perfume, instead of the roses which just looked pretty but didn&#x27;t have a fragrance to any but the bees. I&#x27;d wear them in my hair and be a princess for an afternoon, waiting for a prince who&#x27;d never come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little girls grow up. Mothers pass away. I&#x27;ll be thirty-two in June this year, and I have no roses of my own here in the mountains of North Carolina. But, I now have a way to bring back those bittersweet days with one spray of a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d heard of &amp;#34;rose water&amp;#34; in books. Ladies of old used to wash their hands, faces, and hair in it for clensing and for the scent in medieval-ish times. I always wondered how they got the fragrance of the flowers into the water. I never managed to. Being able to spray a similar chemestry on myself, I&#x27;m beginning to see why it was so popular with the upper class. Not only does it smell divine, but it&#x27;s relaxing, smooths and tones my skin, and reduces marks of dry irritation. My one spot of acme is fading faster than I expected as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re experiencing spring here, so the bees are buzzing and the birds are singing. Surprisingly, no bee has been drawn to me while I&#x27;ve been wearing the rose water. That&#x27;s quite important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the remembrances and for this experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to review this product by the manufacturer, but I have no stake in the success of the product or the company that sells it.</li>
    <li> I waited a full week+ after receiving this product and using it nightly for that time before I sat down to do this review. I didn&#x27;t have to actually give it that much time because if there&#x27;s going to be any kind of problem with skin or allergies associated with this type of product, one knows immediately and most women KNOW what they like and don&#x27;t like after one or two uses. But I wanted to be 100% certain that what I felt that very first time I used Pure Rose Water Mist, was what I was going to feel every time I used it. AND IT WAS! Honestly, I have never been happier with a toner in all my entire life. The smell is divine! It&#x27;s fragrant but yet subtle. Not the least bit perfumy! (new word, go with it lol)&lt;br /&gt;The ROI is phenomenal! This product is just $15.99 and it could potentially last you over 60 days! That is amazing! You just lightly mist your cotton pad instead of squeezing liquid from a bottle. Products that come in those forms, lend themselves to be overused so they don&#x27;t last as long. This way, with the mist, there is NO WAY to over use and you will get a HUGE bang for your dollar!&lt;br /&gt;This has made a fantastic addition to my beauty regimen and I will be recommending it to all my friends and family immediately!&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to test and review this product by Beneleaf! ~~ THANK YOU! :)</li>
    <li> This is the second brand of rose water I&#x27;ve used and it seems to have a much nicer smell -- much lighter and more natural smelling. I have found that rose water products actually do make my face feel smother. If you are looking for something to get rid of wrinkles, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, just a nice moisturizing spray. I live in the high desert and this feels good after a day of working in the sun and wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a bottle of the product to try and review</li>
    <li> I have been using this in place of my normal toners in my facial regimen for about two weeks now. I have always heard positive things concerning rose water and a friend of mine recommended it to me because of my sensitive skin. So far my skin has being looking a lot better. It looks more radiant and feels soft. I like the way it feels, almost like it&#x27;s a hydrating mist, and I really like that it&#x27;s natural and not bloated with chemical filler. I will continue to use this because it&#x27;s doing amazing tings for my skin, and I regret not getting it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: I mixed some rose water, leave in conditioner, and glycerin in a small spray bottle to make an awesome hair mist.</li>
    <li> I really like this mist.  The scent is not over powering at all which is great for me since I tend to get headaches from many perfumes and scents.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this Morrocan rose water smells and feels on my face. I use it as a facial toner after I remove my makeup with a wet towelette.&lt;br /&gt;I notice that the towelette leaves a bit of makeup behind. When I use the rose water I see the makeup residue because the proof is on the cotton pad. I know after I use this facial toner my skin is clean refreshed and hydrated. I give this product 5 stars! You can see the proof for yourself in the picture below.</li>
    <li> I love it....it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin having redness or reaction from it at all.  I do not have any problems with it.</li>
    <li> The rose water mist was cool and refreshing. I love the way it smells and tighten pores. But it did sting a little bit on my face .So this is not for me.</li>
    <li> 1st time using Rosewater .. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love love rose water!! I love the refreshing feeling on my face, I use it every morning. I have tried to make my own and it never turns out. So this is better for me lol</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the roses. This is my first time using a toner or rose water.  I fell the difference in my face. I do have dry skin when I spray this on my face it feel refreshed.  I would recommend this to my friends. I did get to review.</li>
    <li> I was flabbergasted by the horrible smell of stale and dirty water from this product after a first and only use. I sprayed it on my face without thinking of what was going to come. I had to wash my face again immediately and re-start my nightly beauty regimen again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Rose Water Toners from several companies at varying prices.  Before I even received the mist, Beneleaf sent me a message ensuring %100 satisfaction with their product; if I had any issues, I was encouraged to contact the Co-Founder personally. This is the most fragrant, silky, soothing, very reasonably priced rose mist I&#x27;ve ever tried. I don&#x27;t feel a film after an application, only water mist; and my sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t bothered a bit.  A light moisturizer on top and I feel so fine.  I was so pleased with Beneleaf Mist, I immediately ordered 2 more - one as a gift and another one for me.  I think I&#x27;ll stay with Beneleaf for my Rose Water Mists.</li>
    <li> I wish the fragrance  lingerd longer.Still refreshing.</li>
    <li> This was a Mother&#x27;s Day present for my mom. She lives in Oregon and said this is going to be perfect for the dry weather out there. She is all about using natural products and things that won&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin. She just started using this today, but her immediate reactions were great to this Morrocan Rose Water mist. She also says the smell is very pleasant. She rated it 2 Mom thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> Arrived in 2 day, and I am very pleased with the product! I will be ordering again for sure:)</li>
    <li> It was delivered quickly and met all expectatons. The followup to be sure I was satisfied was excellent.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the time I visited a rose water factory in France.  Yours is the same quality that I purchased fresh from the factory.  Superior to other brands</li>
    <li> I love the way this toner smells. It helps me keep my face hydrated and feeling great. I actually carry it with me so I can refresh my face throughout the day if I need to. I like that this bottle came with a spray nozzle for easy application of the toner. I&#x27;ve used other toners in the past but this by far has been my absolute favorite because of it&#x27;s light scent! I will definitely get another bottle of this once my current one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice..... Makes my skin feel velvety and fragrant.</li>
    <li> Retured, couldn&#x27;t use it as I am now condones to my bed.</li>
    <li> Used it as a toner and loved the fresh feel of it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave that sting that most toners do, I assume it&#x27;s because of the lack of alcohol and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out mid day.</li>
    <li> I remember my mother having these as a small child. I always wanted to play with her makeup and things but was never allowed to. As soon as I took a smell it was like I was a little girl all over again. The smell is very rosy. This is the perfect thing for spritzing invitations or mail just to give a little bit of extra flare. Also ladies spraying this on your intimates is perfect for when you are getting dressed and wanting to spruce up without spraying directly on the skin. Or any other regular clothing or linens for that matter. Spraying a small amount on your pillow might be nice too. This is a great toner for the skin just as it is sold for though.  I love to take a fresh shower and then spray with this and follow up with a moisturizer. The bottle is generous and should last a long time. You don&#x27;t need very much spray to keep the scent.  I will have to get some of this for my mom!  I did receive this product at a discount in order to review the product but a positive review is not guaranteed. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This oil literally stinks. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely, is gentle on my face, and does a nice job of cleansing off dirt. It also leaves my skin feeling dewy and soft:  I&#x27;d even go so far as to call this rose water dreamy, okay? I love spraying it on my face all day long, just to refresh myself. It&#x27;s like taking a gentle break from whatever stresses are going on...literally taking time to smell the roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS A TONER:&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin tends to be sensitive to fragrances, so usually my toners and spritzers are scentless.  I&#x27;m very careful with what I allow on my face. I don&#x27;t feel like I have to worry with this one. Not a single breakout yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a daily makeup wearer (only for special events, really), but my face does get grimy from all the gardening, yardwork,  and outdoor activity I do. This definitely picks up dirt, grit and sweat on my cotton rounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR MENOPAUSE:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, at 47 I&#x27;m right about there. I&#x27;ve been experiencing the hot flashes and irritation that comes with peri-menopause for five years now, and I don&#x27;t see that letting up any time soon. I&#x27;m already carrying this around in my purse, along with my usual microfiber washcloth, to mop up the sudden tropical monsoons I get on my face and chest. After wiping off the sweat, I spray this on, and just let it evaporate off. I feel cooler, and less irritable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a review sample, but will be buying it as soon as I run out. I don&#x27;t want to be without it, especially as summer ramps up and  the humidity really kicks in. I&#x27;m sorry about all the superlatives, but this Rose Water is one of the nicest personal treats I&#x27;ve run across, ever.</li>
    <li> I really like this product make&#x27;s my face feels soft n smooth</li>
    <li> This is a toner made out of pure rose water, and nothing else. Now usually I like 100% pure stuff, but I think in this case, the smell is a bit too strong for me. A lot of the rose water toners you find at grocery stores are usually a bit diluted or mixed with other stuff and I never really minded the smell of rose water, but this one...the high concentration makes it smell like–dare I say it–urine, albeit very flowery urine. It&#x27;s that sour smell if you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea, it’s not very pleasant, and after rubbing it on my face the first time, I almost considered just washing the entire thing off. Anyways, enough about the smell. As for how well it works, I think it’s comparable to just about any other non-alcoholic based toner. After using this for around 2 weeks, I haven’t experienced anything dramatic with this, but it doesn’t dry out your skin nor make it feel uncomfortable like some other brands. It’s quite gentle on the skin, despite the strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an average toner in my opinion. It’s a gentle toner, but the strong is just too strong for my tastes. Then again, smell is a subjective thing, and it seems like a lot of the other reviewers here love the smell. I suppose if the smell of rose water appeals to you, then you&#x27;ll love this. It&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to leave questions &amp; comments below. Please note that I was sent this product for review.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I was sent this product for free in exchange for an honest (not positive, just honest) review after trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have severely dry and sensitive skin, and don&#x27;t use toners that often, as they tend to leave my skin depleted of moisture, have an antibacterial-gel-like feeling on my face, and not be too helpful in cleansing, as I don&#x27;t suffer from oiliness, rather the lack thereof. I decided to try this anyway, as it seemed harmless enough, being Moroccan and made of natural ingredients (I trust the Moroccans with my beauty and skin needs — never failed me). Well, I absolutely love this! I use this toner, as instructed, right after removing my make up, with clean skin. Well, I should say &amp;#34;clean skin&amp;#34;, as this toner absolutely remove any kind of leftover make up and dirt from my face. Interestingly enough, this happens even after using Clarisonic on my face, which tells you how good this is, and how bad everything else is:).&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is spray a little onto a cotton pad (or whatever else you may be using, like a washcloth, even facial tissue), and swipe it over your face. That&#x27;s it. It just does all the cleaning work for you, and it does it well. I never feel like my skin is dry, and it definitely does not have any sort of alcohol or anything, because my skin would definitely react to that, what with my sensitivities and all. I&#x27;m absolutely impressed, and will definitely buy this after I&#x27;m done with the current one! The most impressive part is that it&#x27;s not even marketed for specifics skin types, while using much more expensive brand of toners market especially for dry skin did not do half as good as this for me. I mean, I know this looks a little shady, with this non-brand and all, but this is just further proof that brands are useless in telling you about the quality of a product; especially when it comes to natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you see this and think to yourself, &amp;#34;well heck, I can just buy rose water from the drugstore for that much cheaper and it would be the same&amp;#34;, you&#x27;re probably wrong. I&#x27;ve done that, myself. I personally do not think rosewater is good for my skin type (again, severely dry, sensitive skin). I think that this is as good as it gets, and that&#x27;s REALLY good. I&#x27;m really happy with this. Honestly!rom the drugstore for that much cheaper and it would be the same&amp;#34;, you&#x27;re probably wrong. I&#x27;ve done that, myself.

    <li> Edited to Add:  Beneleaf customer service is top notch.  I would not hesitate to try any of their products anytime, they do stand behind them 100%.  Very impressive company.  Original review:  At first it smells good. Then the smell keeps getting stronger and overwhelming. I smelled it on the bottle and was excited to use it. When I used one spray though I quickly realized that it was going to be overpowering and the headache that followed was yucky. Really wanted to like this :(</li>
    <li> I usually use a different brand of rose water but decided to give this a try. I have to say, i hate the smell. It smells nothing like my other rose water and the smell is just so bad, i cannot even use it. I will probable just throw this out because of how bad it smells. Luckily, the smell does not linger for long.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to rose water! It is an absolutely divinely scented toner. No yucky chemical or alcohol smell, just the lovely fragrance of pure roses! It makes your skin soft and supple and gives it a lovely healthy glow. This rose water by Beneleaf is wonderful! Very high quality! Strongly scented and hand made in Morocco. It is made of distilled mountain stream water and Damascus roses. Nothing else! No fillers, no chemicals, no dyes! Love the handy spray pump. I love to mist it on my face and hair after showering! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this product and it felt good when I used it. What I did not like was the smell. While it smelled nice when sprayed at first, the scent that lingered was not pleasant to me.</li>
    <li> It actually has an odd after smell.  I would not order this brand again.</li>
    <li> The scent of this is wonderful and it is very refreshing. The mist could be a finer, but overall I like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome toner. It will definitely always be a holly grail in my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got a bad bottle, but it smelled terrible, had to wash my face a few times after using it!! It was like roses that had mildewed or molded.</li>
    <li> Edit: I should have read the negative reviews on this. In all the 1 star reviews, I read comments on how this product smells awful...with words like rancid, stale, mildew, and soured use to describe the water, which is exactly what it smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is a strong sense of rose in this, there is a stronger smell of rancid water. It reminds me of wet laundry that&#x27;s been sitting too long and gotten soured. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to smell like this (I hope not) or if my particular bottle was old or compromised, but I shall not be buying again. In fact, I&#x27;ll be pouring this down the drain and will probably just use the bottle with some plain witch hazel until I can order some Thayers. Ugh! I can still smell it on me, and it&#x27;s seriously grossing me out.</li>
    <li> This wonderful mist smells amazing, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated.  I use it about four times a day:). Highly recommended:)</li>
    <li> Great product. Refreshing and beautiful scent! Perfect for after the shower or after spending a day at the beach.</li>
    <li> This is the best rosewater I have ever bought. It is 5+ stars. I am actually ordering more to give to my friends because they love it so much.</li>
    <li> This Rose Water is unbelievable!! I have been using it every morning and night after cleansing my face and it is absolutely wonderful!! I love the way it leaves my face feeling, the sweet, natural scent, and the knowledge that it&#x27;s great for my skin can&#x27;t be beat!! If you are in the market for Rose Water, give this company a try!! The customer service department is top notch too!!</li>
    <li> So far so good! Thank you for the prompt service and wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel tight afterwards. It&#x27;s a nice clean scent and I recommend it. I use it before and after my makeup and to freshen my makeup through out the day</li>
    <li> I have small pimples on my skin. I use this rose water morning and night after cleaning my face. My pimples has reduced ans my skin looks more toned.</li>
    <li> Smells divine, tightens my skin.  Love it</li>
    <li> It stinks! It smells like rose water gone bad! I had to spray the room freshener after using this. It stank up the whole bathroom.</li>
    <li> Ok I have used Aveda pure rose water for years til discontinued....I want to like this but  it has a horrible smell!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use toner myself, but my girlfriend does, and she loves this.  It smells great, and she says it&#x27;s gentle on skin, more so than anything she&#x27;s used before.  She also believes in the importance of using skin toner after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I appreciate that this is a genuine product that has been made traditionally for years, bottled up and made available to us.  Really neat history behind it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rose water on my skin for years and I like this product. Water is not sticky and smell really good.</li>
    <li> While it is too early to report results, I can say that this rose water gives you nice cooling&lt;br /&gt;and refreshing feeling when applied. My skin is very sensitive and the one thing I noticed&lt;br /&gt;is that it calmed my skin and evened out some of the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I received an email from the distributor asking if I would be willing to try this product and post an honest review. Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rosewater-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-smells great.&lt;br /&gt;-worked very well as a toner for both my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;-goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-is a totally pure product without any additives.&lt;br /&gt;-was packed for shipping in a bubble wrap pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally enjoyed this product. A little goes a long way so it should last for a good while and the smell of roses was perfect. Now I know why so many women in ages past used it.</li>
