    <li> Its hard to find a good spray gel these days.  This one works well.</li>
    <li> An excellent spray to set the design of newly washed hair. It tends to build up in the hair if not washed every day or so. I like it and use often.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, I have been using this product for a few years and will not replace it with another product.  It manages the natural curls in my hair plus leave a nice shine.</li>
    <li> We have a time share in the desert.  The dryness makes my hair go blah and this puts enough life into it to make presentable.</li>
    <li> Works well for my fine hair</li>
    <li> just what my wife wanted</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed with this styling spray. For the price, I expected a bit more. I found it to be very drying to my hair. It made it feel like straw, which surprised me since it is a brand known for preserving the health of a user&#x27;s hair. I will not be repurchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Great hold, pleasant smell and not too stiff.  This product arrived packaged great and what a good deal.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gives your hair body with no sticky or gooey feeling.. I took it into my hairdresser for her to use on my head, she loves it and has started buying it for herself to use on her other clients.</li>
    <li> Love,love this product, wish nexxus would bring it back, as I can not find anyother product to replace It!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for a long time, great quality. I am very happy with it. Makes nice curls.</li>
    <li> This product has gone through several package re-designs, and I&#x27;ve managed to keep track of it. Nexxus apparently does this a lot; when the spray gel was still available at JCP, they had a LIST of what &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; products are now called! Now that it seems to be available only online, the price is double what I could find it for at JCP.&lt;br /&gt;I really like its styling properties, because it offers lift without weighing down fine hair. I use it on towel-dried hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally.  A hairdresser suggested I look on Amazon and I was happy to find it.  I have fine hair and this gel allows me to spray where I need it and gives me the results I want.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this.  It hold nicely and does not smell</li>
    <li> This is a great spray gel.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and very baby fine. I spray this on before I blow dry my hair, and amazing enough, I look like I have twice the amount of hair. Please dont ever stop making this product. I love it.</li>
