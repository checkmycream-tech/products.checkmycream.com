    <li> Good product. Good price. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The pump works fine.  Very convenient.</li>
    <li> best shampoo if you don&#x27;t want the hassle of using shampoo first then conditioner,its all in one and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the scalp</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo that&#x27;s 2in1 that I have tried. I love it and the smell of it. Finally found the only shampoo I need!! Will definitely only be using this!!</li>
    <li> If you like Pert shampoo and use it regularly, this is the best buy you will ever come across. Simply a great value and a really nice shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used Pert since it came out!  I strongly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Smoking deal and great shampoo.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I like Pert and that&#x27;s what it is....shipping was fast also!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo daily for many years and my hair loves it.  It not only leaves my hair clean, but the conditioner leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is another product that can&#x27;t be found in stores that use to stock such.  My family has been using Pert Shampoo + Conditioner for well over 20 years.  So again I was able to obtain my desired product from Amazon.Com. I ordered &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; 40 ounce bottles to stock my needs for about 6 months.  The product was well packaged with bubble wrap and secured in a heavy cardboard shipping box. The package arrived one day ahead of time. Trying to find your product at various stores does cause one to use a lot of gasoline driving to the stores. In California gasoline is far from cheap, so I have again saved money by purchasing products from Amazon.Com.</li>
    <li> Works great for what little hair I have left. Getting hard to find in stores.</li>

    <li> what smells better than pert?!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling clean, soft and smelling good.</li>
    <li> good price for 2 giant jugs of PERT.  i love PERT.</li>
    <li> My hair is much cleaner or so it feels after using Pert.</li>
    <li> I have used Pert for years.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> Same great product you get in the store at half the price.</li>
    <li> this really doesn&#x27;t condition my hair, but I totally love the smell of pert shampoo. I wish they&#x27;d make a separate conditioner like they used to.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, and was exactly as described.  However, one of the nozzles had sprung open and there was some spillage, although not enough to return the product.  I will not hesitate to order again.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Pert, so when I saw this inexpensive deal, I jumped at it. Now I have a bunch!</li>
    <li> Seeing as Pert Plus has been around for a million years, I expected it to be the holy grail of shampoo that I&#x27;d overlooked my whole life. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It is literally like a massive bottle of nasty smelling chemicals that turned my hair into this strange feeling waxy mess. I tried using a lot. I tried using very little, half a pump almost. Still, my hands and hair reeked of this chemically smell and my hair felt so NOT like hair it was shocking. Pert just isn&#x27;t what I thought. The only upside is it didn&#x27;t make my hair shed like most shampoos do.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it&#x27;s such a clean, fresh smell!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Cleans hair well and has the best scent that lasts of any shampoo, including high end brands.</li>
    <li> good price for this product.</li>
    <li> As described.  Works great</li>
