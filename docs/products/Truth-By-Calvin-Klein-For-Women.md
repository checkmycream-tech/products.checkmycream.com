      <li>so i was delighted when I got more.  </li>
      <li>Normally, Truth by Calvin Klein for women is one of the very best fragances in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Not this time.  </li>
      <li>So glad that someone still carries my favorite perfume!  </li>
      <li>It is by far the best perfume I have ever worn.  </li>
      <li>I am glad Amazon still sells it because It isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>She loves it and it is her favorite.</li>
      <li>Calvin Klein is just overall awesome</li>
      <li>all my friend s love it</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s satisfied ,so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad to find Truth by Calvin Kline.  </li>
      <li>She has gotten many complements on it.</li>
      <li>Love most Calvin Klein fragrances and this one is one of them.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to locate it again</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic fragrance and the price can&#x27;t be beat!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy more so have on hand when this bottle is gone.</li>
      <li>This time, it&#x27;s the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, &amp; headache-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent &amp; very under-rated, imo.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume Calvin Klein truth</li>
      <li>Still searching for the next perfect fragrance to replace this discontinued one!</li>
      <li>This fragrance is my all time favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than the newer Euphoria or CK one.</li>
      <li>That had been my favorite fragrance</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find this perfume again on Amazon, it was like meeting an old friend:)</li>
      <li>Very good value for such a quality product.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but, i think it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with this purchase, no regrets,  </li>
      <li>Honestly, someone says something positive about this scent almost every time I wear it and</li>
      <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
      <li>, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter.</li>
      <li>there to my wondering eyes was the product and it was available.  </li>
      <li>It has a clean topnote and stays with you for hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft and lovely fragrance that gets many compliments.</li>
      <li>It smells very clean, with a greenish floral tone in the beginning, and as it dries down it starts to blend with your own skin chemistry!</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most perfumes give me a headache and smell too much like chemicals.</li>
      <li>We count on Amazon to provide the best price and they usually do!  </li>
      <li>All of CK scents are heavy and sexy, and I just simply love them and sniff myself all day when I wear it:)</li>
      <li>It was all I expected it to be: a smooth fragrance, perfect for a lady which is at the same time modest and elegant.</li>
      <li>and I am happy to say that I found it at half the price on Amazon as opposed to Perfumania at the North Bend Mall.</li>
      <li>I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
      <li>Absolutely the same I used to have for years, my favorite!</li>
      <li>Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
      <li>Hard to find item, great price, reasonable shipping.</li>
      <li>Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern &amp; up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It was lost during delivery and Amazon shipped back free of charge.</li>
      <li>Very floral and feminine.</li>
      <li>Also, if you ever tried and like the scents from Bath and Body Works, Water Blossom Ivy or Green Clover &amp; Aloe and are looking for a long lasting perfume that replicates these scents, you will find it in the beautiful \\&quot;Truth\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>My order came quickly and as soon as I opened the bottle, I felt like I was back on the cruise.  </li>
      <li>It has a deep, strong woodsy floral smell (one squirt is enough for me).  </li>
      <li>is definitely the good stuff , Just remember to buy at least two bottles for her at a time.</li>
      <li>I still have quite a bit of the bottle she gave me left, but when I heard they discontinued it, I ordered another large one.</li>
      <li>I really hope CK brings this one back.  </li>
      <li>Complex &amp; interesting</li>
      <li>My daughter requests this every year as 20 year old now.</li>
      <li>Boy was I surprised.</li>
      <li>However, I have had co-workers and even complete strangers compliment me on the perfume, asking what it is and where they can buy it.  </li>
      <li>It is neither too light nor too heavy and can be worn in winter, fall, spring, or summer.  </li>
      <li>The scent is mild and long lasting, I get compliments every time I use it.  </li>
      <li>On the one hand, it&#x27;s a bright green floral; on the other, it&#x27;s a deep woody oriental.</li>
      <li>It is a large amount of high quality fragrance for such a low price.  </li>
      <li>Its not too loud and not too subtle either.&lt;br /&gt;Its been my signature fragrance for so many years</li>
      <li>And again, it&#x27;s a light scent and not very strong--clean and warm--and soft enough to be worn in a medical office.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way too heavy and sweet for my liking.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you are looking for a fresh, slightly woody, clean scent that has a delicate sweetness to it!</li>
      <li>I hope it lasts until I can find something else I like as much, which will be hard since I&#x27;m very picky.</li>

<li> It is subtle and &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; for a mature, young woman.</li>
<li> This is a rather light fragrance that has unfortunately been discontinued by Calvin Klein.  </li>
<li> This perfume lasts a long time and I always get comments and people ask what the name of it is.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to find this perfume again on Amazon, it was like meeting an old friend:) Absolutely the same I used to have for years, my favorite! I was so upset when it was discontinued. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> So glad that someone still carries my favorite perfume!  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when it&#x27;s no longer available :(</li>
    <li> There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn&#x27;t agree with me. Sadly, Truth is another in a long line of CK fragrances that I like but can&#x27;t wear. This time, it&#x27;s the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, &amp; headache-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent &amp; very under-rated, imo. On the one hand, it&#x27;s a bright green floral; on the other, it&#x27;s a deep woody oriental. Complex &amp; interesting, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter. It&#x27;s not for those who like sugar &amp; cupcakes. Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern &amp; up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding. That&#x27;s Truth, even if it is a pretentious name.</li>
    <li> This is a rather light fragrance that has unfortunately been discontinued by Calvin Klein.  However, I have had co-workers and even complete strangers compliment me on the perfume, asking what it is and where they can buy it.  Honestly, someone says something positive about this scent almost every time I wear it and this has been going on for almost ten years.  And again, it&#x27;s a light scent and not very strong--clean and warm--and soft enough to be worn in a medical office.  Still searching for the next perfect fragrance to replace this discontinued one!</li>
    <li> Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured! I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
    <li> I almost cried in the department store when they told me this had been discontinued.  It is by far the best perfume I have ever worn.  It has a deep, strong woodsy floral smell (one squirt is enough for me).  I really hope CK brings this one back.  It&#x27;s much better than the newer Euphoria or CK one.</li>
    <li> This was a great price and I had been wanting some for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this partum as a gift to my wife. It was lost during delivery and Amazon shipped back free of charge. Even though it is a discontinued fragrance my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about 5-8 hours!&lt;br /&gt;NOT overpowering!&lt;br /&gt;COMPLIMENTS GALORE!&lt;br /&gt;YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!&lt;br /&gt;If you were wondering if you should get it..&lt;br /&gt;THE ANSWER IS YES!&lt;br /&gt;Buy 2 of them!</li>
    <li> So sad it&#x27;s discontinued, but it&#x27;s still possible to find here. Love most Calvin Klein fragrances and this one is one of them. Very floral and feminine. All of CK scents are heavy and sexy, and I just simply love them and sniff myself all day when I wear it:)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves it.  I would like to have gotten her a larger size but upon my research I discovered that this product has been discontinued. That&#x27;s too bad.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!! I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to locate it again but when I found it here, it was a home run, and it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as I though it would be. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Truth\\&quot; is I love this perfume!! It smells very clean, with a greenish floral tone in the beginning, and as it dries down it starts to blend with your own skin chemistry! I highly recommend it if you are looking for a fresh, slightly woody, clean scent that has a delicate sweetness to it! Also, if you ever tried and like the scents from Bath and Body Works, Water Blossom Ivy or Green Clover &amp; Aloe and are looking for a long lasting perfume that replicates these scents, you will find it in the beautiful \\&quot;Truth\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> We were on an Alaskan cruise for our 25th anniversary in 2001 and my husband bought this for me at the gift shop.  We both loved it!  I was disappointed to discover recently that it had been discontinued.  Fortunately I was able to find it on Amazon.  My order came quickly and as soon as I opened the bottle, I felt like I was back on the cruise.  It&#x27;s a fantastic fragrance and the price can&#x27;t be beat!  ($75 in stores back then!)  I&#x27;ll buy more so have on hand when this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> I thought the women&#x27;s fragrance would be as seductive as the men&#x27;s version but I was not too happy with it. It&#x27;s way too heavy and sweet for my liking. The package was shipped on time though so no issues with the seller.</li>
    <li> Always loved the fragrance. Its not too loud and not too subtle either.&lt;br /&gt;Its been my signature fragrance for so many years and I am happy to say that I found it at half the price on Amazon as opposed to Perfumania at the North Bend Mall.</li>
    <li> My daughter requests this every year as 20 year old now. It is subtle and &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; for a mature, young woman.</li>
    <li> Normally, Truth by Calvin Klein for women is one of the very best fragances in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Not this time.  It does not smell the same as it use to.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and great service!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a Christmas present to my mother. It was all I expected it to be: a smooth fragrance, perfect for a lady which is at the same time modest and elegant.</li>
    <li> myn ex boyfriend introduced me to this perfume and so i bought it. its good and smells really good all my friend s love it</li>
    <li> I adore this scent. It is neither too light nor too heavy and can be worn in winter, fall, spring, or summer.  It has a clean topnote and stays with you for hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for my wife for our anniversary.  She loves it and it is her favorite. Being a guy, I don&#x27;t know a lot about perfumes but this perfume  does smell great.. Very good value for such a quality product. I am glad Amazon still sells it because It isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the good stuff , Just remember to buy at least two bottles for her at a time. Alan Doucette</li>
    <li> &#x27;smells great&#x27; That was what my gf&#x27;s mother said. She is very picky with perfumes and this is one of the few that she likes.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find Truth by Calvin Kline.  That had been my favorite fragrance and I was quite sad when I could no longer purchase it in the department stores.  And so for years I thought Truth was not available anywhere.  Just recently I checked Amazon.com and there to my wondering eyes was the product and it was available.  I am so delighted to have found it.  I wear Truth everyday.  Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy F.&lt;br /&gt;Wilmington, DE</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother in law.. and she loved it.. Its a really great perfume and smells great..</li>
    <li> Definitely a great fragrance to wear.  I am so happy with this purchase, no regrets,  The scent is mild and long lasting, I get compliments every time I use it.  The packaging was excellent, and delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for the past 12+ years.  I heard it was being discontinued so i was delighted when I got more.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It smells good but, i think it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me. I have to wear very small puff.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon for selling it!  I know it&#x27;s hard to find.  I love the scent.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming and overpowering.  It&#x27;s not a floral scent but more of a musky scent which I am very grateful for because I hate the floral scents.  This perfume lasts a long time and I always get comments and people ask what the name of it is.  I hope Amazon never stops selling it because they have a permanent buyer for it...me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at best price! We count on Amazon to provide the best price and they usually do!  Love Calvin Klein perfumes too!</li>
    <li> The only perfume my sister will wear.  She has gotten many complements on it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find item, great price, reasonable shipping.</li>
    <li> Last year my mom gave me half a bottle of this because she didn&#x27;t like it on her. It smells amazing on me, though, and it adjusts to your body chemistry. I still have quite a bit of the bottle she gave me left, but when I heard they discontinued it, I ordered another large one. I hope it lasts until I can find something else I like as much, which will be hard since I&#x27;m very picky. Most perfumes give me a headache and smell too much like chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume Calvin Klein truth I always order by Amazon I always get compliments how good iT smells On me I order me two bottles I was very satisfied with my order</li>
    <li> Still glad I can get my favorite perfume, and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Calvin Klein is just overall awesome</li>
    <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it!  It is a large amount of high quality fragrance for such a low price.  Does not appear to be a knock off.</li>
    <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend who couldn&#x27;t find it in her area. She&#x27;s satisfied ,so I&#x27;m satisfied. We&#x27;re both happy.</li>
    <li> Calvin Klein&#x27;s Truth is difficult to find.  I was very disappointed when I could no longer purchase it at department stores, and thought I&#x27;d never be able to wear my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; again.  It&#x27;s a soft and lovely fragrance that gets many compliments.</li>
    <li> I was told years ago that this product was discontinued. On a whim, I did a search on Amazon. Boy was I surprised. This fragrance is my all time favorite. I am so happy to have found it again. Thanks Amazon!</li>
