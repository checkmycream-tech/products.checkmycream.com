      <li>okay</li>
      <li>When i asked her if it was ok after that she replied &amp;#34;not really&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The scent is insanely refreshing (and strong/citrus).</li>
      <li>If you love the scent of lemongrass</li>
      <li>I ordered this as a gift with more than a week to arrive and it was lost in the mail.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite, but</li>
      <li>I felt like I owe antho a review based on their outstanding, organic product.</li>
      <li>but I kinda liked that I still felt clean and not greasy.</li>
      <li>it smells pretty good</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this out, so I jumped in the shower!</li>
      <li>It has a very strong smell, but its not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>Strong smell</li>
      <li>Upon use the scrub is EXTREMELY strong smelling.</li>
      <li>I believe that it the point of strong customer service?</li>
      <li>I make my own scrubs and am always exploring the large varieties of scrubs out there.</li>
      <li>First off, the lemongrass smell is super potent!</li>
      <li>The lemon grass scent literally filled up my house.</li>
      <li>VERY INVIGORATING !!!</li>
      <li>VERY powerful smell of citrus.</li>
      <li>It smells great and the less you use the better.</li>
      <li>It was refreshing and really wakes you up!</li>
      <li>Unlike most salt scrubs, this has fine salt particles which are gently exfoliate skin.</li>
      <li>but i love the scrub as a whole</li>
      <li>Even though my fiancé is not thrilled at the fact that I smell like a lemon (lol), he&#x27;s going to have to deal with it once a week, because I&#x27;m in loooove with this stuff!</li>
      <li>I also love that the ingredients list is all natural products that you can easily recognize:sea salt,essential oils,etc.</li>
      <li>I will likely try some of their other products too, since I&#x27;m so impressed by this one :)</li>
      <li>You feel so fresh &amp; clean as a whistle after using this, it&#x27;s just a wonderful product, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;ll last quiet a while too.</li>
      <li>(My fiancé on the other hand, has a very sensitive sense of smell and it was not his favorite scent lol).</li>
      <li>Since it uses Epsom salt as the exfoliating ingredient, it dissolves very quickly, which is probably why I didn&#x27;t feel like I got much out of it.</li>
      <li>all natural with no nasty chemicals.</li>
      <li>My skin felt so moisturized and fresh.</li>
      <li>The citrus smell is so fresh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really powerful.</li>
      <li>i wont buy again but was worth a shot</li>
      <li>lemon smell is extremely strong and it completely cleared my nasal passages.</li>
      <li>I mean, the scent alone could clear your sinuses, lol!</li>
      <li>The scent was very very intense</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>When I received this the first thing I thought before I even opened</li>
      <li>First time I used it</li>
      <li>When opening this, the first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>

      <li>It is a really great product but it was much smaller than I expected.  </li>
      <li>He uses this scrub and it instantly transforms his skin to much softer skin that he says feels so much better.</li>
      <li>Wow, this little bottle is amazing!</li>
      <li>The sent is lemony and leaves my skin exfoliated, moist, and super soft.</li>
      <li>The salt granules are also a bit too large.</li>
      <li>The lemon scent is very strong but it feels and smells amazing esp when i rub some on my back butt and legs, gets all the dead skin off and doesnt use harsh chemicals, natural ingredients which i love!</li>
      <li>I would probably really like the body scrub if they could do that.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It is very oily</li>
      <li>but i do not feel like it does much for my skin.</li>
      <li>It made my body break out in a rash and made it very itchy.</li>
      <li>The essential oils moisturize well and my skin stays smooth all day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After you step out of shower your whole body shivers.</li>
      <li>too much oil.</li>
      <li>next morning my skin felt SO healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and icy feeling of after use!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great for a morning wake up</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, please be very careful. The first time I used this product I scooped up the scrub with only my index and middle finger (not a lot) , I applied it to my face and a bit of my neck... I thought I was going to have to be rushed to the hospital. It burned so bad, water did not help (I was in the shower). I was in massive pain, my face and neck and collar bone area were full of hives. The product does not lie, a little goes a long way. I didn&#x27;t send it back because I thought I could use it on my boyf. I now put a dab (less than half a teaspoon) on a cotton ball and rub it on my skin. It smells great and the less you use the better. My face still gets red but I&#x27;m hoping it means it&#x27;s working (I know, sounds a bit twisted).</li>
    <li> I loved this scrub!!!</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s too small</li>
    <li> This scrub is awesome. It&#x27;s heavily scented with the citrus-y lemongrass &amp; rosemary, and it smells like heaven. There&#x27;s also peppermint oil in there so your hands or legs feel nice and tingly after using it.</li>
    <li> Way over priced for the amount ....I&#x27;ll never buy it again</li>
    <li> The lemongrass body scrub by antho is truly amazing. I make my own scrubs and am always exploring the large varieties of scrubs out there. I use this one on my face because I struggle with dry skin. My skin loves it.....it glows! The scent is insanely refreshing (and strong/citrus). This is officially my new scrub. I would not want to live without it. Definite buy! This is the first review I have ever done as well (and I am an avid online shopper). I felt like I owe antho a review based on their outstanding, organic product.</li>
    <li> THe oils leave not the best residue on my body but i love the scrub as a whole</li>
    <li> it smells pretty good but i do not feel like it does much for my skin. i was actually itchy after using this and it did not make me not need to apply lotion as it states. i wont buy again but was worth a shot</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this body scrub, but it is far too oily for daily use.  My skin does feel soft, afterwards, but it leaves my tub floor slippery and greasy, and let&#x27;s not talk about how much comes off on my towel when I dry off.  I wish they could back off the oil percentage.  I would probably really like the body scrub if they could do that.</li>
    <li> The best salt scrub I have ever used.The sent is lemony and leaves my skin exfoliated, moist, and super soft.The oil and salt combo is perfect.Check the ingredient label...all natural with no nasty chemicals.Great price,too. I definitely will be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> The lemon scent is very strong but it feels and smells amazing esp when i rub some on my back butt and legs, gets all the dead skin off and doesnt use harsh chemicals, natural ingredients which i love! Spa-like home treatment :)</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this product. From the energizing smell to the great exfoliation, this product delivers and doesn&#x27;t disappoint. One tip, don&#x27;t get to close to private areas the lemon.salt and mint can sting.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! I&#x27;ve had professional body scrub before and this stuff is just like it. Only problem,  it&#x27;s hard for me to place all over my body like the Spa. I woke up this morning, skin feels very smooth and hydrated. I have some sort of psoriasis or excema and I didn&#x27;t scratch my hand at all last night. If you suffer like I do, just to have one night of relief means so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions do not say how long to leave the sea salt on the body. I did it in the shower and left it on for one or two minutes. If you have any open wounds, it is extremely painful to put this on. It burns, feels like those body parts are on fire. Even if you don&#x27;t have any open wounds, you might feel some burning sensation or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemon smell is extremely strong and it completely cleared my nasal passages. I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like this before. It&#x27;s really powerful. It seemed to penetrate my lungs and clear away the phlegm. I didn&#x27;t anticipate getting relief for my breathing, but I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you step out of shower your whole body shivers. I do not know why. I dried off and immediately put on a sweater and went to bed. I still felt cold, even with my sweater. This also happened at the professional Spa so I know it&#x27;s normal. It was actually encouraging because I knew the sea salt was doing something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of scrubs and lemongrass, however this product fell way short. Upon opening the jar I was met with the pleasant aroma and 1 1/2 cm of oil. Come on, that&#x27;s excessive. I replaced the cap and shook the jar thinking it may have just settled, no dice. I then tried to stir it so I could grab some of the salt to use.That just resulted in a bunch of oil falling to the shower floor. That being said it left my skin super greasy &amp; I needed to use a different scrub to get if off.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong smell, but its not unpleasant. Just dont get it in any small cuts or scratches, cause it stings!!!!</li>
    <li> It smells great but just so you know the smell is VERY strong and lasts a while throughout the house. Also, there are actual pieces of lemongrass in it so be prepared to wash that all down the drain and off the shower walls, etc. For the most part, it seems like a good product and it does smooth your skin out nicely.</li>
    <li> Should you get this? Yes. First time I used it I actually had a smile after the shower. I felt cool/icy and my skin felt amazing. Great product but the oil in it does mix we&#x27;ll and settles at the too. Its okay though cause it doesn&#x27;t effect the use I&#x27;d the product. It is very oily but I kinda liked that I still felt clean and not greasy. I just wish the jar was bigger or easier to work with the product and remove it from the jar. Overall though great seller and product...try it!</li>
    <li> Smells like furniture polish. wasn&#x27;t exfoliating enough. too much oil.</li>
    <li> This product works and smells great! Unlike most salt scrubs, this has fine salt particles which are gently exfoliate skin. The essential oils moisturize well and my skin stays smooth all day. The citrus smell is so fresh.I also love that the ingredients list is all natural products that you can easily recognize:sea salt,essential oils,etc.It&#x27;s not as messy as other scrubs and easier to use.Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The product smells wonderful but the oils leak out from under the lid even when sitting up right. I don&#x27;t know if this is a normal occurrence with this product or if there is an issue with my packaging but it makes a mess wherever I sit the jar.</li>
    <li> I give this as a present for my mom on that Christmas morning. She said she love it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Strong smell but I like it. The size of the can was much smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> When opening this, the first thing I noticed was the smell. VERY powerful smell of citrus. It was refreshing and really wakes you up! (My fiancé on the other hand, has a very sensitive sense of smell and it was not his favorite scent lol). I was excited to try this out, so I jumped in the shower! After my usual shower routine, I put this all over my body (including my face); again, the smell was just overwhelmingly refreshing! If you have any small cuts or acne that has just been opened, prepare for a sting! I rinsed with water, and pat myself dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on my PJ&#x27;s and a few minutes later I felt the most odd sensation ever! It&#x27;s really hard to put into words, but it gives you this refreshing chill ALL over your body. You feel COLD but its a good type of chill... and I noticed it helped my muscles relax. I covered myself up good when I hopped into bed and I was just in heaven! My skin felt so moisturized and fresh. I couldn&#x27;t wait to repeat the process again in a week!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning my skin felt SO healthy and soft. I am so happy with this product and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy it again. I&#x27;m also intrigued as to what other products they have available just to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this. Even though my fiancé is not thrilled at the fact that I smell like a lemon (lol), he&#x27;s going to have to deal with it once a week, because I&#x27;m in loooove with this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like sugar scrubs better but this one has a very nice minty feel after use.  I like the lemon smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter because she is a body scrub fanatic. She told me she had to dump alot of oil out of this product and use it on her sons legs because it was loaded w oil and not alot of anything else. When i asked her if it was ok after that she replied &amp;#34;not really&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Wow, this little bottle is amazing! I guess I wasn&#x27;t quiet prepared for how much I&#x27;d really like this product. First off, the lemongrass smell is super potent! But in a good way. I mean, the scent alone could clear your sinuses, lol! But, then you scrub with it, you feel the tingly sensation, &amp; you can actually feel the cooling of the ingredients the moment it touches your skin. I imagine that the ingredients begin waking up every cell of your skin &amp; likely the blood flowing underneath it as well, you can literally feel it waking up every spot on your body the second it touches you! What a great feeling to wake up to! Then, after scrubbing, I sort of rub into my skin what&#x27;s left after the salty/scrub part is already rinsed off. When you then rinse again, you feel that &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; cooling sensation all over, amazing! That&#x27;s what I equate that to. You feel so fresh &amp; clean as a whistle after using this, it&#x27;s just a wonderful product, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;ll last quiet a while too. A very small amount covers your entire body. I&#x27;m very pleased that I tried this. I will buy again as soon as I&#x27;m out. This will probably be something I&#x27;ll use the rest of my life. I will likely try some of their other products too, since I&#x27;m so impressed by this one :)</li>
    <li> When I received this the first thing I thought before I even opened it was that it won&#x27;t last long, however that is my fault because I didn&#x27;t look at the ounces before I bought it. Upon use the scrub is EXTREMELY strong smelling. The lemon grass scent literally filled up my house. Do not use this scrub in the winter. It is extremely \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; and leaves your skin feeling icy cold. Do not use it after you shave because it burns if you do so. I can see how I would like this as a foot scrub, however I probably will not use it again on my body and would never use it on my face. Having worked in the skincare business I have used way better exfoliating products. This one does leave a bit of an oily residue as well. Not my favorite, but this is just my opinion. Since it uses Epsom salt as the exfoliating ingredient, it dissolves very quickly, which is probably why I didn&#x27;t feel like I got much out of it.</li>
    <li> It is a really great product but it was much smaller than I expected.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift with more than a week to arrive and it was lost in the mail. When I emailed the shop to tell them of this and explain it was a gift that I was expecting to receive by a specific date (days after the expected arrival date) they apologized and explained there was absolutely nothing they could do since it was the post office&#x27;s problem. After suggesting they resend me another product at an expedited rate a few times, they finally agreed while sharing that it wasn&#x27;t something they were required to do. I believe that it the point of strong customer service? Since I received the other package a few days after the expedited one I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and the salt is not coarse enough to exfoliate and it leaves residue all over the tub after use. Such a shame since I love supporting small businesses with organic principles, but if you&#x27;re product and customer service are both inferior, I feel obligated to warn other shoppers!</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned on the site, the scent of this body scrub is divine, and the quality of the oil is of a high standard. The reason I gave the product only three stars is because something in the ingredients made my skin tingle to the point of almost stinging. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the lemongrass oil or something else, but the sensation bordered on being uncomfortable. The salt granules are also a bit too large. If you love the scent of lemongrass and  don&#x27;t mind a strong tingling sensation on your skin, then this is the body scrub for you!</li>
    <li> Reminds you of what it meant to be cleansed and annointed with oils!!! Definitely would buy again.. really a great product!!!</li>
    <li> This was wonderful and smelled great. Made my skin soft in the rough. I need to get more.</li>
    <li> VERY INVIGORATING !!!&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE THE WAY YOUR SKIN FEELS AFTER SHOWERING WITH THIS SCRUB.</li>
    <li> This product soothes every senses! I love the smell and icy feeling of after use! Just perfect! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have to keep it in my shower at all times.  It is extremely moisturizing, and the smell is invigorating and energizing!</li>
    <li> My husband is in the concrete business so his hands are always dry and cracked. He uses this scrub and it instantly transforms his skin to much softer skin that he says feels so much better.</li>
    <li> If there&#x27;s a word I can say for this scrub, then it has to GREASY! If i can give it 0 star, i&#x27;ll def do it! I guess the 1 star i&#x27;m giving is for the scent. I understand that this scrub has oil as one of the ingredients, but what i didn&#x27;t know was that it&#x27;s just salt with oil (a lot of oil). When you rub it on your body, the salt just fall off of your body because of the oil and what&#x27;s left is just the oil. Imagine rubbing cooking oil into your skin and let it sink it. That&#x27;s how it feels when using this scrub. Just plain EW! I guess it was my fault too because I had too high expectation with the reviews and the quality of the products. But the higher the expectation I had for this product, the more it disappointed me after one use. ONE AND NEVER again. I have very sensitive skin, i hope this gallon of oil i just rub on my legs won&#x27;t clog my pores! So, make up your mind before you buy this product. If you want an OIL substitute for your lotion/scrub/bodywash, then this is what you are looking for. If you are looking for just a scrub to scrub off your dead skin, MOVE ON! Don&#x27;t waste your money for disappointment like i did!!</li>
    <li> The scent was very very intense</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful. It made my body break out in a rash and made it very itchy. I was able to get a refund no problem. If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend testing in a small area before using it all over.</li>
    <li> This is a great body scrub that makes your skin feel simply amazing once you rinse it off. The only thing is that it may sting in some places because of the citrus content (don&#x27;t use it after you shave!).</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin feels smooth when I am done and less stressed.  Plus the texture and softness of my skin has increased immensely!!!</li>
