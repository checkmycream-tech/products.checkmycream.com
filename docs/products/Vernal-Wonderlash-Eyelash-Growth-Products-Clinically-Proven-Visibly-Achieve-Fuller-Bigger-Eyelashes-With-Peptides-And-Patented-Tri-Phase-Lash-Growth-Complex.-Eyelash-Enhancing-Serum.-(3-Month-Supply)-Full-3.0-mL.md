      <li>So far so good as she said.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>

      <li>i will be giving a full review in three months when i am done using this product.</li>
      <li>You do have a limit to how far it grow based on genetics and diet so while I&#x27;m hoping for more, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
      <li>However it feels lovely and light and has no smell so a natural feel.  </li>
      <li>and I am sure there will be more of a difference later.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see results in my eyelashes which right now are sparse.  </li>
      <li>This is normal for many businesses</li>
      <li>Love it so far!</li>
      <li>and I will continue to use it because I am extremely happy with the results with such an easy application rather then having to get extensions which are only temporary</li>
      <li>I bought this product on discount and was really hoping for some fantastic results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>Was very excited to review as I&#x27;m a vintage individual and when asked to review it for free, I thought what the heck.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to go for it anyway, once a day applied right before bed.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s clear, feels cool when applied, no irritation, apply lightly.</li>
      <li>So easy to use and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Paid a discount for it but would definetly buy full price for how much she uses it</li>
      <li>box looks great and the tube is very plain</li>
      <li>I found them to be very itchy!</li>
      <li>I was aware that redness along the eyelid and itching could occur.</li>
      <li>The product is really nice and you can apply it as the other eyelash serums.</li>
      <li>I am positive for the result and will update them in my review.</li>
      <li>My personal experience with one of my all-time favorite beauty products, expert which differs from the original in that in addition to length and new growth for my eyelashes, it also darkens them and adds a natural curl.</li>
      <li>Awesome, made my eye lashes long and thick.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that this has made a difference.</li>
      <li>it is very suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is very suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the color and the sensation it gives</li>
      <li>One warning the product is very liquid</li>
      <li>I was reluctant to buy any products like this because of my light blue eyes.</li>
      <li>but I like that so that it is harder for the boy to find out what all my products are for better to leave some mystery.  </li>
      <li>Made them very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped use after day three because it just kept getting worse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so when opening it make sure that the product is straight up and down.  </li>
      <li>I actually paid for full price for this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead of handing this to my wife or applying it to my own eyelashes, I placed a small amount on my wrist.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also giving the eyelashes a little natural curl, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I require LESS mascara now when I do choose to use it.  </li>
      <li>It did make my eyelashes noticeably longer and while my top is only a smidgen fuller, my bottom half definitely has more lashes before.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t if that makes me more or less legit but</li>
      <li>Another added benefit is that I have puffy upper lids and now that my lashes are longer it makes my eyes look more open!  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised!  </li>
      <li>and I can already see results I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>still use it to see if I can get a little more out of it.</li>
      <li>I also read the directions multiple times to see when/how often to apply and it just said &amp;#34;Reapply as often as needed&amp;#34; which didn&#x27;t seem right to me.</li>
      <li>Be warned, however, that the instructions are super clear, we had to do a little digging to find out exactly how much and how often to apply.</li>
      <li>surprised me since the ingredients show that the solution is composed of mainly water, glycerin, and starch.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Another review from my girlfriend as not my type of product :-)&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used this product for just a week so a little too soon to see any real difference.  However it feels lovely and light and has no smell so a natural feel.  I have sensitive eyes so was a little worried about using a product on my lashes, however I’m happy to say that it was fine.  My eyes were neither puffy nor swollen and there is no vapour so a very safe and natural product.  I’m very excited to see results and an additional advantage is that the tube says it’s for 3 months so a good size.  The tube is light and compact.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter. So far so good as she said. It doesn&#x27;t itch or irritate her skin but the difference seems minor. I will update this review once she use it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my work spouse after being offered it in exchange for my honest review. When we received it, we were delighted to see that it can also be applied to your eyebrows as well as your eyelashes. She&#x27;s been using it for the last 10 days or so. We&#x27;ve been happy with the results, there is definite increased, pronounced growth on the eyebrows as well as some growth on the eyelashes. It&#x27;s also giving the eyelashes a little natural curl, which is nice. Be warned, however, that the instructions are super clear, we had to do a little digging to find out exactly how much and how often to apply. Also, if you happen to over apply and get some in your eye, it will burn for couple of minutes and leave your eye red for a short while. Overall, however, it&#x27;s definitely increased growth in both the lashes and brows.</li>
    <li> I received this today! It came super fast and application is very easy! No smell and isn&#x27;t goopy!</li>
    <li> I was given this product free of charge to use and to write an honest review.  I spend a lot of time out in the sun at the beach, so I typically do not wear mascara  since it would run.  Since using this product my eylashes did indeed grow in length, as well as fuller.  I attached a photo (I did put 1 very light coat of mascara on to show the length, as the tips of my lashes are very blond.)  I love the fact that I require LESS mascara now when I do choose to use it.  I found this product easy to appy and it did not drip.  I applied it once a day in the evening before bed for a month.  I was concerned about putting anything around my eyes, but I didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort or irritation of any kind.  Another added benefit is that I have puffy upper lids and now that my lashes are longer it makes my eyes look more open!  I am thankful I was given the opportunity to try it and I will continue to use it because I am extremely happy with the results with such an easy application rather then having to get extensions which are only temporary and you must be very careful not to dislodge them! I&#x27;d rather grow my own with the help of a great product!</li>
    <li> It is too early to tell.  I have been using it for only 6 days.</li>
    <li> I received this product to test and review, and things were going as expected with an eyelash serum. I was aware that redness along the eyelid and itching could occur. Since I have tried a prescription eyelash growth topical in the past (Latisse). The redness along my eyelids appeared within 24 hours and the itching persisted over the next week. However, yesterday my eyelids became excessively itchy, and this morning I woke up with swollen eyelids that are still very sore, but not as puffy (6 hours later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, in short, I stopped taking this serum because I am having abnormal reactions to it. I have given it 2-stars because it did seem to make my eyelashes a little fuller prior to the reaction, and I did like that.</li>
    <li> I started using it the day I got it. It has been a week now and to my surprise. ..IT&#x27;S ALREADY WORKING...I will definitely be telling everyone my experience and suggest they try...love it&#x27;</li>
    <li> So easy to use and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes. I&#x27;ll update my review in couple of months when I&#x27;ve seen the effects! Love it so far!</li>
    <li> When using any makeup, chemical, or medication read the directions. As I was reading the directions on the Wonderland packaging I noticed a typo. This is a red flag for me; it shows lack of detail and possible foreign manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proproduct itself is a generic white tube with &amp;#34;Wonderlash&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;3ml sterile&amp;#34; printed by either ink stamping or a cheap heat printing. There is no instructions on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not a sterile product: there was no manufacturing information and there was no seal anywhere on or in the product. If it was sterile the applicator and the product would be separately sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of handing this to my wife or applying it to my own eyelashes, I placed a small amount on my wrist. After ten minutes the area was raised, red, and burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This surprised me since the ingredients show that the solution is composed of mainly water, glycerin, and starch.  There were several ingredient discrepancies: glutamic acid (L) does not exist and should say L- glutamic acid or at least have a legend to tell us what (L) means, panthenol (D) should have been listed as D- panthenol (the only biologically activated panthenol enantiomer) and leads me to believe that the inactive panthenol was used, tropolone has no cosmetic uses, and the proprietary maxlash complex. This &amp;#34;proprietary complex&amp;#34; lists tricholastyl and Sym Peptide 226 which are widely used registered products with scientific backing. Why then did they put Malus Domestica Stem Cell Culture Myristol Pentapeptide-17 instead of PhytoCellTec- the registered brand? This leads me too believe that the complex is inferior or possibly unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also unable to find a physical location of Eureka Brands, LLC or any manufacturer. The Houston address is actually a registered agent and not the actual company. This is normal for many businesses so I tried to find the out of state address. This led me to another registered agent in Florida. Add this with the Eureka Brands, LLC website being shutdown it is very suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vernal Skin Care has no physical contact information either. There is no proof that the product was actually made in the USA and due to the inferior packaging and typos; I don&#x27;t believe it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product is not safe to use and I question its legality e.g., wrong ingredients, misleading packaging, and false country of origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is illegal to: mark a non sterile product sterile, and falsifying the country of origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product for free to review.nt in Florida.

    <li> Just received my package.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for a couple days now, but so far it is as expected :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how it works&lt;br /&gt;this product has not irritated my eyes or the skin around my eyes</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference with it. My eyelashes looked the same to me. A little disappointing.</li>
    <li> i just got mine. and i already absolutely love it. you put it on just like a liquid eyeliner. it came on time and without any hassle. i will be giving a full review in three months when i am done using this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome, made my eye lashes long and thick.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy any products like this because of my light blue eyes. Most serums warn of pigmentation issues. As a test, I only used on one eye to see what happen. I am happy to report that not only did I have no issues with pigmentation or irritation, but there was a noticeable difference in lash thickness. I also noticed that I have one lash that doesn&#x27;t curl, it grows straight down. After a few days, it got a little longer and started to curl. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural lash look.</li>
    <li> i love this item, this is what i found. My personal experience with one of my all-time favorite beauty products, expert which differs from the original in that in addition to length and new growth for my eyelashes, it also darkens them and adds a natural curl. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  Was very excited to review as I&#x27;m a vintage individual and when asked to review it for free, I thought what the heck.  Very excited but honestly didn&#x27;t see a difference but appreciate the  chance to review it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on discount and was really hoping for some fantastic results. Upon receiving it, I opened it and was disappointed that the packaging looked so cheap and that I felt the tube had very little product in it. I also read the directions multiple times to see when/how often to apply and it just said &amp;#34;Reapply as often as needed&amp;#34; which didn&#x27;t seem right to me. So I decided to go for it anyway, once a day applied right before bed. But only within a couple of times of using it, my eyes hated it. They couldn&#x27;t stop watering which felt like it washed away the product within minutes. I was very careful to not put it in my eyes but of course it dripped down into them anyway. So overall I was not pleased. Could be for someone else but was not for me.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s easy to apply and non-irritating. I take my contacts out and put it on before bed, and that&#x27;s it. I look forward to seeing results and will post an updated review when I see some lash growth.</li>
    <li> i love this . so far it is working great. no odor or irritation.</li>
    <li> This eyelash enhancing serum works wonders I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a week now and I can already see results I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product is really nice and you can apply it as the other eyelash serums. I really like the color and the sensation it gives and I need to see how it will go the next days. I am positive for the result and will update them in my review.</li>
    <li> Nice product, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received this discounted product to review honestly.  I tried it last night and it&#x27;s liquid formula is easy to apply with the applicator it comes with.  I&#x27;m excited to see results in my eyelashes which right now are sparse.  I&#x27;ll be back to edit my review in a few weeks once I see results.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised!  This product does not burn at all.  I am hoping it works as well as I hope.  I will be posting updated pictures as it goes to show ya&#x27;ll how it works.  I must say though, I am already feeling pretty great about it.  I have very sensitive eyes so anything that does irritate my eyes is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box looks great and the tube is very plain but I like that so that it is harder for the boy to find out what all my products are for better to leave some mystery.  One warning the product is very liquid so when opening it make sure that the product is straight up and down.  I spilt a little on my skirt because I was holding it like mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I am officially buying my second bottle.  After a scary perm eyelash experience I remembered that I had this in my drawer.  It has made a CRAZY difference!  I am so glad this product exists.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes or get messy at all.</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on this item from Snagshout.com for giving a review. This is easy to apply, but they want it applied at night. I can only remember to apply in the morning, when I&#x27;m putting on my makeup. I can&#x27;t really tell that this has made a difference. I&#x27;m going to continue to use until it&#x27;s gone, but I don&#x27;t know that I would order again.</li>
    <li> I put this on at night after removing makeup, looking forward to seeing the results and will post another review in a couple months. The product arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> So far, I have been using this product for 7 days, pictures are posted. It does not irritate my eyes at all and it seems like it is conditioning to my eyelashes. I am not sure if you can tell a difference in the photos but I will be posting more and I am sure there will be more of a difference later. I think it is working but time will tell more. I will edit my review as needed. I will try to post the next ones at the one month mark. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t notice any lash growth yet.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, I noticed with in a week!!  It&#x27;s worth it, I wish the size was bigger, but it  is powerful, and hopefully it will last a while. This is a good product, recommended . The directions are once a day, it&#x27;s best to apply at night of course. The manufactuer states &amp;#34;the difference will be noticed  in 2 months, but 1 week!! that&#x27;s awesome !!  There&#x27;s no color to it, it&#x27;s clear, feels cool when applied, no irritation, apply lightly.It&#x27;s applied above on the eye lid, not directly on the lashes, since the growth starts at the eyelid, similar to hair roots, from the follicle.:)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Paid a discount for it but would definetly buy full price for how much she uses it</li>
    <li> mine arrived empty.  there is not serum in the tube.  not cool.</li>
    <li> As expected now let&#x27;s see the results!</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff religiously and although my eyelashes arent as long as i want it did make them fuller and longer than ever before. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Vernal Wonderlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum works wonders on my lashes. They grew within a short matter of time. All you have to do is apply it once a day. After a short period of time you will see a drastic difference in your lashes. It helps speed up the growing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formulated with a unique proprietary ingredients to help product stay on lashes and minimize running.

Contains a powerful cosmetic anti-microbial system, allowing for repeated use of a single applicator.&lt;br /&gt;Enhances the appearance of beautiful, younger-looking, more luxurious eyelashes. Custom designed brush allows for a simple and efficient application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. it irritated my eyelashes and eyebrows. Made them very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped use after day three because it just kept getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;hopefully this product works for others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s early yet, well, as far as my experience with eyelash enhancers go… I am on week 2. I do not see any huge change in my lashes but I do not expect that to occur until after 30 days of daily use. I know that &amp;#34;Revitalash&amp;#34; works for me around day 30, so I am expecting the same with &amp;#34;Vernal. The difference thus far? Well, the price is the #1 difference…Vernal is much less than &amp;#34;Revitalash&amp;#34; in addition, at around week 2 using &amp;#34;revitalash&amp;#34; my eyelids were a bit itchy. Nothing like allergies, just if I rubbed my eyes (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway!) I found them to be very itchy! I will repost at the 30 day mark to comment/update on lash growth.</li>
    <li> Used for a couple days have not noticed a difference . Will give it more time and update my review.</li>
    <li> Received it promptly and on time. Packaging was good. Also had directions in the box. So far I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times. Very anxious to see results in a few weeks. No burning or tingling during application and no weird scent, which is good.</li>
    <li> I had to return it because there were black specks in the serum and the lid does not fit correctly. It also seemed like there was hardly any serum in the tube.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few times so I can&#x27;t attest to my eyelashes growing because of it.  However, I can say that I had to discontinue using it as it made my eyes burn in the mornings.  This is NOT mascara.  The applicator is NOT like a mascara wand, it&#x27;s like a paint brush.  And you apply it once a day, and after 30 days of use, it tells you that you will notice your eye lashes growing longer and thicker.  I got to day 5 and had to discontinue using it.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my eyes would burn so badly each morning after putting my contacts in, until one night as I was about to apply the wonderlash and realized that was the only thing I was doing differently since my eyes started burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t want you to get this product in your eyes, yet it&#x27;s almost the consistency of water...very runny.  If it gets in your eye, you are supposed to rinse your eye out with water for 15 minutes. So I was very careful not to get it into my eye during my application of it.  However, after application, and during the night, some of this product must have gravitated into my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So due to the fact that I can&#x27;t really use this product anymore due to my eyes burning, I gave this two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention that the product arrived quickly and, for Amazon&#x27;s free shipping, in record time.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes long enough for me, but after I start using wonderlash its seems they get darker longer and stronger. I use to lose my eyelashes like my hair, but it&#x27;s not happening after this great serum product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I loved it, this is exact item I wanted to fit my needs. I used it today and it made the difference in my appearance. I would strongly recommend this product. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I actually paid for full price for this product. I don&#x27;t if that makes me more or less legit but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it did the job for me.  I usually put it on before I go to sleep and I&#x27;ve been doing it for almost...two weeks now? I started seeing results after four days. It did make my eyelashes noticeably longer and while my top is only a smidgen fuller, my bottom half definitely has more lashes before. Mind you, this is not a miracle worker. You&#x27;re not going to get inches, but it does make a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it to see if I can get a little more out of it. I assume eyelash hair is like regular hair. You do have a limit to how far it grow based on genetics and diet so while I&#x27;m hoping for more, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. I assume that this is where the bad reviews come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it five stars mostly because it works and produced the same results as Revitalash (which my mother received a sample of) for half the price.</li>
