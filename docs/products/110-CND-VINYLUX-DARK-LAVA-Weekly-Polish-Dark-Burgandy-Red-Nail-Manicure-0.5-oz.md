      <li>no lite required, it will last for 2 weeks or more by just applying the top coat weekly what a life saver.</li>
      <li>Dries super fast!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product for the price, and the color is nice, but I am going back to my UV gel.</li>

      <li>Another beautiful dark red burgundy color.</li>
      <li>Beautiful dark Burgundy red...  </li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for and in a very flattering color.  </li>
      <li>Decent price too!</li>
      <li>I use no base coat, two coats of polish and then the CND Vinylux top coat and my manicure lasts at least 7 days.</li>
      <li>really lasts.  </li>
      <li>I can go 7 days with the polish before the tip chipping becomes really noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It stays on well for the week and doesn&#x27;t really chip.  </li>
      <li>I really like this polish.  </li>
      <li>The girl at salon told me to re-apply the top coat every other day to keep from chipping.</li>
      <li>Wish they produced more dark shimmery reds.</li>
      <li>This Dark Lava color is stunning for the fall and winter months.</li>
      <li>It took a while under the uv light to get them to dry</li>
      <li>I ordered this because I had read a claim that it lasted longer (with top coat) than typical polish.</li>
      <li>I can finally have a nice looking manicure without destroying my names using shellac polish.</li>
      <li>Pretty color looks different than photo.</li>
      <li>quick shipping, item as expected</li>

      <li>I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on!</li>
      <li>not sure how well it will last and help my thin nails (ring fingers) but beautiful finish.</li>

<li> and I never make it past day three before it starts to chip.</li>
<li> It make my nails weak and the started to break.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get a week of wear from this polish- closer to three days.</li>

    <li> Beautiful color, CND quality. Just use it properly with no base and Vinylux top coat.</li>
    <li> The color was as I expected. I will try another color. .</li>
    <li> Nice color, unfortunately did not last one week.</li>
    <li> quick shipping, item as expected</li>
    <li> Love the color and love how great it stays on.</li>
    <li> The polish is great. Does not chip off like other brands and covers in one coat.  I did not care for this color myself but use this brand of polish exclusively.  I does state one week polish on the bottle so a touch up is needed to go 2 weeks.  The longer it stays on the harder it becomes.  Wish they produced more dark shimmery reds. Most have too much purple.</li>
    <li> At first I was turned off by the frosted look of the polish in the bottle but was delighted to see that when applied, the &#x27;frosted&#x27; look seems to vanish. Great color</li>
    <li> I have been using this polish for a couple of months and get many compliments.</li>
    <li> Beautiful dark Burgundy red...  perfect color for fall and winter. I really love that this polish dries so quickly.  I, however, do not get a week&#x27;s wear out of this polish.  I have long nails.  They are very smooth and I wonder if this is the reason I have problems with nail polishes lasting.</li>
    <li> I had hoped I could use this product in place of the UV gel I have been using for the past two years. I was willing to lose a week of wear in exchange for being able to remove it with normal polish remover (no soaking). Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get a week of wear from this polish- closer to three days. I have tried it three separate times and I never make it past day three before it starts to chip. I follow the instructions exactly. It&#x27;s not a bad product for the price, and the color is nice, but I am going back to my UV gel.</li>
    <li> Great color love  Vinylux nail polish  no lite required, it will last for 2 weeks or more by just applying the top coat weekly what a life saver. They have a wide selection of colors also.</li>
    <li> I love the vinylux polishes. They definitely have lasting power!!! I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on! The Vinylux lasts about a week for me, which is amazing. Some of the polishes are a little clumpy - like they are a little old - but it&#x27;s ok. Decent price too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I had read a claim that it lasted longer (with top coat) than typical polish. It is a nice polish, but chipped after a day the way any other does.</li>
    <li> I have a color by Perfect Match called Queen Fierce, this is slightly lighter and beautiful. It is a deep almost brownish hue burgundy with a hint of metallic shine in it, not fully a matte finish. It takes some time to dry with base and top coat but overall beautiful without the soak off of gel polish. Just tried it so not sure how well it will last and help my thin nails (ring fingers) but beautiful finish. Be quick to apply and apply just the right amount for a professional looking manicure.</li>
    <li> Another beautiful dark red burgundy color. Pretty color looks different than photo. This polish is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!! Dries super fast!!</li>
    <li> I really like this polish.  It stays on well for the week and doesn&#x27;t really chip.  And I still feel good about getting my manicures every week!</li>
    <li> The color is a deep burgundy and gorgeous.  I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this polish.  I can go 7 days with the polish before the tip chipping becomes really noticeable.  2 coats of polish dries in 10-15 minutes then the top coat is 8 and a half minutes to dry.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  I definitely see a difference in wear from drying it in the sun to drying it at night with no light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person where my manicure chips in less than 24 hours. I&#x27;m going on 4 days and they still look great. I was very careful not to get any on my skin when polishing, and I think this may help. I love this color...it&#x27;s a great staple color for winter.</li>
    <li> I wore this for a week and then switched colors.  It make my nails weak and the started to break.  I would like to return this product.</li>
    <li> This is going to be my go to nail polish and I think it is just great</li>
    <li> The color is great, but it did not last 7 days as advertised. It was easy to take off with remover and did not stain my nails. I purchased online and had it put on at salon. The girl at salon told me to re-apply the top coat every other day to keep from chipping. It took a while under the uv light to get them to dry though so I never did. By day 4 my nails looked nice but all of the tips were chipped.</li>
    <li> Great color, and this polish really does stay a week with out chipping. A great alternative to the cost of gel polish manicures.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for and in a very flattering color.  Glad I made this purchased. i would recommend.</li>
    <li> that is how this is being marketed. I did what it said used two coats and their top coat. It lasted about 5 days without chipping</li>
    <li> Great color however, when I took the polish off my nails were peeling.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this polish!  Gorgeous deep plum color and lasts a week on my nails!</li>
    <li> This polish is awesome. The color is as seen online. Make sure to use the vinyl us topcoat. Really doesn&#x27;t chip!</li>
    <li> The color is shiny and that is by I gave only 3 stars. The quality is very good. It is more for winter but don&#x27;t like the shine there</li>
    <li> really lasts.  just little edge touch ups needed.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with the CND Vinylux polishes. As long as you follow the instructions, this stuff has staying power. I use no base coat, two coats of polish and then the CND Vinylux top coat and my manicure lasts at least 7 days. It will show wear at the tips (no chips though), but nothing anyone else would notice unless they were holding my hand and looking squarely at my nails! I can finally have a nice looking manicure without destroying my names using shellac polish. This Dark Lava color is stunning for the fall and winter months. I love it!</li>
