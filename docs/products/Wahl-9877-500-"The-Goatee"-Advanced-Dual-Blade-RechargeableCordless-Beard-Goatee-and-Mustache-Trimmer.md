      <li>I had to pry it against the counter top to get it to come off.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;I was quite impressed that someone from Wahl took the time to read user reviews about their products and to personally respond.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an OK product but when using the stubble attachment it snags and pulls on the beard.  </li>

      <li>They break so easily that i wasn&#x27;t able to get it working even once.  </li>
      <li>If you want the pleasure of using a quality tool go with a Wahl, as most reviews remark on this aspect I expect most, if not all, enjoy this quality.     </li>

      <li>He offered an opportunity to change my opinion about the product and sent me a replacement unit free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>does a fantastic job of both goatee and mustache.</li>
      <li>Goatee\\&quot; Advanced Dual Blade, Rechargeable/Cordless Beard, Goatee &amp; Mustache</li>
      <li>It trims really well at many settings and the shift head allows for even more precision.</li>
      <li>I charge it for another night, making sure I am doing it exactly right.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m able to control the length consistently with the guide.</li>
      <li>The Wahl does a fine job and has several trim length options - good buy.</li>
      <li>This is the second one that I&#x27;ve bought, and it&#x27;s the best so far.  </li>
      <li>But since this is my first of this kind (a goatee), I think the sound it provides is a bit high and</li>
      <li>I decided to try out something different from the Philips Norelco, and decided to go with another good name brand, Wahl,</li>
      <li>This item has made trimming a beard or goatee easy and consistent.</li>
      <li>This works better without turbo than my older trimmer did with turbo.  </li>
      <li>it east to use , very consistent and makes grooming a breeze.</li>
      <li>Normally, Wahl makes amazing grooming products, but you really get what you pay for here.  </li>
      <li>The dual blade is great for getting at \\&quot;tight spots\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I gave it a two since I think it would work fine for very  hair</li>
      <li>It may be fine if you like a short goatee but anything more and its just not going to cut it.</li>
      <li>I think it would be an amazing product if it actually did what it is intended to do however, not the case.    </li>
      <li>Without attachments, you can trim very closely and get ready for an easy clean shave.    </li>
      <li>IT WAS WORTH</li>
      <li>The prices were right</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to knock everythign apart with the unit open.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought the battery was not charged all the way when I first turned it on, but it had all the charge it was going to get!  </li>
      <li>Wanted to finally replace my old Conair and heard good things about Wahl.</li>
      <li>The blades seem superior to the trimmers I&#x27;ve previously purchased at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>You most definitely get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Thought I was buying from a reputable manufacturer with a solid product line.  </li>
      <li>but I could see the difference in quality on the first use.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t shave or trim my beard often enough to say \\&quot;I Love It\\&quot; or I might have given this 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I now use the first position for that look.  </li>
      <li>So, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this tool and am looking forward to having it continue to work for a few good years, as I expect it will.</li>
      <li>Blades are sharp and cut clean without pulling for a quick, comfortable trim.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, the blades seemed nice and sharp.</li>
      <li>He uses it about every other week to trim his beard and goatee to keep it looking nice for work, and he has yet to have a problem.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, there is enough play in the wires that I was able to turn the switch 180 degrees and reset in the unit nice and firm.  </li>
      <li>It initially worked great, cut smoothly, and held a charge for at least 1-2 shaves.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think Wahl&#x27;s engineers can bring themselves to design anything that won&#x27;t last a good long time</li>
      <li>I have to run over the beard/stubble like 10 times, esp in tricky areas like the jaw line and certain areas of chin.</li>
      <li>I bought it about 1 yr back and is still working fine for me.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A VERY HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>Of course, I liked each one I bought, in terms of functionality and its looks, and it did the job (little did I know).</li>
      <li>but I was able to achieve a one week growth&#x27;s look after about 3 to 4 tries.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my whole beard with no guard for that 5 o&#x27;clock shaddow look.  </li>
      <li>I tried the stubble guard but didn&#x27;t really have a need for it.  </li>
      <li>Better off buying professional series if you want it to last.  </li>
      <li>It cuts but clean up takes several passes to meet</li>
      <li>What is even more frustrating is the instruction manual raves at how easy this process is.  </li>
      <li>Ask anyone and they&#x27;ll tell you a new beard/mustache/goatee trimmer can be an adventure in a new style when you first use it.     </li>
      <li>They snag on the hair and makes i had to shut it down and start again many times.  </li>
      <li>The swivel head is nice for switching from a wide area to a close-in, and I was surprised that the stubble guard leaves an even shorter amount than the one which it replaced which was already pretty short.</li>
      <li>Strong and sharp blades cut very well...</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I keep my goatee at a little more than a stubble</li>
      <li>I use level 1 for a cut that&#x27;s a few days more than the stubble look.  </li>
      <li>I knew I was missing out these many years.</li>
      <li>the other attachments you have to snap on...and are a MAJOR PAIN to be able get off...</li>
      <li>So, I was paying for this tool essentially every year, sometimes twice a year, and I didn&#x27;t think this was right.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product.  I use it on my whole beard with no guard for that 5 o&#x27;clock shaddow look.  Had it for a month and the motor is already feeling like it&#x27;s losing power, but it is recommended that you drain the battery completely once a month and fully re-charge and I haven&#x27;t done that.  I would re-buy.</li>
    <li> After a 3-year break from purchasing any Wahl products, I decided to give their Goatee Trimmer a try.  What I found were the same issues that prompted me to stop purchasing Wahl in the first place - great concepts, lousy execution.  They just don&#x27;t seem to get it as their competitors do.    Wahl has great ideas on how to make their products versatile however; they have no concept on how to make them workable.  Nor do they have any idea on how to make their products durable.    In the case of the Goatee Trimmer, it boasts the ability to switch shaver heads and various trim guards to provide the user with the utmost flexibility.  I think it would be an amazing product if it actually did what it is intended to do however, not the case.    Instead, removing the trimmer guards or razor heads is anything but easy.  Nothing performs as the instruction manual says it will.  Every morning is a time-consuming challenge to try to remove one guard and replace it with another.  Nothing fits as it is intended and the entire razor head must be disassembled just to replace a simple trim guard.  What is even more frustrating is the instruction manual raves at how easy this process is.  Obviously, written by someone who is clean-shaven.    My trimmer is going back and that is the last Wahl product I&#x27;ll purchase.  You most definitely get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> in buying yet another norelco, phillips, etc..., etc..... The prices were right but I knew they would last just as long as the last 5 that I carefully selected off the shelf of Target, Sears, wherever. Which would be  from 7 months to a ripe, old 13 months. So, I was paying for this tool essentially every year, sometimes twice a year, and I didn&#x27;t think this was right. And I hated having to search for yet another one after I got used to using the one I had. Ask anyone and they&#x27;ll tell you a new beard/mustache/goatee trimmer can be an adventure in a new style when you first use it.     Of course, I liked each one I bought, in terms of functionality and its looks, and it did the job (little did I know). I also almost went with the new Vacuum assisted models (including Wahl&#x27;s version) but after reading a couple of reviews I went with this one.    Once I received this gem I knew I was missing out these many years. What a quality piece of engineering. You can feel it as a big difference between the \\&quot;Consumer\\&quot; brands, Norelco, and others, etc....     Also, from the first use you can tell the difference in results, I&#x27;m still the same uninformed goatee trimming guy I was before I got this but I could see the difference in quality on the first use. It looked like a professional cut versus what I had gotten out of my old Norelco just the week before (still not a pro&#x27;s style but that&#x27;s my problem not the trimmers).     So my perception was one of instant difference in quality of cut which I think is the result of the blades, motor power and the design of the trim guide attachment. Obviously I didn&#x27;t go to any training before getting the Wahl so it had to be the tool itself.     If you want the pleasure of using a quality tool go with a Wahl, as most reviews remark on this aspect I expect most, if not all, enjoy this quality.     One caveat though, I did read where some guys are snapping off the little button that releases the attachment on the head. I don&#x27;t think Wahl&#x27;s engineers can bring themselves to design anything that won&#x27;t last a good long time so the operation of this little button can feel inordinately stiff or difficult. This is absolutely the result of using previous trimmers with latches, buttons, what have you, that are so soft in operation that you feel there is something wrong with the Wahl.     Do as I did and armed with the knowledge of previous guys breaking this thing, have faith that it actually works especially well, press it firmly and then slide the attachment off, which is also a firmer fit then you are likely use to, but, again, have faith and it will go on and off as well as you like, and likely last longer than you might want to believe.    So, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this tool and am looking forward to having it continue to work for a few good years, as I expect it will. In fact, I also bought the nose-hair trimmer and that&#x27;s a nice piece of work as well, but that&#x27;s another review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a bunch of beard trimmers. This is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It runs on batteries, so I don&#x27;t have to hunt for a recharger. (I just use rechargeable batteries)  It has served me well, and it&#x27;s made in the USA! How many times do you see THAT these days?</li>
    <li> All I can say is that I am completely dissatisfied with this product. It is very cheaply made and a very poor trimmer. It may be fine if you like a short goatee but anything more and its just not going to cut it. Even after going over my short beard again and again it kept missing hairs over and over. It just does not lift and cut all the hairs evenly.     As for the base its about as cheap as they come and wont hold the trimmer very securely and I also had a hard time getting the power cord to stay attached to the trimmer. It is very loose and wants to fall out with the slightest touch. I would but this in a $15 trimmer category and for goatees only. I gave it a two since I think it would work fine for very  hair but anything over I would give it a 1 star.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer in November 2008.  It initially worked great, cut smoothly, and held a charge for at least 1-2 shaves.  After roughly 1 month of use, however, the battery would not hold a charge.  I called Wahl customer service and had a replacement unit shipped to me.  After roughly 9 months of use (only using the trimmer 1-2 times per week) the battery again would not hold a charge.  I still am able to use it for about 5 minutes after charging overnight (enough for a VERY quick shave), but needless to say I&#x27;m not very pleased with this product overall.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave or trim my beard often enough to say \\&quot;I Love It\\&quot; or I might have given this 5 stars. But I am very happy with it. I keep my goatee at a little more than a stubble and I&#x27;m able to control the length consistently with the guide. The blades seem superior to the trimmers I&#x27;ve previously purchased at the drugstore. The dual blade is great for getting at \\&quot;tight spots\\&quot;. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it about 1 yr back and is still working fine for me. The comments were a lot help for me to take the decision on buying the Wahl. But I do not regret the choice I&#x27;ve made and its worth the money I&#x27;ve spent. But since this is my first of this kind (a goatee), I think the sound it provides is a bit high and as I&#x27;ve read in couple of other comments the removal of attachments are a bit difficult thing to do.</li>
    <li> The 1st Wahl trimmer that I purchased failed within a few weeks.  I posted my review on Amazon and was contacted soon after by a Wahl representative.  He offered an opportunity to change my opinion about the product and sent me a replacement unit free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a different brand trimmer when the 1st failed but it&#x27;s the Wahl that I depend on for everyday use.  The replacement trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut to the short length that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl&#x27;s 11 position guard is more than adequate.  I use level 1 for a cut that&#x27;s a few days more than the stubble look.  I tried the stubble guard but didn&#x27;t really have a need for it.  The battery life is very good.  I use the trimmer 3-4 times a week and charge it after 3 weeks or so.  It can also be used while it&#x27;s being charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite impressed that someone from Wahl took the time to read user reviews about their products and to personally respond.  The reason I purchased the Wahl trimmer is because of brand familiarity and especially because my barber recommended it.  My review is based on extended use of the replacement trimmer and I am more than satisfied with it.  It&#x27;s less expensive than the other brand I purchased and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE PURCHASED 2 TRIMMERS BEFORE THIS ONE AND THIS ONE BEATS THEM ALL!I LIKE HAVING A LARGE AND A SMALL TRIMMER. THIS IS A VERY HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT. IT WAS WORTH THE VERY VERY LONG WAIT.</li>
    <li> This Item is very appealing to the eye but that is about it. It cuts but clean up takes several passes to meet this neat freaks cut he likes. Blade is just not sharp enough</li>
    <li> I wanted a stubble trimmer. a 2 day look, shorter than 1 mm (YMMV).  The attachments are completely useless. They snag on the hair and makes i had to shut it down and start again many times.  The stubble setting gives uneven looking results and too long for my requirements.So, i decided to use it directly without any  attachments and I was able to get wat i wanted. But, the process is still painful. I have to run over the beard/stubble like 10 times, esp in tricky areas like the jaw line and certain areas of chin. This dries my skin and is time consuming.  Also, somethings wrong with the battery hardly lasts me 2 uses.    So, if you want a stubble look. I think it should be achievable with any face trimmer without the use of a guide attachment.  I say face trimmer because the blades in a hair clippers are usually have larger teeth and not really suitable to use directly on the face ( I have tried that too lol ).    Also this device only works on 120 volts. could not use in most of Europe/India etc.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one a few years ago, and it did very well.  I like it well enough to order another.</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing ... it east to use , very consistent and makes grooming a breeze. AWESOME !!!</li>
    <li> So I need to get a beard trimmer as I decided to grow a beard. Keeping it trim was the best look, both profesionally and personally.  I go to Target, pick out what looks like to be a solid buy. I charge it overnight.  I try to use it the next day nothing happens.  I charge it for another night, making sure I am doing it exactly right.  Nothing at all the next morning.  of course I can&#x27;t find my receipt, but will probably mail back the package to Wahl and try to get a new one as it says it has a 5 year warranty.   In the meantime, I will have to go buy another beard trimmer as I want to keep my facial hair and not wait the 3-4 weeks to get my new one in the mail.   By the way, it&#x27;s cheaper at Target where i bought it.</li>
    <li> A friend got me this trimmer about a year ago, an I love this thing. It makes trimming my goatee a breeze.</li>
    <li> As a basic trimmer it works well. The smaller blade is not very useful. On mine, the battery has had some problems holding a charge.</li>
    <li> This item has made trimming a beard or goatee easy and consistent. It is a good buy, and an excellent product. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is THE WORST TRIMMER i have ever purchased.  Normally, Wahl makes amazing grooming products, but you really get what you pay for here.  The snap-on guards do not fit well and they break very easily.  They break so easily that i wasn&#x27;t able to get it working even once.  I am very mechanically savvy, so it isn&#x27;t a case of giving a monkey a Rubic&#x27;s cube, it&#x27;s just a terrible and cheap piece of machinery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my trimmer for 6 to 8 months and I&#x27;ve had not trouble with it.  There was some learning curve in getting the look that I wanted but I was able to achieve a one week growth&#x27;s look after about 3 to 4 tries.  I now use the first position for that look.  I don&#x27;t use the small trimmer because I don&#x27;t need it.  The acculok head serves all my needs.  From time to time I will use position 2 or 3 for eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I recently dropped the unit and damaged the acculok attachment.  I contacted Wahl via their web site and recieved a reply within a day or two with instructions on how to order a replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had Wahl products for many years and this trimmer lived up to their standards for quality and value.</li>
    <li> Worked great until about ~6 years and then stopped working. Doesn&#x27;t seem to charge or turn on anymore.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product at all. It adjusts to the size that fits you best and trims your goatee perfectly. It does not pull on your goatee hair. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thought I was buying from a reputable manufacturer with a solid product line.  Better off buying professional series if you want it to last.  Died after 6 months.  Customer service was decent in sending me a new battery assuming that my old one was dead and may have been sitting on the shelf for up to a year before being purchased.  I was instructed to remove the battery and replace it myself or send the unit back for warranty repair.  Warranty detail states $6.50 to cover handling plus shipping.  BS!  Build a better product and warranty wouldn&#x27;t be needed.  Mind you, replacing the battery or opening the unit voids the warranty.  If you&#x27;re the least bit handy, just open the unit up as instructed \\&quot;Battery Removal &amp; Disposal\\&quot;.  Just pay attention how the blades sit on so you can reassemble.  It&#x27;s very easy to knock everythign apart with the unit open.  My problem was that the on/off switch was not properly set in the unit and thus was not turning on from the outside.  It actually seems that the on/off switch soldered to the wires is on backwards.  Thankfully, there is enough play in the wires that I was able to turn the switch 180 degrees and reset in the unit nice and firm.  This simple stupidity in assembly warrants my made in china comment.  Works once again (just have to deal with on being off and off being on).  If you have a simply solder gun, you can handle just about any needed repair saving you aggrevation dealing with the warranty service and hastle of returing it.  They received a two benefitting by their speed of customer service and ability to send out a battery.  I have a spare for future use if the unit does in fact last that long.  Would never buy from them again.  You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Wahl 9877-500 \\&quot;The Goatee\\&quot; Advanced Dual Blade, Rechargeable/Cordless Beard, Goatee &amp; Mustache Trimmer    item is in reaaly good condition</li>
    <li> the big attachment that you see on the pic goes on and off easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the other attachments you have to snap on...and are a MAJOR PAIN to be able get off...I cut my finger trying to snap it off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;horrible</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband 3 years ago. He uses it about every other week to trim his beard and goatee to keep it looking nice for work, and he has yet to have a problem. He has thick facial hair and so he has had lots of experience with other brands of trimmers not holding up. But we went with a trusted name brand and this one just works great!</li>
    <li> I decided to try out something different from the Philips Norelco, and decided to go with another good name brand, Wahl, or so I thought.  This thing should be pulled from amazon.  The attachments are crap.  Thin cheap plastic, hard to put on and take off.  I had to pry it against the counter top to get it to come off.  The multi height attachment is poorly designed.  With a curved head design depending on what angle you hold it at, it will cut different lengths!  Despite all this, the trimmer it self pulls at your hair.  I couldn&#x27;t get through one trimming of my goatee with out it painfully pulling my hair over five times in two minutes.  I sent it back.  I got the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, this thing works wonders!!!  Just want I wanted from a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd wahl goatee trimmer and yet again it is dead after approx 6 months.  When it is working it works well, but this is the second unit I have had that has died within a year.  Battery is completely dead, will not recharge.   I will look for a different manufacturer this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; products over the years.  The Wahl does a fine job and has several trim length options - good buy.</li>
    <li> Looked like a good product with a good price. Unit failed to turn on or ever  take a charge despite plugging in properly and trying to charge overnight as suggested in the instructions. Now I have to go and deal with returning it to Amazon, shipping it back, getting another one, etc. Am willing to change my review upon receipt/use of a new unit but definitely not giving a five since now I have to go through this trouble.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a different brand that wasn&#x27;t cordless and will say I recommend it. The swivel head is nice for switching from a wide area to a close-in, and I was surprised that the stubble guard leaves an even shorter amount than the one which it replaced which was already pretty short. I don&#x27;t think you can beat the quality and functionality of this one for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had similar Wahl shaver products in the past and this seems the weakest of the bunch.  At first I thought the battery was not charged all the way when I first turned it on, but it had all the charge it was going to get!  Not great, but it gets the job done.  Nice depth/length adjustment, though.  Smaller blade on other side that swivels around, but is basically useless. I have actually paid less for other Wahl trimmers and had more speed/power and a light!  Not great!</li>
    <li> Wanted to finally replace my old Conair and heard good things about Wahl. I was disappointed that the cradle didn&#x27;t actually charge the battery, you have to manually plug into the adapter cord (how tough is it to have a charging cradle like my cell phone, Sonicare, and even my ancient Conair trimmer??) Also missed the nose hair trimmer that I had on the Conair- but the final straw was that the small attachments were VERY difficult to put on and off. Otherwise, the blades seemed nice and sharp. Perhaps another Wahl model...?</li>
    <li> This trimmer provides strong cut, even for close trims on a thick beard.  This works better without turbo than my older trimmer did with turbo.  Blades are sharp and cut clean without pulling for a quick, comfortable trim.  Attachments work well for maintaining length of a beard.  Without attachments, you can trim very closely and get ready for an easy clean shave.    When my prior trimmer (a Conair) died, I wanted something that was a quality build, leading me the the Wahl.  I have used Wahl&#x27;s in the past and have never been disapointed in their quality.  They are the only company I know of that actually manufacture their trimmers in the US instead of China, and that difference shows.  It&#x27;s been two years and still no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I&#x27;ve bought, and it&#x27;s the best so far.  Never have a problem with it, I love it.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this trimmer.  Would highly recommend it to those gentlemen who have difficulty trimming down their goatee or beard!</li>
    <li> Strong and sharp blades cut very well... no pulls as with my old one.  chrome finish a little hard too clean if you let any splash water dry on it... love the rotating head, very good for tight trimming arounf my lips and nose.  Doesn&#x27;t run direct line from outlet, only charges so if it&#x27;s dead you can&#x27;t use until the charge is complete, but it charges fast, and if your in a rush about 5 minutes will give you enough \\&quot;juice\\&quot; to get the job done.</li>
    <li> My guy always had a hard time trimming/shaving his goatee. Now with this trimmer, he has a perfect trim everytime.</li>
    <li> does a fantastic job of both goatee and mustache. Use the small trimmer for tight areas and larger one for mustache and goatee.    Great size and holds a charge well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product but when using the stubble attachment it snags and pulls on the beard.  I have exchanged the item twice and the same result.  Too bad, I really like the length of the stubble guide attachment.</li>
    <li> This product is everything the ads say it is. It trims really well at many settings and the shift head allows for even more precision. I&#x27;d recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer!  Smooth mechanics and DOES NOT pull hair!  Just as promised.  Nice weight and ergonomically comfortable in the hand.  Would purchase a Wahl again.</li>
