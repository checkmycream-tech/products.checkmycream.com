      <li>I really love this cocoa butter.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this lotion to the point that my husband and I have started using it as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Lovely product.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite Cuccio body butter fragrance...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to many people and they love it as well.</li>
      <li>For some reason it would not ship to me here in PR any more.</li>
      <li>I love Cuccio butters.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and am glad to be able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Just ok.</li>
      <li>And the scents are lovely.</li>
      <li>I like Epicuren better.</li>
      <li>love the feel and aromal</li>
      <li>Most of my clients request this scent and they love the moisture it provides for their skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and soft.</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely, smells good, doesn&#x27;t work well on dry skin.</li>
      <li>but I enjoy</li>
      <li>My twenty year old Grand daughter loved it so much I sent it home with her and ordered myself another.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clean smell.</li>
      <li>was also shipped very fast!</li>
      <li>I purchased my first jar at a spa for twice the cost.  </li>
      <li>I cant live without it!!</li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth and silky the entire day when I apply in the morning and it keeps my skin moisturized all day!</li>
      <li>I was expecting a much nicer scent.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product for everyone, children included!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very whipped.</li>
      <li>I had a sample of other scents of this line of body butters and I loved them, so I thought I would buy a big tub of this scent.</li>
      <li>Although both are really nice and similar in terms of how long they moisturize (and smell!)</li>
      <li>My skin went from being dry and bumpy to smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Do not like the smell too much, Lemongrass is a little bit too similar to mosquito&#x27;s repellent, but quality of product is always very good, Cuccio butters are all very good products</li>
      <li>Not thick and greasy.</li>
      <li>completely healed all of my daughters eczema patches, and has prevented them as well!</li>
      <li>My professional manicurist uses this product and recommended it to me.</li>
      <li>Light fragrance not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, especially if you need a regular way to pamper yourself.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate, and my skin is like sandpaper if I don&#x27;t use lotion.</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin and live in a low humidity desert area.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first but it only took one try to convince me that it&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>

    <li> perfume like smell not as I expected</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughters whom both have eczema in the winter in hopes to relieve the dry patches. This product has over- exceeded all of my expectations! I absolutely love this lotion to the point that my husband and I have started using it as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely healed all of my daughters eczema patches, and has prevented them as well! This lotion goes on so silky without any oily residue left behind. My skin feels so smooth and silky the entire day when I apply in the morning and it keeps my skin moisturized all day! And the scent is amazing, not overpowering and calming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for everyone, children included!</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite Cuccio body butter fragrance...but it&#x27;s still a luxurious creme! Non-greasy. Body butter a must-have product for pampering oneself.</li>
    <li> I love Cuccio butters.  I bought both Lemongrass/Lavender and Honey at the same time.  Although both are really nice and similar in terms of how long they moisturize (and smell!) for, the Lavender absorbs a bit faster and leaves a sort of powdery finish.  It makes my skin feel so nice.  I highly recommend it, especially if you need a regular way to pamper yourself.</li>
    <li> I really love this cocoa butter. It&#x27;s very whipped. Not thick and greasy. I keep it by my bedside and do up my feet with socks every night. My arms, legs and chest seem very smooth since using this product. The last one I was using was double the price. For some reason it would not ship to me here in PR any more. So I tried this one. Others do not like the smell but I enjoy it&#x27;s clean smell. My twenty year old Grand daughter loved it so much I sent it home with her and ordered myself another. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Great for Massage Therapy. Easy to apply. Spreads nicely, a little goes a long way. The scent is pleasant and soft. Most of my clients request this scent and they love the moisture it provides for their skin.</li>
    <li> My professional manicurist uses this product and recommended it to me. I was skeptical at first but it only took one try to convince me that it&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay. Not very fragrant. I won&#x27;t get it again. Its creamy like the others, and that&#x27;s good. But I like to put lotion on and have some fragrance with it. The fragrance is gone within seconds of hitting your body.  So I don&#x27;t like it. However, it does keep the skin moisturize.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate, and my skin is like sandpaper if I don&#x27;t use lotion. But I hate the sticky, greasy feel. This cream is amazing. My manicurist gave me a sample and I was hooked. I use it 3-5 times a day. It dries instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all. Within a minute, you can touch an iPad and it won&#x27;t leave a streak. And the scents are lovely.</li>
    <li> Do not like the smell too much, Lemongrass is a little bit too similar to mosquito&#x27;s repellent, but quality of product is always very good, Cuccio butters are all very good products</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as butter flavor but nice to the touch, was a gift to my girl, she is happy using it.</li>
    <li> I cant live without it!!</li>
    <li> I was given this from a friend but could not find locally-It has become my very favorite hand cream. I suffer from extreme dryness due to an illness and this cream is Excellent/it stays on all night and has a very pleasant fragrance!!! was also shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> This butter is wonderful, what every girl needs for smooth, silky, and hydrated skin!</li>
    <li> Same as the butter honey cream only smells different</li>
    <li> If I could give this 100 stars I would!</li>
    <li> Nice hydrating body butter. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> This was a gift I received from someone.. I love this lotion, it is now my favorite!! I ordered the multi pack to give to friends and this size for myself.. The scent is perfect and it feels so nice on my skin.. I have offered it to friends when I am putting it on, I keep one in my purse, they all have lived it...</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like lavender and lemongrass</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely, smells good, doesn&#x27;t work well on dry skin. I like Epicuren better.</li>
    <li> Cuccio Body Butter, in any fragrance, is a soft, non-greasy, delightful treat for the hands and body.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and am glad to be able to find it on Amazon.  I purchased my first jar at a spa for twice the cost.  I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to many people and they love it as well.</li>
    <li> Really nice cream.  Softens and hydrates skin.  Light fragrance not overwhelming.  Use at bedtime for relaxing.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. I had a sample of other scents of this line of body butters and I loved them, so I thought I would buy a big tub of this scent. I am so glad I did. I have extremely dry skin and live in a low humidity desert area. There are few lotions that work and I have tried them all. When I received this product, I was skeptical. Then I tried it and was amazed. My skin went from being dry and bumpy to smooth and hydrated. This is a great body butter and is something I would buy again and be proud to give as a gift. It came well packed and wrapped.</li>
    <li> love the feel and aromal</li>
    <li> Just ok. Nice texture. The scent isn&#x27;t the most pleasing though so I only use it for foot reflexology.  I was expecting a much nicer scent. But Lavender can be a tricky scent depending on how it was harvested and from where. 2 stars for texture.</li>
