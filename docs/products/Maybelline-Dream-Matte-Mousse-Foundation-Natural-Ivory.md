      <li>so you can kinda warm up the product while appling and then use a sponge to kinda press it in to your face.</li>

      <li>and you shoud love the finished result.</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the best foundations I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I picked this up on a whim as I love the mousse blush as a change from powder or cream.</li>
      <li>but thats what you get most of the time when ordering online.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this at a nearby Ulta, and let me tell you this is a wonderful foundation.</li>
      <li>If you have oily skin definetely try this your gonna love it a swear.</li>
      <li>It glides on and seems to just melt into your skin, minimizing pores and giving you a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I then top it off with MUFE HD Microfinish Powder.</li>
      <li>and i love it to death.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll watch for more bargains.</li>
      <li>I like it better</li>
      <li>Wish I had gotten more at this price.  </li>
      <li>HD Foundation, which I do love btw.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this foundation.</li>
      <li>Great coverage and the color was perfect, but it did give my face a subtle yet unnatural shine.</li>
      <li>I would stay away from this one and even would recommend liquid foundation over it, but ideally if you can fork out the cash go for Bare Minerals foundation</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, don&#x27;t need a whole lot, conceals great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that this works best with Revlon Color Stay concealer and any loose powder.</li>
      <li>it is easy with your fingers</li>
      <li>Because of its formula being kinda whiped it not all shiny and wierd it leave your face MATTE like its  name and its easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Hides all mild blemishes!  </li>
      <li>it so creamy and fabulous.</li>
      <li>then I use the E.L.F. powder brush sprayed with Mac Fix Plus to blend lightly.</li>
      <li>The trick is to apply it lightly.</li>
      <li>foundation is very, very matte, so if you&#x27;re into the more dewy type look, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s got good coverage for a light, sheer product.</li>
      <li>so it has a full coverage</li>
      <li>If you like full coverage this is not for you.</li>
      <li>Next use a good primer.</li>
      <li>You can get great coverage with it, but if you go overboard, it can easily start looking cakey.</li>
      <li>First off, make sure you moisturize very well.</li>
      <li>This foundation is very natural looking, but achieves more coverage than you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you need more coverage (for blemishes, etc.), try using a little concealer on top of the foundation and finish with a light layer of powder.</li>
      <li>Light powder on my nose and cheeks took care of the shine, so I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>Soooooooo worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t achieve the desired coverage then add a little more and smooth it on top of the first layer.</li>
      <li>product will not work well if it&#x27;s not applied right.</li>
      <li>or that don&#x27;t have the right skin type for this</li>
      <li>If you prime and set, this stuff looks amazing and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has an uneven tone or just needs a nice, cheap foundation.</li>
      <li>It goes on sooo smooth and weightless, and the coverage is way more than I expected.</li>
      <li>At first i was worried since i&#x27;ve never ordered make up online</li>
      <li>I discovered that the first time I tried it.</li>
      <li>My t-zone can get pretty oily.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, blends easily and does indeed dry matte, but not dry or cakey.</li>
      <li>I would normally wear light or classic beige and this foundation works for me in natural ivory.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>of the reviews say that it cakes but with any foundation, it all depends on how much of it you use.</li>
      <li>If you use too much of ANY foundation, it will cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you dont really need concealer with it</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also very buildable.</li>
      <li>I woul highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have tried them all, both drug store and high end foundations</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this for the first time and was so pleasantly surprised by it!</li>
      <li>I mean, come on, I&#x27;m comparing it to my MUFE and liking it a bit more.</li>
      <li>and I have major bags from staying up late either studying or just not being able to rest, and</li>
      <li>The coverage is nice and sheer but it covers the broken blood vessels on my nose.</li>
      <li>No other foundation comes close to it -- not at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this foundation is the easiest and least messy to apply, and the end result is a very natural and smooth look.</li>
      <li>also have a few acne scars and large pores from when I was younger.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love this foundation. Goes on smooth, don&#x27;t need a whole lot, conceals great. And it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it at a drug store. Soooooooo worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> It was a great bargain.  Always use it.  Wish I had gotten more at this price.  I&#x27;ll watch for more bargains.</li>
    <li> I ended up with this in Natural Ivory because my teenage daughter said that it was too dark a shade for her skin.  I would normally wear light or classic beige and this foundation works for me in natural ivory. It goes on very smoothly with the sponge applicator.  I haven&#x27;t tried applying it with my finger tips as of yet.  I do find, however, that I feel the need to add some blush and powder to finish the look otherwise my face is basically a blank palette.  I am just over 50, and I still end up with a somewhat oily forehead and nose when I use this, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb any oil.  It is very comfortable to wear and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this for the first time and was so pleasantly surprised by it! It goes on sooo smooth and weightless, and the coverage is way more than I expected. I will agree with the review that it can be cakey and washed out IF you overdo it. I discovered that the first time I tried it. Now I go easy and follow up with a bronzer powder - it looks perfect! The best part is that my skin remains matte for MUCH longer than it ever has with a foundation. My t-zone can get pretty oily. I&#x27;ve tried Lancome Dual powder and Lancome foundation. With both, my t-zone was extremely oily by mid day. Not with this stuff. I&#x27;d recommended with a sign of caution for the heavy handed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous different brands of foundation but few of them come close to this one. This foundation is very natural looking, but achieves more coverage than you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews say that it cakes but with any foundation, it all depends on how much of it you use. The trick is to apply it lightly. If it doesn&#x27;t achieve the desired coverage then add a little more and smooth it on top of the first layer. If you need more coverage (for blemishes, etc.), try using a little concealer on top of the foundation and finish with a light layer of powder. If you use too much of ANY foundation, it will cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this product was finding my shade. Not the product&#x27;s fault! The best way to find your shade is to go to the L&#x27;Oreal website. They have a tool that can help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this foundation is the easiest and least messy to apply, and the end result is a very natural and smooth look. I&#x27;ve found that this works best with Revlon Color Stay concealer and any loose powder.</li>
    <li> Came in a safely nice packaged package and not damaged. At first i was worried since i&#x27;ve never ordered make up online but i really loved it!</li>
    <li> Great coverage and the color was perfect, but it did give my face a subtle yet unnatural shine. Light powder on my nose and cheeks took care of the shine, so I really don&#x27;t mind. Hides all mild blemishes!  -Sam&#x27;s girlfriend (Kitty)</li>
    <li> Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse Foundation is the absolutely BEST foundation that I have ever used! It glides on and seems to just melt into your skin, minimizing pores and giving you a healthy glow. I used to switch around from brand to brand until I found this product. No other foundation comes close to it -- not at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using foundation for many many years and have found that this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and goes on like silk. I woul highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ok, all I can say about this foundation is that it is amazing. I have tried them all, both drug store and high end foundations and I have to say that I prefer this one over all of them. I was using Make Up Forever HD Foundation, which I do love btw. I have to say that I like this even better.&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is very, very matte, so if you&#x27;re into the more dewy type look, this isn&#x27;t for you. Although a few sprits of fix plus can give it a less matte look. With it being so matte, I would not suggest it for anyone with dry skin, as it will kinda stick to dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;I have read quite a few bad reviews on this product and I honestly can&#x27;t see how it could be recieveing any bad reviews at all. I mean, come on, I&#x27;m comparing it to my MUFE and liking it a bit more. I&#x27;m thinking the bad reviews are either people not applying it right or that don&#x27;t have the right skin type for this product.&lt;br /&gt;This product will not work well if it&#x27;s not applied right. First off, make sure you moisturize very well. Next use a good primer. I use Mac Prep + Prime Skin Smoother, which is THE BEST primer ever. When applyig, I dab a few spots on my face with my fingers (btw, I sanitize them each time before putting my fingers in the jar) then I use the E.L.F. powder brush sprayed with Mac Fix Plus to blend lightly. I then top it off with MUFE HD Microfinish Powder. I get a flawless, airbrushed finish and this foundation lasts all day and well into the night.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that alot of people say this foundation doesn&#x27;t last long. I have also read that some people aren&#x27;t using a setting powder because they say the foundation is matte. Well. just because a foundation has a matte finish doesn&#x27;t mean that you don&#x27;t need to set it. If you prime and set, this stuff looks amazing and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a few acne scars and large pores from when I was younger. The HD foundation would sorda settle into them and get shiny towards the end of the day, kinda making them stand out. This stuff seriously camouflages them and nothing else has.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very buildable. You can get great coverage with it, but if you go overboard, it can easily start looking cakey. If you haven&#x27;t tried this, I suggest you do. Just remember to moisturize, prime and set and you shoud love the finished result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months already and i love it to death.I cant use it now because i bought it during the summer and i was a little darker but i cant wait to use it again. it so creamy and fabulous. If you have oily skin definetely try this your gonna love it a swear. Because of its formula being kinda whiped it not all shiny and wierd it leave your face MATTE like its  name and its easy to apply. i usually dont use a brush when i wear this foundation bease it is easy with your fingers so you can kinda warm up the product while appling and then use a sponge to kinda press it in to your face. I think this is a must have foundation you know apart from the liquid one you probably have and its very handy when you are in a hurry. I dont recomend this product if you have dry skin because it will look cakey and kinda flake out plus it leaves you skin even dryer because it is made to leave you face matte. if you have oily skin, go out and buy it now its amazing and will cover up acne,scars and freckles so it has a full coverage and you dont really need concealer with it like i said its great for being in a hurry. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best foundations I have ever used. It has great coverage, is very shine-free, and has exceptional staying power. The only foundation that comes close to it is Maybelline&#x27;s liquid mineral foundation. I recommend both of these products!</li>
    <li> I like this foundation a lot. Its a bit too dark for me but thats what you get most of the time when ordering online. Its medium coverage, which I like. If you like full coverage this is not for you. Yes, your freckles will still show... but freckles are cute! :)</li>
    <li> The mousse feels like it has a great texture but it leaves the worst cakey, matte finish on your skin that just looks horrible and VERY washed out.  I even tried applying it lightly with a high end cosmetic brush and it was still awful.  I would stay away from this one and even would recommend liquid foundation over it, but ideally if you can fork out the cash go for Bare Minerals foundation and you will not be disappointed. Cheers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using foundation for many many years and have found that this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I consider this one of the best concealer, a must have for me, the texture is perfect and the coverage is really good, it last for a long time and is not greasy at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this at a nearby Ulta, and let me tell you this is a wonderful foundation. I&#x27;m fifteen and I have major bags from staying up late either studying or just not being able to rest, and with a light concealer with this to top off makes it look like I have absolutely flawless skin. I would recommend this to anyone who has an uneven tone or just needs a nice, cheap foundation.</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> Being a make-up junky, I have custom blended foundations, high-end foundations and am always trying drugstore stuff. I picked this up on a whim as I love the mousse blush as a change from powder or cream. This is fantastic and beautiful. I put it on over SmashBox primer. The coverage is nice and sheer but it covers the broken blood vessels on my nose. So it&#x27;s got good coverage for a light, sheer product. I like it better thn Laura Mercier Tinted Foundation. It goes on easily, blends easily and does indeed dry matte, but not dry or cakey. At the price, give it a try and you might never go back.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well concealing red spots and rough skin.</li>
