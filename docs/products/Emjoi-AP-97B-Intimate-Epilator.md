### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This was one of the best purchased items that I have ever bought.  </li>
      <li>Since I am living abroad, and we move around a lot I thought it would be best to get a battery operated model</li>
      <li>The best thing is it is so affordable...</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I followed those directions perfectly.</li>

      <li>I just love it!</li>
      <li>It is just an ok epilator, not too good.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a handy product</li>
      <li>which meant I had to buy my own.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe some of these youtube videos...</li>
      <li>This one is very gentle, easy to use and it works!!!</li>
      <li>Overall,  I am really happy with this epilator, and the battery life is really great too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how smooth and hair-free my face is now.  </li>
      <li>I read that it was a good starter epilator, which was true.</li>
      <li>Its very cheap material.  </li>
      <li>For a quick job or on-the-go it is a good product, though.</li>
      <li>It is a nice size, easily traveled with.</li>
      <li>Although I wish it had more power and more options (</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so cute, so</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>now that&#x27;s cute.</li>
      <li>so you have to stay on top of it</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more of an \\&quot;aww\\&quot; factor when holding it.</li>
      <li>I will keep it for taking on trips, but I&#x27;m looking around for one with a LOT more tweezers.</li>
      <li>You can be more forgiving of its pain when its adorable.</li>
      <li>I was concentrating more on \\&quot;trying to not hurt myself\\&quot; with all the pain which can come with 1st time epilating.</li>
      <li>I do have a problem with ingrown hairs, but mostly where the elastic from my undies is tightest on my skin</li>
      <li>I use this pretty much every day, and it&#x27;s helped keep my Brazilian looking flawless.</li>
      <li>I love the smooth look.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not shocked these people are hollering in pain, I would be too!</li>
      <li>Then imagine that all 6-12 hairs were pulled out at once or in very quick succession.  </li>
      <li>but it is easy to do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this particular product was a good starter epilator.</li>
      <li>Do not recommend this for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>After waxing, the hair follicles would turn into little pustules and pimples and the hair removal was patchy at best.  </li>
      <li>think the number of tweezers makes a huge difference as well.</li>
      <li>and I have a smooth face.</li>
      <li>To me, it felt like a light pinch whenever it caught a hair.</li>
      <li>This smaller unit will be great for travel.</li>
      <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Nice product, the delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>This epilator was available - and cheaper than QVC.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just never had them basically plucked in very rapid succession!!!  </li>
      <li>: It&#x27;s super portal, it fits in the palm of my hand easily</li>
      <li>And most of them are OK for legs and such, but for intimate use... not so good.  </li>
      <li>But overall, it is a good product.</li>
      <li>In my eyes that was a dream come true.</li>
      <li>It does drain batteries quickly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The box it comes in is even cute, which I love since I like to place things back in it&#x27;s box after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The small size and shape are ideal for removing hair on the face.  </li>
      <li>The Emjoi Intimate only has 15 pairs of tweezers... compared to 72 tweezers on the popular ones!</li>
      <li>My epilator is still going strong after being on for 3 hours straight...</li>
      <li>I have used many epilators, starting with the first EpiLady that came out many years ago to today.  </li>
      <li>Also, the little clear plastic cover that goes over the tweezers is lovely, lol, I&#x27;d forgotten</li>
      <li>To get an idea how it will feel, use tweezers and pull out 6-12 hairs in the most sensitive area you would like to use it on.  </li>
      <li>Although I could clearly see that it had pulled some out, but not too many.</li>
      <li>Worth the money I think.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t put those on my body for anything, the sound alone for most of these epilators is enough to run you out of the room, let alone how it looks!</li>
      <li>It does take awhile the first time around to get rid of all/most of the hair but after that, the maintenance is easy and fast.  </li>
      <li>My right underarm feels tender a bit too, but I&#x27;m not dying or</li>
      <li>I use it very often, is easy to manage, really works, no pain</li>
      <li>do recommend thoroughly washing the skin first and using an astringent and applying a warm washcloth, especially in the beginning, before using the Emjoi Intimate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy and got this for use on my ears, which, as I&#x27;ve gotten older my ears have decided to become ear-muffs!!</li>
      <li>The two AA batteries don&#x27;t last a long time, but I&#x27;m happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the just that first time of ripping your hairs out by the root.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, IT DOES HURT - AT FIRST.  </li>
      <li>when I said it was my first time</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pink and rose colors.</li>
      <li>must warn you though...if you have never waxed or epilated before, the first time you do</li>
      <li>I probably should try electrolysis first or somthing.</li>
      <li>It hurt to use it on my bikini area and underarms the first two times or so and just din&#x27;t seem to be pulling any hairs out.</li>
      <li>but I can not stress enough to get an epilator that is cute to you.</li>
      <li>It works better on smaller areas like underarms or bikini</li>
      <li>After reading lots of reviews on many types of epilator, I finally decided on trying this one.</li>
      <li>It misses so many that I have to go over and over the same place.</li>
      <li>This was my first epilator</li>
      <li>Using Nair and the like, wasn&#x27;t much different, except for the lovely smell as a bonus.</li>
      <li>was similar to static electric shocks all over the area being epilated when on my legs, bikini area, and underarms.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s battery operated because I use only rechargeable batteries.</li>
      <li>This was my first epilator, after years of shaving.</li>
      <li>Okay, now it maybe different for everyone but epilation for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it almost every day so that I get any regrown hairs right away before they are really noticeable.  </li>
      <li>there was in the daily specials and I thought it would be good to have one in my next trip.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say much more as, it&#x27;s a long review...</li>
      <li>Make sure your hair isn&#x27;t too long, just like the instructions say.</li>
      <li>This product is really good, the only problem is the battery run low too fast.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried an epilator before (nor have I tried waxing). I&#x27;ve always been afraid of the pain, and didn&#x27;t want to try. But recently I was trying to look for a more long term solution than shaving. After reading lots of reviews on many types of epilator, I finally decided on trying this one. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and so far so good. It evoked much less pain that I&#x27;ve expected. Afterall, it&#x27;s pulling hair out of our skin, so you can&#x27;t expect no pain. To me, it felt like a light pinch whenever it caught a hair. I don&#x27;t have much hair on my legs so it took me only a couple minutes to use it on both of my legs. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it left little red dots on my legs (which I thought should be pretty normal when hair is being pulled out). It did cut a few hair short, rather than pulling them out completely. I guess I have to wait a week when they grow back out and try again.</li>
    <li> I come from a long line of hairy women. I have a chin hair issue and I used to tweeze every day. It always seemed to be getting worse. With the epilitator I just turn it on, take a few passes every couple days and I have a smooth face. Hair does grow in cycles so you have to stay on top of it but it is easy to do. It does not hurt in the areas where I am used to tweezing or waxing but in those other areas--- yowza! Over all it is a simple, small, well designed product.</li>
    <li> Its very cheap material.  I used it for my underarms, but because I wax the machine hardly caught any hair do to it being so thin.  I still had to use tweezers, it caught my skin a little too which hurt.  Do not recommend this for fine hair.  It would probably pick up course hair which I imagine will be very painful.  Going to try and return it.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try an epilator for years but was a little afraid because of the pain.  I was on the waiting list at QVC twice - but never got it.  So I turned to Amazon and voila!  This epilator was available - and cheaper than QVC.  I have been using it for several weeks and have actually put my razor away.  I love the smooth look. I can&#x27;t say it is painless, but it&#x27;s just a little pinch when it finds a hair. I have used it on my chin and upper lip.  The upper lip is more sensitive and I have to admit that I&#x27;m still getting used to that.  But as compared to tweezing and shaving - I&#x27;ll take this epilator every time.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator, after years of shaving. I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving again, as epilating is just so easy and actually rather fun. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that is uses 2 AA batteries and is so small. I can take it anywhere, and it has been around the world with me. It does drain batteries quickly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are so few tweezer blades that it takes FOREVER to effectively epilate. It misses so many that I have to go over and over the same place. It works better on smaller areas like underarms or bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must warn you though...if you have never waxed or epilated before, the first time you do it be prepared for some serious pain. Especially if you have dark, thicker hairs. I took several painkillers and had cold washclothes handy. That first time was seriously painful. The legs weren&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;.....But my armpits, arms, and bikini line... I gave up after a bit, and used tweezers to pull out the rest of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I used cold compresses to take away the stinging, and put on a soft, gentle lotion after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.....KEEP IT UP! The next time was not that bad, and now I don&#x27;t even flinch. It&#x27;s the just that first time of ripping your hairs out by the root. Once you&#x27;ve done it once, it&#x27;s a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this particular product was a good starter epilator. I will keep it for taking on trips, but I&#x27;m looking around for one with a LOT more tweezers.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best purchased items that I have ever bought.  Would recommend it highly to others.</li>
    <li> I got my Emjoi Intimate in the mail yesterday....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: It&#x27;s so cute!!! I just love it! I&#x27;ve never epilated or waxed (other than my eyebrows) before and I&#x27;ve heard epilating was so painful. I wanted to get one of the cutest epilators on the market because I felt it would take away the stress of impending pain. It&#x27;s shaped like a woman&#x27;s belly, with the safety button as a belly button... now that&#x27;s cute. It even has what looks like abs! I feel inspired to workout every time I see it! I love it&#x27;s pink and rose colors. It looks so harmless... this was such a huge factor for me. Lots of epilators on the market look dangerous! I wouldn&#x27;t put those on my body for anything, the sound alone for most of these epilators is enough to run you out of the room, let alone how it looks! I wouldn&#x27;t run from the Emjoi Intimate, it&#x27;s more of an \\&quot;aww\\&quot; factor when holding it. The box it comes in is even cute, which I love since I like to place things back in it&#x27;s box after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portability: It&#x27;s super portal, it fits in the palm of my hand easily and my hands are pretty small... I wanted something cordless because I don&#x27;t like being stuck to one place because of a plug... plugs scare me. I don&#x27;t like the idea of plugged in metal tweezers on my body. I have an imagination and I didn&#x27;t even want to go there! The Emjoi Intimate fits in all the little nooks and cannies; I was able to epilate my bikini area and armpits with ease! It&#x27;s battery operated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain Factor: I give it a two on my leg, bikini area, and underarms. Yes, a two! I give it a 3 on my arms. Okay, now it maybe different for everyone but epilation for me was similar to static electric shocks all over the area being epilated when on my legs, bikini area, and underarms. When I got to my arms, it felt like my skin was being grating on a cheese grater. I&#x27;ve NEVER waxed my legs, bikini area, or underarms before! I&#x27;ve never epilated any part of my body before! I was told thatit hurts less if you have waxed in the past. I watch the youtube horror videos and wanted to purchase some tatoo numb cream before my first epilation, that&#x27;s how terrified I was! I was also upset I&#x27;d forgotten to purchase pain killers... but I didn&#x27;t need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the number of tweezers makes a huge difference as well. The Emjoi Intimate only has 15 pairs of tweezers... compared to 72 tweezers on the popular ones! 72 tweezers at one time on the bikini line area?! I&#x27;m not shocked these people are hollering in pain, I would be too! The Emjoi Intimate has less tweezers because it&#x27;s made for our intimate areas... such as the underarms and bikini line. People complain that there aren&#x27;t enough tweezers on this... but it&#x27;s design appears to be geared towards smaller areas. This means, while you CAN use it on your legs (as I did) it&#x27;s small and compact for the intimate areas of the female body. This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever purchased, I hear the more tweezers it has, the faster you get done with epilating the larger parts of your body, such as your legs and thighs. I was concentrating more on \\&quot;trying to not hurt myself\\&quot; with all the pain which can come with 1st time epilating. It can be seen as the glass half full, instead of more pain for a longer period of time (less tweezers longer process) look at it as way less pain in comparison to largers epilators for a slightly prolonged time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, my body naturally became numb from all the tweezers and I couldn&#x27;t feel much (except on my arms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expense: My Emjoi Intimate was $32, I don&#x27;t think that was bad compared to others out there... and it&#x27;s so cute, so I didn&#x27;t mind paying this for it. You can&#x27;t really find them in the States anymore, I had to get my Emjoi Intimate shipped from South Korea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loudness: It wasn&#x27;t deafening... I honestly can&#x27;t believe some of these youtube videos... I was expecting chainsaw sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety: It comes with a safety button; you can&#x27;t move the large pink on button without pressing down on the little white button. I like that. Also, the little clear plastic cover that goes over the tweezers is lovely, lol, I&#x27;d forgotten I had turned it on before putting in the batteries, and suddenly it came to life!!! But the clear safety cover was on, so no harm done. There is enough space between the safety cover and the tweezers for the tweezers to move around freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portability: It&#x27;s battery operated. This could be a con depending on the situation. I love that it&#x27;s battery operated because I use only rechargeable batteries. For anyone that doesn&#x27;t use rechargeable batteries... this could get expensive over time. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this little one to anyone that doesn&#x27;t plan on purchasing rechargeable batteries for it. I had it on for probably an hour before even epilating because I was so afraid to touch my skin with it. If you expect that as a newbie you may do the same thing, think about the battery life and if it&#x27;s worth taking a chance on. My epilator is still going strong after being on for 3 hours straight... when I said it was my first time and I was nervous, I was telling the truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: I knicked myself in the bikini line area and it still kinda hurts :( it was my fault though. I was so amazed that I wasn&#x27;t in pain, I got a bit careless. My right underarm feels tender a bit too, but I&#x27;m not dying or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say much more as, it&#x27;s a long review... but I can not stress enough to get an epilator that is cute to you. You can be more forgiving of its pain when its adorable. My 1st time experience may have been less friendly if I had been overwhelmed by the mere sight of it alone.</li>
    <li> I had been using my sister&#x27;s Emjoi AP-96 for about a year and ABSOLUTELY loved it.   My husband gets transferred a lot for work and we moved to the UK for awhile...which meant I had to buy my own. Since I am living abroad, and we move around a lot I thought it would be best to get a battery operated model so I could use it all over the world without having to worry about conversions. I was somewhat disappointed because this does not measure up to the AP-96.   Firstly, its a lot louder, even though its smaller. And, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the finer hairs. I usually have to go back and use tweezers after each session. For a quick job or on-the-go it is a good product, though. If you don&#x27;t need a travel version, and have somewhere to plug it in and always use it, buy the AP 96. Its worth the extra $18-$20.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and got this for use on my ears, which, as I&#x27;ve gotten older my ears have decided to become ear-muffs!! I used to use tweezers but that has gotten tedious plus the hair can be difficult to see depending on the lighting and the hair has to get relatively long to see and grab. I was a bit worried that this would grab the skin too so I tried going across the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; and it didn&#x27;t work.  So I manned up and it scared the pooh out of me because I thought it was taking chunks out of my ears!  But, nope, it was just plucking the hair.  I&#x27;ve just never had them basically plucked in very rapid succession!!!  It has never grabbed my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this now for over 4 years and am very pleased with it.  I&#x27;d prefer a different color, but it stays in the bathroom drawer until I need it. If it ever stops working I&#x27;ll definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> This product is really good, the only problem is the battery run low too fast.  Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have used many epilators, starting with the first EpiLady that came out many years ago to today.  And most of them are OK for legs and such, but for intimate use... not so good.  They are too big, hard to manipulate and they PINCH a lot, they actually hurt you over and over.... This one is very gentle, easy to use and it works!!! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> You can still buy these brand new from eBay. I bought mine because my Philips satinelle was not going to cut it on my downstairs, as great as it is. I use this pretty much every day, and it&#x27;s helped keep my Brazilian looking flawless. If I could give a tip, it would be to go get a Brazilian, and then to use this as the hairs start to grow back. Practically painless, can be used for the full area, and no more waxing after the initial one!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because shaving did not work for all my hair removal needs and was quite painful in some instances, especially when the hair grew back. Using Nair and the like, wasn&#x27;t much different, except for the lovely smell as a bonus. So, I gave this a chance.    I had never epilated before, and much to my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t too bad. Yes, you can feel the hair pulling out, no, I was not writhing around in pain. I had waxed a few weeks beforehand (strongly recommend doing that or using some other kind of hair removal to thin it out) that made it go faster and with little pain. I have gone a few weeks without using it, and although the process took a little longer and was a little uncomfortable, it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I had to stop.     I do have a problem with ingrown hairs, but mostly where the elastic from my undies is tightest on my skin, of course, I am extremely prone to ingrowns - I swear I get them just by looking wrong at my hair. Exfoliating, helps a lot.    Overall,  I am really happy with this epilator, and the battery life is really great too. I haven&#x27;t had to change them yet, and I&#x27;ve had it for almost six months. Yes, it makes noise, but HELLO! it&#x27;s a machine. I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about four months ago and it does a great job but I have not been able to tweeze my underarms and bikini line its very hard to think of because each time I try, the pain is beyond words, so i have left those that way and kept shaving. I dont know how people do it. I guess my hair is too thick and deeply rooted. I probably should try electrolysis first or somthing. But overall, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> It is a nice size, easily traveled with. You have to go over spots numerous times, although, it was to be expected. I&#x27;ve found that moving the epilator in a circular motion gets the hair off faster. That way the \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; find the hair from all angles if that makes sense. I have a decent tolerance for pain and it was endurable. Just like a pinch. Worth the money I think.</li>
    <li> It is just an ok epilator, not too good. I had to spent several minutes on each small area trying to remove hair and that is with years of epilating experience that I have. Even though there is no cord (which is a plus) I would not buy it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Emjoi AP-97B Intimate Epilator after it was highly recommended by a friend. She said that it had been 5 years since she last shaved/waxed her armpits. In my eyes that was a dream come true. It&#x27;s been 1 month since I purchased my Emjoi and I LOVE IT!! I personally do not feel any pain when using the product but this may be because I previous waxed my armpits so the hair is not thick. This is a great starter unit and now that I know that I like the product I intend on upgrading to a corded unit.  This smaller unit will be great for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have dark/coarse hair and I absolutely hate shaving every day.  I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before and I have to say it&#x27;s fantastic.  I have read a little bit about it being painful but my thoughts are: you&#x27;re basically tweezing ever hair on your legs at once.  Yeah, you&#x27;re gonna feel a little pinchy sensation.    It does take awhile the first time around to get rid of all/most of the hair but after that, the maintenance is easy and fast.  It really has been fantastic and I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it! (written by Rob&#x27;s wife, not Rob :D)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product bc I read that it was a good starter epilator, which was true. Although I wish it had more power and more options (speed, different heads) I do not regret purchasing this. I recommend for beginners.</li>
    <li> Sides of product are too high to get in small spaces etc: under eyebrow area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my facial hair for over 40 years.  In 7th grade the boys began teasing me about the fuzz over my upper lip.  Depilatories like Nair, etc. are too harsh and burn my skin causing soreness and redness and leaving my face dry and rough.  After waxing, the hair follicles would turn into little pustules and pimples and the hair removal was patchy at best.  Shaving seemed the only answer.  As I got older and into middle age, hair showed up on my chin and my neck.  I hated the stubble.  I bought the Emjoi Intimate and received it about 3 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, IT DOES HURT - AT FIRST.  You are pulling out the hairs.  To get an idea how it will feel, use tweezers and pull out 6-12 hairs in the most sensitive area you would like to use it on.  Then imagine that all 6-12 hairs were pulled out at once or in very quick succession.  Ouch!  Also, I did develop some little pimples and redness after the first use.  HOWEVER, with continued use, I now feel very little discomfort.  I&#x27;ve used it almost every day so that I get any regrown hairs right away before they are really noticeable.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how smooth and hair-free my face is now.  The small size and shape are ideal for removing hair on the face.  The two AA batteries don&#x27;t last a long time, but I&#x27;m happy with the results.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting one of the larger corded Emjoi&#x27;s for my legs.  Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine using an epilator to remove hair under my arms or in the bikini area - I&#x27;m just too sensitive in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend thoroughly washing the skin first and using an astringent and applying a warm washcloth, especially in the beginning, before using the Emjoi Intimate.</li>
    <li> Make sure your hair isn&#x27;t too long, just like the instructions say. I used it on my underarms &amp; my skin looks beautiful ~ no more stubble! Expect pain because, regardless of the type of epilator, you will feel pain since the hair is being removed from the root.  I think it&#x27;s a handy product &amp; I&#x27;m planning to use it on my legs &amp; bikini line as well.</li>
    <li> If you like pain this product is for you. I personally can&#x27;t get used to it. It feels like your being shocked over and over and over. Not worth the time or money shaving is much easier.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for this but I travel a lot and one day there was in the daily specials and I thought it would be good to have one in my next trip. I use it very often, is easy to manage, really works, no pain and it&#x27;s so small you can carry it anywhere. I love this epilator!!  A very satisfied woman.</li>
    <li> Nice product, the delivery was fast. My wife did like the product a lot. Only down part is that the device is quite noisy but other than that the product is pretty neat.</li>
    <li> Small enough to travel with, easy to use, 2 AA battery last long enough to use several times before reemplacing them. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator and so i was a little apprehensive but it was better than wat i expeted. It runs on batteries so i can carry it easily, and it get all the hair very well, only the tiny ones r left and it is also not very painful which i was most afraid of....  The best thing is it is so affordable...</li>
    <li> This review was written from my gf&#x27;s point of view: The only bad thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t honestly have enough tweezers on it to work wonders, which was my fault for not buying one that had more. It hurt to use it on my bikini area and underarms the first two times or so and just din&#x27;t seem to be pulling any hairs out. Although I could clearly see that it had pulled some out, but not too many. Problem was me. I have very coarse hair that grows in what looks to be like two to three hairs per follicle. Lol. I tried it a couple of more times (which also hurt), and bore the pain to recieve great results. Now the pain is down to a bare minimum when I use it. It was stated to possibly wax before epilating for the first time. Hahaha. I bought a Sally Hansen strip kit that did nothing at all. I followed those directions perfectly. If you can bear the pain and small dots of bleeding for the first few times, you can do it ! I belive in you tough women out there ! : P</li>
