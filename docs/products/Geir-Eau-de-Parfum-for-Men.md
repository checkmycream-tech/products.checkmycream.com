      <li>Of course, he was wearing the cologne and when I asked him what it is was he told me it was his own brand.</li>
      <li>well but does smell nice if someone gets up close to you.</li>

      <li>Now that I own both, I rather disagree.</li>

      <li>However, when i took it out I noticed that the cologne was not plastic wrapped or sealed, like most colognes.</li>
      <li>This is mostly a skin scent.</li>
      <li>We fell in love with the scents of Geir Ness when we went in the gift shop of the Norway area.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Discovered this at Disney, luckily a quite searched yielded roughly 50% cheaper on Amazon than at Disney.  Wife loves it greatly and it has such a unique smell not gotten with store brands and last nearly all day compared to store brands.</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne for years. Glad it&#x27;s still available!</li>
    <li> I love this scent on my husband, it is very fresh and clean.  Nordstrom carried it for awhile then stopped, so happy amazon has it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this.  This spritzer thing (can&#x27;t think of what it&#x27;s called) often breaks, which is annoying.  We keep buying them though because it smells so good.</li>
    <li> We love all the Geir products - my husband smells so good with this.</li>
    <li> A wonderful scent without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Received promptly. Smells great - reminds me of Walt Disney World!</li>
    <li> This smells like flowers. The best I can describe it is walking into a flower shop. This is not a scent for men.</li>
    <li> Arrived beautifully packed and protected, lightning-fast. Geir for Men is absolutely the most delightful scent -- it&#x27;s the only one I buy for my husband!!</li>
    <li> Been wearing this cologne since meeting Geir Ness in Miami many years ago. Of course, he was wearing the cologne and when I asked him what it is was he told me it was his own brand. He then related the story of how/why he created it and I have been wearing it ever since. I too have been complimented on this scent for years, and I too have been asked to &#x27;waft&#x27; thru the office. I did buy it through Nordstrom but It was usually out of stock. I have not experienced any disappointment with the Amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> Clean, citrus and open scent that every woman loves.  Think Allure Pour Homme but more balanced. A compliment getter. Awesome and will keep a bottle in my cologne arsenal.  Very close/similar to Allure.  A tough call between the two.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband for Christmas. Have the women&#x27;s version from the Norway store in Epcot. This smells Fabulous!!! My husband always gets complimented! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I first bought this in Florida in disneys Epcot ctr. My wife loves it. We were thrilled to find it again!!</li>
    <li> unique different awesome special for men.  I found it in epcot years ago and bought it online years later.  yes.</li>
    <li> The scent is okay. It&#x27;s not very strong. The sprayer isn&#x27;t great. What I do like is that this fragrance is easy on the skin and won&#x27;t cause breakouts of the occasional rash like some other fragrances sometimes do if you have sensitive skin. This is mostly a skin scent. It doesn&#x27;t project that well but does smell nice if someone gets up close to you.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  Recipient loves it.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for men.</li>
    <li> The Best - found this at EPCOT (better priced here)</li>
    <li> This doesnot smell like a men fragnance, If you like mature fragnance don&#x27;t buy this. This should have been categorized as women perfume. Too flowery :(</li>
    <li> I really liked this cologne at first I thought it smell a little feminine but thats what got a lot of the girls hugging me, only to smell me</li>
    <li> This cologne is intoxicating and each time my husband wears it rather than his perry Ellis I can tell immediately. I originally came across it from my friends husband and it is just as wonderful on him.</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance!! There is no need to smell 20 colognes at the fragrance counter to find a great cologne. This is unique and hard to find unless you are in Disney World or shopping on Amazon.</li>
    <li> One of the most inexpensive Niche fragrances you can get, and a good starter when it comes to Niches; One of the advantages of this one is that you won&#x27;t smell like many people out there and its a good clean soft fragrance that probably most women will appreciate...not offensive and very peasant</li>
    <li> We first discovered this fragrance in Epcot.  Since that first purchase, my husband has used this fragrance exclusively.  I use the ladies fragrance called \\&quot;Laila,\\&quot; pronounced lie-la.  It&#x27;s another winning fragrance!!</li>
    <li> This a cheap imitation.  I had faith in Amazon LLC would not rip me off but they did.  Not the real deal. Plus they would not let me return in, it&#x27;s classified as a hazardous /f flammable materiel.... I ended up going to Nordstroms and buying it there.  The Nordstroms one is in a different bottle, no labels on it, the Amazon clone has a label and the label is not even centered on the bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again with amazon</li>
    <li> Is a really good fragrance, not as good as I had remembered it being when I tried it 2 years ago, but still nice. Good clean scent and not over powering</li>
    <li> First got this cologne in Walt Disney world and havent used anything else since, it smells wonderful and isnt over powering</li>
    <li> the perfume is great but there spray bottle quit working half way through</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviews mentioning concern of a diluted product. It seems the products purchased online have been less than fragrant (diluted?).  I have purchased directly from Nordstrom and Epcot and have always received positive feedback on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> The cologne seemed watered down.  We found this originally at Epcot, and it was excellent.  We could smell it on my husband&#x27;s jacket for days after he tested it.  This was certainly not the same strength.  We were highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent and I do, too.  It is one of the best gifts I ever got him.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, and he likes it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this cologne in Norway at Epcot in WDW, loved the scent.  Decided to purchase some for my husband for&lt;br /&gt;Christmas...it smells wonderfully sexy!</li>
    <li> We diiscovered this men&#x27;s cologne at Disney World, believe it or not and I fell in love with the scent. Now it is all my husband wears!</li>
    <li> This smells so good. I went to Epcot last year and seriously kept dreaming about this Norwegian scent. Finally went back this year to their Food and Wine Festival, smelled it again to make sure I really wanted it and searched for it on Amazon. Naturally, it is much cheaper on this site. My husband can&#x27;t get enough of this scent on me.</li>
    <li> It is the one Cologne that I receive constant compliments on. Recently bought three bottles. Don&#x27;t want to run out!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing scent!!!  I wonder if this is what the vikings smelled like.  If so, WOW!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The box came without jelatin packed.  Also box and bottle labels are not same as the original one I bought in DisneyWorld Epcot Norway store.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this product. Although smell is quite similar, it might be fake..</li>
    <li> I received  a sample of Geir years ago and loved it.  I finally purchased it.  It has a fresh very light sent that is masculine, yet subtle and not overpowering.  Simply Amazing!</li>
    <li> In years past online reviews have made me to believe that geir and gendarme edps had very similar scents. Now that I own both, I rather disagree. Both are fresh but are also unique in their own rights. I like both. Geir is a clean, green, some say grassy scent. What impresses me about this edp is not the opening but its longevity and its inoffensiveness. As the day goes I catch multiple whiff of the fragrance applied on the neck. Two to three sprays go a long way.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, He loves the one I have for me and now we love the one for him too. Guess we are two great minds thinking alike.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  She can&#x27;t get enough of this cologne.  I also get stopped on the street, in restaurants and at the office  by women wanting to know what I am wearing.  It is the only cologne for which this happens.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic cologne, and I am so glad I purchased it.  One thing I noticed, in comparison with many other colognes I tried before buying, is Geir Ness has a scent that stays very consistent all day.  Some of the others seems to break down over time, heat, activity, and would turn sweet or almost disgusting, but Geir has a really pleasant light scent, not too musky at all, and again last a long time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Receiving many compliments, and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing..not a clone. Great price and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Met all expectations, as described, value priced, fast ship. Light and subtle fragrance, not overpowering, that works well for men</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne I&#x27;ve ever had.  The scent lasts all day and i frequently am complimented on it.</li>
    <li> My son loves this cologne !  Unique</li>
    <li> My brother send me this cologne as a gift. I received it within 2 days. It was packaged very nicely in the amazon box. However, when i took it out I noticed that the cologne was not plastic wrapped or sealed, like most colognes. I do not care about that, however there was a clear gap at the top of the cologne as if it had been used a couple of times. The box itself is a bit worn out. Great Cologne! but I was not happy with what I received.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance with a nice lingering emission that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful  product that I first encountered in the Norway Pavilion at Epcot.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s Fragrance is just as great as I remember it.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite men&#x27;s cologne. It&#x27;s not a real strong smell, but a lot of women have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing. Makes my wife jealous😎</li>
    <li> My husband just loves Geir, he likes the smell and it lasts a long time. He receives so many compliments when he wears Geir.It is the only cologne he will wear.</li>
    <li> Tried this at Disney world a few years ago. Been buying it ever since.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this from the store in Epcot, but this time tried the Amazon order option. The cologne does not smell the same, and was likely expired. In the future, I will buy it in-person again.</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly an imitation product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal Geir customer since 2007 and have purchased a bottle every year since then, like clockwork, directly from Nordstrom.  I&#x27;ve always been satisfied until now.  A few months back I purchased a bottle of Geir on Amazon and I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s not the same product.  My girlfriend is equally convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steer away from these frauds.  Pay the extra couple dollars and buy the real the thing at Nordstrom to insure you won&#x27;t be ripped off.</li>
    <li> I knew about Laila and the wonderful scent that gives from Epcot in Florida, but I didn&#x27;t know that there was a men&#x27;s counterpart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in as a blind purchase on this one and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a woodsy, floral scent, in my opinion, and my wife loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase and every time I put it on, I&#x27;m reminded about Laila and of courses Epcot!</li>
    <li> I smelled the parfum first about 12 years ago while I was working at a restaurant in Durham NC, the designer was there for the oppening of the new Nordstorm store.  I bought it there for a few years but then the store discontinue selling it.&lt;br /&gt;My sister in law Went to norway last year and Its cheaper to get it in the Us than overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent buries into your skin and in case you are wearing a scarf or a sweater the smell  would last for days&lt;br /&gt;Its original and is the best parfum for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve often heard never to buy cologne through amazon. I believe it now. I&#x27;ve purchased this cologne through a department store before and got compliments everytime I wore it. In the case of amazon, I could probably pour the whole bottle over my head and no one would even smell it. Learned my lesson the hard way on this. Don&#x27;t ever buy cologne through amazon.</li>
    <li> Found this cologne quite by accident at the \\&quot;Norway\\&quot; exhibit at EPCOT Center in Disney World (Florida).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I liked the male and female versions of this so much we buy them every time we go back.  They actually complement each other - friends have mentioned this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fresh, like the ocean, without being citrus-y like many oceanic scents wind up being.  I wish there were shaving creams and after shave balms in this scent as it offers a different kind of clean freshness than say, Pinaud Clubman (Geir is more outdoors ocean/salt air/\\&quot;green\\&quot; and \\&quot;blue\\&quot; fresh/clean, whereas Clubman is more indoors/barber shop/\\&quot;amber\\&quot; soap/powder clean).  I realize some of those adjectives may only make sense to some of you, but there they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, get your partner the Laila (if she&#x27;s a woman, or if not you can just share the bottle!).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves and I love it on him.  It is not too strong and seems to last.</li>
    <li> My husband was totally happy he loves this fragrance and wears it often.  Nice clean scent non-allergen.  Love love love!</li>
    <li> first time i ever purchased GEIR  was at EPCOT in Disney,i have liked it ever since&lt;br /&gt;its been about five years</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite and it smells wonderful on him.&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to find it at such a good price.</li>
    <li> I read over the reviews before buying this and it is described exactly how it smells, and it smells amazing! It&#x27;s eau de parfum so a couple sprays is more than enough to last all day.</li>
    <li> I found this sent for the first time in Epoct at Disney.  I could not find it in any stores locally so I found it here.  Smells great and it reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> My dad loves Geir by Geir Ness for men so for Christmas I bought him this cologne. The packing on the outside looked the same as the picture but the bottle on the inside did not look like the one in the picture. The cologne in the bottle had a yellowish look to it and did not smell the same. My dad had his cologne so we compared the two and they weren&#x27;t the same. The seller did let me return which I was happy about, but I did have to pay for the shipping to return it. I was very disappointed that I did not receive what was shown.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s clean not overpowering but lasts all day. I meet geir Ness I couldn&amp;#34;t say enough about this scent to him. the womens fragrance lalia is just as wonderful.</li>
    <li> bought this for my son for xmas...he loves it...  i wear Laila and they sent a sample of the mens....gave it to my son and he perfers it over his giorgio armani ...so that says alot  wonderful parfum...and stays on a long time</li>
    <li> Great product, easy process and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and will always bu it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People love the way this smells on me. Fast order and cheaper than any other store.</li>
    <li> I smelled it for the 1st time when we were at Epcot Center and it took me almost 10 years to get it, as soon as I found out that Amazon was selling it cheaper than the Norway store, I have to have it. The smell its so unique and I along with other readers got so many compliments on how great is the smell.</li>
    <li> I first found out about  Geir at Epcot Center in Florida.I have several colognes and this by far is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of complements when I use it . Most people never heard of this cologne and that me happy lol.</li>
    <li> Just a little of Norway what a great smelling cologne</li>
    <li> A soft masculine smell.  Not an overbearing colone.  Great for day time or night time use.  Very hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband after he fell in love with it on a trip to DisneyWorld. They were selling it in the Norway part of Epcot and he tried a sample and really liked it. Were so happy to find it on Amazon! It&#x27;s become his go-to scent and we both really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Works great, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Found and bought this and the deodorant with a gift travel case for $81.00 in EPCOT at Norway. Love it!  Interesting comments from those who bought it elsewhere. I love both products and will stock up next trip to WDW.</li>
    <li> Great product, I decided to get the cologne when I met the man and got a free sample. It was an instant decision that I had to get it, and my girlfriend loves it</li>
    <li> buy this------ any questions</li>
    <li> My husband and I visited Disney World for the first time together a few years ago. We fell in love with the scents of Geir Ness when we went in the gift shop of the Norway area. I haven&#x27;t seen these scents in stores here in the U.S., so was happy to find them readily available online. This is a woodsy, masculine scent and I love it on my husband. The female counterpart is Leila by Geir-- a scent that is lightly floral and one that my husband loves on me! If you remember liking the scents around Norway in Epcot, you&#x27;ll likely love these scents and don&#x27;t have to fly to Orlando to get them--yay!</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments regarding the scent of Geir!</li>
    <li> Nothing like the Geir I bought at Epcot Center in Disney World!!! This one smelled terrible and, instead of compliments, I was getting complaints. It must have been a fake.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what my hubby wanted. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love being the only one in my town with this cologne. Very, very fresh fragrance</li>
    <li> Great cologne. Every time I wear it I get positive comments!!  I met Geir Ness at Disney World EPCOT and liked his cologne immediately!!</li>
    <li> great buy, so happy I could find it on line for my husband for chirstmas this year. I will always look prior to heading to the store</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful price. I highly recommend this to men looking for something new. You will not be sorry if you order this for a male friend, partner or yourself.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this scent in Disney Epcot, recently I had purchased it as a gift, and it was a hit!!</li>
    <li> Women love the smell of this scent on a man.  Would highly recommend.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Geir by Geir Ness...</li>
    <li> My item arrived smashed I filled out the claim form &amp; faxed it back to beauty encounter they still haven&#x27;t sent a replacement or return label if needed for broken item which I&#x27;ve saved for over 3 weeks now. I&#x27;ve called &amp; left message to find out what else I need to do but still waiting to hear if they&#x27;ve processed my claim form!!! This was a birthday gift for 8.10.12</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband. He had the product and had run out. He gets many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Best Cologne. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy, for the OZ you receive it is a great purchase and love the fragrance !</li>
    <li> The colgne smells amazing and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores. It&#x27;s a great choice.</li>
    <li> Did you ever see the King of Queens episode where Doug gets a nice colonge, and a girl walks bye and says..&amp;#34;Yummy&amp;#34;?...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, expect that when you wear this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big colonge guy, but this stuff is awesome...not strong but just right.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The only cologne my husband wears!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used much cologne in the past. Tried 50 different fragrances. Have received many good comments from males and females</li>
    <li> This is a EDP that can be used for work, going out for a night on the town, or weekending.  It&#x27;s a wonderfully clean scent that is distinctive without being overpowering.  Worth every single penny.</li>
    <li> Unique smell, very easy to be confused with other high end colognes. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is only only cologne I&#x27;ve had women tell me smells good. enough said......</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Geir! This is hands down my favorite cologne. The problem is with the spray button. Shortly after using this product the spray button started to stick and has been consistently sticking ever since. Please fix this Geir Ness because the scent is out of this world. I first discovered this cologne at Disney World Epcot I am happy I bought it, not happy that is so hard to use.</li>
