### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best purchase I ever made for shaving my head.</li>
      <li>It was awesome!  </li>
      <li>be bald and proud!</li>
      <li>Not all that great.</li>
      <li>My results have been great.</li>
      <li>Love it!!  </li>
      <li>This razor looks good on paper and has a futuristic design but doesn&#x27;t work so well in practice.</li>
      <li>The headblade has a relatively good build quality.  </li>
      <li>I find a couple of light passes work best.</li>
      <li>Takes some time getting used too and gets clogged quickly, but one of the closest and best shaves I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>I experienced severe razor burn and also got many nicks and cuts during the two times I used the Headblade and then threw it away.</li>
      <li>Definately check it out and you will fall in love with it.  </li>
      <li>It will give you a better feel for how it works.</li>
      <li>I save about 80% more time shaving with it -- than without it.</li>
      <li>I love thier lotions though.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t disagree more.   </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this razor.  </li>
      <li>Sure, I&#x27;ve nicked myself once or twice in the two years I&#x27;ve been using it, but</li>
      <li>But for now i am ditching this, a mach 3 works better for now.</li>
      <li>I use a Mach 3, but found the Fusion better.</li>
      <li>The blades are wonderfully flexible and the long handle gives one plenty of control.</li>
      <li>also, the headblade uses a nice inexpensive blade, the atra, which can be had generically for about $4 for 10, which is nice because head shaving really chews up those blades.  </li>
      <li>The fact that the Headblade uses Atra blades (which werte popular during the mid-1980s but which are undoubtedly inferior to advanced shaving systems like the Gillette Fusion or Schick Quattro) should serve as a warning that you won&#x27;t get a smooth or comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend also purchasing a bottle of headslick to keep your head in good condition.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Therefore, using the HEADBLADE \\&quot;upset\\&quot; the smooth flow and what I COULD feel was SCRAPING, as opposed to SHAVING.</li>
      <li>and I get a smooth shave..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about 5 years now, (with a Gillette Fusion razor), and I&#x27;ve gotten quite comfortable at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The blade should lightly touch your head while shaving.</li>
      <li>while it does take some getting used to, the headblade is really quite amazing....</li>
      <li>Does a good job on top of the head, but not on sides or back.</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth, clean and comfortable shave</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for the past five years, and the Xtreme-3 is the best product to date.</li>
      <li>what the heck... maybe the unique design would make up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>then I truly recommend the Gillette Fusion as it gives me an ultra-smooth and clean shave every time.</li>
      <li>Because I absolutely love it that much.</li>
      <li>If they put a little more thought in improving the nicks and cuts it might be good, hey that&#x27;s why they had barbers through the ages.</li>
      <li>Initially it looked like a good solution, after a couple of nicks, i thought i am not doing it right.</li>
      <li>I am new to headshaving, but I use the HeadBlade Sport and love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using my regular razor, instead, which makes me nervous, but it gets the job done more easily.  </li>
      <li>The headblade saves me an amazing amount of time shaving my head over using a regular razor.  </li>
      <li>For example, if you use regular shaving gel or cream, prepare for the blade to get stuck and cut you nicely.</li>
      <li>The Headblade is an interesting-looking product but it just does not work (even remotely) as well as more advanced 4 or 5-blade razors.</li>
      <li>My FIRST shave with</li>
      <li>br /&gt;After the first time I was sold..</li>
      <li>Headblade nicked more in one shaving than I have in dozens of times using a traditional two or three bladed razor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a mostly bald guy, with some hair on the back of my head.  </li>
      <li>first thought was that by going with an Atra cartridge, I was taking about 12 steps backward in blade technology, but</li>
      <li>I had my doubts the first time I got it</li>
      <li>All of a sudden, I took a section of my scalp off the top of my head about the size of a quarter.  </li>
      <li>After a few nicks and cuts every now and then due to not handling it right, I can now flawlessly shave my head every morning in under a minute with no nicks.</li>
      <li>recommend this to all my friends who shave their head, and I honestly can&#x27;t imagine doing it any other way.</li>
      <li>I just read a lot of positive reviews of the headblade and figured if it could speed up my shaving</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s so much easier</li>
      <li>Thanks Guys.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well around the ears</li>
      <li>THE ABSOLUTE SMOOTHEST SHAVE</li>
      <li>is absolutely AWESOME, and as much as I&#x27;ve touted the use of Aveeno shave gel for the past few years, I think I&#x27;ve found a replacement.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The novelty of this razor quickly diminished after multiple nicks.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend the HeadBlade.  </li>
      <li>After a few shaves, you can easily shave your entire head and it will be smooth as butter baby.  </li>
      <li>WOW!!  </li>
      <li>After about 2 days (if you don&#x27;t get it right off the bat) of getting used to it, the headblade is like second nature to use.  </li>
      <li>with the HB I use a new blade almost every time.  </li>
      <li>I couldnt live without my HeadBlade.</li>
      <li>And I went to the store and bought new blades...</li>
      <li>This sytem does not do a great job either cutting with or against the hair growth pattern.  </li>
      <li>I am surprised by the reviews.  </li>
      <li>Yes, there&#x27;s the cool factor, but not at the expense of pieces of scalp washing down the drain.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give it the benefit of the doubt, and state that this could very well be due to the fact that my five years of head-shaving has given me \\&quot;muscle memory\\&quot; in that I&#x27;ve grown quite accustomed to moving my hands in a certain manner and speed while shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and although a bit awkward I was able to give myself a fairly clean shave.</li>
      <li>Dulls quickly and the pushing motion required to use the headblade is totally unnatural.  </li>
      <li>Third time cut myself (new blades every time).  </li>
      <li>and then I doubt you would ever go back to the old way of shaving your head.</li>
      <li>I never expected to shave my head until I started chemotherapy.</li>
      <li>This is the first blade that I have cut myself with in the past two decades, and I&#x27;m not talking just a nick but a major peel the skin off cut!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it I had a few nicks and cuts</li>
      <li>\\&quot;car\\&quot; feels a little unbalances, so as  I rolled over to the back of my head the wheels lifted off my head carving a HUGE painful divot into the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> My dome is pretty tough and in ten years I&#x27;ve never cut myself shaving my head with a safety razor.  </li>
<li> As a long time head shaver I&#x27;ve become accustomed to shaving my dome bi-weekly.  </li>
<li> I have had a couple of small nicks, but nothing major.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
<li> but was still curious.  </li>
<li> Okay tried with patience, but didnt stay that way, the worse is behind the ears, no matter how i am careful i ended up with nicks and cuts there.</li>
<li> After a few days, it&#x27;ll be second</li>
<li> I have to agree with the other negative reviews-this razor is tough to maneuver around the ears and really chewed up the back of my head.  </li>
<li> So in summation, yes I became careless and it caused an accident, but the potential is there for many people to become careless.  </li>
<li> The small hook to place your finger in just didn&#x27;t provide enough control over the device.</li>
<li> I would also agree that even the inexpensive three blade disposable razors do an equal, if not better, job than the headblade.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why others have had problems with this device, I use it on a daily basis, and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
<li> Use the HeadBlade Shave lotion and you can effortlessly get that baby smooth shave without any ugly nicks.</li>
<li> I read the precautions about not pressing down on the razor and was prepared.  </li>
<li> Down the side of my head and neck.  </li>
<li> Other than that, no problem at all!  </li>
<li> One small nick, due to my fault slipping.  </li>
<li> The headblade worked well on HALF of my head.</li>
<li> you&#x27;ll want to take it slow at first, but once you get the feel for it, using a conventional razor will feel totally awkward.</li>
<li> While going over a few spots that I had missed it all went downhill from there.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Since I got mine, I have have converted a few of my friends to the HeadBlade system</li>
<li> I began slowly</li>
<li> If you have bad habits from shaving with a standard handle you will have to re-learn</li>

    <li> The headblade worked well on HALF of my head. I have to admit that this was one of the smoothest and closest shaves that I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I needed to transition to the back of my head... well, that&#x27;s where the problems began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;car\\&quot; feels a little unbalances, so as  I rolled over to the back of my head the wheels lifted off my head carving a HUGE painful divot into the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened not once, but twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good concept... just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> The headblade saves me an amazing amount of time shaving my head over using a regular razor.  Also, it&#x27;s so much easier and I can get every part of my head with relative ease.   The headblade has a relatively good build quality.  After about 2 days (if you don&#x27;t get it right off the bat) of getting used to it, the headblade is like second nature to use.  I highly reccomend also purchasing a bottle of headslick to keep your head in good condition.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor.  I had my doubts the first time I got it but was still curious.  The first time I used it I had a few nicks and cuts but this is from not using it properly.  After a few shaves, you can easily shave your entire head and it will be smooth as butter baby.  Definately check it out and you will fall in love with it.  Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;REVISION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second review on this item. Why? Because I absolutely love it that much. It has been 9 months since I have had the HeadBlade. After a few nicks and cuts every now and then due to not handling it right, I can now flawlessly shave my head every morning in under a minute with no nicks. It took a lot of trial and error. For example, if you use regular shaving gel or cream, prepare for the blade to get stuck and cut you nicely. Use the HeadBlade Shave lotion and you can effortlessly get that baby smooth shave without any ugly nicks. I couldnt live without my HeadBlade. Thanks Guys.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other negative reviews-this razor is tough to maneuver around the ears and really chewed up the back of my head.  I would also agree that even the inexpensive three blade disposable razors do an equal, if not better, job than the headblade.  Headblade nicked more in one shaving than I have in dozens of times using a traditional two or three bladed razor.  The novelty of this razor quickly diminished after multiple nicks.  Yes, there&#x27;s the cool factor, but not at the expense of pieces of scalp washing down the drain.  I did like the mentholated shaving cream, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about 5 years now, (with a Gillette Fusion razor), and I&#x27;ve gotten quite comfortable at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought me the HEADBLADE for xmas, and I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought was that by going with an Atra cartridge, I was taking about 12 steps backward in blade technology, but what the heck... maybe the unique design would make up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second thought came after I looped the thing around my finger and started to shave. It felt like I was shaving with my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m going to give it the benefit of the doubt, and state that this could very well be due to the fact that my five years of head-shaving has given me \\&quot;muscle memory\\&quot; in that I&#x27;ve grown quite accustomed to moving my hands in a certain manner and speed while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, using the HEADBLADE \\&quot;upset\\&quot; the smooth flow and what I COULD feel was SCRAPING, as opposed to SHAVING. (I quit before I carved through to my skull!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this however: the HEADBLADE HEADSLICK SHAVE CREAM is absolutely AWESOME, and as much as I&#x27;ve touted the use of Aveeno shave gel for the past few years, I think I&#x27;ve found a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Jonathan Sabin</li>
    <li> WOW!!  &lt;br /&gt;After the first time I was sold.. &lt;br /&gt;Since I got mine, I have have converted a few of my friends to the HeadBlade system</li>
    <li> Initially it looked like a good solution, after a couple of nicks, i thought i am not doing it right.

But for now i am ditching this, a mach 3 works better for now.</li>
    <li> I bought this Headblade razor and used it only twice. The fact that the Headblade uses Atra blades (which werte popular during the mid-1980s but which are undoubtedly inferior to advanced shaving systems like the Gillette Fusion or Schick Quattro) should serve as a warning that you won&#x27;t get a smooth or comfortable shave. I experienced severe razor burn and also got many nicks and cuts during the two times I used the Headblade and then threw it away. If you want a smooth, clean and comfortable shave then I truly recommend the Gillette Fusion as it gives me an ultra-smooth and clean shave every time. The Headblade is an interesting-looking product but it just does not work (even remotely) as well as more advanced 4 or 5-blade razors.</li>
    <li> I never expected to shave my head until I started chemotherapy. Rather than be Mr. Patchyhead, I opted to shave my head. I use this unit along with their shaving lotion. My results have been great. I have had a couple of small nicks, but nothing major.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You must use a specfic technique with this razor. The weight should be on the back of the razor, not the front. The blade should lightly touch your head while shaving. I find a couple of light passes work best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mostly bald guy, with some hair on the back of my head.  This sytem does not do a great job either cutting with or against the hair growth pattern.  I&#x27;m using my regular razor, instead, which makes me nervous, but it gets the job done more easily.  And I went to the store and bought new blades...arrrrrrgh!</li>
    <li> while it does take some getting used to, the headblade is really quite amazing.... you&#x27;ll want to take it slow at first, but once you get the feel for it, using a conventional razor will feel totally awkward. also, the headblade uses a nice inexpensive blade, the atra, which can be had generically for about $4 for 10, which is nice because head shaving really chews up those blades.  with the HB I use a new blade almost every time.  Love it!!  and the headslick and headlube are a delight! be bald and proud!</li>
    <li> As a long time head shaver I&#x27;ve become accustomed to shaving my dome bi-weekly.  I routinely use a Mach-3 for my head and a Fusion for my beard.  My dome is pretty tough and in ten years I&#x27;ve never cut myself shaving my head with a safety razor.  I wasn&#x27;t dissatisfied with the Mach3.  I just read a lot of positive reviews of the headblade and figured if it could speed up my shaving I was all for it.  I bought a tube of the headblade headslick shaving gell and got to work.  I read the precautions about not pressing down on the razor and was prepared.  I began slowly and although a bit awkward I was able to give myself a fairly clean shave. I didn&#x27;t think it was ultra-close like I&#x27;m used to with my Mach3.  But it wasn&#x27;t bad.  I can shave at warp speed with the mach3 with no risk of cuts and so I was lulled into a false sense of security with the headblade.  While going over a few spots that I had missed it all went downhill from there.  All of a sudden, I took a section of my scalp off the top of my head about the size of a quarter.  Blood flowing everyhwere.  Down the side of my head and neck.  I must have hit some type of blood vessel.  It soiled band-aids for 3 days.  It&#x27;s finally beginning to heal.  So in summation, yes I became careless and it caused an accident, but the potential is there for many people to become careless.  Use this product with caution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others have had problems with this device, I use it on a daily basis, and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  Sure, I&#x27;ve nicked myself once or twice in the two years I&#x27;ve been using it, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  After a few days, it&#x27;ll be second nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all my friends who shave their head, and I honestly can&#x27;t imagine doing it any other way.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by the reviews.  I have used this thing three times and I still hate it.  Third time cut myself (new blades every time).  Each time, I had to use a regular razor to go back over things.  Doesn&#x27;t work very well around the ears, doesn&#x27;t give a close shave (may be the gilette blades).  Does a good job on top of the head, but not on sides or back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Going back to my standard 3-bladed disposable. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head on and off for about 6 years now, and the reason I stopped shaving so often was because the shave wasn&#x27;t close enough.  If I had the choice I would never want my hair to grow back on my head again.  Then I found the HeadBlade online and decided to give it a shot.  My FIRST shave with I pulled with the hair, and I though \\&quot;Ehh...\\&quot;  BUT then I remembered in the manual it said some guys like to shave against and some with.  So I shaved against, and then at that moment I was won over.  THE ABSOLUTE SMOOTHEST SHAVE I HAVE EVER HAD.  I HIGHLY recommend the HeadBlade.  Takes some time getting used too and gets clogged quickly, but one of the closest and best shaves I have ever had.  GET IT!</li>
    <li> I just got mine yesterday along with the glossy lotion.  It was awesome!  One small nick, due to my fault slipping.  Other than that, no problem at all!  Truly Ace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip:  Practice using the headblade with the blade cover still on before shaving with it.  It will give you a better feel for how it works.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband as a x-mas gift along with the blades. He did not like them. It cut the heck out of his head.</li>
    <li> This is the first blade that I have cut myself with in the past two decades, and I&#x27;m not talking just a nick but a major peel the skin off cut!  Dulls quickly and the pushing motion required to use the headblade is totally unnatural.  Mine is now in the trash.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> Best purchase I ever made for shaving my head. I save about 80% more time shaving with it -- than without it. I have been using it for about 2 months now and I have only cut myself once.  This is a must have if you want to minimize your Dome-woes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This razor looks good on paper and has a futuristic design but doesn&#x27;t work so well in practice. The thing to remember is that if you don&#x27;t have a flexible blade which shapes itself to your scalp, nicks and cuts will inevitably follow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unlike others who&#x27;ve reviewed this product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The small hook to place your finger in just didn&#x27;t provide enough control over the device. The Atra razors were below par as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: get yourself a package of Schick Xtreme-3 disposable razors. The blades are wonderfully flexible and the long handle gives one plenty of control. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for the past five years, and the Xtreme-3 is the best product to date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a few of the posts saying that the HeadBlade is a bad product and I can&#x27;t disagree more.   I am new to headshaving, but I use the HeadBlade Sport and love it.  I use Gillette Sensor blades and I get a smooth shave.. You must pay strict attention to the proper method of using this product, go to their website and watch the video, it helps.   If you have bad habits from shaving with a standard handle you will have to re-learn and then I doubt you would ever go back to the old way of shaving your head.</li>
    <li> Not all that great. I use a Mach 3, but found the Fusion better. I love thier lotions though.</li>
