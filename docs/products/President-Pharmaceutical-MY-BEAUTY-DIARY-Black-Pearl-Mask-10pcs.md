<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried various products from my beauty diary series this this one so far is the best. It does help when I use it, although its effect doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for 1 year. It makes my skin fine and smooth. I will keep buying this mask.</li>
    <li> It smells great.  I leave the mask on for about an hour instead of 20-30 minutes.  I see the difference on my face after a few uses.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not the best, not the worst facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been seriously slacking on my skin-care regimen since my baby was born a few months ago.  Decided to use the mask to pamper myself last night and the difference in my skin was INSTANTLY noticeable!  I was brighter, lighter, and much more hydrated.  My skin seemed to have a glow back!  I love that the MyDiary masks are portable too since I usually take one with me when traveling.  Will definitely order more of these Black Pearl masks since I saw such a visible difference!  A great little mommy-treat!</li>
    <li> I am Puerto Rican and unlike other latinos I like to protect my skin from the sun as much as possible. And I love the Korean \\&quot;snow white\\&quot; skin. This product gives my skin a slight whitening and also leaves my skin looking dewy and feeling extremely soft. I use it at night before an event or three times a week. I rub the excess liquid on my neck, hands and boobage area. (any area that tends to wrinkle faster) I am 27 years old and I know its the perfect time for me to start preventing the wrinkles. Love love love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for me I love My Beauty Diary Black Pearl Mark ^^ Everything ok ^^ I think i will buy again.</li>
    <li> the masks feel great on my skin and make my skin feel rejuvenated and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, sensitive skin, and these masks do not cause any sort of issues for me.</li>
    <li> This mask hurt my eyes! I can&#x27;t even open my eyes when using this mask. It feels very heavy.  The real mask should be very light and confortable. This one is a fake!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even express how wonderful this product is. I heard about it through a beauty video on YouTube and expected it to be a nice, refreshing mask that would make my skin feel good, but I never expected it to be so AMAZING. This product leaves my face looking fresh, plump, full of life, healthy and hydrated. I use it twice a week before I go to bed (after cleansing and toning) and when I wake up, my face looks so fantastic. I will be investing in plenty of these masks and spreading the word to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Taiwan and it was one of the best masks I have used. Plus it is very cheap.. about $8 for 10 pieces. It leaves your skin extremely smooth texture. I regret that I only bought two boxes.</li>
    <li> i keep these on for about an hr. i usually take a nap in them, i do feel it helps a little, but only temporary, right after the treatment. it does make my skin feel silky smooth. does clog a few pores</li>
    <li> I bought this product under the impression that it would work.... only if even for the next day. I was attending a friend&#x27;s wedding and came across this product. After reading how people loved this product and really recommend it, I was stoked to try it the day before the wedding. Boy was I in for a disappointment. The only thing nice about this product is being able to lay down with this gooey piece of cold plastic on my face just to escape my hectic motherhood life for 1 hour. When it was time to remove this, I was bummed. Nothing on my facial or neck skin felt or looked any better. I don&#x27;t use expensive facial cleansers or moisturizers so it&#x27;s not like I had great skin to begin with other wise I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten this. I am Asian and this is an Asian product right? I doubt using the remaining 9 pieces continuously every week will do anything since the first one did nothing. I am giving it away to a coworker who said she&#x27;d be willing to give it a try, but at least she won&#x27;t have any expectations as I have already explained my experience. Maybe people should be allowed to buy a trial mask to see if it really works, because it has good rating from a lot of people. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> &#x3D;v&#x3D;..I like it. But why it&#x27;s too white for me ...It  looks like chlorinated lime ,i don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s just for me or all...........</li>
    <li> These are my first MBD masks. I found them really hydrating. I have sensitive skin and I had no problem with them. They have so much serum in them that you can use whats left on the pouch for your neck and decolletage area. I would buy them again!</li>
    <li> All of the Beauty Diary facial mask are made in Taiwan. Black pearl is my favorite among their product line. After 30 minutes application, I find my skin brighter, moisturized,and pores minimized.</li>
    <li> Rather than leaving the face mask on for 20-30 as it is recommended, i left it on all night. It slightly had a tingly feeling, but it was nothing to worry about because like the title says, my beauty diary black pearl masks will whiten and soften your skin. Upon waking up, my skin also felt more firm and tight. Just in case anyone is wondering, this is my review after only using one black pearl face mask. I will continue to use them every other day and have no doubt that it will help improve my skin tone.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive. Lots of beaty products burned my face but I have no problem with this one. After using it, my skin looks brighter and feels really soft. I strongly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It is OK. But not as magic as other people have said. Maybe I should not expect too much. Another thing I do not like very much is, it takes about 40 minutes, that&#x27;s really too much for me.</li>
    <li> I found out this Black Pearl facial mask from Chinese supermarket since 2 years ago.  I am glad to find out I can order this product from Amazon.  It is great product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using many brands of whitening mask but i found this brand of Black Pearl to be the best of all i ever use. It gave me bright, soft and fresh look. I will use probably use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchased whole bunch of face mask couple weeks ago. Only 13.95 dollars with free shipping, sounds good.  I visited Japan for two weeks and my cousin was right. In Asian, where these kind of face mask is well known, they don&#x27;t even have any face mask that cost under 4 dollars each. I asked my Japanese friends about my cheap, appproximately a dollar face mask, they told me those are useless or never to use it because it&#x27;s actually bad for your skin. ahhhrrrrr!!!  I thought this mask was made in Japan. They made it look like a Japanese product. But I found out this is NOT A JAPANESE PRODUCT!!! It&#x27;s made in Singapore or Taiwan. I forget which one.. but it&#x27;s not made in Japan.  They kind of fooled customer by writing whole bunch of Japanese instruction.     Didn&#x27;t moisture my skin. Didn&#x27;t do much. Smells really cheap too.     I bought other face masks from Korea that my friend recommended which cost me at least 4 dollars to even 20 dollars each and noticed big big difference between those masks i bought from Korea vs. My Beauty Diary Facial Mask.</li>
    <li> I was so excited after reading all of the positive reviews. I purchased Black Pearl, Aloe Vera, and natto. All three gave me the exact same result: Breakouts. When i used it,my face broke out into bumps and in the morning I had acne. I tried changing other aspects but the masks kept causing the same results. Now I have three boxes of masks that  I cant use. Then I read a review that said these masks contain an ingredient that is used in paint thinner. Hopefully the mask will work for you if you decide to purchase it, but it didnt for me. :/</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so amazing that this item is available at amazon.com.  I like using this facial mask,it makes your skin relaxed and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I was a little curious at first whether or not this product would live up to all the reviews, however after I received this, I have to say that it really works! I left it on 45-60 minutes, although it says around 30 minutes on the box, and my skin looked amazing. My skin looked brighter and felt amazingly soft. The effects are not permanent, but it was a nice treat for my skin after all the stress. Never have I seen my skin so bright and nice. Will definitely purchase another box again in the near future!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this item because I hated my freckles, but now that I look at it I love my freckles so I don&#x27;t catch myself using this product as much as I would have liked haha.. Not sure if it works or not.</li>
    <li> I ordered this the MBD Black Pearl mask a few weeks ago. It was my first time using a sheet mask so I was super excited to try one on. After doing my second mask the other day, I have to say that they work great! I leave them on until the majority of the mask is dry, no need to wash my face afterwards! My skin feels tight, my pores look smaller and my skin is really moisturized. With the leftover essence in the bag, I usually put it on my face before going to bed or just leave it for the next morning to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I find with the mask is that it&#x27;s big on my face. My face is small, but if I adjust it to fit it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was alright, I got it within a week, but some people receive them within a few days. My box was kind of beat up when I got the package, the box it shipped in seemed alright though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an awesome mask and an awesome beauty line! I plan on trying the Natto mask next!</li>
    <li> This  product is sold by juaz is fake. OMG, I am so upset that my money and effort was waste. Ladies please be aware, I love this product and cant believe I wast my precious $$$</li>
    <li> I bought this and Pearl Powder masks made by My Beauty Diary. I&#x27;ve been purchasing various facial masks on Amazon. I am still disappointed by the fact that I am unable to find a mid-price / descent quality facial mask. I am investing 30+ mins of my life per mask and around 1-2 hours per week (3-4 masks) per week, so I want to find the best bang for the buck. This brand was similar to others I reviewed, which is pretty CHEAP QUALITY...    One big positive is the scent of the essence. The smell was good and did not have that alcohol smell like in \\&quot;KOSE\\&quot; facial mask I would absolutely refrain from.    This mask comes in an incredibly pretty box. Quite deceiving because \\&quot;Black Pearl\\&quot; and \\&quot;Pearl Powder\\&quot; are all marketing languages that really don&#x27;t mean much. When I got the package, it was a smaller box than I expected, but more importantly contained MUCH THINNER masks than I expected and MUCH MUCH LESS essence than I usually want. I think the mask was ready to be removed after about 15 mins or so because it kinda dried out. I went ahead and put 2 more masks on (45min session) and it was quite annoying having to replace these. I&#x27;d rather pay 3x and get 3x as much.     The reason for 1 STAR: The biggest issue I had is LACK OF INFORMATION. Everything is in Japanese or Chinese. I want to know what is in this thing that I purchased. Where is it made? Does it contain high quality ingredients? If yes, how much of it? From the feel of the pack, as mentioned, there wasn&#x27;t too much essence and it doesn&#x27;t even state how much of it is in there. Is it that hard to put 0.5oz or 15ml or whatever on the pack?    This product is nothing to get excited about. I see a lot of people love this product. I probably have different standards because I may have less time to take care of myself in my busy life.</li>
    <li> First time using my beauty mask, although heard a lot of recommendations before. Easy to apply, I feel my skin begin to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; water after first use. If I want to buy this again, I will surely come back.</li>
    <li> This particular mask in the BD line is my favorite.  Soo soothing and smoothing.  Very juicy masks that allow you to do neck, declotte&#x27; AND keep applying to the mask while its on your face.  I wear them all until they almost shrink to my skin and there is SO much juice in these BD masks..you could take the mask off after it soaks in to your skin..put it back in the package to soak up the extra juice and use it again!  Literally!  Great quality and they do what they are supposed to.  Ive seen some on here say you are supposed to take the mask OFF the white backing and apply that side to your face.  WRONG.  They MUST have been joking.....you simply take it out of package and apply  rub it onto your face a bit then slowy peel the paper backing off.  Simple and wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very Fast Shipping! Love these beauty diary masks and had to put one on as soon as I got it. Only bad thing was that the box was a little beat up but at least the masks were alright haha</li>
    <li> I do not review items much but I really am truly impressed with this product. My skin is the healthiest it has ever been using this and, when I went off of it for a while, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as glowing/healthy as it was while on it.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am writing this review is so that users take advantage of the extra serum in the beauty packs to make it last longer, especially if you are slightly budget-conscious (and even if you aren&#x27;t!). One way I figured out how to get the lasting daily benefits is to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I open the packet, I pour all the excess/loose liquid from the packet into a separate container (empty beauty bottle that you may put your travel products in, etc)&lt;br /&gt;2. I then use the beauty mask, which usually enough liquid left to use the mask on your face (follow the helpful instructions other give on using the actual mask)&lt;br /&gt;3. Days that I do not use the mask (I use it maybe once per week, if I am ambitious), I use the leftover liquid from the mask as a daily serum underneath my moisturizer. It lasts a while, depending on how much you use, and certainly make sure pack last longer (and makes it the beauty mask that keeps on giving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many serums, even the best selling brands from this site, but I like to find multi-uses for products that I especially love. This is perfect as a serum for those in-between days.</li>
    <li> There was a high concentration of product on the mask paper. It had a backing to it so I knew which side faces my skin. My skin felt totally moisturized and renewed after using this product. I thought it was worth the money for sure and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Ahhh This thing is amazzzing. Im loving it so far! It feels so refreshing. Would totally buy another one (:</li>
    <li> I started out with the variety pack i got as a gift, and i personally like the black pearl best for the skin-whitening.   For those who can&#x27;t read Chinese. these are the steps to use these masks. wash your face/makes sure it&#x27;s clean from oil/dust. Then leave mask on your face for 30mins[the side where it sticks to the foil is the one that should go on your face.personally i keep it on till it&#x27;s close being dried out, about 45mins.], then throw away mask, rub the rest of residue into your face, and let it dry, no need to wash it off! My skin is now brighter and healthier looking than ever!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  It&#x27;s cleansing, refreshing, and most importantly it works!  You&#x27;re supposed to use it 2-3 times per week, but I use it when I go events (weddings, big deal dates, etc).  Leave it on for ~30 minutes and your face is brighter and clearer.  I recently went to a wedding and before doing my makeup, I used the mask (don&#x27;t wash your face afterwards) and could immediately feel the difference.  I got sooooo many compliments on my skin - some of my friends couldn&#x27;t stop staring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first try on using any facial mask - and I think I made the right choice!</li>
    <li> Shipping was faster than expected, and the product is well-packaged. I&#x27;ve only used it once so can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really whitening my skin, but it&#x27;s definitely moisturizing. The mask was completely soaked and there was a lot of lotion left so i also applied on my neck, my knees and elbows. About 30min the mask is still wet so i teared it up and applied on my knees. Another plus to this mask is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
    <li> This came rather quickly (like in three or four days). I tried it that night after washing my face like usual. First impression is that it is messy, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me all that much. I would rather feel like there is actual product on the mask than just get a semi-moist mask. I put it on my face (which is relatively round and not particularly big or small). It fit alright, although hung over my top lip a bit so I kept having to push it up. Otherwise, eye-holes and nose-holes were just fine. I kept it on for 25-30 minutes while I watched tv (in the meantime my skin tingled a bit, but nothing too bad, just felt like it was working), then took it off and rubbed the remaining product into my face and neck. Once my face absorbed everything, it didn&#x27;t feel too greasy or gooey at all. The next day, I did my usual routine with my face and the feel of my skin (which is combination oily and dry) is soft and well-balanced. I plan on using this once a week as a good deep-moisturizing, not so much caring about the whitening properties.</li>
    <li> Disappointed at the results, especially based on the reviews noted here. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements to my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love these sheet masks. I wish the product directions were in english as well. I bought the Apple Polyphenal mask as well and I&#x27;m 99% certain it&#x27;s fake and I was back and forth on whether this one was as well, but I have determined that I believe it&#x27;s real. The box raphics match up perfectly unlike the graphics on the other box.</li>
    <li> My skin has improved sightly from using this. For example, if I had a blemish that was new and a bit reddish, applying the mask would calm it down. Although I don&#x27;t see the whitening effects it smells great!</li>
    <li> i usually buy this from sasa.com it&#x27;s like a dollar cheaper there but it was out of stock so i bought it here. 13$ + free shipping is a pretty good deal, not to mention it only took 2 days to get to my house &lt;3.     notice: this is a Taiwanese brand. the directions are written in Taiwan...and if youve used sheet masks before it&#x27;s not rocket science on how to use these. if you&#x27;ve never tried them, you need to wash your face, put the mask on and fit it to your face, wait for skin to absorb serum and mask becomes dry (recommended 20-30 mins, but about 85 mins for my skin to soak up all the goodies), and throw out when it dries. DO NOT RINSE YOUR FACE AFTERWARDS, just rub remaining into your face. excess serum left in the packet i like to rub onto my neck.    to my review. it&#x27;s cool and refreshing on the skin and smells like pineapple. the mask is wide to fit most face shapes and has holes for your eyes, nose, and mouth. depending on the size of your eyes and mouth you may need to make the holes bigger so it fits more comfortably. make sure to put the side the plastic was on onto your face. this goes great with my shiseido white lucent line, the products make my skin look soft and moisturized and i have a glow-y transparent look that lasts like 2-3 days til i use a new mask. i highly recommend using 1-2 masks a week or the day of a celebration maybe a wedding or if youre going to go out for the night. remember that all skin types are different so everyone will have different experiences.     for those of you curious of the ingredients:  Purified Water, 1, 3-Butylene Glycol, Glycerine, Propylene Glycol, Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid, Pineapple, Alage, Cucumber, Lime Tree, Triethanolamine, Methyl Paraben, Algae-Yeast Complex, Bio-Active Silanols, Lecithin, Nanospheres, Vegetale Collagen, Citric Acid, Royal Pearl Extract, Tween-20, Ubiquinone, Propyl Paraben, Carbomer, XanthanGum, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Perfume</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with my skin for months. Went from too oily, to too dry, to acne (that takes weeks to clear up). Then acne meds made my skin too too dry! A friend recommended these mask to help soften my skin... The 1st use I notice my face was softer. And all the dry patches were gone... I thought, hmm just a coincident... Skipped a day. Used it... Hmm... Dry patches still gone... My face looks whiter (brighter). And where are my pimples!! hehe.. Gone!! Skin feels nice and soft and no pimples! On top of that the whiter skin makes my acne scars less visible!! I&#x27;m hoping after a few months of using this it will be barely noticeable! I love it!</li>
    <li> Overall, I love these masks.  I love the way my face feels the next day, but I do think these can be a little bit oily.  I love the way my face feels after I use these masks, very refreshing!  To the touch my face feels soft, but even a couple hours after putting the mask on I look \\&quot;shinny\\&quot; or \\&quot;oily\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t really feel oily, but I definitely look like it.  But after a nights rest the oily look dulls and I am left with a soft face.  I would recommend to anybody with normal skin, but I would worry what this would do to someone with already oily skin.</li>
    <li> I want to share this link of this Brand of products for English readers so you know what this mask is for. There are many of them with different functions all smells lovely and fruity.  I tried almost all of them.  My favourites are Strawberry, Black Pearl, Red Vine and Bulgarian White Rose. It&#x27;s just a personal preference of the scent! Even they state different functioinality for each mask I feel the common goal is for re-hydratioin which is what I am looking for. The mask feels cool on the face while putting it on so I prefer to use these type of masks when the weather is warmer! The masks are gentle and don&#x27;t irritate the skin. I would recommend you taking a nap while having it on so you can take full advantage of resting and relaxing and let the mask do the work.  When you wake up again in 20-30 minutes you can tell your skin is tightened, brightened, supple and fresh looking.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the morning though. I don&#x27;t normally like to put make up on right after a face mask but I do follow through with my beauty routine religiously to lock in the moisture.    The link:[...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used these masks. Definitely try other my beauty diary facial masks. This was super soothing for my skin and the next morning, my skin look more refreshed and super supple and soft! Very inexpensive also for the quality.</li>
    <li> After use this type mask, i didn&#x27; t feel any change of my face. I have had acne problem for one year. Maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t fit my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin was getting worse after I use it. I do not know why I use it. It makes no differences.</li>
    <li> skin feels nice and smooth after using this product. The  excess  lotion in packaging I apply to my neck too.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this sheet mask! SO moisturizing for you skin. I ordered like four boxes in the past from Amazon, but I am going to start ordering from eBay because they have these at more affordable prices</li>
    <li> my beauty dairy is my favorite brand of mask. it is affordable and effective on my skin type. it is the best.</li>
    <li> I love these masks!! I was skeptical about purchasing this product because I have spent lots of money in the past on so many different beauty products.However, after grabbing a copy of Woman&#x27;s Day it suggested that the sea pearls would be beneficial to any beauty regime. I love this mask because its ingredients create a dewy instant glow to the skin. I have sensitive skin and i did not experience any irritation after applying the mask.I will definitely be purchasing other variations of sea pearl products and last but not least the seller shipped them super, super fast!!</li>
    <li> I was anticipated to purchase MBD Black Pearl mask because of the rave reviews. It works okay for me. There is lot of essence and the mask stick well to the face leaving minimum amount of air bubbles. It has a faint smell, not strong but not really pleasant. When removed, the result is not something that you have to say \\&quot;wow\\&quot;. It leaves skin smooth, hydrated, radiant, however the whitening effect is very subtle if not at all. I&#x27;ve had better masks but of course with greater prices. One good point is that MBD mask is inexpensive and very affordable. FYI, I normally use a mask every 2 day so 1 box like this can last me around 3 weeks.    Black pearl mask is like a mix. Because it has many effects, none of the effects really work that well. If only for smooth and hydrated skin, I already have my moisturizer. There are other mask in MBD line that work better than this like the Natto mask. This mask is just mediocre, nothing so exciting. It earns me 3 stars, maybe 3 1/2 stars if I&#x27;m generous :)</li>
    <li> This is a really fun mask. The effects only last a day or so but if you have a special function to attend this would be a good mask before hand. Feels really good on dry skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product so happy i came across is. It makes my skin glow and is so soft. there is extra product left in the packet and i use it in the morning and on my neck. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this mask is not designed for people with acne or oily skin. Use it everyday if you can afford it</li>
    <li> Black pearl is my second favorite in this brand (aloe right now is the best). It has a light/floral/powdery scent, which I&#x27;m not as fond of. It doesn&#x27;t brighten my skin as it says, but it makes my skin feel a lot plumper after uses. I use these masks every 2-3 days. It&#x27;s actually very affordable and sustainable. I haven&#x27;t figured out how to insert a picture but below is a picture/chart of some products that MBD has with their benefits. This way, you can figure out which type of mask is most beneficial for you.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> It really made my mom&#x27;s freckle face  glow and she got compliments on it too...People would what she was using as well!</li>
    <li> Like this mask - I normally don&#x27;t use conditioning masks but for some reason this one is wonderful and very pleasant to wear even if its awkward.  I just put the whole thing one initially for a minute or 2 then rub the lotion in and take it off.</li>
    <li> To be honest I was really expecting something amazing after reading all these wonderful reviews. However, my experience was simply mediocre at best. First of all it is large on my face which made it a little uncomfortable because I had to hike it up and lay a good bit of it on my hair. I kept in on for about 50-60 minutes and rubbed the excess liquid on my neck. It didn&#x27;t exactly do much for me. It is definitely very hydrating and smells lovely, but my skin certainly didn&#x27;t look much brighter.</li>
    <li> This product is quite different from products I purchased before. Last time I bought a box of pearl mask and I like it very much. So I decide to buy this product again. But at this time  I compared it with the real products and I think this one is fake. The mask emits a strange smell and it was a little dry and much liquid was left in the bag. And when I use it, my eyes can&#x27;t open.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best products in my beauty diary.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot other mask in MBD, but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything. You know what it is? Some really \\&quot;cheap and slimy\\&quot; moisturizer on a piece of paper which you have to put on ur face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive, it ruined my day. These creams work: Nivea soft, burt bee&#x27;s radiance cream work on me for moisturizing but this product didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so expensive, I wonder why anyone would choose to purchase a completely useless thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money for good products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely, doesn&#x27;t do other things as well. I use Kojic acid soap and it worked for me, my hyperpigmentation is in control!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please beware, someone is disliking all the true reviews on this product.</li>
    <li> Always love the MY BEAUTY DIARY brand, strongly recommend if you are a student and just need the basic skin care, try to wear masks twice a week and it helps your skin fresh from studying. Black Pearl Mask is one of my favorite and it does whitened my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this after my mid day runs in the hot summer. I did notice that my dark skin did return to natural skin tone after using this twice a week for couple months. Great product</li>
    <li> great mask that I&#x27;ve ever had. Lots of moisture, easy to use, saving time, you can feel the changes right after using it.</li>
    <li> This is a really fun mask that makes you feel really great after using it.  It does get a little sloppy because there is so much of the solution on the mask, so I recommend having a little hand towel available to dab at the run off.  I use this as a special treat every once in awhile, as following the recommendations for full benefits (2-3 times a week) is just way to pricey.  I will happily buy more of this product in the future and have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> Was a fake, I was too afraid to actually it on my skin because of how sensitive my skin is. My beauty diary masks are awesome though</li>
    <li> great for skin, I woke up with smoother and whiter skin. very moisturizing and feels great, great for sensitive skin as well</li>
    <li> Whitening effects weren&#x27;t amazing, but it did moisturize my skin very, very well. Awesome for pampering the skin, not for whitening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved pearl masks and although I haven&#x27;t used one in quite a while, I found this recently and started using it...and so far the result has been more than satisfactory! I use it twice a week, and it has noticeably whitened my skin. Also I love how my skin feels so silky smooth and moist after using it!</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it after a microdermabrasion scrub . Just making yourself lie down is a bonus. I love how it makes my skin feel and its even better the next day</li>
    <li> I love these masks with a passion. I used my first one of this kind last week and my face still feels soft and fresh 5 days later after working out, showers, etc. They&#x27;re great for those of you with enlarged pores and that awful &amp;#34;winter face&amp;#34; that rears its ugly head this time of year. I definitely recommend this product! Its such a blessing.</li>
    <li> I compared the package with the real one, this is the fake one.&lt;br /&gt;Evidence 1: the individual package looked totally different from the picture shown here, and it is NOT the upgraded version. (There is NO day, month, year these three words on the individual package - HOWEVER, this is one of the critical ways to identify whether this product is real)&lt;br /&gt;Evidence 2: The amount of the essence in the package is PATHETIC!!! It is almost dried up and not even mentioning if there are extra essence for me to put on my arms and legs (if you have ever tried the real version you will know what i am talking about)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO FREAKING DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!! DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> it works every single time there is a huge difference in the texture and appearance of my skin after i use this mask&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll always buy this. and it came really quickly too!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick, but when compared the packaging to my other my beauty diary masks, I could tell it was not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;You can immediately tell by looking at the font of the ingredients list. Each pouch is also slightly larger than real ones and the tear off marks do not line up to the real ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m worried about putting this on my face, but it does whiten the skin.</li>
    <li> The masks do not fit that well on my face but they work well at hydrating and I love the packaging</li>
    <li> It really makes your skin brighter and softer, but it is very temporary. I would use it before a special event for a little extra moisture but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful.  I put it on my face until the mask dry out at night. The next morning my face look fresh, moisturize, soft, and brighten.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing and whitening mask!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on at night after washing my face, and take it off after about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;After, I massage in the gel left over.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I gave it a four star was because although it is a great mask, I&#x27;ve tried on better ones, of course, for a bigger price, but it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I think this mask is great for its price, and great for using whenever</li>
    <li> I am really sure that this product is fake. I&#x27;ve compared the mask with the one I purchased from Walmart, not only the mask shape is different but also the patterns on the external packing is different. I&#x27;ve looked up some tips for distinguishing the fake and real mask. They say the mask sheet (white)should be very thin so that it provides a good contact with our face. But the one I purchased from this seller is very thick and it does not fit to my face also it is very thick that does not last long enough on my face.</li>
    <li> I was a bit dubious about ordering this product, but after reading all the great reviews, decided to give it a try.  The first time I used it, I left it on for about 30 minutes and when I removed it, my skin felt moisturized, but that was about it. The second time I used it, I left it on for over and hour (until the mask was mostly dry).  This seemed to make a big difference.  Not only was my skin moisturized, but also very soft, smooth and supple with a great \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it.  The mask is easy to use, don&#x27;t worry about the directions not being in English -- remove the face shaped mask and align and press against your face.  It smells great without being over-powering and is very cooling as it dries.  Wonderful product</li>
    <li> Shipping time was awesome!  Product was exactly what it said it was.  Quality product as well and the price was very low!  Product is helpful for hydration!!</li>
    <li> I reallllly like the smell of this mask. It smells very settle and fresh. I&#x27;m not a fan of strong smelling products but this product was perfect for my sensitive nose. This mask also made my skin feel very soft and moisturized every time. I took it with me to a sleepover and all my friends loved it as well.&lt;br /&gt;As for the whiting abilities, I have no idea if it is working. I&#x27;m southeast asian and I got tan this summer. I should pay attention to if it has made me lighter, in the mean time, u probably will have to use it quite often to see some real results.</li>
    <li> Good for moisturizing. I always keep some BEAUTY DIARY MASKS at home for my regular skin care. But besides moisturizing, they don&#x27;t seem to have other amazing effects.</li>
    <li> This great for people with little time and a busy day, 45 minutes of my day to refresh my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great facial mask! I love this brand and I&#x27;m used to get it from some Asian cosmetic stores in the US or sasa.com (Hong Kong), which cost me $15 or $12 for each package. Amazon is great! The price is great and shipping is fast!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on Amazon reviews and am so happy I did. I am a hard-to-impress skincare junkie. I&#x27;ve tried many of the high end department store and dermatologist name brands. This works as well as all the aforementioned. My skin is very fair and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the mask on for 30 minutes and rubbed the residue on my hands, neck, and decollete. My skin was lineless afterwards and glowing. Two days later, my skin is still very hydrated and supple. I am on a special program from my dermatologist and plan to use this once or twice a week.I feel the results are as good as any expensive facial for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Very nice and good price product</li>
    <li> it does&#x27;t really do what it says. It gave my face a bit of a yellow tinge....? Odd thing to happen, but at least my skin felt more or less alright. Not super impressed.....not even a little impressed actually, it&#x27;s just bleh.</li>
    <li> generally good. but I do not feel that it brightened my face much. also my face hurts a little after putting it on for 10min. Despite that, it is good for moisturing</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this mask based on the many positive reviews here and I am not disappointed! After using 1 mask at night before bed, the next morning my skin was SO soft I really was shocked. A couple of months ago i had a $70 facial with microdermabrasion and my skin feels the exact same way after using the mask as it did with the facial. So this Black Pearl mask is my new facial for sure. There is also enough serum left in the package to apply to my face and neck one additional time which I think is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Almost 10 years of acne has left my skin scarred and bumpy. Several rounds of chemical peels have also left my skin hyper-pigmented, so much so that my face and neck are at least 3 shades darker than the rest of my body. People think I am crazy and have dark makeup on my face but that is just the real color of my skin. I also have semi-deep wrinkles on my forehead from too much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been in the market for any kind of treatment that would fade the dark marks, make my skin tone more natural looking and even out the wrinkles on my forehead, all while not making me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this wonderful product 1 week ago on amazon and ordered it after a little research. I received it in the mail about 5 days after I ordered it (I placed my order on a Saturday). That same night I cleansed my face and applied the mask. I do not use toner at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I opened the little pouch, I was unsure what to think about how wet the mask was. The mask itself fit pretty well on my face, the cut outs for the eyes, nose and mouth fit my face really well. After applying the mask on my face I rubbed the remaining liquid all around my neck, decollete area, and even on my arms and shoulders. There was that much liquid in the pouch. The mask is thin enough that I was able to tear slits around my nose bridge so that it would stick well to the skin. Also the mask covers my upper lip and moisturizers it as well. The mask is wet but not runny so it does not seep into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is slightly slimy and has a pleasant light smell. I left it on for 45 minutes because it felt so cool on my face; I laid down and took a nap. Even after 45 minutes, the mask was still pretty wet. I did not wait for it to dry. I took it off and squeezed out the remaining of the liquid in it and gave my face and neck a light massage. I did not need to apply any moisturizer nor did I wash my face. I immediately went to bed but tried sleeping on my back foras long as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up in the morning, I literally cried after I looked in the mirror and touched my face. I cannot remember the last time I had felt such soft and smooth skin on my face, like I mentioned above, been battling acne for 10 years now and I turn 22 in a few months. That is almost half a lifetime of acne and problem skin. Anyways, my forehead looked like those celebrity foreheads who get botox done and my bumpy cheeks looked like I had really expensive makeup on and then photo-shopped as well. My overall skin tone wasn&#x27;t drastically changed but my skin looked better because of how smooth it had become and the dark acne scars looked lighter, not completely gone but noticeably lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it has worked for me so well I have decided that I will use this every other night. I only applied it for the second time last night. My only complaint is why did I not know about this product earlier. It might not work for everybody but this has worked for me and the best part, it has not caused me to break out after a second application 24 hours ago. The price is also reasonable considering it solves so many skin problems at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took pictures before I started with this so I will update this review in 4 weeks with before and after pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anybody looking for the same results that I mention above in the 2nd paragraph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE After 1 year: So I know that I said I would post a before and after picture and I apologize to those who were expecting one. I didn&#x27;t because the results were not permanent. They are still just as magnificent for a day after you apply the mask and then the effects wear off. I don&#x27;t understand why or how, but that is just how this product works. Over time, I did notice a slight permanent improvement with the scars. The dramatic effects are temporary. And for about $1.30 per mask, it is pretty expensive to put on every other day. So Ionly put it on the night before a big event. It is however very hydrating. The mask is really wet and it is perfect for when your skin needs extra moisture. I use Olay&#x27;s microdermabrasion kit and that really dries out my skin. But I have found that if I use this mask right after I do the peel, my skin gets the right amount of moisture and heels very nicely and best of all, it does not make me break out. So I still think that this is a good temporary skin brightener but do not expect any permanent or long term effects. All in all, I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My mother bought this mask pack herself and suggest me to try first before she will, I just used this mask now and oh my... This is the best I&#x27;ve ever felt! I kept this on for about 20 minutes, every five minutes with the mask on I massaged my face then after I took it off I did some gentle patting and it absorbed onto my skin perfectly! My pores are tightened, my skin is so smooth, and it has a polished glow to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mask to many people, we are all different maybe but if the people who oppose to this mask&#x27;s work give this mask another chance they might see it as a healing change. I had some blemishes and blackheads on my face I was getting rid of with the come dome, after using this mask it felt like it&#x27;s helping my skin heal very well. This is powerful and skin changing indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am eighteen years old, I sure would like to see the hormone levels of my teenage years change after this, I had extreme problems that took a total on my skin over the years more than the average teen...</li>
    <li> This mask is very moisturizing, there is plenty of product in each treatment to use all over the neck and chest as well.  I keep the mask in its&#x27; envelope and re-use as the mask is very saturated with the moisturizing ingredients.  rub the extract into your skin and skin is soft and silky, I especially appreciate how soft it leaves my neck and chest area.  very good value!</li>
    <li> this one works as well as the natto mask and smells much better (to me) it has a very salt air kind of smell that makes me think of the ocean and its great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how ever the mask its self (like the natto and apple one) does not really fit my face(granted it is a paper mask so i can move it around abit but it seems too big for me, my face must be small/short because the mouth opening always wants to go down to my chin.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I stated using it two days ago; and it instantly made my skin feel super soft and smooth! I will continue to use this product in the coming weeks to see the long term results.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about ordering my mask,but it didn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t have really bad skin at all, but I do have some dry areas and I was hoping it would help. I used the whole box and I couldn&#x27;t see any changes. The only thing I liked was that It felt cool and it was relaxing.</li>
    <li> This works ABSOLUTELY great! My skin feel sooooooo fresh and comfy after using it just once! Whitening overnight and highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Was the formula changed in this? I&#x27;ve ordered it plenty of time but the last two they&#x27;ve been irritating my skin. It was more alcohol-y.  I don&#x27;t know if I would order it again. I used to.love it especially because I felt it did help with my acne scarring and dark spots.</li>
    <li> The mask certainly leaves the skin supple and with a certain glow, but so far not sure on any real permanence.  Will keep using it to see how it goes; definetly worth a try.</li>
    <li> I tried this mask on a whim and am glad that I did.  It&#x27;s moisturizing without causing my face to break out, and seems to make my pores appear much smaller.</li>
    <li> I love this product! First of all, these masks work great. After putting it on for 30 mins. (package says 20 but I feel like it works better at 30 min.) After the 1st night I used it, my pores shrunk and my skin stayed super soft and glowy the next morning. The mask gives a an initial tingly sensation but goes away after a while. There is so much serum packed into the package I can use the excess serum in the bag the next day (I put it on before bed). The packaging is so convenient that I can throw some in my suitcase and break one out when my skin is feeling tired and dull. I&#x27;m definitely going to have to buy more. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Not messy to apply.  Feels very refreshing while on my face.  I do notice a difference in my skin afterwards.  My skin feels softer and looks moisturized and brighter.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my first facial mask purchase. After viewing bubzbeauty tutorials, I&#x27;ve decided to try them. I want to try more of them! This was cold but refreshing at the same time to my skin. I just love it. I will be sure to make future purchases.</li>
    <li> i think this kind mask is not for me, probably im ganna get the other one for dehydration. i heard of the brand  pretty good through, my friend uses it for a long time</li>
    <li> Overall, I think this is a good product. They tell you that you don&#x27;t have use moisturizer afterwards,  that it continues to moisturize your skin. That was one of the reasons why i bought it. But My only complaint is that my skin feels kind of dry afterwards. I still feel that I need to use my night crime. I still use it though</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and it keeps my skin soft and smooth. I almost used it every week.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again next time.</li>
    <li> good product. I already brought it twice, will continue use it. After use it skin feels moisture.I always like the product of My beauty diary.</li>
    <li> Love Japanese cosmetic. But this one is a disappointment. Not a single word in English. Have no idea for how long it&#x27;s supposed to be on the skin. Other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> love it, so convenient, no messy eggwhite anymore. soft, good for busy professioanl women.Put it on the night before, get it off in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay,.it cools my face, it didn&#x27;t lightened my face just like the other review but its a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Super hydrating and soothing. Perfect for my extremely dry skin. Also brightens and tightens like it says it does. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I ordered it as a gift for my mother because she loves trying new beauty products.  After using it her skin look so radiant and more hydrated than usual.  Seeing the effect it has, I decided to try a package.  I&#x27;m amazed at how bright my skin was and how well it hydrated it. My skin is very dry and this mask really hydrates it. Overall, I love this mask !</li>
    <li> smell weird，not the same as i used before, the materials i feel different,too. i only use it for 5 minute, then i can&#x27;t stand it</li>
    <li> It really moisturizes my skin. i used this mask about once a week after exfoliating my skin, I couldnt tell the different on my skin right away, but the next couple of days, I noticed my skin looks brighter, smooth, and moistured. You shouldnt wash your face off after using this mask. You should apply the left- over liquid on your face and leave it overnight. Will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One of the hottest mask on Amazon. I think it is authentic. The smell and material are definitely the same as those previously bought from Taiwan.</li>
    <li> My beauty diary is competitive in China market. This is my favorite mask. I am really happy that I can buy it in USA</li>
    <li> Overall what I can say about this product is that it has given me a very moisturized and clean feel towards my face after every application. Yes, I am a guy and a friend recommended me this product in order to help reduce the facial tan that I have had all throughout my life and I can honestly say this does make my face look paler(in a good way) but also I have been getting compliments by girls(believe it or not) on how my face is glowing in comparison to how it was before. Normally I apply it probably twice a week right after I shower and I let it just sit for the recommended 30 minutes, but occasionally I do it for 40 and it never ceases to disappoint me on that refreshing feel after. I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re trying to lighten your skin a bit but also bring out some color from a very dull looking skin tone. It&#x27;s one of my most favorite facial masks, aside from Aztec healing(but thats another story). Im here to say it for all the men out there, GUYS CAN USE THIS TOO. Two thumbs up! :]</li>
    <li> This mask makes the skin more hydrated and therefore it seem healthier. but like most hydrating sheet masks, the result only last a short time -- maybe an hour or two. It&#x27;s good for a quick treatment before a night out or an event, but do not expect any long term effect such as anti-aging or improving skin tone, etc.</li>
    <li> The black pearl mask is relatively easy to use.  Just tear open the bag, pull out the mask, remove the plastic backing, and put it on! As others have said, DO NOT rinse your face after using the mask as all the good stuff will be removed. I typically find that there is too much product in the packet for me to use, so what I do is squeeze the mask as I pull it out of the packet so that I have a little bit of serum left. I then use this leftover at night during the next few days as a booster serum after cleansing.   Though the mask says to leave it on for 20 min, I typically wear for an extra 10-15 minutes. It&#x27;s so refreshing...It feels nice and cool. A great way to relax once a week (or more) while watching TV or listening to some calming music. I do like that it makes my face feel soft after using it, although I haven&#x27;t seen much in terms of results. I believe the biggest benefit to using this (or any masks in general) is that relaxed and pampered feeling you get afterwards. That&#x27;s not to say that masks are useless...feeling great is also an important part of beauty care! ;)  The fit of these masks is quite good...it does take some adjusting when you first put it on. The sheet itself it thick, so don&#x27;t worry about accidentally tearing it up. Lastly, the fragrance isn&#x27;t too overwhelming...it smells nice! After this, I will have to try the Natto mask next for moisturizing purposes.</li>
    <li> Only used once but great moisturizing qualities..... Enjoyed using the spa like mask, great to use in the dry winter months...</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product after viewing all of the positive feedback, but am quite disappointed. I am happy for those it has worked for, however, so the product may deserve their positive feedback and just may not work for everyone. Personally, I have only used it twice and am actually going to use it again because I SO want it to work as it has for many others. In that regard, I will post an update to this review. Speaking of my current use and opinion, I did not immediately see any improvement whatsoever (in any of the described areas of benefit in the description or reviews), though it DID make my skin super smooth and soft, and it did break me out. I am in my mid-thirties with minimal wrinkles, combination skin, and some minor melasma. To describe my skin further, I have always taken excellent care of it, wearing sunscreen daily since about age fourteen along with a daily moisturizer, toner, etc. and normally am not prone to breakouts (except possibly an occasional breakout during &amp;#34;that time of the month,&amp;#34; though that is rare, as well). So for now, I am quite sad that this product did not work for me, but I am willing to try again (since it made my skin so soft and so many others apparently adore this product for a reason) and will update with any new results. Hope this helps. Thus far, I am not going to tell anyone that it does not work or to stay away because it seems to work great for some.</li>
    <li> This mask hands down beats a lot of other masks I&#x27;ve tried. There are a lot of serums in the package and the sheet material is very nice. After one use, I immediately saw hydration in my skin. Look forward to buy more masks from beauty diary. They&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin around my mouth area, and I bought many boxes of My Beauty Diary series.&lt;br /&gt;I should have just bought one and give it a try. It turned out that most of them burn my skin so all are wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you have sensitive skin as I do, be careful trying out these masks.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have sensitive skin, then these masks are indeed good for the price.</li>
    <li> Better than any mask I&#x27;ve ever used. . .better than masks in tubes and other cloth masks.  I washed my face, used a toner and then put the mask on.  I let it sit for 30 minutes and took it off.  Once I took it off, I just massaged the rest of the oils from the masks into my face and neck.  This smells lovely.  Very light and fragrant.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy this mask because it leaves an extremely sticky-icky finish on my face. My face also doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb this serum well. On the other hand, the aloe MBD mask work a whole lot better for me.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars only because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I love these sheet masks, so relaxing and leave my skin looking smooth, clear, and soft in the morning. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite mask in my beauty diary series, made my skin feel super soft and smooth. I already brought it twice.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best product of My Beauty Diary masks I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes your skin brighter and moisture better.</li>
    <li> It feels very good on your face, it helps clarify the redness that my skin has because of the break outs i sometimes have. You may not see the results in one day of course, but after three uses you do feel your skin is much more soft and looks really healthy. And the pores on my nose and cheeks are almost invisible! I have combination skin and i think the black pearl is the best one for combination to oily skin! I will repurchase again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this line of masks, but the price is good and I gave it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I really like that the mask fits really well on my skin therefore It is both comfortable and more effective. I have tried other Korean brands that didnt have that snug fit. I didnt smell any alcohol in this product and feels really nice. No irritation at all even when I leave It on for 45 to 60 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Saw the same brand in Houston and Dallas ranch 99 Asia grocery store and I brought other masks in the same line like snail, coQ10,eye mask etc and all have been excellent. I use 3x-5x per week and it has made a huge difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask every weekend. I apply it after thoroughly cleaning my face and toning it. The after feel is velvety and after a few weeks my skin is much supple and even toned. I hope they will keep it affordable.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive mask that works as described. I really like how it moisturizes and lightens(reducing the physical appearance of acne scars/blemishes).</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with all the masks I have tried. The pearl masks are especially nice because they have a light texture, dont feel sticky and have a remarkable effect on the skin. Try it, you will love it!</li>
    <li> I used these before and really liked them, so I bought more.  They really work and the price is reasonable.  Good value!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product. However, to my disappointment, I broke out immediately after using the mask. I have sensitive-ish skin (allergic to MAC and Clinique skin care), however online it said that this product was good for people will acne prone, sensitive skin, which I have. I will definitely not be repurchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> wow..my face felt dewy soft and soo smooth after the first use. I workout out doors alot do i looselots of moisture this helps replenish it in one treatment.</li>
    <li> I have beeping using this kind product for while. But the one the seller offered is fake one. After I use it, my face gets dry. Besides that. The mask quality is not good either.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted a good face mask to improve my skin but after buying the Ren Rose Serum I have found that I don&#x27;t really need this product as much.  However!  If you are one to take many long driving/plane trips then this is very useful.  You can put this on and let it keep your skin hydrated.  The skin has a beautiful glow afterwards but it is only temporary.  This product is more of a quick fix then part of my skincare routine</li>
    <li> I bought the signature one of this mask and it works good on me. It moisturizes my skin and keep it till next morning I wake up. But I am using that only when my skin is under not good conditions, just don&#x27;t have a habit of using mask frequently.</li>
    <li> Warning to all girls: do NOT buy this crap. Makes your skin super shiny (in a gross, oily way *barf*) and really sticky. Makes your skin feel really stiff (lol \\&quot;toned\\&quot;&#x3D;immoveable--makes it hard to smile). This stuff is really messy, and the mask doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin: kept sliding down my face, eww!!!!&lt;br /&gt;And before you ask if I got a fake, I researched it, just to make sure. Yep, I received the REAL shit, and trust me, it SUCKS. *throws away in disgust*</li>
    <li> I used this mask for 1 year. I have very sensitive skin and serious acne (in recovering during this year by using other products),  so it is hard to say whether it improved my skin or not. But every time after I used it, I do feel my skin is smooth, bright and soft. I watched a famous TV show in Taiwan which recommended this product. So I decided to keep trusting this product, see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I just received the product. But after I opened it I found the box doesn&#x27;t match the pictures shown on this page for the product. There is no any English on the box, not sure what is going on. [[ASIN:B001R5U2UU President Pharmaceutical MY BEAUTY DIARY Black Pearl Mask 10pcs]]</li>
    <li> I tend to not believe hype about products because most don&#x27;t work the way they claim to. This mask though?  Dear Lord does it work.  I&#x27;ve had skin problems all my life and finally gave up because nothing worked except constant facials and I didn&#x27;t want to shell out that kind of money twice a month (which is what I need to do to keep my skin under control). I&#x27;ve also used Accutane (years ago) and Rentin A (yeeearrs ago)and had such a bad reaction to both had to stop. Some good old-fashioned acne but mainly large pores, whiteheads and blackheads. I read about this mask, decided to give it a whirl and I&#x27;m SO glad I did because it&#x27;s re-energized me to clear up my skin.  It leaves my skin looking brighter, moisturized and tighter - smaller pores, blackheads cleared up, whiteheads easy to extract - but what really surprised me is for the few days after I use the mask my skin looks better and better.  I use it once a week and EVERYONE from co-workers, family, etc. has noticed how great my skin looks. No end to the compliments.  I&#x27;ve since purchased the Clarisonic for daily use and I&#x27;ve never, ever looked better in my entire life. This is my go-to product for the ages.</li>
    <li> Based on outstanding reviews I have decided to try this product. I have found nothing special about using this mask, no positive or negative effects. Why to buy it?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after visiting Japan and seeing all of the ladies there using it.  She loves using it about once per week and leaves them on for around 45 minutes.  Her skin looks great and is really soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> The shipment was fast. The mask makes my face smooth and bright. Suitable for dry and dull skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> This face mask is incredible! Perfect for all skin types, left my face silky smooth, plumped it up and was hydrated.</li>
    <li> this face mask is very nice!!!my skin is softer after i using it.it is my favorite mask in my beauty diary series.</li>
    <li> I love these face masks! They leave your face feeling so soft, smooth and fresh! They are also very inexpensive so makes for an even better buy!</li>
    <li> I have used My Beauty Diary mask almost two years and tried six different types of it. All of them are soft, light and good smell. They protect my skin away from dry, and make my face shining. No doubt I will continue support this brand and try other types of it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mask from My Beauty Diary, but unfortunately this is the new version. The serum has no scent, there is a slit in the chin, the shape is narrower, the packaging is different. The box you see in the picture is NOT the same as the one you will receive. The one I received seems to match up with the (v2) Black Pearl Masks from Sasa so while it may be legit, it&#x27;s not the same at all.</li>
    <li> I am almost out of these masks and I have to say I am impressed. I use it sometimes once a week, sometimes once every two weeks. Only when I feel my skin needs a pick-me-up because I think it does a good job of whitening and moisturizing. The first time I used it I think it irritated my skin a little, i got a small breakout and tingling sensation. But then after that it felt fine, I guess my skin just needed to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a typical paper mask, which fits way too big on my face especially the jaw area but that&#x27;s fine. Its loaded with essence so you could probably cover a lot of your body with the essence left in the packet. Certainly not a miracle product, but It does the job for me which is why I would re-purchase. It may be more costly to buy these on Amazon vs. Ebay, but I think amazon is a safer bet because there are a few \\&quot;fake\\&quot; beauty diary going around online and I think some on Ebay are not real beauty diary. Even if you pay more on Amazon, at least its authentic.</li>
    <li> I love these masks! At first I was a little concerned because of the residue left over on the skin, but I have had no problems with irritation and my skin practically glows after I use one. My skin type is pretty varied - sometimes it seems oily and other times it seems dry, but I am not prone to breakouts. The area where I live is super hot in the summer, and I often feel like the heat and humidity pull the moisture out of my face. These masks seem to help to restore that moisture to my face and even my skin tone out. The scent is not as pronounced as I expected, but it is not unpleasant, and I really like the tingly feeling the mask leaves on my face. I definitely think you have to use these often to keep the effectiveness visible, but I really like facial masks, so I don&#x27;t have a problem with using them once or twice a week. Generally, I leave the mask on for about 30-45 minutes, and rub the excess serum into my skin afterward as several other people have recommended. I would love to try other masks from this same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 3 times a week. THey are nice. I have them on my daughter&#x27;s face, she like it too.</li>
    <li> I have always loved My Beauty Diary face masks but never had the actually Japanese kind. The box is completely written in Japanese and is shrink wrapped to assure that it is new</li>
    <li> I do not feel that it brightened my face much, but it&#x27;s comfortable to put on and it has good moisture effect.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have too magicial functions as I expected. But it is also a nice mask product that makes me feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> Great product works well with my sensitive/oily/acne skin and i already see results, it has not irritated my skin at all, i will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap. The smell was good when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;After I used it, I washed my face I can feel my face is smooth. At least, I don&#x27;t feel dry on my face.</li>
    <li> Product received as it described. Evry thing looks ok in original package. no complain so far. Will come back again.</li>
    <li> This product is quite different from products I purchased before. I compared it with the real products and I think this one is fake. The mask emits pungent smell and it doesn&#x27;t rehydrate my skin at all. I felt my face very dry after using it.</li>
    <li> This mask does whitening you skin... for 5 minutes! After that time, your skin goes back to however it is before, it really doesn&#x27;t make your skin better in long-term.</li>
    <li> I have acne and scaring but I  do  not have dry skin. when I used it for the first time  I left it on for about 40 mins, when I took it off my skin looked the same it didn&#x27;t look hydrated or glowing or even helped my acne and scaring problem. It might work for dry skin but that&#x27;s it , not worth buying at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one of those people who deceive themselves into believing that the products they bought are good. I see what I see.&lt;br /&gt;I got this today, was so excited since I saw so many positive reviews on this one. I left it on my face for about an hour, took it off in front of a mirror, expecting to see a change. But I saw nothing. No glow. It sure does feel moisturized, but all other masks leave your skin moisturized too. After all, it&#x27;s a common sense that if you apply some type of liquid on your face for some time, the skin would absorb it. For now, I don&#x27;t see anything special in this. It absolutely made no difference in my skin. I HOPE to see a change, but like I said, I see what I see. I would have to use this several more times to see if it really deserves all the positive comments here.</li>
    <li> I bought this to combat dry skin that I&#x27;ve been plagued with the last 6 months. I have hormonal skin and it goes from oily to dry for no apparent reason. I&#x27;m normally super oily in the spring and summer but not so much this year, in fact my skin is dry and flakey. I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 weeks now about twice a week and I like it. I can&#x27;t say that the moisture affect stays long term but I definitely see the difference the morning after. I was also concerned as a dark african american that it would have an adverse fading affect on my skin (which I do not want), but it did not. My skin is also super smooth and silky afterwards. I&#x27;m hoping with sustained use the moisture will last longer.</li>
    <li> I often say that I do not mask enough but it is easy with these.  No mess and apply well.  I do have to make a couple additional cuts at the eyes and nose but that is no problem.  After I apply to my face, I rub the excess from the discard sheet and rub it into my hands and neck.  I leave it on until it is mostly dry- more than an hour (it feels so nice this summer to have it on with a fan blowing!) then remove and again rub the leftovers in my face, neck, decolletage, hands.  Afterwards the skin feels great and seems more resilient and seems to last a day or two.  I try to use at least once a week and use a clay mask other times.  It is a nice treat and I think the price is fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on my practice clients while I am in school, and everyone who has used one just loves them. They leave your face so soft and supple.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mask! Ever! I love it. Your skin will get really soft and smooth after using it; it will glow!!! I only used it once but I absolutely love it and I will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as it&#x27;s really popular  for whitening and moisturizing at the same time. And it really works! I use it once a week and about 20 minutes each time. Everytime after using it, I feel my skin is hydrated, radiant and very soft. I&#x27;m also using other series under this brand, but this one actually brightens my face. I will definitely buy it again. But I think I prefer to use it in winter since summer is for sun not fair :P</li>
    <li> it is good, even I do not know if it does work for me,because it is hard to distiguish, but everything is good.</li>
    <li> I like masks because it really refreshes my face without me having to shell tons of money at the spa. It is relaxing and effective. However, some masks require tons of clean up, which is a bit of a hassle if not done in the shower. This mask doesn&#x27;t require rinsing! Put on the mask and let it sit for 15 min or so and then take it off. Rub the rest of the liquid into the skin. My skin looked instantly brighter and have a nice glow to if. I love the scent too!</li>
    <li> First time I tried this, I didn&#x27;t necessarily break out with LARGE acne, but got about three or four itsy bitsy tiny ones the next day. I have only tried it once though... so maybe my skin can get used to it?! It&#x27;s really a bummer to me because I was so excited to try these out!! Maybe I need a different kind. :( so I gave it three and not less because my results weren&#x27;t horrific yet still made my skin glow a bit.</li>
    <li> MY BEAUTY DIARY is my favorite mask brand!! i use it twice a week, and every time after using it, i feel so good!</li>
    <li> I like them, very rich liquid, moisture a lot, and vey good quality of the mask itself. But it is more expensive when I bought them from China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan.</li>
    <li> I love using this 1-2 times a week. My face feels much softer now and looks clearer too. I will be repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> although I may say this is a bit different packaging from the ones I got from HKG before, I think it&#x27;s the same product in terms of effectivity. brightens instantly but I don&#x27;t see a whitening effect anymore compared to the ones i used before. but still a good product. happy i found this here in amazon. convenient to buy. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent facial mask for everyday use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the Japanese ones before this, and they cost more. This works as well and even cheaper!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this result, it&#x27;s really surprise me. After use it 3 times, I can see the different on my face. OMG, I will keep buying as my regular mask now. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used this mask for over a year, it works good for me. It effectively preserve moisture on face.</li>
</ol>
