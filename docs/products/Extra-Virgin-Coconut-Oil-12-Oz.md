<li> so I have a bit of Rosacea and Seborrheic Dermatitis and have tried everything to combat the dry patches on my lower face that tend to feel like sand paper.</li>
<li> to treat chapped lips, diaper rash, dry skin</li>
<li> But the container makes it difficult to get the oil out especially towards the end, you have to heat it up in hot water to get it out.</li>
<li> A little went a long way.</li>
<li> Maybe if it was packaged differently in a little tub or dish it could be dipped out with a finger or a spoon.</li>
<li> I mix it with a little aquaphor and apply to the scalp.</li>
<li> The bottle makes it hard to use the product unless its melted down.</li>
<li> Why is the product too thick to pour?  </li>
<li> It is still usable and turns to oil in your hand but getting it out of the bottle is going to be difficult as the bottle empties.</li>
<li> I am not having any bad experience with it.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff!!  But the container makes it difficult to get the oil out especially towards the end, you have to heat it up in hot water to get it out.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I use it on my face for dry skin and it works really good. :)</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with the quality of this product. Packaging and shipping was good. I use it on my skin all the time. The feeling is amazing, soft and light. I do not like to use it in my hair only because the oil is in a liquid form right now and not thick, so it drips everywhere on my hair and not my scalp. Another thing, I always leave it in room temperature and it works great in the summer time as well.</li>
    <li> great product, i used coconut oil before, however you can tell this one is natural no additional chemicals, no perfumes, you just feel the coconut smell.</li>
    <li> Picture a product with the firm texture of crisco vegetable shortening that cannot be poured from the bottle I live in Las Vegas Nevada where the in recent days the temperature is 48 degrees at night and 59 in the daytime. The indoor temperature in my house is 72.  Why is the product too thick to pour?  Maybe if it was packaged differently in a little tub or dish it could be dipped out with a finger or a spoon. Then it could be used more easily  The water bottle type container with a flip top pour spout wont work. Its one solid chunk.</li>
    <li> Loved this oil, I really like the see through packaging. It worked really well on my hair. A little went a long way.</li>
    <li> So far I like it. I use it on my 1 yr old&#x27;s hair. I mix it with a little aquaphor and apply to the scalp. I have tried jojoba and olive but this might be the best so far</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I can tell the difference in how smooth my skin feels since I&#x27;ve started using it.  This is my second purchase I will definitely be adding this to my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> This product was not in oil form and appears old. It arrived on time, however, it was in a lard or lotion form instead of liquid. I thought it would warm up and liquify but it has not. It is still usable and turns to oil in your hand but getting it out of the bottle is going to be difficult as the bottle empties.</li>
    <li> Extra Virgin Coconut Oil , , creams, lotions and for massage.&lt;br /&gt;Used to treat chapped lips, diaper rash, dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Prevents skin disorders such as acne and eczema&lt;br /&gt;It reduces skin inflammation and helps in curing several skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;Usage Rate: 1-100%</li>
    <li> I love this Coconut Oil.  At the end of the day you can still feel it moisturizing your skin.  Execellent!</li>
    <li> Works GREAT on dry/irritated skin!  Very thick in the bottle, but almost immediately melts to liquid in the warmth of your hands.</li>
    <li> LIKE THE WAY IT SMELLS AND FEELS ON MY BODY. ITS RICH AND THICK, WISH IT WAS IN A JAR INSTEAD OF A BOTTLE BUT THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 other oils from Dr. Adorable, and I am never disappointed. My husband and I also use this as part of our skin care regimen, I cook with it, and I use it weekly as a hair treatment. I have purchased their Argan oil, Grapeseed oil, and now the Coconut oil. Thank you for selling these wonderful unrefined and refined oils!</li>
    <li> Great product but hard to get out of bottle.</li>
    <li> Although this says extra virgin, i find that the smell is not as strong as it should for something pure. I use this on my skin, hair and my newborn. I am not having any bad experience with it.</li>
    <li> We bought this coconut oil after it was recommended to us by a family member.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing.  Our new born son had a bit of an issue with dry skin and cradle cap that baby oil and lotions were not doing anything for.  The day after we put this on, all the problems disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is solid at room temperature but simply squeeze a bit in your hand and it will melt quickly.  You can also run it under warm tap water.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product smells like fresh coconut. The delivery was very fast.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a pure coconut, and really smooths my skin.</li>
    <li> I am looking for some oil which is not only functional but with some medicinal and health benefits. This one, along with the others that I have ordered, fits the criteria. Very good to use externally, pleasant and soothing.</li>
    <li> It arrived solid cold, but once heated up by a bowl of warm water, it liquifies and is great for my hair and body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  It is solid so it needs to be warmed up to dispense from the cap. I will, and already did, order more!</li>
    <li> I use this coconut oil for everything. It&#x27;s the only thing I have used in my hair and it looks and feels so healthy ( non greasy) I also use it on my skin after showers. The bottle makes it hard to use the product unless its melted down. The top should be bigger.... Great but!</li>
    <li> I purchased several oils from this company including the Coconut oil. Great price and they ship fast. I have sensitive skin so I have a bit of Rosacea and Seborrheic Dermatitis and have tried everything to combat the dry patches on my lower face that tend to feel like sand paper. I finally found that cure...I use Coconut oil and Baking soda to wash my face then rinse and all that is left is the coconut oil that softens my skin. I also use the coconut oil in place of butter on my toast along with honey and cinnamon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use in a beauty regimen and it is just great. You only have to use a minescule amount and it feel soooo good on your skin. Only been using it a short while and alreatdy have had compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> This extra virgin coconut oil is great. The shipping was fast. I use this oil for body, hair, and cooking. It works great for all three.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend purchasing this oil for a multi- purpose use. I was a bit skeptic due to reading some not so good reviews, but I am so glad I decided to purchase this coconut oil anyway. I will be definitely purchase more.</li>
