### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;For best results:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>This is the greatest stuff to use on your callused feet.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonderful lip balm!  </li>
      <li>so like I said looks very good</li>
      <li>I knew it was good stuff !</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>I do prefer to praise, but am vehemently honest!</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Better than anything else I have ever</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I think it is a lean healthy meat), so hopefully using their fat is in addition to the use of their meat</li>
      <li>so although I love the product I am going to try to figure out if the emu is just raised and used for this of if they use the meat too.  </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s easy to miss the decimal on .5)</li>
      <li>This stuff I expect to work really well just from the appearance since I have not used it yet, but other people have and it also has a nice smell to it kind of a peach-pear scent</li>
      <li>Great product and really works on cracked or dry feel and heels.</li>
      <li>An absolute must for cracked heels used with the special socks.  </li>
      <li>Emu oil has long proven effective in softening skin.  </li>
      <li>Use it very, very sparingly...</li>
      <li>While this stuff works wonderfully, the price is far to steep for such a small size.  </li>
      <li>so everything comes out really</li>
      <li>/&gt;This does work well on rough feet, without doing any sort of exfoliator, just not as well, but still better than anything else out there.  </li>
      <li>Be more careful than I was when ordering this product.</li>
      <li>There are so many other effective products that don&#x27;t destroy endangered birds.</li>
      <li>Be sure you see it is half ounce rather than 5 ounce</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment, but like larger size</li>
      <li>Have used better products in the past.</li>
      <li>Your pedicurist will not believe how soft and healed your heels are and will want to know how you are accomplishing that!</li>
      <li>(heat must help it soften and spread); so it seems to get so thinned out, it becomes clear.  </li>
      <li>This item is .5oz for nearly $9.  </li>
      <li>With a little more research you can find a large container for less money.</li>
      <li>The other is in a dark blue tin (kind of vintage looking - looked like something my grandparent&#x27;s would have had in their medicine cabinet and has the medicinal stink)</li>
      <li>Discovered this completely by accident when I completely  ran out of every possible source of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; lip balm I owned...</li>
      <li>There is one a clear plastic container with a blue lid - it smells citrus-y.  </li>
      <li>Apparently Emu oil comes from the connective tissue of an emu bird, which I found out in my research is endangered.  </li>

<li> Dark socks won&#x27;t show anything, and white ones go into the whites with my husband&#x27;s undershirts, our white towels and get a cup of bleach thrown in anyways</li>
<li> I never noticed this when purchasing or I never would have, but I skipped right to the customer reviews and failed to notice the key product ingredients, which is actual emu oil.</li>
<li> This gets off the old dry dead skin or callouses and leaves your feet softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> CAUTION -this is a tiny half ounce</li>
<li> I also use white or black socks every day after applying.  </li>
<li> I never had paid attention to the ingredients until the other day, and it is the fat of an emu bird....</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t make the same careless mistake I did and fail to read the fine print.</li>
<li> After letting this set for about 1/2 hour apply lipstick/lip gloss as usual.  </li>
<li> In my humble opinion - felt like tacky grease on my feet without any moisturizing benefit!</li>
<li> If I took a gob of this stuff out and rubbed in on some fabric it would be the color of the product, but not sure if it would permanently stain, but how often do you do that or why would you?  </li>
<li> Unfortunate to have dry cracked feet, this product both softens and moisturizes my feet.</li>
<li> :  I had previously read complaints about the bad smell of this stuff.  </li>
<li> and I was angry.</li>
<li> - I found this at the &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; store and it smells terrible and didn&#x27;t think it worked as well, but didn&#x27;t compare ingredients, so maybe was just turned off by the smell;</li>

<ol>
    <li> Do NOT buy this!!! It&#x27;s only .5 oz, which is nothing. $10 for nothing. Just go to the website dothegoo.com, it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
    <li> Love the product. Could not find it locally. But,it was my mistake in buying the .5 oz. The 2 oz size is about the same price. I misread the size on the one I bought . Be more careful than I was when ordering this product.</li>
    <li> used it after surgery on my scar ! I knew it was good stuff !</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb</li>
    <li> This is the greatest stuff to use on your callused feet.  Regular use has improved the soles of my feet 100%</li>
    <li> Have used better products in the past. In my humble opinion - felt like tacky grease on my feet without any moisturizing benefit! I do prefer to praise, but am vehemently honest!</li>
    <li> Gives relief to pain of calus.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Scrub your feet in the bath/shower with some sort of exfoliator and/or pumice stone.  This gets off the old dry dead skin or callouses and leaves your feet softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Apply Blue Goo every day.  Blue Goo will keep your feet softer longer.  Better than anything else I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does work well on rough feet, without doing any sort of exfoliator, just not as well, but still better than anything else out there.  It will soften them, but doesn&#x27;t take that toughness away or eliminate the cracks that can occur; it works for the day and then repeat the next day after your shower and put on socks.  You also don&#x27;t need a lot.  A tiny bit will spread out as you rub it around and massage it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL:  I had previously read complaints about the bad smell of this stuff.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why.  There are two types of this stuff out there.  There is one a clear plastic container with a blue lid - it smells citrus-y.  The other is in a dark blue tin (kind of vintage looking - looked like something my grandparent&#x27;s would have had in their medicine cabinet and has the medicinal stink) - I found this at the &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; store and it smells terrible and didn&#x27;t think it worked as well, but didn&#x27;t compare ingredients, so maybe was just turned off by the smell; but like anything, it wasn&#x27;t unbearable and once I put socks on, it was done and gone - no big deal, just suck it up for 30 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAINS:  I read some reviews that mentioned staining clothes.  I have not encountered this, but I only use a tiny bit which spreads out over my entire foot (heat must help it soften and spread); so it seems to get so thinned out, it becomes clear.  If I took a gob of this stuff out and rubbed in on some fabric it would be the color of the product, but not sure if it would permanently stain, but how often do you do that or why would you?  Tomato sauce stains so I wear an apron and don&#x27;tdump it on my shirt intentionally; I use caution with all liquids and fabrics.  I also use white or black socks every day after applying.  Dark socks won&#x27;t show anything, and white ones go into the whites with my husband&#x27;s undershirts, our white towels and get a cup of bleach thrown in anyways so everything comes out really white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EMU OIL:  I never had paid attention to the ingredients until the other day, and it is the fat of an emu bird....so although I love the product I am going to try to figure out if the emu is just raised and used for this of if they use the meat too.  I have thus read that emu&#x27;s were being raised on farms for their meat but it hasn&#x27;t taken off in the US as planned (I think it is a lean healthy meat), so hopefully using their fat is in addition to the use of their meat so no part of the bird is being thrown out.</li>
    <li> Great product and really works on cracked or dry feel and heels. It&#x27;s worth the investment, but like larger size</li>
    <li> CAUTION -this is a tiny half ounce (it&#x27;s easy to miss the decimal on .5) The 2 oz is the same price.</li>
    <li> Emu oil has long proven effective in softening skin.  In fact, the &amp;#34;Queen of Feet&amp;#34; recommends emu oil.  But my dog loves the taste of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Started using this last winter, just follow directions and &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; feet are yours in a short time!</li>
    <li> This stuff I expect to work really well just from the appearance since I have not used it yet, but other people have and it also has a nice smell to it kind of a peach-pear scent so like I said looks very good</li>
    <li> This item is .5oz for nearly $9.  While this stuff works wonderfully, the price is far to steep for such a small size.  With a little more research you can find a large container for less money. I am returning this unopened.</li>
    <li> An absolute must for cracked heels used with the special socks.  Your pedicurist will not believe how soft and healed your heels are and will want to know how you are accomplishing that!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Nothing I&#x27;ve used even compares to this.</li>
    <li> I did not read the packaging closely when purchasing this product, but when my kid noticed this product uses Emu oil, she asked what that meant. I didn&#x27;t think it could be possible, but then I did my research and I was angry. Apparently Emu oil comes from the connective tissue of an emu bird, which I found out in my research is endangered.  I was gutted to find out that the Audubon Magazine puts the remaining population of emu at 1200 to 2400 individuals.  I can&#x27;t believe I bought this product!!! Ugh. I never noticed this when purchasing or I never would have, but I skipped right to the customer reviews and failed to notice the key product ingredients, which is actual emu oil. There are so many other effective products that don&#x27;t destroy endangered birds. Gesh. Don&#x27;t make the same careless mistake I did and fail to read the fine print.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  Unfortunate to have dry cracked feet, this product both softens and moisturizes my feet.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my lips...yes lips. It is a wonderful lip balm!  Discovered this completely by accident when I completely  ran out of every possible source of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; lip balm I owned...this was in the drawer and voila...  Use it very, very sparingly...the smallest container made has lasted me for well over a year.  After letting this set for about 1/2 hour apply lipstick/lip gloss as usual.  Stop laughing and try it!!!</li>
    <li> Be sure you see it is half ounce rather than 5 ounce</li>
