      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It does do the job though!  :-)</li>
      <li>It feels much more \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; than Vaseline Intensive Care or Lubriderm.  </li>
      <li>The product has a light scent and absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>I have problems with the way most lotions smell.</li>
      <li>I love this product, and so does my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell.</li>
      <li>Many of them have an over powering perfumy stench that gives me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>:)  p.s.  Haven&#x27;t purchased it from Amazon (yet)</li>
      <li>Even my nails are doing better because my cuticles are moist now.</li>
      <li>It couldn&#x27;t have been more magical if unicorns and sparkles emerged from the pump.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite lotion</li>

      <li>Just ok nothing special</li>
      <li>Not only is it truly effective (better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried), but because it&#x27;s so effective</li>
      <li>&#x27;cause I haven&#x27;t had these wonderful results from ANY other lotion!  </li>
      <li>I picked this up because I had a coupon and quickly feel in love.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge user of lotion</li>
      <li>Same great product</li>

      <li>It glides on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.  </li>

      <li>I researched the most highly rated moisturisers and this came up in the top 5.</li>
      <li>I have used many lotions, none that truly work; this lotion so far is the best one I have found for my dry skin.</li>

      <li>I happened across a sample of this lotion in a magazine several years ago, and it&#x27;s by far absolutely the best hand and body lotion</li>
      <li>A lot of perfumed lotions burn the scratches and my hands get wet and wash most lotions off very easy.</li>
      <li>I like this lotion because it works well on my hands and is absorbed quite quickly into the skin</li>
      <li>I have an old flip top that fits these bottles.</li>
      <li>but this particular version smells too strong.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have bad hang-nails year-round.  However, since using this product throughout the day and at night, they&#x27;re much, much better.  While it does wash off when using soap and water, you&#x27;re hands do feel much more moist overall when using this product, even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can purchase this at about the same price at my local stores, and sometimes on sale for a better price, by purchasing this on the subscribe and save, I never run out, and most importantly never have to search for sales.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond lotions and creams are great; I love the product.</li>
    <li> I used paquin Plus for 40+ years as it was the only product that really solved the dry hand problem. It has not been available for years and Numerous products I tried did not work. I received a sample of the Gold Bond Softening cream in the mail and it was almost as good as paquins plus so I&#x27;ve used it now for about five months and I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
    <li> I happened across a sample of this lotion in a magazine several years ago, and it&#x27;s by far absolutely the best hand and body lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried at any price. Even better, it has a very light, totally unnoticeable fragrance, which is a big deal with me.    I have a bottle in the kitchen, both bathrooms, my car, and in my bedroom.    In short, I COULD live without it, but I really, really wouldn&#x27;t want to!</li>
    <li> I was initially put off by the higher price for a lotion, but now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while, I find that it&#x27;s totally worth it.  Not only is it truly effective (better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried), but because it&#x27;s so effective I find you actually use less.  It is a bit heavy when you initially apply it, but like the other reviewer said, it does in fact dissipate quickly and comfortably.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse, diabetic and I have a skin condition known as a type of keratosis. After spending hundreds of dollars on prescription skin creams, and many different types of over the counter cream, I will never use another. God, help me if they ever change the formula. This specific cream, Gold Bonds Ultimate softening cream is the best by far that I have tried. I was amazed at how soft my \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; became and with continued use it has helped immensely. Kudos to Gold Bond for making this cream. It has helped with the over dry, itchy skin that I have been blessed with also.  Thanks Gold Bond.</li>
    <li> After years of several treatments by dermotoloigsts and home remedies to treat a chronic skin problem which I developed after an ankle fracture, I have finally found something that works. Thank you Gold Bond, Gold Bond with Shea butter is it for me!!</li>
    <li> best lotion i never used</li>
    <li> This lotion is A1....I just love it!</li>
    <li> I had itchy low legs for yearsss..i tried all the possible lotions in market ...like Olay, Nivea, Vaseline,Jergins ( dont even remember other names now), but nothing worked. Either I had to take prescribed medication creams or bear with the itching...then I saw this on Amazon with some reviews suggesting to try this. I thought why not... I have been using this for a month now and it have reduced itching to atleast 75-80% less...this really awesome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although each individual have different skin, so this may or may not work for you ...but its surely worth to give a try..I would definitely recomment this to anyone who is suffering with similar issue...</li>
    <li> I get really dry skin in the cold weather, but I have a really sensitive and I cannot handle most smells of lotions. This is seriously the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The scent is nice, it makes my skin so soft, and its not in the slightest bit greasy. I bought it at walmart for for a really good price too. Seriously just love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been a gold bond fan for a while, but this tops everything. And I never write reviews for stuff.</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended to me by a friend and she is soooooo right!  It is the best!  I hope they do not ever decide to dilute this lotion.  Keep all the ingredients just as it is and I&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>
    <li> I have gone through a number of lotions. Some are too oily, others dry out your skin. I have problems with the way most lotions smell. Many of them have an over powering perfumy stench that gives me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It works well for not just everyday use, but it works for adding to hair to combat dry, split ends and as a good massage lotion. The smell is very very mild and is even pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion but the dispenser stops working and you have to take the top off and even then you can&#x27;t get the lotion to come out of the bottle. So about half of the lotion is stuck in the bottle and then it must be thrown away and another bottle has to be opened. The same thing happened with the second bottle. I couldn&#x27;t get the dispenser to continue to work. So I won&#x27;t order this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I use to use Lubriderm, however they changed the formula about a year or so ago.  I picked this up because I had a coupon and quickly feel in love.  It is thick but definitely moisturizes well, and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> I really like the Gold Bond lotion.  It feels much more \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; than Vaseline Intensive Care or Lubriderm.  I don&#x27;t feel like it just disappears and leaves my skin dried out again as soon as it goes on.  It goes on easily, unlike some other lotions, and the softening effect lasts a long time.  No greasy feel either!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and so does my skin. This winter has been so cold and dry, and my skin has reflected that. My hands are usually okay, because I use any hand cream a lot, but nothing has worked on them this year, they were dry to the point of being cracked and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond with Shea Butter to the rescue! My skin drinks it in, it is not greasy or smelly, and the softness lasts all day on my body. I keep it with me at all times so I can freshen-up my hands when needed. Even my nails are doing better because my cuticles are moist now. Thanks Gold Bond for another great product, and thank you Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> Just ok nothing special</li>
    <li> My skin gets dry easily. Gold Bond lotion really helps a lot. My parents also like it. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great lotion, just way too think to get out of the container!  I&#x27;m going to try something different next time.  I love Gold Bond, this one is a &#x27;fit&#x27; for me.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have found in a long time.  I&#x27;m a senior &amp; my skin now wrinkles a lot &amp; this product helps keep the skin smooth &amp; make the wrinkles less visible.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great, leaves my skin soft and it smells good. It is not too greesy like others. Amazon has a good price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Shea butter hand lotion. I wanted a non greasy, healing type, so I gave this one a try. It is all that. It&#x27;s really a nice lotion, but I am not thrilled by the smell. It smells like hay or something like that. It works really well and is soothing and not greasy, but the smell isn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It does do the job though!  :-)</li>
    <li> Use it everyday...very good..not sticky, dries well...</li>
    <li> I recently moved to Florida and naturally am concerned about the constant sun exposure plus, unfortunately, the ageing effect! I researched the most highly rated moisturisers and this came up in the top 5. It is just brilliant! Rich, a brilliant humectant and only 2 applications has completely transformed my dry arms and legs and I can actually feel the water on the surface of my skin a day later. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> The best lotion I ever had. No too harsh for my sensitive skin yet does wonders for dry skin. Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I suffer from a bit of psoriasis, and I&#x27;ve found that the Gold Bond lotions work very well for me.  They&#x27;re very heavy - take a little effort to massage in - but they&#x27;re long lasting and quite soothing.  They&#x27;re also pretty much odorless and don&#x27;t seem to harm clothing, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for those of us who live in dry climates.  Not too greasy like other lotions I have used for dry skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion to help with winter dryness on my hands and legs. It has been perfect. I&#x27;m not sure it is a good weight for the hot summers, but I&#x27;ll use it as long as I can throughout the year.</li>
    <li> I Love Gold Bond and their skin care products! Leaves your skin smooth and non greasy. It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion when my dad had come home from the hospital (my mom had gotten it from the hospital gift shop for him) and I was at their house.  WOW!!! It moisturizes like no other.  I had previously been using a natural brand and also a lot of Lubriderm (which I used to love).  Although Gold Bond is more expensive, it is definitely worth it.      I had originally tried the aloe and really liked it a lot.  Then I tried this softening version with shea and love, love, love it!!  Last week I decided to save a little money and go back to Lubriderm (new kind with shea and coco butters -- smells awesome).  However, my hands were dry as soon as I washed them once.  The Gold Bond stays on throughout the day.  I am switching back to the Gold Bond immediately.  I will keep my other stuff as a backup and for the good smell (kind of like suntan lotion).    I do wish the shea version came in a larger bottle.  Also, it is very difficult to get all of the lotion out of the bottle.  I have an old flip top that fits these bottles. When I get to the point that the pump won&#x27;t get any more from the bottle, I throw on the flip top, store the bottle upside down, and bang the sides (it&#x27;s so thick that it sticks to the sides of the bottle rather than flow down to the bottom).     Love, love, love it, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a great lotion. I even use it on my face during the winter at times when my skin is super dry.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion have used for years.</li>
    <li> This product was ok. A little too thick for my liking and I didn&#x27;t like the smell so I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite lotion</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it works well on my hands and is absorbed quite quickly into the skin so your hands don&#x27;t feel greasy for a long time after applying.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this product . My hands get very dry in the winter. This product is very effective.</li>
    <li> great deal ,a very good lotion ,I use this during winter  really helps the dry skin and itches you get from dry skin in winter ,this stuff stays on longer ,been using this for years</li>
    <li> I am a huge user of lotion and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all (even the expensive ones).  This is now the only lotion I will ever use again.  And honestly, it may be the only lotion that actually works.  At least you will feel like that after you switch.  I put this lotion on my feet and I can feel it for 2-3 days, even after daily showers.  The smell is pleasant and not intrusive.  I have never felt that this lotion is at all greasy.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I am buying this product for the second time from Amazon and for the third time overall. I really like this product as it has worked well for my 50+ year old skin. Not too heavy, absorbs pretty quickly, no strong fragrance and softens my skin. (They will probably discontinue it! haha)</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion! I&#x27;ve tried lots of expensive body lotions, and this is just about the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a nice, slightly-musky smell (very light) and is very emulsifying. I highly recommend this. It&#x27;s all my family uses now.</li>
    <li> While I love the scent of L&#x27;Occitane and other high-priced boutique and department store brands, I do not like their pricing. This product softens and even removes wrinkles (especially on the arms) as well as those other pricey products do and at a fraction of their cost. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. I would buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works wonders! As a nurse I am constantly washing my hands and have found this to be the best lotion to help moisturize them.</li>
    <li> i like all gold bond lotions.  i am the dryest person ever.  gold bond is the only thing that works for me.  but this particular version smells too strong.  like perfume or cologne.  and the smell lingers too long.  maybe i&#x27;ll get used to it eventually.</li>
    <li> I have used many lotions, none that truly work; this lotion so far is the best one I have found for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> We have tried so many things for our little boy&#x27;s eczema, and nothing has helped until now.  This is truly a miracle!</li>
    <li> I have used Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Lotion for years and living in cold country Gold Bond helps keep my hands from being dry and cracked in the winter.  We also live in a dry climate so use it all year round.  It glides on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.  I highly recommend Gold Bond Lotion to keep skin moisturized.  Also a great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years... Keeps my skin healthy and mousturized!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion you can get for yourself. My husband works outside and never used lotion, to greasy, didn&#x27;t like the smell.  I tried so many other brand name lotions in hopes of getting him to use it. Now I have to have a bottle by his side of the bed so he won&#x27;t steal mine. This really is a great product, we use it every day.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this lotion, my skin has gotten incredibly soft and smooth.  It was pretty soft to begin with, but Gold Bond has taken it to the next level, despite these bitter winter months.  It&#x27;s really the only lotion that holds up to the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people think it&#x27;s too \\&quot;greasy.\\&quot;  It might feel a little thick going on, but dissipates after a minute.  More important, the results are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say my significant other is eternally grateful.</li>
    <li> This makes even the rough skin smooth!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Good Stuff</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have ever used in terms of durability and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on like a salve but once you have it on, it is very light.  It is does not leave a greasy feel or the kind of &amp;#34;I need to wash my hands&amp;#34; film.  It stays on a long time too, even after I rinse my hands with water.  I have been using this lotion for 3 years and plan on using it more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY lotions over the years; I have very dry skin; I told my daughter about it and she loves it now too!  I am a breast cancer survivor and the scars from over 10 surgeries (counting complications) get dry and itch; but after many other tries, this one helps me to sleep better and I&#x27;m not scratching in the store when I go shopping!  Thank God for Gold Bond!  It does soften; it smells nice and it&#x27;s not greasy!  The moisture is wonderful as we know our skin needs moisture!  I could do a commercial for Gold Bond &#x27;cause I haven&#x27;t had these wonderful results from ANY other lotion!  I would definitely recommend it!  :)  p.s.  Haven&#x27;t purchased it from Amazon (yet) but I think TWO bottles of 14 oz for around $14 or 16 bucks is a good deal!  :)</li>
    <li> I have dry skin during the winter and this lotion works wonders. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell.</li>
    <li> This is by far he best lotion out there.  It keeps your skin moistarized all day long.  I am in Afghanistan and I have used all kinds of different lotions and this lotion beats them all.</li>
    <li> bought  3 gold bond products  together  and the pump only worked on 1 of them .  I previously purchased  purchased  3 gold bond products at various times and only 2 of the pumps worked .. will not buy again</li>
    <li> This lotion is very thick, and very moisturizing. My only complaint is that when you near the bottom of the bottle, it cannot pump the remaining contents so you have to struggle to use the final eighth or so.</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion I have ever found for winters dry, cracking hands.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Just like the commercial states, &amp;#34;This stuff really works.&amp;#34; This Gold Bond lotion really softens and lasts. The scent is really nice also.</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion while visiting my parents. I was 8 months pregnant with a very itchy, stretching tummy. This lotion is absolutely amazing and lasts almost all day, unlike every other lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried! It is thick going on but not at all greasy. My skin actually felt nourished. But, again, It doesn&#x27;t feel like you have lotion on. It is wonderful. I am sold!</li>
    <li> I have skin like the Sahara Desert all over. This lotion is wonderful at hydrating. I&#x27;ve even been using it on my old face (I&#x27;m 59)...ano break-outs surprisingly. Almost everything makes my face break out.The main ingredients seem to be glycerin, aloe, jojoba oil, and shea butter...NO MINERAL OIL, which is usually the culprit in breakouts. My only complaint is the pump. It shoud be in a squeeze bottle instead because it&#x27;s so thick, a sort of air tunnel forms inside the pump tube. You have to take the top off, and look inside. You&#x27;ll see a perfectly round hollow where the tube was. You have to turn it upside-down on your palm or wack the bottle to get air pressure to move the lotion into that space. I couldn&#x27;t get the pump to work at all when I first got it until I figure this out.</li>
    <li> I have issues in the summer where my hands get very cracked and dry because I spend quite a bit of time in the water. Who would have ever thought that being in the water would dry out your skin! This is the only thing I have found that fixes me. VERY good product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a RN. Nurses was their hands a lot. Not like normal people wash their hands a lot, but like a lot a lot. So when my hands were scaly and starting to resemble a cheap street knockoff alligator purse, I borrowed a squirt of this from a coworker. It couldn&#x27;t have been more magical if unicorns and sparkles emerged from the pump. Not only did it smell lovely and hopefully cover a little of the smell of sweat and various bodily fluids that were no doubt on my scrubs, but it made my hands look totally not like a cold reptilian handbag. My hubby is hooked too. Buy it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really the only one that I use. It is the only lotion I have found that really helps super dry skin from winter. It is also sensitive enough to you on your face. I love this stuff and insist my entire family use it. It also works wonders on my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> I love this so much I buy it in bulk. I can never have enough. Thick and absorbent, great for post shaving.</li>
    <li> I am in the dry Arizona heat and dry skin is an issue.  But with Gold Bond that issue has been eliminated!  It was recommended by a friend so thanks to her for the tip.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.  I have very dry skin, and it keeps my soft and moisturized. Lasts for hours, and I even use it on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I am a dog groomer and my hands are constantly wet and scratched. A lot of perfumed lotions burn the scratches and my hands get wet and wash most lotions off very easy. This lotion dries quickly(no greasy slick feeling) which is good to avoid getting trimmed hair stuckto my hands and not messing up freshly clean pooch coats. It seems to protect your hands once you do get them wet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short of it is: Not greasy, fast drying, protective, hydrates very well. Good for people who need to wash their hands often( my mom&#x27;s a nurse and uses this), gets their hands wet a lot, or just have really dry skin.</li>
    <li> The product has a light scent and absorbs nicely. I&#x27;m using it in some vain attempt to prevent prego stretch marks. It moisturizes very well to prevent itching and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. My only complaint - once you *think* you&#x27;ve used up the whole bottle, don&#x27;t throw it away. There is a TON of product left in the bottom. Really, enough to fill a bottle of hand lotion and maybe then some. The straw in the pump must be way too short. Other than that, this is a great lotion.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I ever used.  You can totally tell a difference over regular lotions...Gold Bond just rules!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion .It is not greasy at all,it goes on so nice and smooth. I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems with this lotion at all.</li>
    <li> Always love Gold Bond.  I fight with dry flaky skin.  Gold Bond goes to work the first use.  Will always use it.  Highly recommend for dry skin sufferers</li>
    <li> This is truly a healing lotion. I have dry itchy skin and when I use this lotion I really do feel a healing affect. The generic versions are not at all the same so don&#x27;t waste your money. The Aloe Vera one does not work as well for my skin. Its the cocoa butter one that really works for me. I wish if was a couple dollars cheaper though but it works.</li>
    <li> All that was expected.</li>
    <li> Dries very fast, leaves no grease on the hands. Works very well. Seriously, this is one of the best softening lotions out there.</li>
    <li> Works well for extremely dry skin</li>
    <li> Fast absorbing, but not as fast as I&#x27;d like and a tad filmy- as in it doesn&#x27;t ALL absorb. Rather, it&#x27;s like a protective shield. So use when you need that shield. Recommended mainly for dry spots and can be used on the body, but not recommended for your face [unless you have a stubborn dry spot].</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever! It&#x27;s not greasy. It rubs in very well and lasts until you&#x27;ve washed it off. It has a light, pleasant scent. If you&#x27;re having issues rubbing it in, it helps to be slightly damp.</li>
    <li> Same great product but I purchased two bottles and both pumps are broken.  Not thrilled about the pump but gold bond is the best moisturizer</li>
