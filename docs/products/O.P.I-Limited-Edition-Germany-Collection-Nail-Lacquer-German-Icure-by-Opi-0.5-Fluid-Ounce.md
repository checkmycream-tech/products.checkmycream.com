      <li>and even then it looked great</li>
      <li>As always, I love OPI polish - it is the best on the  market, IMHO.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal, but if you are unsure of the color you should check a store in person that sells this color before buying.  </li>
      <li>better, my husband must have commented how beautiful my nails were every day of the week</li>
      <li>Great price, nice color, my favorite nailpolish!</li>

      <li>You&#x27;ll love this color!  </li>
      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Great quality polish - smooth application, no bubbles.</li>
      <li>The nail polish was not protected in any way with bubble wrap or any kind of tissue.</li>
      <li>The shipping was prompt and I received it in a nicely packaged box</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a nice polish and goes on well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a nice color and will be great for the fall, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly look like it does in the photo.</li>
      <li>Personally, I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the purple color in the picture, when I opened the box</li>
      <li>the color at the bottom of the bottle picture is closer to reality than the highlighted area towards the top of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Lovely color.</li>
      <li>have no desire to return for refund as it would cost me more and take ore time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely winter color.</li>
      <li>It is used in many salons.</li>
      <li>So make sure you know what color your buying but</li>
      <li>As someone else stated, it&#x27;s way more brown than the image</li>
      <li>I gave this nail polish four out of five stars because I love the way it looks in the bottle, but I haven&#x27;t seen it on my nails yet.</li>
      <li>When I saw this color I fell in love.</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>I had to get a bright light and shine it directly on the bottle to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me.</li>
      <li>This polish has a great rich color with jut the right amount  of opal like glimmer without sparkling too much</li>
      <li>OPI are fantastic nail polishes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a rich burgundy brown with glittery sparkly undertones.  </li>
      <li>OPI is a good brand in general.  </li>
      <li>However, the shade is significantly darker and browner than pictured.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful shade of dark cherry.</li>
      <li>She has bought lots of nail polish online and has a method for determining how true the color is.  </li>
      <li>great quality nail polish none the less.</li>
      <li>OPI is always great quality but the German Icure color is a lot darker than I normally wear.  </li>
      <li>It looks like it would be a nice wine/burgundy color when in fact it&#x27;s quite closer to a darker red.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more brown in reality than in the photo (&amp;#34;German-icure&amp;#34; is the brownish one, &amp;#34;Every Month is Oktoberfest&amp;#34; is the one with more purple).</li>
      <li>It is a pretty color.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a keeper!</li>
      <li>I prefer deep colors, and I love red, so I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>shade went on beautifully, as pretty much all O.P.I polishes do, and in 2 coats I achieved the color on the bottle (the bottle, not the webpage).  </li>
      <li>More brown than purple, German-icure leans more towards a burnt brown/burgundy with a subtle metallic sparkle.</li>
      <li>Love this color - limited edition, so I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
      <li>I quite like this color, although it doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and I appreciate that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice color a very deep red.</li>
      <li>I came across this color at the salon and even though it&#x27;s older, I had to have it for myself.</li>
      <li>Anyways, I highly recommend this product and this color.</li>
      <li>usual, good quality with OPI - doesn&#x27;t fade or peel; stays on long</li>
      <li>When she tried it on, it was a totally different shade (more of a dark brown tone).  </li>
      <li>I had a professional give me a pedicure</li>
      <li>more of a rich dark brown with some serious auburn hues.</li>
      <li>Dries much darker that I expected.</li>
      <li>This shade is just the right shade of dark red to carry me through the Christmas season through Valentines&#x27; Day!</li>

<li> openog my box and taking the polish out, I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> I feel this is a terrible shipping practice.</li>

    <li> Great price, nice color, my favorite nailpolish!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful shade of dark cherry. It looks especially flattering on my toes because I have a dark tattoo on my foot and it compliments the tattoo perfect. OPI makes good quality polish, I get almost 2 weeks of wear on my toes with their polishes. Very happy.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this based on the color shown in pictures.  When she tried it on, it was a totally different shade (more of a dark brown tone).  She has bought lots of nail polish online and has a method for determining how true the color is.  This one failed.</li>
    <li> Love! OPI never lets you down with this color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I love the purple color in the picture, when I opened the box I was so upset that the color I revived was brown/burnt looking with a hint of a redish shimmer. If the company would accommodate me and send the purple  color in the picture, I would give them 5 stars. The shipping was prompt and I received it in a nicely packaged box</li>
    <li> Great quality polish - smooth application, no bubbles. However, the shade is significantly darker and browner than pictured. More brown than purple, German-icure leans more towards a burnt brown/burgundy with a subtle metallic sparkle. Great polish, but not a shade I would wear.</li>
    <li> OPI is always great quality but the German Icure color is a lot darker than I normally wear.  the color at the bottom of the bottle picture is closer to reality than the highlighted area towards the top of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is darker then shown but it&#x27;s OPI so will keep it. It is a pretty color. Delivery was fast and I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I have tried several kinds of nail polish and it does last longer than a lot of other brands. It is used in many salons. I love the color.</li>
    <li> Just a brief word about the color \\&quot;German-icure\\&quot; - the picture on the web page is a little deceiving.  It looks a lot like a dark purple.  In reality it is a very deep red.  Personally, I love it.  I bought this along with \\&quot;Suzi &amp; 7 Dusseldorfs\\&quot; (what is up with these names? LOL).  I can assure you that \\&quot;Suzi &amp; 7 Dusseldorfs\\&quot; is indeed purple, as is \\&quot;Every Month is Oktoberfest\\&quot;. So if you are looking for a shade of purple go with either of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shade went on beautifully, as pretty much all O.P.I polishes do, and in 2 coats I achieved the color on the bottle (the bottle, not the webpage).  I prefer deep colors, and I love red, so I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, my husband must have commented how beautiful my nails were every day of the week I wore it.  Absolutely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Love the color! dark purple/red looks pretty, chipped somewhat quickly but it may have been the base coat that was used.</li>
    <li> can use this color anytime of the year&lt;br /&gt;as usual, good quality with OPI - doesn&#x27;t fade or peel; stays on long</li>
    <li> As always, I love OPI polish - it is the best on the  market, IMHO.  This shade is just the right shade of dark red to carry me through the Christmas season through Valentines&#x27; Day!</li>
    <li> This polish has a great rich color with jut the right amount  of opal like glimmer without sparkling too much</li>
    <li> When I saw this color I fell in love. The photo shows this to be a &amp;#34;rasberry&amp;#34; color.&lt;br /&gt;When I got my package, this nail polish was shipped in a 12 inch by 6 inch box. It has 1 piece of brown paper in it, with the nail polish rolling around onside the box. The nail polish was not protected in any way with bubble wrap or any kind of tissue. I feel this is a terrible shipping practice. Packages are treated roughly during shipment and had this broke, there would have been nail polish everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Upon openog my box and taking the polish out, I was very disappointed. I had to get a bright light and shine it directly on the bottle to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me. This nail polish is a very dark brown red. There is no &amp;#34;raspberry&amp;#34; or purple tone to it at all. Although I have nothing against a brown red color, it was not what I wanted, not even close. I wanted the &amp;#34;raspberry&amp;#34; purple color shown in the photo. Brown Red is in the &amp;#34;Warm&amp;#34; Family and a Raspberry Purple color is in the &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no desire to return for refund as it would cost me more and take ore time then I have to do that.OPI are fantastic nail polishes so I have no problem keeping it. I will keep it and use it at some point, just not when I needed it.&lt;br /&gt;This and the horrible shipping practices of the seller is the only reason I gave this 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review once I polish my nails with this so you can see the actual color.</li>
    <li> I gave this nail polish four out of five stars because I love the way it looks in the bottle, but I haven&#x27;t seen it on my nails yet. One day I will get around to trying it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!!  It&#x27;s a rich burgundy brown with glittery sparkly undertones.  A great fall color that covers the nail well and lasts great!</li>
    <li> Love this color - limited edition, so I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
    <li> I came across this color at the salon and even though it&#x27;s older, I had to have it for myself. It&#x27;s a little more brown in reality than in the photo (&amp;#34;German-icure&amp;#34; is the brownish one, &amp;#34;Every Month is Oktoberfest&amp;#34; is the one with more purple). It&#x27;s perfect! I had a professional give me a pedicure and it lasted over a month and even then it looked great but I got another pedi and my nails had started to grow out quite a bit. Anyways, I highly recommend this product and this color.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll love this color!  I gave it to my discriminating daughter and even she loved it!  I can&#x27;t wait to borrow it!</li>
    <li> OPI is a good brand in general.  My only comment is on the photo of the Germanicure color.  As someone else stated, it&#x27;s way more brown than the image makes it look.  It&#x27;s a deep brownish burgundy that is green or gold sometimes depending on how you look at it.  It&#x27;s a good deal, but if you are unsure of the color you should check a store in person that sells this color before buying.  It&#x27;s still a nice color and will be great for the fall, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly look like it does in the photo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great color, however it&#x27;s more bronze/brown than purple.  Perfect for Fall!  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I quite like this color, although it doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture. It looks like it would be a nice wine/burgundy color when in fact it&#x27;s quite closer to a darker red. It&#x27;s still a nice polish and goes on well.</li>
    <li> Dries much darker that I expected. Not really as purpley as I expected either...more of a rich dark brown with some serious auburn hues. It&#x27;s a lovely winter color.</li>
    <li> OPI, only brand I buy. Lovely color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice color a very deep red. Great for fall and winter. The only thing is I was expecting it to have a hint of plum/purple because now I have two colors that are basically the same. :( So make sure you know what color your buying but great quality nail polish none the less.</li>
