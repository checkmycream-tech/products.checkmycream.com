### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They are the perfect weight in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Ion tops them all with best results both for your hair and money!</li>
      <li>I purchased this product after reading a Consumer Reports review that rated as one of the best and quietest.</li>
      <li>The best hair dryer!</li>
      <li>, its performance is excellent.</li>
      <li>; speed on this dryer is perfect.</li>
      <li>are great as well.</li>
      <li>It still works great.</li>
      <li>It delivers great heat, and dries my hair in a snap.  </li>
      <li>Very nice hair dryer.</li>
      <li>If they make a good product for hair products then they must make a great product in a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>The effective use of this dryer comes from the combination of the three-settings controls for air flow and heat temps!</li>
      <li>The hairdyrer itself was fairly lightweight and balanced.  </li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>This hairdryer does a good job</li>
      <li>Having the option to select ionic or not seemed to be a good choice.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the replacement and would recommend this to others.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle and leaves hair beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Love this dryer!</li>
      <li>For the money this is an excellent product that gives you the control to create styles comparable to a higher priced dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice design and controls.  </li>
      <li>and this is equally as good or better.</li>
      <li>Answers model did a better job smoothing and shine while it lasted than this model.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;d never buy another one</li>
      <li>I stayed with Vidal Sassoon a name brand product in the USA for many years.</li>
      <li>I use it daily great product !</li>
      <li>This dryer is just OK.</li>
      <li>I bought this hair dryer and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>like the fact that it has multi-speeds and heat settings and a cool shot button is always nice if you&#x27;re styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great gentle dryer, but not as powerful as I hoped.</li>
      <li>Price is very good compared to some other units which probably are not any better.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try one of the ionic hairdryers, but since I have fine hair</li>
      <li>For the price I&#x27;m fine with that lifespan.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t really an easy way to clean it out so it just ends up overheating every time I use it.</li>
      <li>So I was excited to find this on AMazon.  </li>
      <li>If the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed had 20% more power, this would be the perfect hair dryer (but I wouldn&#x27;t sacrifice the current &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; speed setting to get the extra power).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this dryer for about 3 years.</li>
      <li>it shot bright white light out of it and is threatening to start a fire.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good buy for the price.</li>
      <li>It does the job adequately although the balance is off.  </li>
      <li>I had both set to the right ions for fine but not extra fine hair.     </li>
      <li>i previously had a vidal sassoon dryer and loved it.</li>
      <li>and I do appreciate that very much.  </li>
      <li>This is my third one and I love them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather spend 5 minutes more every morning on drying than lose the ability to control the final style (which is what happened when I replaced this with a Remington dryer for the month that this one didn&#x27;t work on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>Read online that many others have same problem.  </li>
      <li>Right now, I just keep it on the medium setting, but I do think I&#x27;ll try it off and on high to see if I actually notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing it is supposed to do is reduce static electricity</li>
      <li>Replaced an older Vidal Sassoon which finally wore out after many years</li>
      <li>In Low setting it is fine</li>
      <li>I really like the power shot button.</li>
      <li>Heat adjustments and speed work very well.</li>
      <li>I always keep a spare one of these hair dryers because I like it so much.  </li>
      <li>This is a very functional hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>it seemed to make my hair much softer.  </li>
      <li>(more time spent than I wanted).</li>
      <li>I have used a similar model for several years and really liked it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get extremely hot but hot enough to style your hair and it doesn&#x27;t blow out so fast your hair is blowing straight out.</li>
      <li>i also noticed that the hot setting was hot enough to burn my scalp, but the warm setting wasn&#x27;t intense enough to dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more than a little dubious about this whole Ion thing.</li>
      <li>so I had to get a new one fast...</li>
      <li>Odd in light of others talking about how noisy it is!</li>
      <li>All in all I would recommend this dryer if you are on a budget, since it is a decent price for a dryer.</li>
      <li>The hair dryer does the job, but the high blower speed seems slower than my older VS dryer.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>but once you turn it to high-</li>
      <li>Compared to other hair dryers that costs a lot more and claim professional results, Vidal Sassoon 525 1875W</li>
      <li>Get this one, it&#x27;s worth the extra money!</li>
      <li>the low setting is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all.  </li>
      <li>Hot is too hot and fries my bleached hair, but medium takes FOREVER, which is really obnoxious due to the noise.  </li>
      <li>It gives the right amount of control to allow precision brush work and prevent flyaway strands, but isn&#x27;t so low that it takes forever to style.</li>
      <li>The cost was so low on Amazon and I purchased it right away.</li>
      <li>It stopped working on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and would only work on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; for about a month, then it inexplicably started working perfectly again.</li>
      <li>The other thing I noticed is the end gets real hot.  </li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t say that it necessarily dries my hair any faster or better than other driers that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
      <li>Love the blowdryer, but, very heavy</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really remember how loud my last one was.</li>
      <li>The control of the ions seems to make no difference, and the difference between the non ion and ion dryer isn&#x27;t as much as my old ion dryer.  </li>
      <li>so much I bought a second one for a spare!</li>
      <li>Dries my hair in record time and leaves it soft.</li>
      <li>but it is rather loud.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend (who has really long hair) hates this dryer also, he uses it on hot and it causes all kinds of frizz and takes forever to dry his hair...and he never finishes drying it either because he starts sweating too much.  </li>
      <li>Next I bought the Vidal Sassoon Answers for fine hair less than a year</li>
      <li>See other site for more on this electrical issue ... Be careful!  </li>
      <li>I find that I&#x27;m always using it with the turbo button pushed because the regular high setting is just not enough air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like the different temperature options and low and high speed settings.</li>
      <li>Love the dryers that have that extra turbo shot of air, was hard to find one till finally came across this one!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be too loud, like some have said, but it&#x27;s definitely wimpy on power.</li>
      <li>I am only giving this product 3/5 stars because of how loud it is.</li>
      <li>It is a little quieter and makes a lower pitch noise, but does not blow as strong as my other dryer.</li>
      <li>but I also use a detangler that cuts down on static, so again, I&#x27;m not really sure if the dryer is the hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a decent dryer, but my hair is thick and long and the dryer wasn&#x27;t powerful enough.</li>
      <li>Also, I noticed the dryer left my hair wavy after drying, whereas my previous dryer left my hair straight</li>
      <li>I also noticed that the dryer is top heavy and hard to hold.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find that this is a very loud dryer like other reviews</li>

<li> long and short of it is I&#x27;ll use it</li>
<li> The cool shot button is a little small and awkwardly placed next to another button, but much better than others I have used.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s even low enough to let me round brush my bangs once they&#x27;re 80% dry without leaving me looking like a 12 year old</li>
<li> /&gt;The high speed falls short of other products; it does take me a few minutes longer to get my hair to be 50-60% dry before I switch to low and start sectioning and using my round brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have had this dryer for about 2 years, leave it plugged in.  Every few weeks, it makes a loud vibrating electrical sound, very scary.  I shut it off, reset it and it still works.  Is there a recall on this model? Read online that many others have same problem.  No flames or sparks with the thing as other have had, but plan to replace it pronto.  Went off again this morning and woke me up!  See other site for more on this electrical issue ... Be careful!  [...]</li>
    <li> I had this 1.5 yrs then it died.  Next I bought the Vidal Sassoon Answers for fine hair less than a year it shot bright white light out of it and is threatening to start a fire. Answers model did a better job smoothing and shine while it lasted than this model. I had both set to the right ions for fine but not extra fine hair.     Your hair dryers do not last. Never again. Burned me twice, and the second time was almost an electrical fire burn not a figure of speech anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer and absolutely love it.  It delivers great heat, and dries my hair in a snap.  I like all the different heat and settings and the ion controls are great as well.</li>
    <li> I got this dryer for Christmas 5 years ago and haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it. It still works great. Dries my hair in record time and leaves it soft. Sometimes it isn&#x27;t as shiny as other days but my hair is weird anyways. I am only replacing it now because it over heats because of the lint that gets trapped in the back. There isn&#x27;t really an easy way to clean it out so it just ends up overheating every time I use it. Its not a big deal its just annoying. I don&#x27;t find that this is a very loud dryer like other reviews have mentioned. But then again I have had it for 5 years and I don&#x27;t really remember how loud my last one was. All in all I would recommend this dryer if you are on a budget, since it is a decent price for a dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is what I expected, I like it a lot, I like the color, power, its performance is excellent.</li>
    <li> Nice design and controls.  It just doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power.  It&#x27;s a great gentle dryer, but not as powerful as I hoped.</li>
    <li> For the money this is an excellent product that gives you the control to create styles comparable to a higher priced dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; speed on this dryer is perfect. It gives the right amount of control to allow precision brush work and prevent flyaway strands, but isn&#x27;t so low that it takes forever to style. It&#x27;s even low enough to let me round brush my bangs once they&#x27;re 80% dry without leaving me looking like a 12 year old Pollyanna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high speed falls short of other products; it does take me a few minutes longer to get my hair to be 50-60% dry before I switch to low and start sectioning and using my round brush. In the balancing act between time and precision, I&#x27;ll take precision. I want the option to have a polished style without feeling like I have to flat iron or curl. I&#x27;d rather spend 5 minutes more every morning on drying than lose the ability to control the final style (which is what happened when I replaced this with a Remington dryer for the month that this one didn&#x27;t work on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;). If the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed had 20% more power, this would be the perfect hair dryer (but I wouldn&#x27;t sacrifice the current &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; speed setting to get the extra power).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this dryer for about 3 years. It stopped working on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and would only work on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; for about a month, then it inexplicably started working perfectly again. For the price I&#x27;m fine with that lifespan.</li>
    <li> I am only giving this product 3/5 stars because of how loud it is. In Low setting it is fine but once you turn it to high- Look Out! It is so very loud that it might be damaging to your ears, seriously, having it close to your ears on a daily basis is a concern. I bought this on sale at Target for 16.99 and I will be returning it. My quest for a sufficient Ion Dryer continues. Also, I noticed the dryer left my hair wavy after drying, whereas my previous dryer left my hair straight... I am not sure why or how this would happen, but it something I noticed that I did not like. After using this VS blowdryer I had to bust out the hair straightner (more time spent than I wanted). Anyhow, the dryer works, just not for me. My suggestion is too look elsewhere for a dryer.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try one of the ionic hairdryers, but since I have fine hair I was hesitant about how it would affect my hair.  Having the option to select ionic or not seemed to be a good choice.  The hairdyrer itself was fairly lightweight and balanced.  I did like the ionic drying - it seemed to make my hair much softer.  I did not like the on/off and heat selector buttons...they seemed to get in the way and be much harder to use than the sliding tabs some other dryers have.  I would have gotten used to them though, if the dryer had not overheated and quit on my 3rd use.  Nothing I did would get it to work again; every time I turned it on it overheated within 5 seconds and quit.  So I sent it back and am waiting for one from a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It does the job adequately although the balance is off.  The cool shot button is a little small and awkwardly placed next to another button, but much better than others I have used.</li>
    <li> i previously had a vidal sassoon dryer and loved it. when i decided to upgrade, i chose this dryer. bad idea. it&#x27;s a decent dryer, but my hair is thick and long and the dryer wasn&#x27;t powerful enough. i also noticed that the hot setting was hot enough to burn my scalp, but the warm setting wasn&#x27;t intense enough to dry. i&#x27;m returning this product. it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Someone dropped my hairdryer in the toilet and it was broken so I had to get a new one fast...I picked this one up on sale at Target.  I have been using it for the past year, and I absolutely hate it.  It is SO loud that I can&#x27;t even finish drying my hair because I&#x27;m afraid for my hearing...the low setting is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all.  I end up finishing drying my hair with my flat iron.     Hot is too hot and fries my bleached hair, but medium takes FOREVER, which is really obnoxious due to the noise.  I hate the switches, they&#x27;re hard to use and I don&#x27;t know who would ever decide to put switches like this on a hair dryer.  The control of the ions seems to make no difference, and the difference between the non ion and ion dryer isn&#x27;t as much as my old ion dryer.  Also, the cord is too short.  My boyfriend (who has really long hair) hates this dryer also, he uses it on hot and it causes all kinds of frizz and takes forever to dry his hair...and he never finishes drying it either because he starts sweating too much.  Get this one, it&#x27;s worth the extra money! [[ASIN:B000EPHRO8 Remington D-2009 T Studio Collection Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer]]</li>
    <li> I have used a similar model for several years and really liked it. However, I could not find a replacement locally when it finally quit. So I was excited to find this on AMazon.  I like the adjustable of the power &amp; temperature with this model. It works well with finer, thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer because my previous one was the same brand and although that was purchased at a discount store when my last one quit on me, it lasted at least seven years. I am very pleased with the replacement and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading a Consumer Reports review that rated as one of the best and quietest. It is a little quieter and makes a lower pitch noise, but does not blow as strong as my other dryer.</li>
    <li> This is my third one and I love them.  They are the perfect weight in my hand.  I really like the power shot button.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer does the job, but the high blower speed seems slower than my older VS dryer. I have thick hair about shoulder length and seems to take a lot longer to dryer my hair, I have to hold the turbo boost to get a faster fan speed.  I also noticed that the dryer is top heavy and hard to hold. My hands are not small and I think that a women with small hands would find the hold uncomfortable. The other thing I noticed is the end gets real hot.  Overall I still like the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer does a good job but it is rather loud. I like the different temperature options and low and high speed settings.</li>
    <li> Love the blowdryer, but, very heavy</li>
    <li> I use it daily great product !</li>
    <li> Mine just stopped working. I tried everything to get it back, but it just stays quiet. Odd in light of others talking about how noisy it is!</li>
    <li> This is a very functional hair dryer.  Wouldn&#x27;t say that it necessarily dries my hair any faster or better than other driers that I&#x27;ve had.  But, it&#x27;s good.  And, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair in the air intake and I do appreciate that very much.  Overall, a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> The effective use of this dryer comes from the combination of the three-settings controls for air flow and heat temps!</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer! Easy to handle and leaves hair beautiful.  Compared to other hair dryers that costs a lot more and claim professional results, Vidal Sassoon 525 1875W Ion tops them all with best results both for your hair and money!</li>
    <li> Love this dryer! Doesn&#x27;t get extremely hot but hot enough to style your hair and it doesn&#x27;t blow out so fast your hair is blowing straight out. I like it so much I bought a second one for a spare!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer. Heat adjustments and speed work very well. Not at all noisy at the setting we use which is about medium. Replaced an older Vidal Sassoon which finally wore out after many years and this is equally as good or better. Price is very good compared to some other units which probably are not any better. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I always keep a spare one of these hair dryers because I like it so much.  I never want to be without one should something happen to the current dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is just OK. Like another reviewer, I loved my previous Vidal Sassoon dryer, but this one is disappointing. I don&#x27;t find it to be too loud, like some have said, but it&#x27;s definitely wimpy on power. I find that I&#x27;m always using it with the turbo button pushed because the regular high setting is just not enough air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of other complaints. One is that it&#x27;s too &#x27;fat&#x27;. I have a limited space for a dryer and this one exceeds that. Also, I bought it because the black area on the dryer was said to be rubberized, so it wouldn&#x27;t slip when I had to lay it down on the sink, but it turns out it&#x27;s not rubber, it&#x27;s hard plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it has multi-speeds and heat settings and a cool shot button is always nice if you&#x27;re styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ion setting? I&#x27;m more than a little dubious about this whole Ion thing. It seems a gimmick to me, but I&#x27;ve read varying opinions. Right now, I just keep it on the medium setting, but I do think I&#x27;ll try it off and on high to see if I actually notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing it is supposed to do is reduce static electricity and I&#x27;ve had no static while using it, but I also use a detangler that cuts down on static, so again, I&#x27;m not really sure if the dryer is the hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long and short of it is I&#x27;ll use it, it&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;d never buy another one and I won&#x27;t be sad when it goes belly up and I have to replace it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my sister.  I don&#x27;t use this type myself, but my sister loves it. I happen to like the one that has the comb on it. My sister is still using it.</li>
    <li> I looked at other hair dryers on the internet and Amazon. Read the customers reviews on Amazon and the internet. Some dryers were very high in cost and very expensive and had problems. I stayed with Vidal Sassoon a name brand product in the USA for many years. If they make a good product for hair products then they must make a great product in a hair dryer. The cost was so low on Amazon and I purchased it right away.</li>
    <li> Love the dryers that have that extra turbo shot of air, was hard to find one till finally came across this one!</li>
