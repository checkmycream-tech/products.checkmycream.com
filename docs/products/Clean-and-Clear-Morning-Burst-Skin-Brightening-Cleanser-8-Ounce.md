      <li>My Axe shower gel works better than this in getting my face brighter.</li>
      <li>Ok</li>
      <li>The bursting beads feel good on your face, too, and it leaves you with that tingly feeling you get when you scrub your face really well.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to wash off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;d prefer something with strong beads)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I can easily say the difference it didn&#x27;t clean up throughly.</li>
      <li>I like that it is oil free and does seems to brighten my skin.</li>
      <li>You can notice a cleaner face just after one wash, I recommend this product if you are looking for a great daily wash.</li>

      <li>but so far I love it!</li>
      <li>I totally love the cleanser, it gives that fresh feeling and matte look right after the use.</li>

      <li>I will buy more from the Clean and Clear line!</li>
      <li>The price is also good and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>and I like the fresh lemon smell.</li>
      <li>) I noticed my skin became more sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>This product make me feel fresh</li>
      <li>A special that was going on prompted me to buy the cleanser and get the facial scrub for half off - excellent!</li>
      <li>Who ever said you get what you pay for is right....</li>
      <li>It smells really good, like citrus, but not too sour.  </li>
      <li>description of awake, fresh, clean, clear?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not obsessed with skin care, and don&#x27;t have thousands skin-care items.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to this product and even though I heard it dried the skin I figured with a good moisturizer it wouldn&#x27;t matter..</li>
      <li>It is easy to wash off which is a major plus.</li>
      <li>Other than that highly recommended if you are looking for some good face wash with a kick.</li>
      <li>It smells very sweet at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I probably would recommend something other than this if you are wanting to help reduce acne, but if you are wanting an easy way to to clean oil of your face, this is it.</li>
      <li>and I started using the Clean and Clear Detoxifying Cleanser about 6 months ago, which I thought was a decent cleanser.</li>
      <li>With this cleanser you absolutely have to moisturize.</li>
      <li>It is too gentle</li>
      <li>I wanted something to wake me up and make me look vibrant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it was a decent cleanser</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does dry out my face a little too much, but it&#x27;s nothing that a good moisturiser can&#x27;t fix or getting another product to wash your face</li>
      <li>The cleanser is obviously softer on my skin than the scrub, but both make my skin feel soft and clean after use.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m one to always need a burst in the morning, when I was on the hunt recently for new face products I had to try Clean and Clear Morning Burst.</li>
      <li>After that, the sebum takes over, and your skin returns to normal.</li>
      <li>I normally get Clinique face wash, but this was compared as same/cheaper... with a new baby</li>
      <li>This is a new product for me</li>
      <li>It removes all of the oil from my face, but the oil does come back pretty soon</li>
      <li>The Clean and Clear Detoxifying Cleanser is drying too, but not nearly as much as this one.</li>
      <li>My face felt fine right after I washed it, but within 5 minutes my face was so dry and tight.</li>
      <li>I am in the army and wake up early.</li>
      <li>, I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
      <li>I recently ran out of that cleanser and decided to try this one, mainly because it had lemon in it</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin same as my father and we both tried this product and got different results.</li>

<li> I like this smell, little beads work well too.</li>
<li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s to harsh for girls?</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old woman and obsessed with skin care. I am in the army and wake up early. I wanted something to wake me up and make me look vibrant. This did the trick</li>
    <li> I must admit this product did make my skin feel refreshed and looked really vibrant, but after three days&#x27; use it completely dried out my skin. I must of had a reaction to it, because I&#x27;ve never had dry skin. However, even though I won&#x27;t be buying again for myself, just because it didn&#x27;t work for me, doesn&#x27;t mean I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to do. Although, the brightening effect is sort of a gimmick, it does make the skin look good for 10 min after washing. After that, the sebum takes over, and your skin returns to normal. It is easy to wash off which is a major plus.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to this product and even though I heard it dried the skin I figured with a good moisturizer it wouldn&#x27;t matter..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin same as my father and we both tried this product and got different results. My skin dried out and flaked constantly no matter was lotion, serum or even Vaseline...I tried using it with a combination of several thingsbut nothing worked and I finally just had to toss the bottle..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M dad on the other hand got it from a friend and it cleared his skin up in no time ....even helped with his ingrown hair when it came to his beard and shaving....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s to harsh for girls?</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. I use it every morning and it feels like it wakes me up. you should get it</li>
    <li> I love this product . Have been using it for two Years now, I have sensitive acne prone skin but it never broke me out, it actually treats break outs from other cosmetic . I love it! Will continue to use it! Thank you</li>
    <li> It is a ok cleanser but it didn&#x27;t brighten up the skin as suggested. My Axe shower gel works better than this in getting my face brighter.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser if that&#x27;s your concern - dullness. However, this did clog my pores and it did make me break out. Dullness was never a big concern for me ... I just wanted more of a prominent glow, which it did provide. I&#x27;d recommend, just be careful - but it&#x27;s really cheap, so what do you have to lose ? Trial and error is the best way to go</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not obsessed with skin care, and don&#x27;t have thousands skin-care items. But I love this cleanser, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This is a good cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It helps wake you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It is easy to wash off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) My acne scars are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Drying (depends on your skin type)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Doesn&#x27;t get rid of pimples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It is too gentle (I&#x27;d prefer something with strong beads)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I noticed my skin became more sensitive to the sun. However, it could be anything..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s cheap and good, and I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how well this product works!!</li>
    <li> I totally love the cleanser, it gives that fresh feeling and matte look right after the use. My daughter and I are using it for a while now and would not change it for anything else! The only complain I have that one of the cleansers I ordered came in with broken dispenser and some spill in the bag. Other than that highly recommended if you are looking for some good face wash with a kick.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It made my skin feel smoother and I like the fresh lemon smell. The price is also good and it lasts a long time. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Gets all the make up out ,went back to Neutrogena cream cleanser just for a change but I can easily say the difference it didn&#x27;t clean up throughly.So never going back to any other cleansers.</li>
    <li> This product make me feel fresh but I think is over price I found better price at the store. Ok</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me and I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far I love it! It smells great and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had read good reviews about it before and because it claimed to make my skin look brighter. Yet it didn&#x27;t fulfill either. I&#x27;d say it was a decent cleanser yet my skin is already a bit rosy and this amplified that making my skin look blotchy red every time I washed it. Definitely not what I wanted. I gave it a try. Won&#x27;t buy again. Not recommended for those with already red/rosy skin.</li>
    <li> Who ever said you get what you pay for is right....I normally get Clinique face wash, but this was compared as same/cheaper... with a new baby i wanted to save $$$- lets just say this is not one of the ways.... description of awake, fresh, clean, clear? should read oily, feels dirty, makes you face errupt, dont buy me!</li>
    <li> Removes oil from face &amp; gives you a fresh clean look &amp; feel. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling acne for 16 years and I started using the Clean and Clear Detoxifying Cleanser about 6 months ago, which I thought was a decent cleanser. I recently ran out of that cleanser and decided to try this one, mainly because it had lemon in it and I was hoping it would make my acne scarring less visible. My face felt fine right after I washed it, but within 5 minutes my face was so dry and tight. I have oily/combo skin and I&#x27;d rather not have to moisturize every time I wash my face. With this cleanser you absolutely have to moisturize. The Clean and Clear Detoxifying Cleanser is drying too, but not nearly as much as this one. I&#x27;ll be going back to the Detoxifying Cleanser.</li>
    <li> This soap is great!  It smells really good, like citrus, but not too sour.  It smells very sweet at the same time.  It removes all of the oil from my face, but the oil does come back pretty soon (that&#x27;s my face&#x27;s fault, not the soap).  The bursting beads feel good on your face, too, and it leaves you with that tingly feeling you get when you scrub your face really well.  I would definitely buy this soap again!</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash the smell is great. You can notice a cleaner face just after one wash, I recommend this product if you are looking for a great daily wash.</li>
    <li> Tried many types of face wash and this one is the best, by far. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. Clears up any blemishes and smells amazing! Ever since trying this out, I haven&#x27;t looked back and continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I&#x27;ve been using it on my face because it was covered in acne scars and now they are barley noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry out my face a little too much, but it&#x27;s nothing that a good moisturiser can&#x27;t fix or getting another product to wash your face with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I also use for acne scars is the mother of pearl soap from grisi. It works good and I use that for a day and then switch back to this. Great products, the both of them.</li>
    <li> The face wash is nice but could have been better in terms of cleansing action, the fragrance is very good, and the price/oz is by far the best I have ever purchased !</li>
    <li> I love it! It doesnt cause me break outs, its oil free and its refreshing!!! What else you need?? Its the perfect wake up in the morning for your skin.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m one to always need a burst in the morning, when I was on the hunt recently for new face products I had to try Clean and Clear Morning Burst. A special that was going on prompted me to buy the cleanser and get the facial scrub for half off - excellent! I&#x27;m happy to report that I enjoy both products. They both have caffeine, lemon and papaya , smell great, and seem to work for me. The cleanser is obviously softer on my skin than the scrub, but both make my skin feel soft and clean after use. I also bought the skin brightening line, and I have to say that I truly believe they do that. I&#x27;m very impressed with both these products, and know I will definitely purchase the cleanser again, if not the facial scrub as well. I will buy more from the Clean and Clear line!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works so well</li>
    <li> I like this smell, little beads work well too. I like that it is oil free and does seems to brighten my skin. I use it in the mornings and I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 3 months ago. I haven&#x27;t used it as much, but it is ok. It does get rid of grease and oil on your face and it smells nice, but thats about it. It may just be me, but I have noticed that after I have used it, it dries out my hands. I have never had dry skin on my hands, and I have had it for the past 3 months. I&#x27;m not sure if I would repurchase it, but I still have a lot left. I probably would recommend something other than this if you are wanting to help reduce acne, but if you are wanting an easy way to to clean oil of your face, this is it.</li>
