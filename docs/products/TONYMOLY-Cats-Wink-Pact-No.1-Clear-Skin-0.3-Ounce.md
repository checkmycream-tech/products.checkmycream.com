<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cute packinging, light lovely scent, very mattifying. My only complain is that this product has a very pink undertone, and since my face gets pink when it&#x27;s hot, this just adds more to it and makes my face looks red -,- so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to those with pink undertone skin already. Other than that, it was very lovely to use and it gets the job done. Btw I got this in #1</li>
    <li> It was alright. I admired that this product was clear and therefore goes with every skin tone, but I do not use this product anymore. Just wasn&#x27;t for me. My mom uses it and loves it though! That&#x27;s why I give it a 4/5.</li>
    <li> Ok, I admit...I love Tony Moly and the cute packaging and awesome products! I am pale so this worked great for me. It&#x27;s not to powdery (a concern for my 49 year old skin).  The only negative is that there is a wrapper around the item. When you remove the wrapper, the only detail on the compact is the eyes.  The cute little paws and the stripes between the ears is only on the wrapper.  It is still cute ... But the paws? Lol!  I would definately order again.  Shipping time is a little long. It&#x27;s worth the wait though!</li>
    <li> Super cute and matches my skin tone well.</li>
    <li> The design of this compact is really great!</li>
    <li> Super adorable compact. #1 Clear skin matches my fair skin well. Does look pretty powdery on though, will only be using for mattefying oil later in the day.</li>
    <li> Very cute and works perfectly!!</li>
    <li> This powder is better suited for lighter skin tones. The powder is decent, but can cake easily. The pad even has a light scent of perfume on it. Very cute packaging, and of drugstore quality. Super cute and afforadable.</li>
    <li> I hope this item will be good and worth the money i had to pay. it says free shipping but charged me $22 for some odd reason? never made such a stupid mistake! Angry buyer!!</li>
    <li> Excellent powder, probably my favorite that I&#x27;ve tried.  The only reason I&#x27;ve given it 4 stars is because it arrived broken up into a million little pieces in compact--still useable, but now very messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ll likely buy it again when I use this stuff up.  It does work very well.</li>
    <li> so cute! I live in a humid area, and it&#x27;s nice to have this to carry around instead of the rice paper for blotting I usually use, since moisture seems to collect everywhere this works way better than blotting. Its pretty light when applied but a few pats makes it disappear. I have a light medium skin tone and got the #1, works pretty well on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also its so friggin cute!</li>
    <li> has lasted for a while, i actually bought this for the container and was going to use if for a different powder but when i recieved it, the powder went perfectly with my skin tone (very pale) and worked very well and ended up using anyways. its been a few months and its just now emptying, i bring it to work daily for light makeup touch ups, great product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Korean and wear 23 with other powders, this is too light for me and my daughter actually laughed at me. I put a thin layer on too...I might just give it to one of my paler friends. It&#x27;s cute though.</li>
    <li> This compact smells and looks so nice i have to buy more</li>
    <li> Amazing product works so well on my skin and feels weightless.  Definatly willing to order again  If you have sensitive skin it works great</li>
    <li> Look at the product it&#x27;s shaped like a cat... seriously it doesn&#x27;t get any cuter and bonus the powder is good too. So this is just a awesome product. Since I&#x27;m using it... I say the powder is consistent and I&#x27;m almost 40 and who cares if this is more for a much younger crowd or even a kid. I say if you like something &#x3D; no age limit. This would make a wonderful gift even for yourself. It&#x27;s a cat shaped powder....♥♥</li>
    <li> Love this thing! It is such a cute buy for the price! It&#x27;s absolutely adorable and completely fits with my style. I love the paw print indent in the compact itself and the product even smells great (but, it&#x27;s a very faint smell for those who are worried about the fragrance)! I have very fair skin and this works perfectly over my foundation to help get rid of the shine throughout the day. Very fun buy and will purchase again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be sure how this will work, arrived completely broken! :/</li>
    <li> I used this for midday touch ups when oil is breaking they on my forehead and nose. It mattifies both areas nicely  and lasts the rest of the day without  leaving any powdery finish. And it&#x27;s so cute</li>
    <li> AMAZING! If you are light/fair skinned, the #1 is for you! It&#x27;s perfect, smells great and looks so amazing. I will definitely be ordering this from now on, very happy!</li>
    <li> Love how it covers, and its not too heavy. Love how it doesnt make me break out like other compacts</li>
    <li> A regular powder, got it in shade #1. Matches pretty well (I&#x27;m an NC20-NC25 for reference..)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light powder~ not amazing but it does well to mattify your face, and it&#x27;s not cakey.</li>
    <li> The quality is so much better than powders I&#x27;ve tried here in the US. It doesn&#x27;t look cakey, doesn&#x27;t settle into lines, and keeps my face from looking oily throughout the day. Probably a new HG product for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is beautiful and smells like roses! Every time I take my cute kitty compact from my purse, I hear eclamations and jealous friends ;) Of course, I&#x27;ve told them where to get one! Delightful with nice coverage.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star review is just because the powder has a pink undertone to it and makes me look kind of weird lol</li>
    <li> I gave up on finding a pressed powder that works with my extremely fair skin a long time ago, after trying everything from drugstore to high end brands - nothing was ever light enough, and settled unflatteringly into my pores. I bought this because I wanted the compact (it&#x27;s just as adorable in person as in photos) but the powder is AMAZING. I put a bit on as the last step in my makeup, do a quick retouch in the early afternoon, and my face is set all day. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love it and really well package</li>
    <li> Makes your skin dolly-like! Light and airy. Nice for hot weather!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It works well alone, but I like it on top of my Holika Holika Petit BB cream. When I pair the two my skin looks flawless and it is still light enough not to feel like I am in a torture chamber in the summer. It has a super soft finish and keeps oil under control all day even when it is hot.&lt;br /&gt; I have been looking for something that does all of this for a long time and finally found it. I should have known the perfect product for me would be shaped like a cat.</li>
    <li> I am officially in love, this product doesn&#x27;t seep into your pores or lines like many of the Powders you find in the USA and it is a perfect shade for my pale skin</li>
    <li> So cute!  Great packaging.  Powder quality is very nice. Has a light fragrance, but it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
    <li> I love how fine this powder is, it spreads on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking cakey or flakey like other powder brands and the packaging is so cute. I&#x27;m surprised at how cheap it was for such a good quality product. Love :)</li>
    <li> The powder is not as fine as I expected. But it smells very good and is so cute to look at.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged. Looks really cute, I love it.</li>
    <li> Not so great when my skin is being dry, but fine when I&#x27;m having a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin day. Cute packaging!</li>
    <li> Love this powder. I am moderately pale and #1 is completely invisible on my skin. The compact is very cute and even comes with a little powder puff (although I prefer to use a brush). It is fragrant but only very lightly and the smell is quite nice. This is my new go-to powder. :-)</li>
    <li> This product has a lovely scent and is finely milled.  The puff it comes with is very soft and cute.  However the problem I have with this product is that it tends to coagulate with my makeup and form uneven patches on my face. The puff itself then sticks and collects my makeup and forms a thick cakey layer on the surface which I then have to scrape off and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I want to love this compact so badly,  but for now the best areas to use this is the nose and forehead, combined with a facial mist to minimize the powdery finish.</li>
    <li> Nice transluscent, lightly tinted powder.  Does not break me out.</li>
    <li> Amazing powder! I normally use MAC powder, but because of the cute packaging I thought I would try it and if all else failed I would put in my purse for emergencies. Much to my surprise I absolutely love this product even more then my MAC powder that I usually buy for $30!! I bought #1 and I have pale skin. It blends amazingly and makes my skin appear even toned and glowing! I will be purchasing this product from now on instead of my MAC.</li>
    <li> Very cute container. The powder works very well and stays on your skin throughout the day. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Outside of just being an adorable compact, the powder is very fine, and makes for even, non-shiny coverage. The powder also smells a little rosy, it&#x27;s so cute! the only downside is that the stripes and pink pawprints are only on the outside packaging, and not the compact itself... but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so thick everyone can tell that I&#x27;m wearing powder lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;No thanks</li>
    <li> Fell in love with the casing first but soon I fell in love with the product itself! Made the right decision to buy this press powder, really the best out there.</li>
    <li> Adorable and excellent, really good coverage. This is my new brand!</li>
    <li> smells great, color matches really well, keeps my skin oil free for most of the day.</li>

    <li> So I ordered this on Aug.4 and it got here today Aug.12! The estimated delivery date was Aug.28-Sept 18! I thought it was awesome that it got here earlier! I haven&#x27;t used the product yet (since I just got it) but the compact case is SO cute! Very unique! Also I&#x27;d thought I should mention that my package also came with some samples of different Korean products, which I thought it was neat- I didn&#x27;t expect it! I&#x27;m just rating this product a 3 just because I haven&#x27;t tried thaw product yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pumped to try this and see how this works on my skin since I have very oily,acne prone, and sensitive skin! I&#x27;ll update this post when I use this product.</li>
    <li> i love this; its so adorable and actually a really good powder!&lt;br /&gt;The only problem though; its made for people with more fair skin than dark.&lt;br /&gt;Its sooo matte and perfect, but, just a little too light...&lt;br /&gt;If it came in darker tones, then I&#x27;d give this 6/5!!!!</li>
    <li> Super Cute! I really like TONYMOLY products because they have good quality make-up/accessories and they are so much cuter than buying regular make-up from walmart! The powder inside smells really nice (and has a cute paw print design) and the powder sponge thingy is really soft. Just a warning that clear skin means that its for really light skin!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover up everything. It can only cover up really small pimples but other then that it&#x27;s really soft on your face when you wear it and it look really natural too</li>
    <li> My girlfriend ordered this and really liked it, said it matched her skin perfectly. Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Came right on time, suuuuuuuper cute, light feeling, and smells so good! I have I light to dark medium skin color, depending on the season, and I got the number one clear skin pact, I believe that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called, and it blends right in. Very translucent. It does a wonderful job of keeping your skin feeling clean and not oily. Will buy again :D</li>
    <li> This is so adorable! I was so excited to get it now I am even more excited! Keeps the oils at bay. Did I mention how cute it was???? Oh I love the packaging! I have really sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin! It didn&#x27;t create new acne or break outs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use powders that much but this is perfect! It&#x27;s really great coverage and it&#x27;s not too light or too dark for my skin. Most likely purchasing again. This got to me within two weeks!</li>
    <li> This powder not only works well but it is in the cutest compact ever. Its light and not heavy or cakey and leaves you skin matte for longer than alot of other brands I&#x27;ve used. I have very sensitive skin too ,and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this, or any of the other TonyMoly things I have ordered. I love it all, its good stuff :)</li>
    <li> Love it came true to package so cute !!! Great finishing powder!</li>
    <li> The compact is really cute. I guess I got a tan that is why the compact seems lighter now. I have to stay in doors more for me to be back to the same color as the compact but it&#x27;s inevitable during the summer months here. It does give a smooth finish to your skin and feels light weight. I will probably use this with another one to even out the shade.</li>
    <li> I thought the legs were part of the product: c but despite that I really liked</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite! It&#x27;s really soft and the box is really cute. Every time when I use it, I enjoy a lot &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought this solely for the case but it turns out I really like the powder. It&#x27;s soft and has a very soft, natural scent to it. Didin&#x27;t clog my pores or sit heavy even after multiple touchups. The color of the power itself was pretty fair, maybe a little lighter on than in the picture. It&#x27;s definitely my new go-to powder.</li>
    <li> Great quality! The compact itself is very cute, but the stripes are only on the plastic packaging it comes in. The powder puff is very soft, and distributes the powder well. The powder doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage, but it is very light and makes my skin look nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> i picked the shade number 1 its like i dont even have makeuup on ! its so light and it smells like cherry blossoms!! its the perfect little compact make up ever! I am a tony moly cutomer for life now!</li>
    <li> I chose #1 clear skin, it is a lot lighter than I expected so there would be some color difference so I need to apply to my neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;this powder has a light fruit smell which was very nice. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because of the color. But it is just error on my part.</li>
    <li> A tad pale, but I like it. Smells great too haha. Works great for touch ups through out the day.</li>
    <li> It has a very pleasant aroma that is somewhat reminiscent of baby powder and it isn&#x27;t cakey or porous looking. It gives your face a dolly glow and smoothens it. I was very impressed, because at first I was frightened that it would be too dark for my pale skin tone, but it simply intensifies it in this gorgeous porcelain way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this powder for cosplay, living dolls, special occasions and everyday wear. You&#x27;ll almost forget you&#x27;re wearing it, until you feel how soft your face is.</li>
    <li> I got the clear skin version, and I only suggest it for people with pale skin of course, but if you have oily skin like me it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s small and the packaging is cute so I take it with me everywhere and if my nose or forehead gets oily I just blot with it</li>
    <li> This gets rid of all oil or that greasy feeling bad makeup can sometimes cause. Sometimes I only dab it on my T zone when feeling a bit oily. The pad is extremely soft if you use it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, it&#x27;s supposed to be floral but it&#x27;s on the verge of being old-lady like. The smell goes away after an hour so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> Adorable packaging, great price, and the perfect color for my fair skin tone. Love it!</li>
    <li> This compact is adorable, but its the pressed powder inside that makes it great.  This goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause acne; which is a great change since I have oily and acne prone skin.  I use this pretty much everyday, and I get stopped all the time about it! Its one thing to love a product, and its another when everyone loves it on you! ^.^</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! It doesn&#x27;t highlight any dry or flakey spots and it goes on smoothly with great coverage. However, if you apply too much it might look too white or light, no matter how pale you are. The packaging is also really adorable! Highly recommend ^^</li>
    <li> the powder is just ok, and the case is adorable but my pan fell out after a couple days</li>
    <li> So cute and very functional.</li>
    <li> Honestly I would buy this for the packaging alone. It&#x27;s sooo adorable. I like seeing it on my sink everyday. Also it works as intended.</li>
    <li> This is great powder. I am very pale and it blends flawlessly with my skin tone. It&#x27;s a very fine powder and you can&#x27;t really see the pigments. It&#x27;s also packaged adorably, and it&#x27;s inexpensive, which is always a plus. I&#x27;m a fan. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a week longer than it was supposed to :( that sucked.  Just got it 2 days ago and I&#x27;ve been wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my face :( doesn&#x27;t cover the acne scar on my chin or my dark circles that good. A small part off my right cheek is turning red and my face starts to sting a little after applying :( have to reply alot and it doesn&#x27;t cover much. I live it cause of the cute cat design.  I&#x27;m going to throw the powder out and use the compact as a container/mirror. Eh</li>
    <li> When I received this, the powder was all over the box and there was none in the compact. I salvaged as much as I could and restored the powder with alcohol. The powder is really great! Matches my skin and is smooth, light, and gives a porcelain complexion. I would have gave it 5 stars but the manner in which it arrived has left my slightly indifferent.</li>
    <li> it is very cute. the only losing star is the amount of power is so few..</li>
    <li> I love this compact! The powder is very finely ground and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin at all. Aside from that, I can see why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;#1 Clear Skin&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and create extra breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for shine-control mid-day and evening. Highly recommened.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the cutest compact I&#x27;ve ever laid eyes on.  I have fair skin, w/ occasional acne, and dark under eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased #1 Clear Skin and it&#x27;s perfect!  The powder is light, doesn&#x27;t settle into lines, or cling to any small hairs, and you can build up the coverage over any red spots, extra shine, or under the eyes with a few extra pats.  The case isn&#x27;t cheaply made or easily breakable like a lot of other products that look cute.  This is worth every penny &amp; I will be buying it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how often you will want to use it I suggest ordering it ahead of time. Mine came a full month early but, I still waited 2 weeks.  It also came with a free sample of Nymph Aura Volumer which I have yet to had a reason to try.  It was also really well packaged! There was no way it was going to break on the way to my house. :)</li>
    <li> TOTALLY amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, goes on very sheer and barely feels like I&#x27;m wearing anything at all while providing the most lovely matte effect I&#x27;ve ever had the joy of experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it to set my bb cream for the summer, but after experimenting, it provides a nice light coverage on it&#x27;s own and would also be suitable for setting foundation in the fall and winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE, and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from people whenever I pull it out to check something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order again when I run out. Easily a new staple in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> best compact powder i have used so far. pressed powder leaves a nice oil free finish and sets the foundation in really well</li>
    <li> cute packaging and the powder is light and sheer very nice :3c</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product because the compact is so very cute.  The problem is I have extra pale skin, and I mean I generally wear the lightest color foundation available in every brand.  I ordered this color because the next color up has a yellow tint to it and that washes me out.  This color has a pink undertone, but the powder is almost WHITE on my skin.  And this is coming from a girl who feels casper the friendly ghost has more pigment in his skin.  I will say it glides on super smooth and the puff is extra soft which makes applying it very nice.  It seems to cover well enough and doesn&#x27;t appear to cause break outs so far.  I will test it again tomorrow to see if my skin gets upset and update accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product, but unless it does some magic wonders for my skin then I won&#x27;t be rebuying it.  You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the item is adorable, but with the colors being so different and not knowing which one too choose, it&#x27;s too much of a gamble.</li>
    <li> This dries my skin so bad.</li>
    <li> The compact is as cute as the picture and but the color is definitely light. I seem have a light to medium tone on my face. But the compact is nice to powder your nose with!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff though it feels a little drying. I&#x27;ve been told how radiant I look when usingn it on top of bob cream. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Love this powder, good quality and of course super cute. I was expecting thin cheap plastic but the compact is a nice thicker plastic.</li>
    <li> Adorable packaging and the powder leaves your foundation matte and doll-like.</li>
    <li> I think the packaging is really cute.  However, the product is extremely light.  I can understand with this being an Asian beauty brand, that darker skin tones are not really a consideration.  I cannot say if it controls shine or not, b/c I immediately took it off of my face when I saw how light it was.</li>
    <li> Really good product : cute, smells good and efficient. I do not have an asian skin neither a perfect one but this product suits me. I want to use it mostly on my T-zone and it is fine because it is translucent (no &amp;#34;geisha effect&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived 10 days after I ordered, well packed with two samples.</li>
    <li> It is great soft and great I love the shape and it smells nice I high recommend it</li>
    <li> Love the adorable compact, and the powder is very versatile and feels nice too. It is definitely for pale complexions,  I can only use it during the months in not outside much. Good product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this. It gives my face a porcelain effect when paired with my Clinique bb. Other powders make me lookolder and overpowdered, not this!!  Just purchased 2 more!!&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this foundation I wish they sold cute things like this in America. I highly recommend this, I have acne prone skin and I have no problems with this :) and It is super cute</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product, clean and not heavy, will order again when she runs out, has used other products from this&lt;br /&gt;vendor, loves them...;)</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter and she loved it. She recommends it, and the container is so sweet and cute, very femenine. Will buy it again for sure. Thanks!.</li>
    <li> The package is so cute and the powder is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already bought 2 more since this one! I love it! It&#x27;s kawaii and it works! It also helps deathly pale people like me.</li>
    <li> Packaging is so cute!! Definitely as described and came when expected. Was nice sealed and carefully packed. The color is great for my skin but it does smell a bit flowery and also makes my skin feel dry. It would be great to use when your skin is really oily. Not sure if it&#x27;s non comodogenic though because nothing on it is in English. Overall I&#x27;m pleased. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Doesnt cover up oily skin, it is light though</li>
    <li> In Love With This Will Buy More When Gone! It&#x27;s Going To Be My Main Makeup Love!</li>
    <li> Very sheer translucent and light powder. Packs on nicely and the packaging is absolutely as cute as can be.</li>
    <li> I got this because it looked adorable. It turned out to be smaller than I thought. I&#x27;m used to compacts as big or slightly bigger than the palm of my hand and this was slightly smaller than the palm of my hand.  With a little mirror and small powder pad I can only describe it as dainty. The powder is nice and light colored (I got the clear as I&#x27;m already pale), it has a nice smell and covers my skin well. For the price I can&#x27;t complain and will consider reorder.</li>
    <li> Absolutely super powder, very soft....with adorable puff and packaging!  Love it!  Doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.  Just wish it had sunscreen in it! Packaging is so fun to open and look at!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Blends in nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this product, will buy again</li>
    <li> Best powder I have ever used. I have EXTREMELY fair skin and 01 is perfect.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product I ordered it and was eager to try it. I was not let down one bit. My skin is very pale and the powders here in the US never blend well but this clear skin compact works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is the cutest powder compact.  The product has excellent coverage.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was a cute compact thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t really like or use the powder inside. I was totally wrong, the powder is amazing! Its light and airy with a nice scent that not overpowering or overwhelming but really enjoyful. I really love this product and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all my friends! I dont even use foundation or any other powder product.If you struggling whether or not to get this, STOP! AND JUST BUY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT!!! (for pale skin only)</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and as expected.  OMG, it is so cute and my daughter &amp; I love it.  The compact has a light smell but it smells really and does not bother me.  You have a young teenager that wants to start wearing makeup this is a good compact to start them with.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to ship. Very cute but difficult to get open. The powder has a very nice coverage though which I like, great for when I need to put under my eyes if mascara smudges</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so stinking cute and smells like happiness!!!!!!!! It has good coverage and blends well. I got the clear skin #1 and it&#x27;s really pale, but so am I so it works. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone who has really tan skin because although it it translucent looking I put some on my friend whose pretty tan and it looked like she had a film over her skin, it didn&#x27;t look bad but her normal shade that&#x27;s darker looked better, but overall this product is AMAZING! Shipping was quick and the product arrived safe. I&#x27;m very happy and would recommend this product to anyone :)</li>
    <li> Love  this powder! Sensitive and fair skinned. This powder provides a nice light coverage for me, not heavy, does not irritate or make my skin itch like with other brands I have used. Compact is super cute I adore it, its always with me in my purse. I usually put this on after I have applied sunscreen and it handles that well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect color, smells great, looks cute, and I got a free sample of a rather expensive anti-aging cream.</li>
    <li> I found that it sets my foundation very nicely, and works well with my fair complexion (#1 Clear Skin).  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it caking, moving, or being apparent on my face (even in hot + humid weather), and it&#x27;s kind of cute.</li>
    <li> It matches my skin ok and keeps the oil shine at bay. It can look a little chalky even with a very light application though.</li>
    <li> i just got it today the box was like omg destroyed but i blame the shipping company but product was in-tacked. and super cute worth the buy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review in faith that the product works well. I bought this after seeing it on tumblr and decided that I could use it anyways. I&#x27;m going to be using it in conjunction with the TONYMOLY BB cream. It&#x27;s very cute and has very nice packaging. It arrived wrapped in bubble wrap with cute little samples included! Definitely buying again from this store.</li>
    <li> ...and that&#x27;s saying A LOT. I have been using this compact for several weeks, now. The powder goes on super light, but it has amazing coverage and looks very natural. My skin feels fresh and clear after I apply it. I&#x27;ve forgone using the applicator the compact comes with and instead use a makeup brush, which I think makes it go on even better. Overall, I would say that this is far superior to any other pressed (or even loose!) powder I&#x27;ve ever used. This is the first thing I&#x27;ve purchased from the TONYMOLY brand, and I am extremely impressed. I would definitely purchase this item again (and probably will).</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this because of the cute container and it is cracked. Not happy. I would like to receive a new one that isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Its so soft and it looks natural. Would totally buy again. I got it in clear skin</li>
    <li> Very cute compact and the makeup is awesome. I generally apply a thin layer of BB cream, let that set for 3-5 min and them apply this over the top for the perfect amount of coverage. I have VERY fair sensitive skin and the color if perfect on me</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea of this cute little kitty pact, but it&#x27;s just far too yellow and dark for my pale skin. I&#x27;m keeping it as a mirror though, just because it&#x27;s so darn cute.</li>
    <li> Very good powder. The packaging is beyond adorable and the product itself is high quality. I purchased the clear skin pact. The puff that comes with the compact is not the best to use with the product in my opinion. A fluffy brush works nicer. My skin is oily/dry so it works perfectly on my T-zone. Overall it is a cute product that actually works!</li>
    <li> Very cute case! I always get compliments. I take it everywhere with me, as it is somewhat translucent on my skin tone and goes well over existing makeup to touch up your face throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Adorable packaging! The product itself offers great coverage, but does not come with a ton of product.</li>
    <li> This was so perfect! It made my skin look and feel smooth. My boyfriend loved it and i love how cute and adorable it is~ ill definently keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> Best face powder I have ever used. My mom asked where I got it since it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever used. She was shocked when I told her how cheap it was. This is the only powder I use now, it&#x27;s just stunning. My skin is also very pale and no problems.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous.  Use the puff to pat on oily areas such as the nose and forehead.  Then, use a fluffy brush to take off excess.  Smells great, lasts for hours and looks very natural.  Also, who could resist such a cute compact?</li>
    <li> The packaging on this is super adorable!  For a little after application this product also works well and is a nice translucent colour.  However, the oil control isn&#x27;t the best and needs to be reapplied a bit frequently for my liking.</li>
    <li> So cute and powder is wearable!!! Keeps my oil controlled and I think it keeps my makeup wear a little longer!? I only used it for a day, loved it thus far. Might order more in near future. :)</li>
    <li> tried this powder this morning and noticed the color is not right for me. But I love the design of the case, will proly not use the powder, but just keep the case as a keepsake</li>
    <li> Adorable packaging (pretty much the whole reason I bought it), but the powder is too powdery... if that makes sense. It looks very obvious there is makeup on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is so cute and kitten like- you need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this at one point was marketed like a compact bb powder, but i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just a blotting powder, Like those a MAC. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, not much, if any, coverage, but you look cute as hell when you pull it out to eliminate shiny face syndrome, and all the ladies that see you pull this out, will ask, &amp;#34;Where&#x27;d you get that?!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> cute and smells good.</li>
    <li> This powder is amazing :3 It gives the face a very matte and dolly like complexion! This is going to become part of my everyday makeup for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to use a maybelline fit me powder and it was okay but this TONYMOLY cats wink stuff is like 100x better. i mean I don&#x27;t get clogged pores or any acne from using it (I have sensitive skin and it has a good smell (very faint).the packaging is so adorable i didn&#x27;t want to use it. The puff it comes with is also pretty high quality and nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Nice light powder,  matches my complexion very well.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to clump or look flaky when used properly.  Also,  how can you dislike that little kitty face?</li>
    <li> I personally think this powder is worth 4 stars. I feel that my skin doesnt stay completely oil free. I don&#x27;t have extremely oily skin in the first place but do tend to get oily in my t-zone. I do like this powder overall. It is also very compact and has cute packaging. Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Came quickly than expected. Overall happy witht he purchase it is very cute plus had two free beauty samples. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Received this smashed &amp; broken! Had to throw it out as it was completely destroyed. Wasted money</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful little compact! As effective as it is adorable. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the cutest makeup product ever! I could not stop staring at it when it arrived ^-^ Also it smells wonderful and matches my skin tone perfect! It&#x27;s hard to find makeup to match me since I&#x27;m pretty pale, but this was amazing. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It was unfortunately too light for me, but it was soooo smooth and easy to apply. Some of the detail is on the plastic and not the case itself, but still pretty cute</li>
    <li> Cute but nothing too special.  Goes on nice and lightly, though.</li>
    <li> I got the #1 pact and it&#x27;s perfect. Very light coverage but with my BB cream it makes my skin look like porcelain. I am extremely (read half a step from undead) pale and this is awesome! Smells kind of fruity too!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend who loves cats. She&#x27;s not big into makeup, so the fact it is translucent is a plus! The plastic packaging that has the paws and says &amp;#34;Cats Wink&amp;#34; was super scratched and made it look a little cheap when I presented it to her. The product itself was unscratched and whole though once you take it off.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. It&#x27;s nice and light for my pale skin, and it provides some extra coverage on top of foundation.</li>
    <li> I have received several compliments on my complexion since I started using this product--something no one has ever complimented me on before! So I&#x27;m a big fan. I&#x27;m very pale and the color is perfect for me, although it&#x27;s sheer enough that I imagine it could work for a variety of skin tones. There&#x27;s a slightly pinkish tinge to it, which I think is responsible for the compliments--it helps my pale skin look radiant instead of pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, sensitive skin. I wear this over my CC cream and it really helps with shine, but is not so matte that it looks like makeup. It also hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m really pleased! As a bonus, the packaging is adorable and the price is right--if it continues to be available on Amazon, I will continue to purchase this powder instead of my usual Clinique. Feels good to look good and save money at the same time!</li>
    <li> Has a nice light smell to it~ Very soft and can make your skin look naturally smooth</li>
    <li> I needed a light powder to carry with me in my purse.  I live in South Florida and often need to touch up my powder mid-day.  I mostly chose this for the adorable packaging,  but I absolutely love this powder.  It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.  I would say it provides neither a matte or shimmer finish.  It is nearly invisible and sets my makeup beautifully.  It also does not settle into pores or fine lines which is a huge plus.  It&#x27;s almost like adding a soft focus filter to your face.</li>
    <li> I love this powder! The packaging is so so cute. The pad it comes with is really nice to use, I love it. The shade #1 is perfect for a fairly pale person like me. The powder itself is amazing. My makeup instantly becomes matte and it has enough coverage where I can wear ti by itself if I don&#x27;t want to put on some bb cream. It also smells floral, but the scent is very very faint. Overall, this product is fantastic and I&#x27;ll be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> I bought this product solely for the packaging and was pleasantly surprised to love the product as well.  The puff inside is very soft and great for gentle light coverage.  The powder is very fine and light and great for matifying oily spots on your face. It has a clean fresh aroma that is very light and almost unnoticeable. I keep this in my bag for touchups throughout the day and the mirror inside is handy for lipstick touchups as well!</li>
    <li> I admit I originally just bought this product because of how cute it was but once I started using it it&#x27;s seriously the best! First thing I noticed is it smells so good! It smells clean and fresh without a horrible perfume smell. It&#x27;s a tiny bit smaller than what I expected but a little goes such a long way so it lasts a very long time! It&#x27;s seriously one of my new favorite powders and it always leaves my face with a beautiful soft matte finish. Another thing is this power feels soo light (sometimes I forget i&#x27;m wearing any powder at all it feels so light and comfortable!) but still has amazing coverage. It&#x27;s kind of amazing! On top of that it arrived very quickly and I am just so happy with this purchase! I&#x27;d totally recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This is such a cute product, which is the reason I ordered it to be honest. Shipping for this seller has been much quicker than anticipated. Product has a light fragrance to it, just so people know. It&#x27;s a really good, light translucent powder and isn&#x27;t thick at all. It&#x27;s thinner than mineral veil from Bare Minerals for those of you who are familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really velvety. The compact is a bit smaller than I expected which was kind of a let down, but it isn&#x27;t super tiny. That would be my only complaint. I would purchase again. I&#x27;ve been buying a lot of Tony Moly products to try and so far I love all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder has to be reapplied just as often as other good quality powders. Every 4 hours or so a little blot. No blotchy finish over BB cream.</li>
    <li> The color of shade one is a bit pink undertone which is not bad but on a more golden tone skin it can look a bit off. Other than that the product has a floral smell which i like and its cute packaging!</li>
    <li> Other than being absolutely adorable, this works like none other! It puts all the other powders I&#x27;ve tried to shame. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this doesnt do anything to me. Like I&#x27;ve applied it to my face several times now. I can&#x27;t tell the difference of when I have it on.</li>
    <li> I was very curious about this product due mostly to the packaging. Its so adorable! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I love how matte it makes my skin look. I have sensitive/combination skin (dry on my cheeks but oily everywhere else) and this did not upset my skin. I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> excellent! I will buy it again and again!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out like some other pressed powders do, and with this makeup lasts nearly all day!</li>
    <li> So cute! and the color is decent as well, I worry since I have very pale skin and its so hard to find anything that looks natural this should work just fine in the summer.</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage and was pleasantly surprised by the sweet fruity smell it has!! Kind of like peach. This helps with oil control and doesn&#x27;t break me out ever. It is so cute and convenient and came very quickly! Wonderful purchase I will make again.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this. Who doesn&#x27;t love a cute kitty face? I still use it for the mirror, but I should have researched more before buying. This powder contains talc which makes me sneeze and itch. (also some consider a cancer risk)</li>
    <li> I like the design and product. Good.</li>
    <li> Nice lightweight powder. The lightest shade really brightens my complexion (I&#x27;m NW20). It could look over powdery if you use the puff, but a quick spritz of a setting spray or water solves that. Really nice dolly finish, would repurchase  again and super cute.</li>
    <li> not spectacular, its average. It also causes dry spots on my skin. I&#x27;d reccomend this product to someone with more oily skin rather than some one with dry skin, also it smells like lemon wafers which is nice.</li>
    <li> I love this powder.  And I really cannot complain very much about many of the face powders available from South Korea either...though, this is my favorite :)  Pretty much every face powder available in the U.S. tends to be very thick and heavy feeling or is just overly cakey looking.  Not to mention that they all, regardless of whether they claim not to, settle into any fine line, wrinkles, and expression lines...like smile lines or forehead wrinkles(no matter what your age is, too!).  This particular product has a nice natural color (I use #1..and I am SUPER fair), and it has wonderful coverage that can be build-able to cover either any acne you may be battling or to cover those horrible dark circles that you can get(to cover any dark under-eye circles that I sometimes get, I just pat the powder puff under my eyes instead of wiping it on).  Bottom line is, it&#x27;s great stuff, and the smell is hardly even there, and it is pleasant.  I would suggest, however, as much as I love ordering from South Korea and supporting them, to order from a seller in the U.S. if you live in the U.S., because you will be waiting for about a month to receive this item...unless you want to pay the extra $20-$25 for 3 day shipping.  I wear makeup every day, so I typically use 2 of these per month.  So, plan for how many you may need based on your personal makeup wearing habits.  I hope you like this products as much as I do!  And the compact looks like a cute little kitty cat, too &#x3D;^.^&#x3D;</li>
