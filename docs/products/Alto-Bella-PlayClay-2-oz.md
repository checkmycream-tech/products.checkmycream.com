    <li> I love Play Clay and have been buying it from my local salon for years.  Recently, I have found it much more difficult to find, but I have tried other waxes and pomades.

The jar is only 2 oz. but honestly it&#x27;s plenty because you hardly have to use much, it&#x27;s really potent :)</li>
