      <li>so the seller is pretty good.</li>
      <li>It smells clean, just like the shea butter!</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>i get so many compliments on how clean i smell.  </li>
      <li>an youll be fine</li>
      <li>then those perfect little bars</li>
      <li>The shea butter came in a sealed durable plastic, however this huge block came in ceran wrap material.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for an overall body wash &amp; face wash.</li>
      <li>Oh my gosh, it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
      <li>Overall great soap.</li>
      <li>Much more effective than commercial \\&quot;oil</li>
      <li>I walk away feeling clean and have no skin problems.</li>
      <li>My skin had a very nice glow all day long.  </li>
      <li>the product on the other hand, not so great.</li>
      <li>The wrapping was decent but could have been better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a fresh, clean smell, not artificially scented.  </li>
      <li>But now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that problem anymore because the black soap &amp; Shea butter work perfect on my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>To be fair: I do have sensitive skin, and I am about as white as they come, so if you also fit that description, beware.</li>
      <li>Be sure you suds the soap in your hand and DO NOT RUB THE SOAP directly on your body.</li>
      <li>so it worth it.</li>
      <li>they can&#x27;t believe how much it lathers and then rinses so clean leaving the skin squeaky and fresh.  </li>
      <li>It also has very large &#x27;pebbles&#x27; in it.</li>
      <li>the first time i ordered 1lb.  </li>
      <li>, it lathers all the same, so I&#x27;ll keep it :)</li>
      <li>so i use jojoba oil after bathing and my skin is so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>just love the way it leaves my entire body skin.</li>
      <li>What I love most is that it does not have a harsh perfumed smell!!</li>
      <li>the soap came well packaged and in one large chunk.  </li>
      <li>I used it for a month straight.</li>
      <li>I have really course curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have saved so much money since I stopped using Department Stores Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I bought the 5lb and it is so much</li>
      <li>I did not care much for the way it was packaged.</li>
      <li>The gentleman who answered the phone was very patient and informative.  </li>
      <li>Now she wants to buy some.  </li>
      <li>so that lets me know that where ever they&#x27;re getting their batch (even if it is straight from Ghana), to me any way is a lil iffy.</li>
      <li>that is way to long for a strong pure soap.</li>
      <li>African Black Soap is excellent for dry skin care.  </li>
      <li>It lathers well and works like regular soap, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate and leave you squeaky clean, which I prefer.  </li>
      <li>If you want a natural soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, this is for you :)</li>
      <li>exactly what it says i just been using it for two days now an see my complextion clearing an as far as the marks</li>
      <li>This is authentic black soap from Ghana, indeed.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased when I received my package of black soap.</li>
      <li>I can still have plenty months away at least for the next year lol.</li>
      <li>Pay a little more and get the better quality black soap sold my others on Amazon.</li>
      <li>the soap smells wsy better than some of these other natural soaps,it cleans an does</li>
      <li>I love this soap because I notice it don&#x27;t burn sensitive area around the body as much as the other natural or unnatural soaps dose</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing the Dudu-Osun and found that because this soap lathers so well and because its natural, I go through it much faster</li>
      <li>then my face just looks normal.</li>
      <li>I love Halal Everyday.  </li>
      <li>My cousin and I both took small shavings of the black soap and were amazed at how easily this stuff lathers!!!</li>
      <li>The soap lathers really well, is soft, and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>First time from this site and it worked out well, outside of shipping cost..</li>
      <li>I just put a little on my hair, about a quarter size and it detangles just fine.</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I will have this soap until I&#x27;m 95 years old.  </li>
      <li>It works on baby excema and adult skin issues.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this product along with the Raw Unrefined 5lbs of Shea butter one week earlier than estimated. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and try this product. I did not care much for the way it was packaged. The shea butter came in a sealed durable plastic, however this huge block came in ceran wrap material. Because it is so soft I suggest using the same packaging as the shea butter (5 lb). But this doesnt affect my actual review score of the product. The wrapping was decent but could have been better. My cousin and I both took small shavings of the black soap and were amazed at how easily this stuff lathers!!! What I love most is that it does not have a harsh perfumed smell!! It smells clean, just like the shea butter! Although my cousin and I were testing the products latherability (lol) I couldnt resist washing my face with it. I like that my face and hands did not dry out. I await to see what it does to my acne prone skin. I absolutley LOVE it and will be ordering again. I think this stuff will at LEAST last me one year if its lathering like this in such small amounts!!</li>
    <li> I needed something for my face that was NON irritating and would help with adult acne. I LOVE THIS! It is my second order. Be sure you suds the soap in your hand and DO NOT RUB THE SOAP directly on your body. It has rough pieces in it and they will scratch your face. The rough peices simply disolve when you suds them. I USE THIS EVERY DAY ALL OVER I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love Halal Everyday.  This company has great customer service and great products.  I called to ask a question about my order and was given loads of information about the products I wanted to purchase.  The gentleman who answered the phone was very patient and informative.  My product was delivered in excellent condition and delivered promptly.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until Monday...but it arrived on Saturday and I was pleasantly surprised.  The Raw African Black Soap is a very luxurious soap.  I love the way my face feels after using it.  I also took a shower with it.  My skin had a very nice glow all day long.  I broke a piece off and gave it to a friend.  She said she had intended to take a shower but once she saw how the soap lathered up...she decided to pamper herself and take a bath in it.  Now she wants to buy some.  This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a looonnnng time!  If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this soap...please get it from HalalEveryday...it&#x27;s a great company,  that has great products!</li>
    <li> My soap had rocks and hair in it (animal or human I can&#x27;t tell). Perhaps that&#x27;s acceptable in Ghana... but not where I&#x27;m from!</li>
    <li> After first discovering the beneficial qualities of black soap, I have been a user ever since. I would recommend this to anyone, whether you suffer from skin problems or not. I tell everyone I know what I use on my skin, and I am always getting compliments, even though I am over 40. Going natural is the best thing you can do, because avoiding chemicals and unnatural ingredients is healthier for your skin. You must understand that your skin is the largest organ on your body and whatever it breathes and absorbs affects your overall health. Do the right thing and start using raw african black soap from Ghana!</li>
    <li> It was just what I expected</li>
    <li> I will have this soap until I&#x27;m 95 years old.  Share with friends and family.  It works on baby excema and adult skin issues.  Be careful not to get in babies&#x27; eyes, ouch!!!  The smell is bad, but you will get used to it quickly.  In the moist bathroom, the soap seems to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; so keep it in a tupperware container.  You will be happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing the Dudu-Osun and found that because this soap lathers so well and because its natural, I go through it much faster (I use it as my regular soap and use it as a face cleanser). I decided to purchase the 5lbs of raw soap so that it could last me a lot longer (hopefully). Although it looks a lot different then those perfect little bars, it lathers all the same, so I&#x27;ll keep it :)</li>
    <li> the only time this soap will dry out your face is if you leave it on yoir face too long just leave on for a couple seconds an youll be fine the soap smells wsy better than some of these other natural soaps,it cleans an does exactly what it says i just been using it for two days now an see my complextion clearing an as far as the marks im sure they will go away once my face gets use to the soap ,i will be buying again. my boyfriend loves it as well he was complainig about dryness but thats because we just ordered the shea butter until thats comes we just use black soap but he left his soap on his face until he was done brushin his teeth  that is way to long for a strong pure soap. i only lathered up soap on face let it siy for a couple seconds an i washed  it off an becaise of this there was no drying now as far as the customer that complained about red spots im lite too but those spots go away its becaise the strongness of the soap an how long its being left on but trust me it will all go away if not rite away within weeks ..</li>
    <li> the seller was really great in communicating with me and letting me know what&#x27;s going on and they did their best in sending me another batch and returning the not so good soap. so the seller is pretty good. the product on the other hand, not so great. it still wasn&#x27;t to my liking/expectations. so that lets me know that where ever they&#x27;re getting their batch (even if it is straight from Ghana), to me any way is a lil iffy. so i&#x27;ll just order somewhere else. nonetheless SmellGood got nice people working there.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It cleans well with no residue.  And it does not dry your skin out.  I did not like that the photo makes you think the entire block is 5 lbs and that is what you will get.  I did get 5 lbs but it was a portion of the block shown.  I got what I paid for but somehow I felt I was deceived.  I am a very visual person.  I think if you show a photo, it should actually represent what you are buying.  It is a small matter considering I did get 5 lbs of soap and it is really good soap.  It arrived very quickly.  Just hate the photo \\&quot;deception\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a black soap user for several years now and usually buy my soap from Street vendors whenever &#x27;m in the city, where I can see the product up close and save on the shipping fee.  First time from this site and it worked out well, outside of shipping cost..</li>
    <li> I love this soap because I notice it don&#x27;t burn sensitive area around the body as much as the other natural or unnatural soaps dose and this soap is not only natural but it heals my body..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they put lots of barks and other healing ingredient in this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is the only soap that is natural, healing and RAW! so you will had to put it in the refrigerator for it want turn rancid..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that is the only inconvenience but it proves to me that the product is raw also this is the only raw soap with healing elements in them so it worth it.</li>
    <li> this is my third purchase of this African black soap.  the first time i ordered 1lb.  the second time i ordered it was 3lbs.  this time i ordered 5lbs because i use this soap everyday.  i shower with it and even use it to wash my hair.  i get so many compliments on how clean i smell.  it&#x27;s a fresh, clean smell, not artificially scented.  it can be somewhat drying in the winter so i use jojoba oil after bathing and my skin is so soft and smooth.  the soap came well packaged and in one large chunk.  i slice off a square and keep it in a covered soapdish.  you should keep it covered or it will melt in the shower.  you should also store the unused soap in a zipper type bag because humidity will cause it to get soft.  i hope this soap will last me a long time because i am always cutting of pieces to give to family and friends.  they can&#x27;t believe how much it lathers and then rinses so clean leaving the skin squeaky and fresh.  this soap is also great for acne.  this will be my forever soap as long as the women of Ghana continue to make it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Raw African Black Soap &amp; the Raw Unrefined Shea Butter Grade A from Ghana 5 Lbs and I love it! I&#x27;ve been using this product since April 2010. I used the African Black Soap to wash my hair and then I wrap my hair in a towel. About 3 minutes later I take off my hair towel and put the raw unrefined Shea butter in my hair. I rub it all over my hair and then I get my pick and comb through my hair. Oh my gosh, it&#x27;s so smooth. I have no tangles! I Love It! I&#x27;ve always had to buy detangler sprays and lotions and I would have to use half the bottle of lotion just to get my hair detangled. But not with this Shea butter. I just put a little on my hair, about a quarter size and it detangles just fine. I have really course curly hair. I&#x27;m muti-racial: Indian, Asian, &amp; African American and have 3b curls. Shampoo is terrible on my hair because it has Laurel Sulfate in it which makes my hair so poofy and frizzy. But now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that problem anymore because the black soap &amp; Shea butter work perfect on my naturally curly hair. I style as usual with gel afterwards and then diffuse my hair. Now, I don&#x27;t use Shampoo or Conditioner. I just use the Black Soap as my shampoo and the sea butter as my Conditioner. I have saved so much money since I stopped using Department Stores Shampoo. I just cut up the black soap in block sized cubes and put my Shea butter in a small container. I then stick the rest that I don&#x27;t use in the refrigerator. It Works Great! I&#x27;ve used other black soaps on my hair in order to wash it and the product just tangled up my hair really bad. So make sure to buy Raw African Black Soap &amp; not unrefined Black Soap because it really does make a difference. It&#x27;s also great for an overall body wash &amp; face wash.</li>
    <li> African Black Soap is excellent for dry skin care.  The soap lathers really well, is soft, and leaves my skin soft.  This soap does not dry the skin out. It actually moisturizes the skin and leaves a sort of glow to it. If you have had problems using Castile soap due to dry skin, this is the product you are seeking.  It is a raw product so don&#x27;t expect the pretty little shape you get with commercial soap which contain sulfate, but this soap cleans the skin and leaves it feeling soft. I would not recommend using this soap on very delicate areas, if you know what I mean, as it has an exfoliant in it. But, that&#x27;s just me. LOL</li>
    <li> I had never used black soap before, so my bad for buying 5 lbs of it to start with. I was convinced by all the other reviews that it was going to make my skin glow. Actually, it turned it beet red. There is some kind of abrasive in the soap that scratched the *&amp;@# out of my skin everywhere I used it. I don&#x27;t know if all black soap is that way, or if this stuff is just shockingly low quality. At any rate, I&#x27;m looking for someone to give this stuff to now.  To be fair: I do have sensitive skin, and I am about as white as they come, so if you also fit that description, beware.</li>
    <li> I started using black soap a year ago. It is all I use now for body, shampoo and shaving.  great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. First  time using black soap and not sure how to use it like if I should use it every day or every few days. Makes a great lather and makes my skin look amazing. Its been about two weeks or longer and I dont see any change in acne black spots but it makes my face look really radiant until apply African shea butter or coconut oil then my face just looks normal. I bought the 5lb and it is so much I can still have plenty months away at least for the next year lol. Wish I knew how to use this soap and its benefits every day but each day Im learning more. I would love to use this as a body wash but I am not sure how much water to add etc. Overall great soap. Came earlier than expected and packaged really well. I will definitely be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> this is a gre3at product.i just love the way it leaves my entire body skin. I have already recommended to some of my family members</li>
    <li> I will always buy this soap, it works wounders for the skin</li>
    <li> Have purchased before, will purchase again. This soap is excellent for my skin. Yes it does leave it drier than regular soap and I require moisturizer for my face and body which takes some getting used to for a guy. But I can&#x27;t critique the quality. I walk away feeling clean and have no skin problems. And I like knowing that I am using a natural product without perfumes or unnecessary chemicals. It is actually cheaper to buy 5lbs (six months worth) of this through amazon than to buy bars of regular soap at a store. And it works better to.&lt;br /&gt;I found the shipping a bit slow, but it got here within the predicted time. I just think shipping from NY to OH shouldn&#x27;t have taken 8 days. But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and eczema and I was hoping that this was just one of those products where your skin got worse before it got better, but in my case all it did was REALLY dry it out to a point of further irritation. I used it for a month straight. I personally won&#x27;t be buying it again but it may work for your skin type. I don&#x27;t recommend it for people with skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased when I received my package of black soap. This is authentic black soap from Ghana, indeed. And the price is by far the best I&#x27;ve found on the web unless you are importing from Ghana yourself. This should last my family a few months and we&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again! The price did go up $4 since I last placed my order which was only a couple a weeks ago, but still you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again. Item arrived in a timely fashion. Lathers well and cleans great.  If you are expecting miracles, you better stick to magic.  If you want a natural soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, this is for you :)</li>
    <li> Since I started using african black soap for my face, it stays less oily throughout the day. Much more effective than commercial \\&quot;oil control\\&quot; facial washes that I&#x27;ve tried. I also love that I can use it as a body soap and shampoo. It&#x27;s all I need come bath time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item several month ago.  And boy was I surprised at the volume of soap received.  I love this soap.  I broke the soap down into several large chunks for storage purposes.  Your skin feels very clean after use.  The one downside is that it will evaporate if left in the shower.  You have to keep it in a closed container.  Or you can make a liquid soap out of it.  This will last you forever. Buy it now.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff. I stop buy all other products and I use only black soap and Shea butter. It works well for me. Just wish there was a natural product that can remove blemishes.</li>
    <li> The soap from this vendor is not the same as the one from Halal.  It lathers well and works like regular soap, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate and leave you squeaky clean, which I prefer.  Next time I will order from Halal.</li>
    <li> Great Deal and I love the benefits of this soap.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was a little cheaper than one I had ordered before and you get a lot of it. I have sensitive skin and black soap doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate it like regular soap does. I have to say I was disappointed with this product. It is very crumbly unlike other black soap I have ordered from Amazon and it&#x27;s almost impossible to cut up in smaller bar size. It also has very large &#x27;pebbles&#x27; in it. Also something about it irritates my face and the other I ordered from Amazon didn&#x27;t. I would send it back but I am out of time since I am moving to another country Saturday and bought this to care for my allergic skin there. All in all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Pay a little more and get the better quality black soap sold my others on Amazon.</li>
