      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>Thinner and not as good quality as Urban products, but at about one seventh the price, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making that much of a difference</li>

      <li>Very reasonable price</li>
      <li>E.L.F. Eyelid Primer is very easy to apply and it lasts all day long.</li>

      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>This primer fixed it all and kept everything smooth and in place, even when I sweat.</li>
      <li>Works the same or better than what you get in dept stores and much, much cheaper.</li>
      <li>It prevents creasing pretty much all day, and now I don&#x27;t put eyeshadow on without it.</li>
      <li>Be sure to let it dry thoroughly before applying shadow.</li>
      <li>Being a lady of a certain age, my eyelids are no longer what they once were.</li>
      <li>I happen to like this primer, though it took me a little bit to warm up to it.</li>

      <li>The colors are vibrant there is no smudging or color melting away when combined with  oily complexion.</li>
      <li>Not stick and not irritating to my sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>If you have oily lids, it may not work the same for you, but for the price I still think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I only apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This was a good price and rated well, but I found it thin and almost oily.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants their eyeshadow to not smudge and last all day.</li>
      <li>it is invisible on my skin tone, and my eye shadow stays in place all day, at least 9-10 hours :-)</li>
      <li>Covers better than other more expensive primers.</li>
      <li>It definitely helps to keep my eyeshadow on, especially during these hot summers.</li>
      <li>I got the same outcome as high end primers.</li>
      <li>This works for me just as well as the Urban Decay Primer Potion, but I&#x27;d say that I have normal lids.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price, it works well.  The only reason it gets a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because the amount in the tube doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  Still, it&#x27;s a great product and holds eyeshadow on very well.</li>
    <li> Goodness thank to the many reviews on YouTube I gave up the costly primers and tried this one. I got the same outcome as high end primers. The colors are vibrant there is no smudging or color melting away when combined with  oily complexion. A little goes a long way this is a very good buy. It matches all skin types!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works perfect I find my eyeshadow has more pigment and it stays on for the hole day!</li>
    <li> I apply this underneath my eyeshadow and it really seems to work!!! it is invisible on my skin tone, and my eye shadow stays in place all day, at least 9-10 hours :-)</li>
    <li> I have used this every day and it is great. I have used several more expensive brands and decided to give this a try because of the price. I am impressed. I cannot wear eyeshadow without primer as it creases on me after a few hours. I&#x27;m glad I found this. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This does the same if not better as the very expensive brands. I know because I&#x27;m a cosmetics junkie.</li>
    <li> The price is very good and the light color fits me well. It is a little dryer than I expected.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price and it works very well. I have used others, this is thinner than most, but it works fine.</li>
    <li> the product I recieved seems to be dried out, it was h ard to get out of the bottom of the tube. package was factory sealed, so it wasnt &#x27;used&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Works very well! I had this extremely poor quality liquid eyeliner that I could never use because it smeared everywhere, but the primer made it stay in place all day! I also have hooded eyes so it was difficult to wear eye shadow because it creased after one blink. This primer fixed it all and kept everything smooth and in place, even when I sweat. This product is great, and with this price you really don&#x27;t have anything to lose.</li>
    <li> Very good. Product stays all day long and a very good price.  They shipped it as promised.</li>
    <li> Works the same or better than what you get in dept stores and much, much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I even put it on my eyebrows before the pencil and it stays matte all day long. I have oily skin. Work wonders if you are oily.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products and not expensive as others.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Apply it and blend it quickly for best results. It helps produce fantastic color.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s really good</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how badly I needed this product until I started using it. It prevents creasing pretty much all day, and now I don&#x27;t put eyeshadow on without it.</li>
    <li> Tried this with pencil eyeliner and gel eyeliner and both stayed in place and didn&#x27;t end up in the creases of my eyelids.  Dries quickly and really does the job!</li>
    <li> I love this my eye shadow stays on all day</li>
    <li> This primer is easy to apply, dries fast, and allows gorgeous blending of eyeshadow. I love this stuff, and I am over 40. I apply some with the applicator and the use my fingers to spread and pat it all over my eyelid. Not stick and not irritating to my sensitive eyes. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It definitely helps to keep my eyeshadow on, especially during these hot summers. Be sure to let it dry thoroughly before applying shadow.</li>
    <li> I need more coverage.</li>
    <li> this is a second time purchase...keeps my shadow intact all day !!</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely with brush but did not meet my expectations. Other products that may be a little more expensive are better.</li>
    <li> ELF is cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect great quality but the product is undeniably effective. Covers better than other more expensive primers. Because this was in a 3 pack I doubt I will ever run out, but if I did I wouldn&#x27;t order anything else</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my eyeshadow last any longer. I don&#x27;t like the primer as much as other ELF products</li>
    <li> This product performed great.  Very smooth and comfortable to put on and holds mine and my daughter&#x27;s eye makeup in place the entire day.  It has made a huge difference when in deciding if I wear eye makeup because now I know that it is going to last and that it won&#x27;t flake off in my eyes all day long.  I also get compliments on my eye makeup because it can actually be seen because it is lasting for such a longer period of time.  Work every penny, especially if you buy the 3-pack.</li>
    <li> This was a good price and rated well, but I found it thin and almost oily. Not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
    <li> This primer does everything a primer should on my lids: it locks my eyeshadow into place and keeps it from creasing. Plus, it&#x27;s just $1 on the ELF website, you just can&#x27;t go wrong with this. This works for me just as well as the Urban Decay Primer Potion, but I&#x27;d say that I have normal lids. If you have oily lids, it may not work the same for you, but for the price I still think it&#x27;s worth a try. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a medium quality product. I think it works really well for the price, but I have used other (much more expensive) primers that probably work a little better. But overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Thinner and not as good quality as Urban products, but at about one seventh the price, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It is easy to apply. I switch between glasses and contact, and it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. One application keeps my eye makeup lasting all day.</li>
    <li> This primer is a dream come true for a girl who loves bold eyeshadow but doesnt want it stuck in her creases</li>
    <li> great alone for a quik get ready or under other colors</li>
    <li> It works really well for the price and you get THREE in the pack; can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> I love this primer! And the best part was that this little company had the sweetest deal. I got 3 for the price of 2 if judging by everyone else&#x27;s pricing. And I use it EVERY day for shadow that lasts as long as I do!</li>
    <li> Comes in a pack of three. Very good product and non eyelid or eye irritant.  I gave one to my sister!  I use it almost every day and my eye shadows last all day long, even in hot weather.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this .you can get this for 99cents at Kmart and its the same thing as what this person is selling you</li>
    <li> It helps my eyeshadow last longer!</li>
    <li> Its ok. It do its job.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully! Without it, my eyeliner would be on my forehead! lol. I only apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I put this under my eyes and on my lids to prevent makeup from creasing.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making that much of a difference so I quit using it for one day.  I looked in the mirror in the afternoon &amp; was horrified.  I will never skip another day again!!!  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price!</li>
    <li> This so so great same quality as urban decay primer but cheaper you get more. A great choice to buy</li>
    <li> Keeps eye shadow on well for the entire day, but it is not as sheer as I would like it.  Otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> i love this primer it helps my eyeshadow stay on longer but it doesin&#x27;t last that long when you use it everyday but the price is amazing i would recommend this eyeshadow primer</li>
    <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product</li>
    <li> I love this! i finished the entire bottle in one year! so that&#x27;s like 3 years of good stuff! would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Just tried it and it worked great......! My eye shadow looked great after applying it and 6 hours in it still looks great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it creases and went on oily</li>
    <li> my eyeshadow stays on all day and it does not crease. and i have oily eyelids so i know it really works. best primer and great price</li>
    <li> Works really good and the price is so cheap but the product isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Works just as well as big name brands. I&#x27;ve used Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer in the past but it&#x27;s pretty expensive. Glad I found an alternative.</li>
    <li> Such a difference. I never used primer before and it works so well. Also I use it under my eyes and I look less tired!</li>
    <li> The bloom of youth is off the rose. Being a lady of a certain age, my eyelids are no longer what they once were. this product is a wonderful aid to apply eyeshadow evenly and smoothly every time.</li>
    <li> My daughter knows her make-up and said that this primer outshines the more expensive ones by far.  We will order more!</li>
    <li> Streaky and doesn&#x27;t apply evenly. This is junk!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear much in the way of makeup, this stuff is surprisingly lightweight and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin *and I have sensitive skin); it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a very good deal. I happen to like this primer, though it took me a little bit to warm up to it. I believe I was using too much to begin with, so it was likely my own fault. Now I apply a light layer along the space I&#x27;m working with, and tilt my head back with my eyes closed to let it dry to avoid crease lines. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Use it everyday. Definitely going to repurchase before I run out!</li>
    <li> Worth it! I will be buying this again</li>
    <li> I love this eyelid primer!  It holds my eyeshadow all day!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and will continue to use it. The color applies smooth and light, with enough moisturizer to prep your eyelid. I always re-order before I run out because I can&#x27;t apply my makeup without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed using this product. It helps with creasing and allows me to wear bright colors without fading. Anytime I can achieve an all day wear, I am a fan!</li>
    <li> E.L.F. Eyelid Primer is very easy to apply and it lasts all day long. My eyes are very sensitive and shadow near my eyes causes irritation and excessive tearing. Using primer helps set my shadow so that it stays put. The color is neutral and does not interfere with the color of shadow used. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants their eyeshadow to not smudge and last all day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works so well. I never have to worry about those annoying lines where the eye shadow accumulates throughout the day. It&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
    <li> This product really dries out my eyelids.  It covers easily and thoroughly but while I&#x27;m wearing it, i feel like someone or something is pulling on my eyelids. They feel very dry and stuck together.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
