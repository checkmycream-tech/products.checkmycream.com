      <li>They have more color choice that is good ,  if it smaller like .8cm will be great , my client said it too big for finger nail.</li>
      <li>I use them for my nails and happy with the size, BUT the picture portrays them to come in equal amount of colors and it does not.  </li>

      <li>I love my new bows and the assortment of colors!</li>
      <li>I got a variety of colors and they arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>very pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna order again when I run low on these cute bows with rhinestones!</li>
      <li>Cute for natural nail or acrylic.</li>
      <li>These are cute and arrived fairly quick, but there is only 80 NOT 90.</li>
      <li>Very cute, but I received all teal and pink colors....</li>
      <li>I helped please leave comments ;)</li>
      <li>I got 10 of each color, which was AWESOME because I thought that I was going to get totally random amounts of each color bow.</li>
      <li>but then when I took them out of the little baggy I had an abundant amount of greens, which frankly I don&#x27;t think I would use all THAT much.  </li>
      <li>I have a very curved nail bed</li>
      <li>all the colors are there &amp; you really do get 100 of them</li>
      <li>These came fast.</li>
      <li>They cover the whole width of the nail bed.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>But it came quick and it was smaller</li>
      <li>Cute, small enough to fit on natural nails.</li>
      <li>i received this two days early!</li>
      <li>all of the colors are really cute, i love it, ill definitely be ordering again.</li>
      <li>Would&#x27;ve preferred to have black bows in the mix &amp; all the colors pictured but the assortment I received was fine.</li>
      <li>before I got one color for the exact same price!!!  </li>
      <li>and I knew they were shipping from far away.</li>
      <li>I received these in the mail 5 days early,  </li>
      <li>Actually, two of the bows were slightly deformed, like the plastic spilled over the mold a bit or something, but this order is much better than I expected</li>

<li> I received these in the mail 5 days early,  </li>
<li> Actually, two of the bows were slightly deformed, like the plastic spilled over the mold a bit or something, but this order is much better than I expected</li>
<li> Solid colors and flat backed.</li>
<li> I was hoping them to be equal because I ONLY got 4 black bows which is pretty upsetting because black goes with all.  </li>
<li> and they&#x27;re a little big for my natural nails</li>
<li> so I am curious to see how well these stay on, seeing that they have a completely flat back.</li>
<li> I only received 1 yellow, 1 green, and 1 baby blue bow.</li>
<li> Shipping took a long time</li>
<li> eight colors ten of each of which two of my purple bows were stuck together and when i tried to separate them they snapped and also some were missing rhinestones with no extra escaped rhinestones on the bottom, just none existent.</li>
<li> The majority were black, red, and dark blue.</li>
<li> one was missing the rhinestone but no big deal i guess.</li>
<li> then I expected</li>
<li> Somewhat difficult to use on natural nail if the person&#x27;s nail is naturally curved though.</li>
<li> maybe a few black and white.  </li>
<li> I only received 80 not 100 and had multiple broken pieces.</li>
<li> I also got an extra rhinestone in the bag which means that if one of them loses a gem than I won&#x27;t be stuck with a messed up bow.</li>
<li> I have small hands.</li>
<li> you then are rude</li>
<li> There were a few random pieces in there</li>
<li> also got three random ones</li>
<li> Sad ,</li>
<li> so they stick out on the nail, somewhat awkward.</li>
<li> Horrible absolutely horrible don&#x27;t buy the short</li>
<li> Bad buy smh.</li>
<li> My daughter was so mad!</li>
<li> i was very disappointed</li>

    <li> I got them faster then my estimated date but i only received 91 pieces. The pieces are cute and i will use them on my crafts.</li>
    <li> I received these in the mail 5 days early,  I can&#x27;t wait to try them. They look perfect for natural nails! I&#x27;m gonna order again when I run low on these cute bows with rhinestones! Thank you!</li>
    <li> To big for fingernails.</li>
    <li> Very cute, but I received all teal and pink colors....maybe a few black and white.  It seemed like whatever the company had left they threw in a bag (especially unpopular colors)</li>
    <li> It was a total ripoff. I paid for all those bows and only got ten. My daughter was so mad!</li>
    <li> I am super excited to try these out! Shipping took a long time but I wasn&#x27;t in a rush and I knew they were shipping from far away. I got 10 of each color, which was AWESOME because I thought that I was going to get totally random amounts of each color bow. I also got an extra rhinestone in the bag which means that if one of them loses a gem than I won&#x27;t be stuck with a messed up bow. Actually, two of the bows were slightly deformed, like the plastic spilled over the mold a bit or something, but this order is much better than I expected so I&#x27;m not complaining. I have a very curved nail bed so I am curious to see how well these stay on, seeing that they have a completely flat back.</li>
    <li> Cute, small enough to fit on natural nails. Just what I needed! Some of the colors are off but they are fine.</li>
    <li> Great for the price you pay everything came intact. Can&#x27;t wait to start doing nails these are amazing. Same color as seen on picture!</li>
    <li> They have more color choice that is good ,  if it smaller like .8cm will be great , my client said it too big for finger nail. Sad ,</li>
    <li> I only received 80 not 100 and had multiple broken pieces. Bad buy smh.</li>
    <li> These nail bows are the best i own, I have bought over 10 different bows off of Amazon and these are by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> Horrible absolutely horrible don&#x27;t buy the short you then are rude</li>
    <li> I was impressed with how quickly my order arrived. It was scheduled by the merchant to arrive between July 10th, and July 28th.  I received it on June 28th.  I got all 100 pieces, the colors are very vibrant, and is a good nail size. They cover the whole width of the nail bed.  I have small hands.</li>
    <li> O My God thease are just soooo cute i just ordered another pack all the colors are there &amp; you really do get 100 of them the colors are bright &amp; prettty. I love them. You will too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any blacks, I was looking forward to it. But it came quick and it was smaller then I expected</li>
    <li> No curvature of the bow so they stick out on the nail, somewhat awkward. They are cute though; might use them for a phone case design.</li>
    <li> There really good and very cheap they don&#x27;t break at all hope I helped please leave comments ;)</li>
    <li> I got all the colors and there were 100 of them.</li>
    <li> Cute for natural nail or acrylic. Solid colors and flat backed. Somewhat difficult to use on natural nail if the person&#x27;s nail is naturally curved though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any red, or white i was very disappointed</li>
    <li> These are great ! Every loves them &amp; are always asking me if I can stick some on there nails!!!</li>
    <li> These are cute and arrived fairly quick, but there is only 80 NOT 90. eight colors ten of each of which two of my purple bows were stuck together and when i tried to separate them they snapped and also some were missing rhinestones with no extra escaped rhinestones on the bottom, just none existent. A buck maybe but not four</li>
    <li> These bows are really nice but I thought I would receive them the way they are on the pic..I only received 1 yellow, 1 green, and 1 baby blue bow. The majority were black, red, and dark blue. I ordered 2 packets and ONLY received around 60 bows..not 90.</li>

    <li> Cute bows. 100 of them are all there. Can&#x27;t wait to use these!</li>
    <li> Love them. I got a variety of colors and they arrived quickly. There were a few random pieces in there but I didn&#x27;t mind (it was hello kitty and I love hello kitty things). I got them to use on my nails and they&#x27;re a little big for my natural nails but I&#x27;ll still use them.</li>

I&#x27;m happy with the product but upset with how many each color came in.</li>
