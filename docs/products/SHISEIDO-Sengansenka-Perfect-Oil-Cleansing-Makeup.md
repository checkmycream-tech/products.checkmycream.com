      <li>I had been buying the Perfect Oil</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome at taking off waterproof mascara AND glitter (I guess the glitter sticks to the oil?)</li>
      <li>and it does the job perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Shiseido products are awesome!</li>

      <li>This oil is proof that you need not spend a mint to get a good product.  </li>
      <li>Used 2 bottles, it works good for me, however, I felt a bit greasy and def need to go over with a face wash after to wash off the oilyness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Great face pre-wash, removes all make-up even waterproof make-up and followup with a light cleanser.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>I love this oil, cleans up very nice and leaves skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>Really nice feel with it kind of sudsing up</li>
      <li>Nice oil product to cleanse the face.</li>
      <li>My problem with this cleanser is that it isn&#x27;t actually effective at removing my make-up.</li>
      <li>It does feel very nice, though, as it is super hydrating and becomes creamy on contact with skin.</li>
      <li>Tried many kind of cleansing oil.</li>
      <li>This is the best facial cleanser in my experience.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money.  </li>
      <li>Better than Dermalogica and</li>
      <li>i even was able to remove not washable mascara.</li>
      <li>This cleans better than anything I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Love it :)</li>
      <li>I use Waterproof Mascara and this product is able to removed all my make up and this mascara. ,</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Its okay.</li>
      <li>Love this cleansing oil.</li>
      <li>I got the 2 pack and glad I did.</li>
      <li>need a bit more exfoliation.</li>
      <li>but it does a better job than any eye makeup removed I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>smells ok.</li>
      <li>so I am really glad I came across this.</li>
      <li>ehh it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that I&#x27;m breaking out more since I started using this.  </li>
      <li>Origins is better consistancy, but I&#x27;m put off by the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am soooo glad it is now available on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s a good cleanser alone.</li>
      <li>I also use Perfect Whip after it and face is all clean and doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
      <li>After using so many different products over the years and never being happy I just about gave up until I decided to try shiseido&#x27;s skincare line.  </li>
      <li>It removes makeup ok, but you will still need to cleanse your face after with something else because it doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
      <li>I liked that I got this at such a good price.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and works to remove all traces of make up and mascara (even waterproof mascara).</li>
      <li>It also has a strong perfume type smell.</li>
      <li>mascara is smudged all around my face and my eyelashes feel smooth</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s got the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in it, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and rinses off really easily leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Asian skin care products are generally good and this one is perfectly fine.  </li>
      <li>, it is that clean with just 1 pump.</li>
      <li>I normally clean my face with the oil then follow up with a cleansing cloth.</li>
      <li>I started with the Garnier&#x27;s Clean+</li>
      <li>Did not like because I felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my face and made me break out</li>
      <li>I do not need to use anything else before clean my face.</li>
      <li>There are a few things that I have bought from this brand and all are very good quality.  </li>
      <li>Light, nongreasy oil that takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin fresh.  </li>
      <li>Its full of mineral oil or something like that.</li>
      <li>feeling whereas the DHC product washes away cleanly with only warm water.  </li>
      <li>The Shiseido Perfect Oil make up remover is the best make up remover oil second to DHC&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil which I love to use but is at least double the cost.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not crazy about the scent.</li>
      <li>It is not oily and feels fresh.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida, so it&#x27;s pretty sweaty and humid around here most of the year.</li>
      <li>this is a useful and clean my make up very fest, even in my eyes</li>
      <li>so I think I&#x27;m on the right track.  </li>
      <li>Sent right away</li>
      <li>If you want a cheap dupe of high end products go for it.</li>
      <li>This cleansing oil is a great alternative to more expensive cleansing oils.</li>
      <li>It takes off my most waterproof water resistant make-up like mascara with fibers and eyeliners, it also makes my face feel fully cleansed yet not dry afterwards but not oily either.</li>
      <li>It works to remove makeup quickly but it leaves my face feeling much oilier than the DHC product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather spend few more dollars and buy more quality.</li>
      <li>hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very, very oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>Any impurities and makeup get removed very fast.</li>
      <li>This is also fine for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It definitely takes off all of my makeup, but I feel like even after a really good rinse and follow-up washing with my favorite cleanser, my face is still slightly oily.</li>
      <li>This is very affordable and it does the work!</li>
      <li>One time I got a free sample on Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes, I felt the makeup was just moving around on my face instead of</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feel such better.</li>
      <li>This cleansing oil is only okay.</li>
      <li>was a bit concerned at first</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and smooth after.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a higher quality product.</li>
      <li>Great for extra dry skin.</li>
      <li>This produce leaves my skin soft and clean with no greasy residue and no breakouts.  </li>
      <li>The product is very efficient, you don&#x27;t need a lot to remove your make up :) The only cons is the smell...</li>
      <li>I always have to use a separate make-up remover to really get the stuff off, and I&#x27;d actually maybe be better off just using my foam cleanser in this case.</li>
      <li>I think this product smells a little bit chemically / not as nice as the next option on my list (the philosophy purity oil), but I think that&#x27;s a Shiseido thing more than anything else as I haven&#x27;t liked the smell of other products from this manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you have had good experiences in the past with Shiseido products or if you want to try an oil cleanser.</li>
      <li>but my face seems super sensitive to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The seller delivered it on time and it was well packed and easy  to open.  </li>
      <li>More people should use cleansing oils, it&#x27;s really a treat for your face after a long day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> makes my skin break out in little white pussy pimples! Maybe because mineral oil is the base oil used, and after cleansing face with it it leaves a slight oily film on face.  And yes, I do know to always wash with a face wash after using a cleanser to remove makeup.  The only change I make to my PM routine was trying this cleansing oil. So I didn&#x27;t have to consult with a rocket scientist to  determine what caused my sudden breakout. Also I waited a few days for my skin to clear up, tried this cleansing oil again and experienced the same pimples again. I can use it anywhere else on body without breaking out, so I&#x27;ll use it up by removing oily sunscreen on arms and legs with it. Works fine for that, minus the breakouts.</li>
    <li> Light, nongreasy oil that takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin fresh.  No fragrance, and all I need is one pump for my entire face.  The bottle lasts awhile.  Better than Dermalogica and way cheaper.</li>
    <li> Nice oil product to cleanse the face.</li>
    <li> This product completely removes every single drop of makeup on my face. I only use it when I have a full face (foundation/powder/blush/eyes). Its still a bit of a hassle to remove waterproof mascara but it does a better job than any eye makeup removed I&#x27;ve used. Great price as well, my bottle has lasted me over 3months (using it 3x a week). Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil is a great alternative to more expensive cleansing oils. I rub it into my dry face then dampen my hands and continue to rub it around. The oil will start to turn a milky white and removes all of your makeup. I have had it for a couple months and still have about have a bottle left. More people should use cleansing oils, it&#x27;s really a treat for your face after a long day.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil does break down makeup and does emulsify, but it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean and leaves a film that Boscia oil does not. I&#x27;m also not crazy about the scent.</li>
    <li> Description said it was made in Japan but when i received the shipment, it said it was made in Vietnam.</li>
    <li> Tried many kind of cleansing oil. This is very affordable and it does the work! This is my 3rd bottle and i will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> There are a few things that I have bought from this brand and all are very good quality.  This make up remover works great.</li>
    <li> The Shiseido Perfect Oil make up remover is the best make up remover oil second to DHC&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil which I love to use but is at least double the cost. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and works to remove all traces of make up and mascara (even waterproof mascara). I use it by turning on the shower, pumping it onto my dry hands and rubbing it around all over my face until you can see all the make up and mascara is smudged all around my face and my eyelashes feel smooth then I rinse it all off in the shower. Even though it&#x27;s got the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in it, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and rinses off really easily leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed. I had been buying the Perfect Oil make up remover at a Japanese store in town, and they charge $19.99 which is what I was used to paying. I am soooo glad it is now available on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned at first when I got it in the mail because the sticker you see in the picture was all in Chinese, and I was afraid I had gotten a knock-off product, but as soon as I removed the plastic wrap around the bottle, everything else on the bottle itself was in Japanese just like the ones I&#x27;ve been using since I lived in Japan, so maybe it&#x27;s just packaged for the Chinese marketplace.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to hormonal / cystic acne.  One of the blogs I read recommended using an oil cleanser instead of the aveeno cleanser that I usually favor.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a big difference in the tightness of my face skin so I think I&#x27;m on the right track.  I have had a little difficulty getting this to emulsify / wash off compared with soap.  The trick is to start with a damp face and dry hands I think, but also to rinse for longer than I usually do with soap.  I think this product smells a little bit chemically / not as nice as the next option on my list (the philosophy purity oil), but I think that&#x27;s a Shiseido thing more than anything else as I haven&#x27;t liked the smell of other products from this manufacturer.  I&#x27;d recommend it if you have had good experiences in the past with Shiseido products or if you want to try an oil cleanser.</li>
    <li> this is a useful and clean my make up very fest, even in my eyes i skill do not feel heart</li>
    <li> I got the 2 pack and glad I did. I am on my 2nd bottle now. 1 bottle lasted me about 8 months. I was using regular face wask to remove my makeup which cause my skin to breakout so bad. Then I find out about oil to remove makeup. I started with the Garnier&#x27;s Clean+ Nourishing Cleansing Oil. Used 2 bottles, it works good for me, however, I felt a bit greasy and def need to go over with a face wash after to wash off the oilyness.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have that much money to explore at dept. stores so I am really glad I came across this. This is by Shiseido, the price is affordable. It works on my very dry and sensitive skin. I HAVE to use it when I take off makeup, it is that clean with just 1 pump. One time I got a free sample on Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes, I felt the makeup was just moving around on my face instead of off.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again after I run out on this. At my local Asian store this sells at $17+.&lt;br /&gt;I use:&lt;br /&gt;Foundation: Relvon Color Stay /Estee Lauder Doublewear&lt;br /&gt;Eye: Maybelline Lash Blast + Milani Liquid Eyeliner</li>
    <li> Great product. It takes off all the foundation and other make-ups. Just remember to add a little bit water with this oil to work on your face, otherwise you might experience a break out.</li>
    <li> This another gift for my sister for Xmas, I had to tell her how to use it, as we don&#x27;t have many of these types of products in America, although Neutrogena and Loreal make these products at the drugstore level for every other consumer, except those in the USA!</li>
    <li> I will be returning mine.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but the packaging clearly says it&#x27;s Made in Vietnam.  The description from Amazon say&#x27;s it&#x27;s Made in Japan.  If this information is inaccurate I don&#x27;t know what other claims are not true.  I don&#x27;t want to take a chance.  I&#x27;d rather spend few more dollars and buy more quality.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I never knew oil and water could actually work this well together.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a higher quality product. Its mineral oil. yuck. I&#x27;ll stick to the DHC in the future.</li>
    <li> ehh it&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s a good cleanser alone. It removes makeup ok, but you will still need to cleanse your face after with something else because it doesn&#x27;t feel clean. also, avoid contact with eyes...it will make your vision temporarily blurry. smells ok.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just too oily and makes my skin oily too. I was worried about breaking especially during this hot and humid summer and I did as soon as I started using it. Be careful if you start vitamin supplements as well. If they are oil based capsules,&lt;br /&gt;there is a chance your skin will be oilier.</li>
    <li> It is not oily and feels fresh.</li>
    <li> It does the job and excellent customer service. I had a little problem with the pump leaking a little which I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the handling or heat of Vegas, since it&#x27;s oil base, but the seller communicate with me and work things out.</li>
    <li> guess its fake.... not feel like a real one as I used before</li>
    <li> I have used MAC oil for removing my cosmetics. It clogged my pores and gave me acne. Then I used this cleansing oil. My skin looks and feel such better. I think it&#x27;s less oil heavy than MAC and it costs a lot less. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I liked that I got this at such a good price. I have dry skin so this product works well for me. I normally clean my face with the oil then follow up with a cleansing cloth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using random samples of the DHC oil for ages and really liked it, so I wanted to try an oil cleanser long-term. The DHC one was way too expensive for me, so I decided to use this as a cheaper alternative and see how I liked it. I bought it back in September, and now let me tell you...I&#x27;m totally hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very, very oily, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;m talking &amp;#34;I-need-a-blotting-paper-after-an-hour&amp;#34; oily. I&#x27;m also prone to cystic acne along with my usual breakouts. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this does such a good job of removing my makeup or what, but I&#x27;ve only had ONE cyst since I started using it and the oiliness of my skin has gone waaaay down. I live in Florida, so it&#x27;s pretty sweaty and humid around here most of the year. Having less oily skin and less acne is pretty much a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on a dry face - I just use two or three pumps of oil for my whole face and use it like a normal facewash. It&#x27;s awesome at taking off waterproof mascara AND glitter (I guess the glitter sticks to the oil?) eyeliner. I then just follow with my normal skincare routine (which includes washing my face again with my usual cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend this! If you have a similar skin type, it can&#x27;t hurt to try, especially since it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than some other brands out there!</li>
    <li> This oil does its job very well. Any impurities and makeup get removed very fast. It is quite fluid, so I had no problem spreading it all around my face, little goes a long way with this product.  All that said, it is quite unpleasant if gets into the eyes or mouth, so I have to wash my face extra many times before opening my eyes. It also contains mineral oil and hell-knows-who-many-other-suspicious-looking chemicals, unlike cleansing oils by Boscia or Josie Maran  mineral oil can cause breakouts and is generally not good for skin).  So I&#x27;ll use this bottle, but switch to something more natural in future.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my skin, I regret this purchase. Its base is mineral oil, and it doesn&#x27;t easily wash off the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It takes off all of my makeup without leaving any film.  I got many of my friends hooked on to this!!!</li>
    <li> Shiseido products always win my heart. I use Waterproof Mascara and this product is able to removed all my make up and this mascara. , after massage the oil all over my face, i use cotton pad to wipe my face. It&#x27;s not too oily and the oily feeling can be removed after you wash your face with normal face cleaner.</li>
    <li> Completely removes makeup. I also use Perfect Whip after it and face is all clean and doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all. Love it :)</li>
    <li> Doesnt take off eye makeup very well</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers who said that this doesn&#x27;t emulsify and wash off as easily as the DHC cleansing oil. It definitely takes off all of my makeup, but I feel like even after a really good rinse and follow-up washing with my favorite cleanser, my face is still slightly oily. I&#x27;ll use it a bit longer and update the review later if this changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;//Updated 3/2015 // I went back to DHC. I still have about 3/4 of the bottle left of this one, and I&#x27;ll use it for other things (such as removing makeup from my hands since I use the back of my hand to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; my foundation) but I won&#x27;t be using this on my face. It made me breakout a lot more than the other stuff.</li>
    <li> Works well to remove eye makeup without having to rub too much.  Does take a few rinses to get rid of that super oily feeling, but I don&#x27;t mind a little bit of oil left behind as I have dry skin and live in an arid climate during winter.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil work not as well as the other Shiseido ultimate cleaning oil.  I thourht I would give it a try since Shiseido makes it.  But will go back to the ultimate cleaning oil.</li>
    <li> The product is very efficient, you don&#x27;t need a lot to remove your make up :) The only cons is the smell... And I also thought that the bottle will be bigger, but as you don&#x27;t need a lot of product, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will reorder regularly. Great for extra dry skin. also reasonable price. Recommend highly. Remember to use on a dry face.</li>
    <li> This oil is proof that you need not spend a mint to get a good product.  I use this to remove even my waterproof mascara and it does the job perfectly.  I then use a face wash to remove every last trace of the oil.  The oil has to be removed (I have oily skin) so that serums and face creams can penetrate and do their work.  For those with drier skin, a toner would work also.  This is also fine for sensitive skin.  Asian skin care products are generally good and this one is perfectly fine.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money.  Shiseido makes wonderful skin products and makeup and this is no exception.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this oil since it has no odor, it&#x27;s just thin and hard to get on my face after pumping it into my hand. Also, because it&#x27;s thin, have to use many pumps...seems wasteful.  Origins is better consistancy, but I&#x27;m put off by the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product two days now and had expectations it removes makeup. It does not. I had wanted a product like its description and am disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> Removes make up well. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or make it oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC Cleansing Oil for years but it&#x27;s a bit pricey so I thought I&#x27;d give this lower cost option a try.  It works to remove makeup quickly but it leaves my face feeling much oilier than the DHC product.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I&#x27;m breaking out more since I started using this.  After using this product, I have to wash my face with some type of soap to get rid of the oily film feeling whereas the DHC product washes away cleanly with only warm water.  If you have very dry skin, this might be an advantage but it&#x27;s not for anyone with oily or combination skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleansing oil for a few months now. So far it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> After using so many different products over the years and never being happy I just about gave up until I decided to try shiseido&#x27;s skincare line.  This is just what I needed as a cleanser.</li>
    <li> For all kinds of skin, not oil or dry after use it. A typical cleanser, nothing left. I do not need to use anything else before clean my face.</li>
    <li> BB cream can seem pretty impossible to remove with basic foaming cleansers so when I use bb cream I will wash my face with this first and then use a small amount of foaming cleanser (I use mizon pore refine deep foaming cleanser) and my face feels so clean. I could probably use this alone but my face seems super sensitive to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially I treat this as a makeup remover and it works fantastically.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil is only okay. I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase it. I like using it before my foam cleanser when I wear make-up because I want my face to be extra clean before I apply any moisturizer. My problem with this cleanser is that it isn&#x27;t actually effective at removing my make-up. I always have to use a separate make-up remover to really get the stuff off, and I&#x27;d actually maybe be better off just using my foam cleanser in this case. It takes my eye make-up off much easier. It does feel very nice, though, as it is super hydrating and becomes creamy on contact with skin. IMO, not worth the money, though.</li>
    <li> Very good for getting my water proof sunscreen off.  Really nice feel with it kind of sudsing up yet it&#x27;s an oil.</li>
    <li> After my cleansing oil was discontinued I was on the lookout for a comparable product. This was not it. My mascara doesn&#x27;t budge with this stuff. It&#x27;s not even a heavy duty mascara. It also has a strong perfume type smell. Not a fan. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is made in Vietnam, not Japan. When I received this, I had thought is was made in Japan. I do not like this because the product quality is not good.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised! It&#x27;s a silky, thin oil, with a nice scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate. I can even get my mascara  off, by just applying the oil to my lashes and letting it sit for a minute. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water or burn like some other cleansing oils I have tried. I use it to remove all of my makeup and grime from the day. My skin is soft and smooth after. I usually follow with a regular cleanser, but sometimes I just rinse and my skin is fine. I will buy again,  especially since this product is half the cost of the DHC oil.</li>
    <li> This cleans better than anything I have ever tried.  And it leaves my skin soft and glowing.  Thank you Shiseido!</li>
    <li> I love this Perfect Oil Face Cleanser! It takes off my most waterproof water resistant make-up like mascara with fibers and eyeliners, it also makes my face feel fully cleansed yet not dry afterwards but not oily either. This product is in my must haves now because without it my makeup wouldn&#x27;t ever come off all the way, this product takes every scrap of fiber off of my lashes! 5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser in my experience. It leaves the skin fresh and soft and acts as a cleanser as well as day cream.  The seller delivered it on time and it was well packed and easy  to open.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Good and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> This produce leaves my skin soft and clean with no greasy residue and no breakouts.  Even takes off my waterproof mascara.  Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing oil. Removes everything including water proof mascara! Doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in your eyes unlike other oils</li>
    <li> Its okay. It does the job but not too well. Its really greasy. If you want a cheap dupe of high end products go for it. But it cannot compare to the high end ones. Its full of mineral oil or something like that. Cuz that&#x27;s what it feels like I washed my face with. After I used it. The only thing I truly like about it is it leaves my skin soft after I use it though.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Gentle for face. Recommend highly.  Shiseido products are awesome! Sent right away and it was sealed and wrapped well.</li>
    <li> Great face pre-wash, removes all make-up even waterproof make-up and followup with a light cleanser. great stuff for the price.</li>
    <li> Did not like because I felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my face and made me break out unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a bit more exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, cleans up very nice and leaves skin very smooth. i even was able to remove not washable mascara. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really a great product and a good deal.</li>
