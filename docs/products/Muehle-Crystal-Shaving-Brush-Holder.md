### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best part is this stand is not a P.O.S. from China, made in the U.S.A. baby.</li>
      <li>This holder fits the tweezerman and perfecto badger haired brush perfectly....</li>
      <li>It works perfectly for that, and has held up well.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly with my Bluebeard&#x27;s Revenge brush from England.</li>
      <li>Best value on amazon!</li>
      <li>The brush holder is very nice.</li>
      <li>Good product for the price</li>
      <li>Does its job but make sure that you buy it</li>
      <li>The clear plastic is great as it won&#x27;t clash with anything.</li>
      <li>the clear color looks great too</li>
      <li>Fits my Escali badger brush just fine.</li>
      <li>and the fit is acceptable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have clear sticker, though.</li>
      <li>Nice, cheap stand, used double stick tape to put it up, would buy again if needed it.</li>
      <li>Fits my tweezerman brush perfectly, may be too small for a large brush.  </li>
      <li>You get what you pay for so be prepared if you decide the price it worth it.</li>

    <li> This holder fits the tweezerman and perfecto badger haired brush perfectly....the clear color looks great too</li>
    <li> Fits my Escali badger brush just fine. Has a circle of double-sided tape on the back which attached to the wall of my shower. Good product for the price especially if you want to wall mount in bathroom somewhere.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it looks like, just a basic plastic holder.  Comes with a strong sticky pad in the back in case you want to hang it.  Fits my tweezerman brush perfectly, may be too small for a large brush.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Does its job but make sure that you buy it</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  I have a Tweezerman badger hair brush and it holds it up and lets it dry out every day.  One thing to be aware of - the supplied sticker is NOT safe to put on a painted wall.  I had to move to the other bathroom (wife kicked me out, I was getting in her way :)  ), and it tore a big chunk of paint off the wall.  Get one of the 3M easy-remove double-sided squares if you are mounting this on a painted surface.</li>
    <li> not adjustable and not wide enough to hold my shaving brush.  considering that I only paid a few bucks for it I can search for another brush.</li>
    <li> Shave brush holder is top quality - these holders are made for the high quality badger brushes not the cheaper boar brushes with the larger knot.</li>
    <li> I picked this stand up for my father, along with the tweezerman brush. It works perfectly for that, and has held up well.</li>
    <li> Product description states “Crystal” shaving brush holder but is simple plastic. Too small to hold my standard size brush and too short. You get what you pay for so be prepared if you decide the price it worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice, cheap stand, used double stick tape to put it up, would buy again if needed it. three words needed</li>
    <li> It holds on wall very well. Its material is very clear and fine. It has two tiny problems...it&#x27;s a bit too tight for a brush and has white sticker instead of clear. I give it 4 1/2 stars instead of 5. I have it on the wall and it doesn&#x27;t bother me seeing white sticker. It&#x27;s nice to have clear sticker, though. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Broken when arrived from amazon. The item is made from cheap plastic and was broken when I received it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, buy a better one.</li>
    <li> For the price it wasn&#x27;t too bad but it is barely big enough for my brush and I thought it would be glass but it&#x27;s just plastic anyway it works for my brush and does it&#x27;s job so I can&#x27;t complain much not a bad buy</li>
    <li> Even though it does what it is supposed to (which is why it deserves 5-stars), it was way too narrow to hold my brush. I had to to some slight modification to it with a candle (for the flame) and a table knife (to heat up and melt the plastic). Once I got the opening wide enough, it was thee perfect height to hold my brush to let it dry. The clear plastic is great as it won&#x27;t clash with anything. Even if it did, I keep it in the cabinet so there&#x27;s very little if any contaminants on it from my wife using her hairspray.</li>
    <li> Flimsy but hangs a brush...</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with my Bluebeard&#x27;s Revenge brush from England. The best part is this stand is not a P.O.S. from China, made in the U.S.A. baby.</li>
    <li> I use this with a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] and the fit is acceptable. It seems to get hung up on the metal ring surrounding the knot, but it works as advertised and dries the brush in the recommended orientation.</li>
    <li> just wanted something to store a shaving brush and this was the cheapest thing i found--will probably replace it with something nicer at some point--it does the job</li>
    <li> It does the job, that all one needs to know!  Best value on amazon!</li>
    <li> this is just too short and the hole is too small to fit the tweezerman brush i bought to go along with it :(</li>
    <li> The brush holder is very nice.The only draw back is is made for small , diameter brushes.for example my vanderhagen shaving brush does not fit.</li>
