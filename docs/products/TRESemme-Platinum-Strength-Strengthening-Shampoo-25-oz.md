      <li>My hair was noticeably softer and the conditioner gave my hair that healthy glossy</li>
      <li>my hair looks and feels smoother and more body and cleaner(?).</li>
      <li>I am sure it had to do with the ingredients where ginger was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>

      <li>Love Tresemme haircare products.</li>
      <li>I have used Tresemme products for many years</li>
      <li>so it is okay.</li>
      <li>Love that I can find it online instead of through the stores.</li>
      <li>I received conditioner instead of shampoo (as did many others.)  </li>
      <li>Since I really love the lather, fragrance, and</li>

      <li>This shampoo is pretty good shampoo.</li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers nicely with a pleasant scent and rinses clean without using too much water.  </li>
      <li>Good price for a large bottle, as well.</li>
      <li>When I used it with the conditioner, I was shiny, smooth, and friz free ALL day!</li>

      <li>In fact, I could comb the follow up treatment through my hair easily.</li>
      <li>Love the container size, they do not pussyfoot around, and offer a lot of value specially for the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had full, healthy hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it three stars since I did like how it smelled, but it&#x27;s an average shampoo at best.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use conditioner every day and frankly, who&#x27;d have thought you ought to review it, but it&#x27;s all fine.  </li>
      <li>Tresemme makes some of the best leave-in hair conditioners around so perhaps when used with Tresemme conditioner, this shampoo might be worth a few more stars.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am an Amazon Vine Reviewer that selects free products in exchange for my reviews.</li>
      <li>Tresemme PSS is a great mid-range shampoo for your hair, especially at it&#x27;s current price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tresemme&#x27;s Platinum strength shampoo is a pretty nice product, developed to repair damaged hair.  It has a light scent, and does leave my hair feeling silky.  I really have no way of knowing if the product is &#x27;repairing damage&#x27;, but I&#x27;m happy with the way it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> My hair is much stronger, shinier, softer with less frizz and tangles for a MUCH BETTER VALUE. MUCH BETTER PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine, natural curly hair that is now bouncy and not heavy or greasy.  I use very little styling product. Honestly, I would pay salon prices for this in tiny bottles. It&#x27;s THAT good!</li>
    <li> Love Tresemme haircare products. Love that I can find it online instead of through the stores. Also not having to drive to the store is its own pleasure.</li>
    <li> As a long time shopper at Amazon I have always valued the comments in choosing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my 70s with lots of hair but thinner.  Decided to let is grow long and use a better shampoo than the typical Sams or Costco brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme is very popular......and now with me.  First difference is how little gives so much foamy lather.  Second while shampooing my hair feels slicker and smooth.  Using this shampoo and the equivalent conditioner my hair looks and feels smoother and more body and cleaner(?).</li>
    <li> this shampoo was recommended to me by a friend. It cleanses the hair and adds volume which was exactly my objective. To my surprise even my husband who is indifferent to such things commented it was a good one.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in the mail and fell in love. My hair has never felt or looked better!</li>
    <li> I had received this shampoo and conditioner kit in the mail as a sample and it is 1 FL ounce and honestly right off the bat I thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for my hair because it is thick, full and course typical African-american hair but let me tell you as soon as I used it I fell in love with it it made my hair soft and has given me volume which I have never had with any shampoo! I recommend to any hair type.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo but little more expensive.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times and see no improvement but i do notice my hair is dryer than when i use a salon brand. its not a bad shampoo but it does nothing to improve my hair. I do believ my color faded too!</li>
    <li> This line works for aging/thin hair.  And is so inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week now, and I&#x27;m wondering why I hadn&#x27;t tried this shampoo sooner. It&#x27;s cheap ($4) but effective and smells great!</li>
    <li> Decent size bottle for the price. This shampoo Smells great. I Love tresemme products. Works great on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> We got conditioner too...  Good hair product.  My wife&#x27;s hair looks beautiful and smells really nice.  She says this stuff seems pretty concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use much even for her long hair.  Conditioner has a lightness to it that she says does not weigh down her hair.  She does say it is hard to tell if there is really any \\&quot;strengthening\\&quot; occurring.  Good product.  Good price.  Not an eco-friendly or \\&quot;safe\\&quot; product.  Check the ingredients label for those that have concerns.</li>
    <li> Tres semme platinum strength shampoo did an adequate job of strengthening my hair after a week&#x27;s use.It has a pleasing fragrance and is thick when you use it. The bottle is a bit heavy to use in the shower but it is pleasing to have a product that can be used for quite awhile. I have not used Tres Semme products previouly, but will add this shamppoo to my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> I have used many Tresemme shampoos and conditioners and I have never been disappointed with a single one.  This shampoo is great, leaves hair shiny and smells nice.  Love the large bottle because it lasts so long.  I think it&#x27;s very reasonably priced and I don&#x27;t mind paying a little bit more for such a nice product.  My husband and son are both picky about scents and they both like this as well.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for over ten years now.. No breaks. My hair has taken hit after hit with my constant changes. I have elbow length hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to grow it past that length due to the constant chemicals. Ever since I switched to platinum strength shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has actually grown past that length. No other shampoo/conditioner has done that! I now have switched to use their heat spray and the leave in balm. Amazing! My hair feels nice and soft, the smell is not overpowering and not bad either.. I love it.  It makes my hair look shiny and healthy. I&#x27;m a big fan!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it cleans my hair but that&#x27;s about it.  There is nothing special about this product.  It has no fragrance which is good for some but I prefer a pleasant scent.  However, this product is not fragrance free.  I feel the same about the conditioner.  I might have to give the rest away, don&#x27;t know if I want to suffer through the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this shampoo.  She says that it makes her scalp feel clean and gives her hair added body...for me...well...I like the way it makes her hair shine and bounce.  There is just something about how it makes her hair look that I find as a turn on...</li>
    <li> First I am not sure why I got the conditioner and not the shampoo.  I like the conditioner but it is no different from any other conditioner so it is okay.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty good shampoo. It lathers richly, and leaves hair conditioned. I know a lot of people use conditioner after a shampoo, but if you do so with this it will leave your hair greasy. It has enough conditioning properties in it. I have borderline DRY HAIR, and use a conditioner sparingly three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that got this FOUR instead of FIVE stars is the scent. It is a HEAVY perfume scent. But not a current up to date perfume. This has the lingering odor of OLD perfume. Almost STALE perfume.&lt;br /&gt;And, I sometimes have to change up my shampoos, as this was a HEAVY shampoo. If you have oily hair, AVOID THIS PRODUCT, you will be a grease pit.</li>
    <li> I have used Tresemme products for many years and I think they make good products. They offer good quality at good prices. You get a lot of product for not a lot of money. This product is no different. It is a great shampoo and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do consider Tressemme to be of the \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; shampoos, and thankfully its products live up to that quality.  I have thick hair that can be subject to breakage, and I have found this to be a wonderful regular-use shampoo that does wonders in preventing hair problems. Yes, I would definitely say my hair feels stronger and looks healthier, and yes, I would say that is after only a few uses.  This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;tough love\\&quot; shampoo that makes it too powerful for regular use, but is a little-by-little product that maintains and improves hair&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> I tend to get dry hair from lots of sun exposure and needed an everyday shampoo that would be easy on my hair and help repair some of the damage...This shampoo does a great job day to day and leaves me with a light clean feeling head of hair....</li>
    <li> TRESemm&amp;eacute; Platinum Strength system shampoo has done a remarkable job in the past three weeks in repairing damage to my hair from coloring and use of beauty tools.  The shampoo lathers nicely with a pleasant scent and rinses clean without using too much water.  For myself, this has been like having a spa treatment for my hair.  I cannot wait to see what changes I will see in three months of use.</li>
    <li> After finishing the Tresemme Platinum Strength Shampoo, 25 Ounce, I am happy to announce that overall I thought this shampoo was above average. My goal plan was to help my hair to become or remain stronger, help the scalp to keep the integrity of the hair, for the always present fear of loosing it seems to always show its proximity. There are so many kinds of shampoo that a person could have a nervous breakdown, just trying to remember all the titles and classifications. I do not roll like that. I am always seeking the one product that I may become attached to, and that will do the job each time, without any fears from my loss of loyalty. Shampoos, the same as deodorants, are so plentiful, that who really knows which is the king of the hill, and which is at the bottom. Of course, if you wash your hair and a couple of hours later, it feels like hay to the touch, do desist immediately using said shampoo.. So many configurations, key words that must have taken weeks to come up with, to convince the unsuspecting consumer, this is the one product to use. Free for all, kind of system, so a diligent approach to just about any product is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;The container is black, and that was one star immediately, for I think it looks good just about anywhere, versus the light colored ones. This might be a perception issue, but never the less, it still looks good in the shower area.&lt;br /&gt;After using it to its completion, perhaps shared by one or two members of the tribe due to curiosity, I give this shampoo a positive review. Mild aroma, and a sense that it appeared to add body and some shine to the hair, makes it a viable choice. Love the container size, they do not pussyfoot around, and offer a lot of value specially for the money. Still, I am sure that the best of the best, my present itself in a later time. A shampoo so awesome that it would be almost like a religious experience once used. No kidding! I found a body and face wash soap, that made me giggle uncontrollably after each use, eliciting some awkward behavior for a few hours extra. I am sure it had to do with the ingredients where ginger was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I tried many different brands and this one was the best choice for my thin, straight and oily hair. Now I guess I will have to try something else because my hair is getting too used to it and I don&#x27;t get the same effect as when I first started using it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit wary of what \\&quot;platinum strength\\&quot; means - sounds like another stupid  marketing gimmick.  Yet I was very surprised at how well this line worked on my hair.  The results were similar (or even better) to the higher end Pantene line I had been using.  Hair felt smooth, no frizzies, and even curled a bit happily at the ends.  In all, very pleased and will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> As recommended by my stylist, I switch out my shampoo every couple of bottles.  If I like the shampoo, I go back to it.  This one I will go back to as I do like the way it makes my hair feel.  I&#x27;ve always had full, healthy hair but as I age I&#x27;ve found a bit of thinning occurring, so I&#x27;m sticking with the shampoos that give me back that \\&quot;more full feel\\&quot; and this one fits the bill.  Good price for a large bottle, as well.</li>
    <li> Tresemme Platinum Strength Shampoo is a very good product to use if you have limp damaged hair. It gives your hair body and helps to repair the damage to your hair caused by the dryness of winter weather. The shampoo leaves your hair grease free and clean.Your hair will look and feel healthy once again.</li>
    <li> Great scent, love the S&amp;S and not having to run to the store for stuff like this. I recommend giving this a try if you are not already using it.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a hair product that actually delivers when it comes to my dry damaged hair and I think I found it. I actually tried both the shampoo and conditioner from the Tresemme Platinum line and saw a remarkable difference after my first use. My hair was noticeably softer and the conditioner gave my hair that healthy glossy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth trying. The bottle says that it can revere up to 2 years of damage after 5 uses and I am very enthusiastic after my first use. As for my split ends, judging from what I noticed after my first use they are not completely gone but my ends look a lot less frizzy</li>

    <li> I have long, thick hair that I torture with super hot showers, blow drying, and straightening almost every day of the week.  I often have a hard time finding shampoos/conditioners that don&#x27;t dry me out or leave me totally frizzy.  This shampoo has a great smell, lathers well, and rinses very clean.  When used alone it did leave me smooth and shiny, but I found my hair frizzy after a few hours.  When I used it with the conditioner, I was shiny, smooth, and friz free ALL day! So, I would say, if you have normal, or thin hair this shampoo will probably leave you nice and sleek, but if you have thick hair, you&#x27;ll need to pair this with the conditioner to get an all day smooth look.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to use, she typically uses the Clear brand of shampoo and figured she would give this a shot.  While with this shampoo you get twice as much for the price, 25 oz instead of 12.9 oz she still prefers Clear over tresemme. No complaints on the scent.</li>
    <li> When it comes to these curly locks God gave me and my family, I don&#x27;t go all cheapskate. That&#x27;s why the Tresemme brand has been a part of our hair care and this Platinum Strength Shampoo was a fantastic new addition. Squeaky clean, high-quality and an awesome scent. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Tresemme PSS is a great mid-range shampoo for your hair, especially at it&#x27;s current price. You could do a lot worse and pay a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an every-day shampoo I find it a bit much; meaning that I need to use a conditioner afterwards. But it deep cleans my hair and when dry, seems to give it added body. The scent is pleasant as well, though it mostly washes out when rinsing your hair. I&#x27;d be very happy to use this every day, but on occasion my hair and scalp needs something extra, and this shampoo really only delivers the basic shampoo results, though in a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> DISCLOSURE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an Amazon Vine Reviewer that selects free products in exchange for my reviews. Normally, my review would have the following warning in green at the top \\&quot;Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program.\\&quot; The reason this review does not show this green warning is because Amazon Vine made a mistake and sent me this product instead of the [[ASIN:B00AE07FYK Tresemme Platinum Strength Conditioner, 25 Ounce]]. They were unable to rectify this error so I want the readers to know that I did not purchase this shampoo in case that is a concern to you and weighs in on how you perceive this review. Also, since I feel like it&#x27;s stealing if I don&#x27;t review all the products I receive (I review 100% of the products I receive), I&#x27;m submitting my review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine long hair that damages easily.  This is supposedly a strengthening shampoo that might \\&quot;repair\\&quot; that damage. The container says it repairs up to 2 years of damage after 5 uses when using the Shampoo and Conditioner as a system.  I cannot attest to that nor do I really believe what a product&#x27;s package says. To me those are just claims to sell both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve used the shampoo a few times and noticed that I do not shed as much hair into the shower as usual--but that could be a coincidence. What I do love is that it lathers up beautifully and has a nice fragrance (which I cannot describe). After my hair air dries, it came out full-bodied.  Since I really love the lather, fragrance, and like the way my hair dries after using this shampoo, at the current price of $3.79 I would definitely consider adding this shampoo to my arsenal.</li>
    <li> My hair is.....Luxurious!!!! price of product, delivery, quality..AMAZING!!!!!! My hair feels and looks gorgeous. I am too sexy! Watch out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of this product so receiving it through the Vine program at no cost was a bonus. It&#x27;s a product I personally like and use (though truthfully don&#x27;t buy through Amazon/retail stores usually on sale $2/3.99- same size), my boys like and use as does the husband.&lt;br /&gt;We have a variety of hair types to deal with from oily, normal, and dry-course and works beautifully on each and the shampoo is def. enhanced by its companion conditioner. It has a lovely almond smell when using which lingers only to the extent of subtle cleanliness through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans without drying leaving behind a pleasant softness and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;This is a salon product minus the salon price.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it once a week with excellent results, the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; use it daily with no drying effects. It&#x27;s especially effective for my oldest teen who has thick, dry, course Asian hair and can wash it up to three times daily with no ill-effects. (e.g. x-drying)&lt;br /&gt;One star lost for thickness of plastic-- otherwise terrific product.&lt;br /&gt;Review produced from years of use not days nor weeks.</li>
    <li> I received conditioner instead of shampoo, but since this is a vine review i must review it like this.  I am happy I received conditioner, so keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Tresemme hair care products, so I am delighted Platinum Strength delivered strength and softness.  It has a beautiful scent, almost fruity, but delicate.  I think after several days of use I did notice a softer, stronger feel to my hair.  I cannot tell if two years of damage was repaired, but I like the way my hair feels, styles and smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, the product cannot be beat.  So many other brands cost so much more with military claims.  Tresemme works and its affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend all Tresemme products, including the Platinum Stength.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Tresemme shampoos and conditioners for years now, and generally prefer it to other brands. I&#x27;ve had a chance to try out both the Platinum Strength Shampoo and Conditioner and I like it. It does seem to add a bit of body to my hair, which tends to get a bit stringy and fly all over. This seems to help, and it smells good. I like it. My family members agree.</li>
    <li> I am never very compelled by claims that any product can repair hair. None of them really can as hair is dead biological matter and dead is not fixable. But I have very long hair and I work at keeping it in good condition. This means I need moisture and to minimize damage in washing drying and styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the Tresemme Platinum Shampoo is a good product for my goals. It did not stip my hair or leave it a tangled mess. In fact, I could comb the follow up treatment through my hair easily. It smells good. Lathers well and rinses easily. I don&#x27;t think it can repair hair but I think it will help you take good care of your hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and this shampoo made my hair dry and frizzy.  I also got dandruff after using this shampoo.  Also feel like hair is hard to get wet the next time you try to shampoo.  This shampoo is not moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I received conditioner instead of shampoo (as did many others.)  As a conditioner, it made my hair feel soft; however, it seemed to weigh it down.  I have natural curl and this made it more of a wave than a curl.  In addition, by the end of the day, my hair felt slightly greasy which is unusual has I have a dry scalp.  The greasy feel was slightly unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner otherwise did its job.  My hair was easier to comb and was soft once dry.  I prefer a lighter weight conditioner but for those who like a thicker one, this may be just the one for you.</li>
    <li> I was not all that impressed with how this shampoo actually cleaned my hair. It lathered OK, had a reasonably decent scent, but it was hard to rinse out - felt like it was still there regardless of how much I rinsed. My hair never felt clean, but rather felt like I left in some conditioner or other similar leave-in type hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price, I was not at all impressed. I&#x27;ll give it three stars since I did like how it smelled, but it&#x27;s an average shampoo at best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been happy with any Tresemme product I have purchased this product matches the quality I have come to expect frin Tresenne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers quickly and rinses with ease.  I have very fine hair and it does not weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and does not linger overly long (a good thing)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioner every day and frankly, who&#x27;d have thought you ought to review it, but it&#x27;s all fine.  the product smells fresh and your hair feels great after you use it.  And that&#x27;s the point, I suppose!</li>
    <li> The Tresemme Platinum Strength Shampoo was used by the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Everyone found the shampoo to leave your hair pretty much knot-free and feeling smooth and silky.  For a regular head of hair, you didn&#x27;t need a much shampoo to wash your hair so the large bottle lasts a long time, even in a big family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The member of the family with hair over two and half feet long really liked this product; seeing a huge improvement in the look and feel of her hair shortly after beginning to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - One minor one. The bottle is very big and heavy when new at 25 ounces. A pump dispenser would make it easier to manage but probably also more expensive.</li>
    <li> In all fairness, I did not use this with the complementary conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Strictly as a shampoo, it cleanses ok, and my hair didn&#x27;t feel completely stripped.  Tresemme makes some of the best leave-in hair conditioners around so perhaps when used with Tresemme conditioner, this shampoo might be worth a few more stars.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product once I got it. When I started using the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioning treatment I was satisfied with the results. After a month however I started to notice my hair had become dry, and brittle. I am the type of person who only washes their hair every few days and who also lets the conditioner sit for a few minutes before rinsing out, so a few minutes became a few minutes longer after I noticed my hair take this effect. Eventually I began conditioning more than once in the shower and my hair had become more difficult to comb through before I had realized it was my shampoo and conditioner making it happen. This was odd since I had stopped using heat on my hair within that period of time and if i felt it become dry or brittle it was usually for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend using this product in large quantities, on a regular basis, for a long period of time, or at all if you can manage.</li>
    <li> Just tried the shampoo and also the conditioner in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can vouch that the shampoo does a terrific job cleaning my hair and the Conditoner does a similar job giving me smooth, healthy-looking hair. However the Shampoo can&#x27;t take any credit for smooth or soft.  I have thick, curly shoulder length, color treated flat ironed once a week hair, I look for a shampoo to leave my hair clean and other products to do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right!</li>
    <li> My hair is very damaged from years of coloring.  When I wash it, the back feels like straw and it tangles.  I have been using a more expensive conditioner and it helps, letting a comb glide easily through my hair, but it is still brittle and dry.  After just one use of this conditioner, my hair felt less brittle.  I dried it with a blow dryer my hair was soft and manageable.  After a second use, I noticed it was not as strawlike after shampooing.  It hasn&#x27;t made my hair heavy or look and feel waxy in any way.  I will update my review again after I&#x27;ve used it for a full week.  It claims it can reverse two years of damage in just 5 uses.  It seems to be working and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and it left my hair feeling heavy and greasy. My hair felt and looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed for weeks.  I tried rinsing longer and it made no difference so I threw it away and bought new shampoo.  Even with the new shampoo and conditioner and repeated washing it took over a week for my hair to return to normal.  I would not reccomend this product to anyone if I liked them, the cheap 99 cent shampoo works better than this stuff.</li>
