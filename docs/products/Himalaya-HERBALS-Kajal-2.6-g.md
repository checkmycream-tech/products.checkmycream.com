      <li>my opinion, I think that this Kajal would work better if you&#x27;d just smudge it under your waterline, or try to use an angled brush and put it on your eyelids</li>
      <li>Being a makeup artist I love to try out various products and this is great!!!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Himalaya Herbals Kajal is wonderful product. I love it. It&#x27;s made with Almond Oil, Castor Oil, Camphor and a few more herbals, which is very good for your eyes. Eastern people use it to protect eyes for even for babies and man from sun and sand. You can’t make a sharp line with this Kajal, but to make smoky eyes is very easy along with Almay Intense i‑Color Shadow Stick I use and it&#x27;s take a couple of minutes to finish makeup for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> The color is deep and pretty.But I have a oily face and the black color is under my eye after sometime. I dont recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to unnatural products and can&#x27;t wear regular eye liner on my bottom lid (wet line) as it burns my eyes. I actually found Himalaya Kajal while traveling in India four years ago and have used it ever since. I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever be able to get it again back in the U.S. but was so happy to find it on Amazon from a company in India called SpicesWorld. The product gives your eyes a smokey, sultry, defined look. However it does smear. Sometimes that can add to the smokey effect/look. It&#x27;s actually good for your eyes, as opposed to makeup which is toxic. It has herbs and Rose essential oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you get the product and it says October 2010 on it, that IS NOT the expiration. The expiration is three years FROM that date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was recieved quickly, even coming from India, wrapped very nicely and thoroughly. Had cool Indian stamps on it. :) And the company SpicesWorld was very attentive to a comment I made.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I am clinically hypersensitive. Even the smell of certain things can land me in the ER. Just being close to some things can be dangerous and threatening for me.&lt;br /&gt;So, when I say that I have used this now for a week and have no reactions whatsoever, thus far, I am ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived perfectly and swiftly; and I put it on in the morning and it still looks good and fresh when I am finished with BOTH jobs (yes - a LONG day!) at night.&lt;br /&gt;The only time it smears would be the obvious - if I were to rub my eyes or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price was fabulous! I&#x27;m happy to have found this! Now..if I can find a mascara...</li>
    <li> In the search for a great eyeliner that isn&#x27;t toxic and isn&#x27;t incredibly expensive, I think I have stumbled on a gem. I had no problems at all with the product arriving damaged or even tampered with. And it glides on smoothly, stays put all day. I don&#x27;t really have any trouble with it smearing or running.  I mean, it&#x27;s a natural product, I don&#x27;t expect it to stay put when I rub my eyes. But surprisingly it does stay put and withstands quite a bit!!</li>
    <li> I really like this liner because it is very dark and goes on thick and smooth.  It smudges just enough, but stays on.  I like the way it is very easy to apply and the texture.  Awesome recipe.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different eyeliners - but this beats them all. It goes on smoothly - I put thin line of black powder under the eyeline so the Kajal doesn&#x27;t bleed.  The scent is yummy... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used an eyeliner that I like to sniff as I&#x27;m applying! :)</li>
    <li> Product is ok (since I FINALLY received in working condition from the seller) but I don&#x27;t like that it cannot be sharpened very easily and while I don&#x27;t mind the product, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> I really like it. its incredibly soft and super dark, now when i fall asleep with my makeup on, i don&#x27;t have to worry about my eyes because it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals like other cosmetics. The kohl itself is soft so i recommend your careful with it because it can fall off like certain tubes of lipsticks when your too rough with them. Good thing it is as dark and pigmented as it is because a light touch is more than enough</li>
    <li> I just got this the other day and I love it, goes on nice and smooth with easy application and creates a nice dark look. No irritation to the eyes. I will definitely be ordering this again</li>
    <li> Even tho it smells like herbs, , I like it, that means is a natural product!&lt;br /&gt;It was long lasting&lt;br /&gt;and bold color,  I love it</li>
    <li> I am a Makeup Artist and I have tried every single eyeliner on this earth NONE has gave me that black smokey eye like this eyeliner. Gives a smooth straight line everytime! Ordered two ! Great product just keep re-stocking so i can order more &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ordered kajal of this brand. Its a good product for the eyes and doesn&#x27;t smudge too much.</li>
    <li> this inner eyeliner is the best one i have found, and i&#x27;ve tried at least 10. it can move a little throughout the day but not too much. it is great for sensitive eyes. it is the one makeup item that i wear every day. at night i will add a liquid liner just outside the lashes which will also keep the kohl liner from budging.  other kohl liners are harder, which makes them more difficult to apply. also, this one lasts a really long time.  the only bummer is that it is shipped from india, and this isn&#x27;t very ecologically friendly. i buy 4 at a time. (over a year&#x27;s supply)</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is one of my favorites but you have to be careful with it. It&#x27;s very easy to apply but it also smears easily so throughout the day I check to make sure that it is where it is supposed to be. A fantastic product if you need or would prefer a herbal eyeliner opposed to one with chemicals but you have to have time to check that it hasn&#x27;t smeared. Also great to reapply when needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really wanted to try Kajal, and this seems to be a good product.  I like the formulation, especially the triphala.  According to the packaging, it does not contain lead -- another plus.  It is quite comfortable to wear.  However, I wish it came in a brown color.  Black is too severe for an ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I figured out how to use this so that it works for me.  I really do like it, and will order more.  I just use it on the upper lash wet line.  The effect is far less startling. &amp;lt;grin&gt;  It bleeds a little, but that works out if I just wipe the excess away a few times.  I am allergic to mascara, so this, with an eyelash curler (man, those things look scary, don&#x27;t they?) does the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great Kohl liner and have used powder ones and I tried this. I can&#x27;t believe it shipped all the way from India... I feel like my carbon footprint got way bigger... but the liner itself makes a lovely deep black line... and then after a few hours, all the blackness is under my eyes. I never have that issues with my Loreal Kohl stick liner. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, I love the color it gives to my eyes, very easy to apply. Better than expected, I will be ordering more. thank you</li>
    <li> very nice product, my wife likes it. that is if you would like to stay all natural. will definetly buy again!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner that I have ever used. It made my eyes brighter and stand out more. I was surprised it made my eyes bright, because black eyeliner usually don&#x27;t do that for me. It is the only black eyeliner I use now. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> this is the only eyeliner i use now after trying it. it stays put and looks amazing. bit tricky to get use to using an eyeliner so thick but not hard. i will definitely be buying more when or if i ever run out lol, it&#x27;s lasting forever.</li>
    <li> Being a makeup artist I love to try out various products and this is great!!! SMooth tip, streamlined and very dark...good for everyday use or to blend via a smokey eye..</li>
    <li> The pencil is very soft and glides on easily.  The color is intense and I really like the fact that it is an herbal product and does not contain chemicals!</li>
    <li> I must admit the liner is a great one.  I used it and it lasted almost all day.  I really didn&#x27;t have to reapply it at all.  The little bit that was gone from the day was still very good for it being a natural eyeliner.  It has a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I love the way this looks initially. It doesn&#x27;t sting, it goes on super smooth...however my luck is very hit or miss. If my eyes are the slightest bit watery, I will have raccoon eyes. I&#x27;m not throwing it away though, I&#x27;m going to figure out how to make it work for me. The price is great, so you can afford to experiment a little.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using kajal, and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work because I have light blue eyes. But I actually love the effect. It is somewhat messy, I have to make sure to wipe off the smudges left under my eyes, but it really intensifies my eyes. A great product.  I&#x27;m a little wary about whether or not this actually contains lead. It says it doesn&#x27;t but there&#x27;s no regulation and so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to tell.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I am from the Middle East and live in the US; it is so hard to find Arabic style eyeliner for inside the eye so it was nice to find it online. it&#x27;s flirty, smooth, very black and very soft and won&#x27;t scratch my eye lid. It arrived three weeks earlier and i am so happy with this product</li>
    <li> Easy to carry and apply any time any where. First i saw my sister using this product. I liked it so much and started using. love it.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner for lining the eyes, eastern-style. This is made to be used on the waterline, goes on smoothly and will not sting or irritate your eye - love the natural ingredients. There is a trick to it, however, which I found on a Middle Eastern beauty blog: First, line your waterline and tissue off any liner that has smudged outside that area, THEN using a small eye shadow brush, immediately dust highlighting powder under your lower lash line and on top of your upper lash line. This will keep it from smudging, pretty much all day unless you have watery eyes. It also makes your under eye shadows virtually disappear as well as doubles as a natural looking eye shadow. This only lasts about 4 hours on me but it fades gradually and is easy to touch up. have super sensitive eyes and this is better for me than regular &amp;#34;American&amp;#34; pencil eyeliner, less irritating. You can use it on the eyelid for added drama but be warned it WILL smudge.</li>
    <li> Some groundwork, first. I am almost 30, and have never been able to use many eye products because they have ingredients that give me a reaction similar to pink eye. I&#x27;ve tried gel liners, I&#x27;ve tried vegan liners, I&#x27;ve tried hypo-allergenic liners. If any of these get into my waterline they immediately tear out and i end up with little smudgy wet stains on my face and 12 hours of intense eye irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was *exceedingly* skeptical about using this product at first, because the idea of having camphor near my eyes sounded like pain city. (Camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol are all roughly in the same chemical compound family and often cause a &#x27;cooling&#x27; effect because of how they interact with &amp; dilate surface blood vessels.) I worked up the courage to try this brand on a whim, and I was not disappointed. It will go on your eyes and stay on your eyes all day long without heavy irritation or eye-reactions. It *does* smear as it has a lot of natural oils in comparison to other brands that use a more westernized recipe, but it smears out into these lovely, mysterious smokey plumes and is easy to clean up and sculpt with eye-remover makeup (or even a little soap on a round q-tip!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for dark, dramatic lines that will go on thin and stay put, this isn&#x27;t the eye product for you. If you&#x27;re looking for dark, dramatic lines that spread organically around your eyes and wont cause severe allergy reactions for even the most delicate of faces, You wont be sad you spent the couple bucks on your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Himalaya naturals has recruited a new fangirl, for sure.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!! only thing is that it smears so easily. ive been putting it on top of eyeshadow and it does a lot better. i love how it defines my eyes and brings out the brown in them. the shipping was about a week or so but it came from india so i cant complain. it hasnt bothered my eyes yet like my usual eyeliner either, so its my new fav makeup tool!</li>
    <li> Very nice black pencil good for nickel allergy :) works perfect for my skin, good blending and last all night</li>
    <li> very nice color creamy texture, im a little worried about how i will apply it once it gets down but i suposse i will use a fine tip sponge brush good buy took forever to ship but its worth it</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product,even though I was disappointed the stick arrived broken.  Unfortunately, I developed a severe allergy to this product.  I must have added 10 years to my eyes by the constant rubbing.  Fortunately, I realized that this was the problem, and not the inadequacy of all the allergy drops and medication I was taking.  So beware, one can develop an allergy to one or more of the ingredients.  I will go back to making my own eyeliner with coconut oil, beeswax and activated charcoal, which I apply with a retractable lipstick brush.</li>
    <li> Ever since my Avon eyeliner ran out, I&#x27;ve been looking for one that went on as easily and smoothly, but had no luck. I read reviews on this one and decided to give it a go because I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and may even help it. I received it on time and it goes on SUPER easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my waterline!!! It does smudge just as easily, too, but it&#x27;s not too bad, &amp; it does make it a little easier to make corrections (rather than rubbing your eye red as with other products). A good trade, in my book. It&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s shown and the \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; measures about just a couple inches, so it&#x27;s not much, but I am in love with it. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner so much!! It goes on smooth, and it&#x27;s a great color for my hazel eyes. I wear contacts, so a lot of eyeliners tend to irritate my eyes. I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with Himalaya Herbals. I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day for months and probably haven&#x27;t used half a tube yet. No sharpening, no breaking and no smudging. The color even makes my eyes look brighter. I will never use another brand of eyeliner!</li>
    <li> This would have been an excellent product, except that I received it completely broken and useless. I was not able to apply the Kajal at all.</li>
    <li> I love this liner.  Easy to apply, does not pull your skin, you don&#x27;t have to stretch your delicate eye skin to apply it.  It wears the whole day.  It does smudge a bit, so you have to keep checking every few hrs to Q tip away a little smudge.  But the black is the absolute blackest opaque you can find.  It makes my eyes really pop, especially when paired with an excellent mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great little kajal for my brown eyes..adds definition. My eyes are sensitive to popular drugstore eyeliners. No issues with the Himalaya product. It does smudge, but in a natural way and it is easy to fix with just your finger pads. However, it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Overall, good enough to stick with.</li>
    <li> I had an authentic India eyeliner in silver container with dry kohl.  I purchased this because I have lost my favorite.  This works pretty well but is definately not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the up side service was very fast and the product was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this product and it is amazing.  It is soft and goes on beautifully.  On the upper eye I apply to lid between eyelashes and eye and it makes your eyes look smashing.  On the bottom lid I use a smudge brush once I have applied a small amount.  This company also makes an incredible toothpaste.  I will be looking for more of their products.</li>
    <li> I love that this liner is not loaded with chemicals and artificial ingredients, and how it glides on smoothly in a deep, rich black. Not sure what will happen when it needs sharpening - guess I&#x27;ll have to read up on that somewhere on-line.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and without damage. Shipping was fast. The Kajal is really smooth and goes on easily. Is a bit difficult to take off due to how charcoal and deep it is. I do recommend it though-great value for the price</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I thought maybe this product would have lead, but I emailed the company and they assured me it was lead free and all natural. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Loving it all the way!!!nice color, easy to apply...hoping it does not break and finish quickly...would be ordering more soon. thanx</li>
    <li> This goes on effortlessly and does not smear--all natural too, which was the main reason I ordered it...but the quality is also outstanding!</li>
    <li> Our daughter got some red pimple/prickly heat like reaction on forehead when we used this. So we have discontinued it</li>
    <li> Best if you are going for raccoon like look. Smells awful to.Smudged every where, used it only once .In TRASH it goes .</li>
    <li> i dont like it its open when i receive and its broken i wast my many on it i wanna my many back</li>
    <li> It last for a long time and easy to clean by the end of he day ;-) glad I found it</li>
    <li> ITS UNUSABLE BECAUSE IT IS SMASHED AND COMPLETELY BROKEN OFF AT THE VERY BOTTOM WHAT A LET DOWN!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful about this product but am disappointed. The product was damaged. The eyeliner was broken out of the container and cant be used. I tried to apply it on my eye but can&#x27;t get a smooth line.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like it also shifted and some of the eyeliner got stuck to the inside top.  Also, this is supposed to be a water proof product but it is very soft on my eye and hasn&#x27;t dried. It takes such a long time to ship that I would hate to wait another 7 days for replacement of a damaged product. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> love my eyes. It is cooling , its herbal and eyes look amazing. A must have in any make up kit.</li>
    <li> Glides on nice and easy, but not for those who inadvertently rub their eyes or for those with oily skin...</li>
    <li> Bon produit, le mettre au frigidaire pour avoir une bonne tenue .  Ne pique pas les yeux   L&#x27;odeur du camphre n&#x27;est pas trop forte.  L&#x27;embout pointue permet une application fine.</li>
    <li> Being an Indian I already know that \\&quot;Himalaya\\&quot; brand has good products. So when I saw this eyeliner in an Indian Grocery store I instantly grab it &amp; I am happy that I did. There I got it at around $6 so it was a good price. It&#x27;s really deep black &amp; creamy. It glides on very smoothly. I can say that it could give strong competition to urban decay 24*7 if It had color range. It comes in only one color. Ppl who loves smoky eyes will definitely love this.  BUT it does smear. I have tried many waterproof &amp; non waterproof eyeliner &amp; now I can say that all eyeliner smear may be a little plus or minus. But one can fix it by applying powder eyeshadow right below the liner(on waterline) &amp; u r ready to go.  So ya I love it &amp; I have no plans to move to other eyeliner.</li>
    <li> It took a while to come but worth the wait. I&#x27;ve used this product before so I knew what to expect. I enjoy using it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful ayurvedic product,highly recommended for people with sensitive eyes like me,It&#x27;s very smooth and black,doesn&#x27;t smudge,am a big fan of Himalaya products!!Would definitely repurchase them from Amazon...</li>
    <li> My mother is from Pakistan and we have been using Kajal (red or blue tubes) for such a long time until we found out that it&#x27;s extremely harmful for your body, FDA does not approve it, could cause brain cancer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I came across this Himalaya Kajal and it brings the same results. It still has the same shine and goes on easily. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this kajal - something about the texture. I don&#x27;t like the way it goes on or how it looks. I find it hard to apply. Back to my old brand...if I can find it.</li>
    <li> I bought this Kajal due to the good reviews I read, but this product doesn&#x27;t stay on---it spears with the slightest touch of kind EVEN when it&#x27;s being used as mascara. Also, the company I purchased it from was very good about sending me a replacement as the first one I received was damaged, BUT then again, so was the second one. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again and if I do, the makers would have had to improve the product in the sense that it takes on the lashes or eye line instead of spearing so much.</li>
    <li> Very good Kajal, steal for the price!&lt;br /&gt;shipped in a timely fashion and it is very good quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I love eye liners and this is best so far that I have tried.  It glides on smoothly and you can smudge it your finger to get the smoky eye look.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. but shipping took so long and I am bound to reduce on star for that only otherwise it is definitely worth 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love that this stuff has few ingredients and is easy to apply. It goes on very smooth and holds pretty well. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I received this product and it was broken and melted. I tried using it and it just smeared. It went on smooth but it got all over my eye. Not happy!</li>
    <li> I am currently studying Ayuveda and learned about the benefits of this herbal eye \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; from my studies.  It&#x27;s amazing to find something that is both good for your eyes and looks great.  I was concerned that it would smudge and run everywhere, so I put it to the test by applying it before teaching my 90 minute dance workout class this morning.  What a pleasant surprise!  My eyes looked great from start to finish.  I just orderd 4 more because other women in my class want to try it for themselves.  THANK YOU for providing this product.</li>
    <li> The first package I recieved the eye liner/ khol was broken in half. So I sent an email they responded almost instantly. Gave me a refund no questions asked and they also sent me another one and told me to keep the first as a spare.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product it self. Its very very pretty and dark. You will have a re apply it during the day. But I still love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a million</li>
    <li> When I perform onstage I rim my eyes to make them look better.  Most kohl kajal products make me look like I am on a serious bender, with red eyes after the show.  I don&#x27;t like to meet and greet with bloodshot eyes, because this makes those dreadful National Enquirer pics look even worse! Himalaya Herbals Kajal works wonderfully and does an outstanding job of keeping my eyes nice for photos and more.  I was so tired recently that I actually fell asleep after a concert without removing my make up, but the next morning my eyes were fine!  Any other product and it would have taken 10 groupies to pry my eyes open. I don&#x27;t suggest you rim your eyes often, except for on special occasions.  For regular use, just use it in the lash line and you will look outstanding!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands and varieties of liners that are supposedly okay to be applied to the waterline. I was sensitive to almost all. This product however worked; I had no itching or \\&quot;heavy eyes\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in about 25 days! and to my amazement was shabbily packed and was damaged (the crayon was broken). I guess, I will be looking for other ways to find this product.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed is that this eyeliner was delivered to me EXPIRED.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on somewhat thick, and seems to be good for that \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;But buyer beware- set this with some sort of powder or you will have more smudge than you would like in a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;It works alright in the water line, but does tend to slip down within a few hours- which doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it actually was...took the chance &#x27;cause I&#x27;m okay with that, but still, got it in 2012 and it said it expired a year before. NOT A GOOD THING, PEOPLE.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, but again, it&#x27;s scary that it was expired.</li>
    <li> I really really enjoyed the fact that this product was wrapped well. I was hoping that it would come in pristine condition and it did. It shipped faster than I expected.The color is the darkest that I&#x27;ve seen in quite a while I would compare the depth of color to a chanel pencil that I previously bought. The only downside to this is that my eyes are almond shaped. . . and when I smile the liner smudges  . .its kind of annoying to constantly have to check that its in place. . . but. . . oh well. . .For the most part . . i&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> This kajal is very easy to put on, it goes on very smoothly. The color was full and not overwhelming. Also it did not irritate my eyes or smudge and I wore it for a full day. I will definitely buy this kajal again.</li>
    <li> really awesome product. super long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t smudge. i would highly recommend. certainly a must buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing eyeliner again and it seemed that many eyeliners irritated my eyes. I ordered this on a whim just to see if it would work for me. At this price I felt I could take a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did!! This eyeliner is great! It goes on smooth and actually stays there without smudging all over as the day goes on. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t go away after a few hours &amp; it continues to look great all day! It hasn&#x27;t lost its point yet so I&#x27;m not sure how it will be in a few months after the point wears down, but I&#x27;m not worried. I will definitely order this product again &amp; recommend it to anyone who needs a great eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic product for my eyes and there are not many choices available.  I bought this because it was reasonably priced and herbal.  I was happy with it on my eyes, it did not melt like other eyeliners, and mostly stayed put.  Some did spread to my lower waterline from the top corners of my eyes but it did not look bad and did not move further.  My biggest issue with this product is the tip is very wide. It requires you to put on a LOT of eyeliner.  It goes on very thick and since the stick tapers, I don&#x27;t know how you would use the entire tube/stick unless you bought a brush and used it similar to a gel liner.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner it&#x27;s good for sensitive eyes, the kajal delineates very intense and beauty, although it duration isn&#x27;t much, but  worth it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quicker than I anticipated. Since I am allergic to many eyeliners, I have not had ANY problems with this one. Goes on quite smooth and last along time. I will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> I cannot vouch for how good the ingredients are. All I can say is that the liner smears and is not as dark as I would have hoped. There is a 2013 date on the package that I thought was an expiration date. The seller says that it&#x27;s not an expiration date. Either way, I&#x27;d much rather return this, but I&#x27;m not sure if the seller would take it back.</li>
    <li> When i was younger, I wore more make-up, but now, I&#x27;m lucky to get some mascara on before i go out the door.  However, i do like this product and how easy it is to apply, plus its totally non-irritating even for my sensitive eyes.  It does make my eyes look super big and its great for date night.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but it does take a little extra effort to get it off, since you are lining it on the inside of the lash line.</li>
    <li> So, I bought a few different kajal products, and this one was the third I tried.  A problem I had with the others I tried before was that they irritated my eyes. This one went on with no problems and actually was a bit soothing. It seems a bit more oily than the others I tried, one of which I purchased on here: [[ASIN:B000O8C34E Lakme Kajal Pencil (Black Shade)]] but since it wasn&#x27;t irritating my eyes or making them watery it wasn&#x27;t really a problem and seemed to stay in place well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 4 different types I&#x27;ve tried, this is definitely my favorite. It didn&#x27;t irritate at all and it looks great. Also, as someone else mentioned, I was a bit confused by the date on the bottom of the tube at first because I just tore into the packaging without actually looking at it too much, but the date on the bottom is the manufacture date/batch, not the expiration date. I wanted to be certain as I&#x27;ve unknowingly purchased expired products before and I was not pleased. The expiration date is on the outer packaging. Anyhow, great product. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Super good! *^* Looks really nice when you just line the bottom lid. And the herbs it has keeps me awake at my nightshift job. Makes my eyes feel super relaxed. &amp;#60;3 Though it does smudge easily, but that&#x27;s something you gotta expect. Kajal/kohl smudges easily. &#x27;u&#x27; It&#x27;s -not- eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Not anything like eye kohl.  This is like a black crayon &amp; doesn&#x27;t even apply.  The tip of mine was broken, so it was just a bummer from the get go.</li>
    <li> Like a previous reviewer, I was a bit worried about ordering this since I had thought that camphor would be irritating and my eyes are very sensitive because of allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and is so easy to use to line the waterline; you hold it against your bottom waterline area, close your eye, and gently glide it from the inside to the outside.  It deposits color in both the top and bottom waterline areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also really makes your eyes pop! I have green eyes and brunette hair, and the black kajal really does make my green eyes look so much brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mine arrived, it was also broken (the pencil had come off of the base), but, rather than contact Amazon customer service and wait for a replacement, I was able to smoosh it back into the kajal left in the base, and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, you can&#x27;t sharpen these, but using them on their sides self-sharpens them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also does smudge, so you have to be careful not to touch your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this so much that I also just ordered the Sephora brand ones in purple and copper.</li>
    <li> Last for a long time. I still haven&#x27;t finished the one I brought many months ago. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic dry eye and my eyes are extremely sensitive to makeup. I cannot even wear most eye makeup without my eyes becoming so irritated and red that I can&#x27;t see. Purchasing this Kajal (Khol) eyeliner was a final desperate attempt at an eye makeup that doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes... and it was successful! The only downside is that this makeup is NOT waterproof OR touchproof. It will smear if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It goes on so easily and stays on all day. The lines it  creates are dark and bold. The shipping did take a little long but it was well worth the wait. Order this at least 2 weeks before you need it!</li>
    <li> My eyes hate eye liner, even most branded &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones. However, they had no adverse reaction to this eye liner. It&#x27;s great to be able to comfortably wear eye liner again and I appreciate that it&#x27;s natural. I like the Himalayan Herbals products, so it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that this is one more great one.</li>
    <li> This product was totally with my money I pursued it and it came really quick! I love this it goes on really black and smooth!!! A must buy!! :-)</li>
    <li> Kajal is something that i always wear and I was using this Kajal 3 years ago and stopped using it after I found Lotus herbal Kajal. Since I couldn&#x27;t find Lotus Kajal I decided to go back to using this. This is a great Kajal and stays all day but my only complaint is that it smudges quite a bit and needs cleaning around the eye for a couple of hours after application. This would be the case with home made Kajal that my grandma used to make with almond oil so they are not lying when they say they have used almond oil. It does look great and I do get compliments on how well it stays the whole day ( even after hiking this summer).</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and gives a very deep black color. It doesn&#x27;t smear and stays pretty nice all day long.</li>
    <li> Wears very smoothly and does not smudge. You can put on the water line too. Perfect for a smokey look.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve been gradually making the switch to all natural herbal beauty products.  It is one of the first eyeliners that didn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy when applied to the waterline (even when I have my contacts on!). During summer I also put this kajal in the fridge, and the cooling on my eyes was a definite treat for the hot days.  However I&#x27;m an avid reader of the Beauty Brains blog and they had a blog post about this product, pointing out that the ingredients list is incomplete (and that it doesn&#x27;t list any ingredients that would be used as a black pigment) so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again even though I like it, there is other kajal out there that has the full ingredient list and is fully herbal.</li>
    <li> It glides on smooth like silk, easy on, it does smudge if you don&#x27;t know how to&lt;br /&gt;put it on  great for Smokey eyes look it does have a bit of a smell if you smell&lt;br /&gt;it from the tube but you don&#x27;t smell anything when your wearing it. It leaves&lt;br /&gt;your eyes feeling rejuvenated and refreshed.Over all great product...The thing I&lt;br /&gt;love most about it is the lipstick like tube :) very small and compact it&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;bulky at all and it locks in place when you twist it all the way out.</li>
    <li> the kohl seems excellent; i was a little anxious about the safety of this product, and still am a bit, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this product around 2 months ago. It took around a month for it to arrive, which was agony, but that&#x27;s what I get for ordering from a non-prime account! Not only did the item arrive damaged! ( a thumb print directly on the kajal stick! Disgusting!), but after I wrote a lengthy message to the vendor, they emailed my husband and said they would do something about it, and we have yet to hear from them again.....the kajal may not have cost all too much, though the shipping was high considering, but it was so disappointing to wait for so long to finally try something everyone&#x27;s been raving about and now have to wait to hear back from these people.....if I could do it all over again, I would have spent the extra bucks and ordered from a &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; vendor. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!!!! I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll actually do the right thing, but considering its been weeks since they sent the email stating they&#x27;d help me out, I doubt it. Again, this item may not be expensive, but we don&#x27;t have very much money, and believe it or not, this was a splurge.....so again....very disappointed.......&lt;br /&gt;I would give this zero stars, if I could! Paying for something and not get to use it, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
    <li> for the price it&#x27;s great of course..&lt;br /&gt;but for the waterline: I&#x27;ve tried better ones like (bourjois eyeliner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, I think that this Kajal would work better if you&#x27;d just smudge it under your waterline, or try to use an angled brush and put it on your eyelids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but not inside the waterline, you need something better</li>
    <li> I use this product exclusively on my water-line, upper and lower and it goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.  This one seems to hang on longer for me.  I also have Sephora&#x27;s dupe product and it seems to shift a bit after it&#x27;s been on a while, creating  raccoon circles. :-(  I am using an e.l.f. gel now too and that&#x27;s solved the problem totally.  Still, this is good and it&#x27;s extremely reasonable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted to see what the hype about kajal was so I read the reviews on this one and decided to buy it and am happy I did the color payoff is amazing one swipe between the water line with your I closed and bam! Super nice black on top and bottom now it does tend to start traveling under the water line but I find that putting a primer under and an eyeshadow keeps it from giving you raccoon eyes lol but I do like it and recommend it to others and shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype. I have been on the search for an eyeliner that STAYS PUT. I had a brand that I used for years with no problem, but I think the constant heat waves this summer really made it kind of a mess. A co-worker recommended that I try kajal, which she uses and said has no problems. Well I ordered this and was really excited for an eyeliner I wouldn&#x27;t have to sharpen and would be dark and long lasting. Well, this thing runs like a JOKE. My boyfriend and sister would constantly wipe the excess that ended up all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might just go back to Stila Smudge pots. While it isnt as easy as using a pencil, it definitely has been the best for me out of any of the eyeliners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Darker than any high end eyeliner for the water line out there!  Also, it lasts really long.  The first one I ordered was a little damaged in the package but when I contacted the seller they sent me a new one without hesitation.  I&#x27;m beyond thrilled with this product and the seller.  I will be purchasing again.  Also if you are interested in seeing how dark it actually is, I will link a quick review I have on the product here: [...]</li>
