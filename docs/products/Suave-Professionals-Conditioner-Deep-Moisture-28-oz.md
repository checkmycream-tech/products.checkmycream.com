      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true!  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is just as good as the more expenisve brands and leaves my girl&#x27;s hair easy to comb and soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Most think that a cheap price means a cheap product but not in this case.</li>
      <li>and when I use this it is so easy to comb through and style.</li>
      <li>The coconut scent is quite strong, if you don&#x27;t like coconuts, you won&#x27;t like this.  </li>
      <li>However, it made my hair super frizzy!</li>
      <li>have tried many products from super cheap to uber expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this conditioner provides wonderful slippage for detangling natural 4b hair and leaves hair moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>, I went through my stock looking for something that was sulfate free and grabbed this one figuring I need moisture.</li>
      <li>I thought this conditioner would be great, especially comparing it to nexxus</li>
      <li>I know I sound like a cheap tv ad...</li>
      <li>This conditioner is so silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>the best dog-gone conditioner I have ever used, and it, Thanks to Suave, cost less than most of the so-called Salon brands.  </li>
      <li>and it makes our hair very soft love it!</li>
      <li>I had to throw out my 3/4 full bottle.</li>
      <li>It does what conditioner is supposed to do, but don&#x27;t expect a true salon type conditioning.  </li>
      <li>I like it for volume, but I see more of a difference in my hair being smooth &amp; soft...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great conditioner, but not worth the money these third-party Amazon sellers are asking for it.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the name brand stuff only much cheaper!</li>
      <li>and I suggest it to anyone that asks how I keep my and my children&#x27;s hair so soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>make my hair soft and manageable love it ...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this is certainly as good as other brands that cost 3-4 times as much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall the exact name)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve personally had better results with this than products 4x the cost.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny and clean with this inexpensive product.</li>
      <li>After I rinse, still soft, clean hair.  </li>
      <li>My kids love the smell of this conditioner but after using it for a couple of months their hairdresser said their hair was very dry.  </li>
      <li>I have waist-length 3b hair that can be a real nightmare to deal with.</li>
      <li>, ready to go, and just add it on when I place an order.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this conditioner after reading all the positive reviews of it.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite conditioners (the other being Aussie Moist).</li>
      <li>but THIS ONE truly provides the softness &amp; moisture much more so than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Good for daily use, but once a week or so, I use the more expensive product to add to it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>, I know some people love it, I guess I just need a heavy duty conditioner for my thick hair, but this did not deliver than extra moisture I needed, great price though</li>
      <li>It smells nice and is really thick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone as far as putting down my tresemme silky smooth, naturals &amp; luxurious moisture for this!  </li>
      <li>Item as described new in package big bottle worth the price</li>
      <li>and wow! I cannot believe how soft my hair feels for just bleaching it.</li>
      <li>I quit using it because I switched to natural conditioner.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t rinse the conditioner completely out of my hair, I leave some of it in which helps a ton.  </li>
      <li>It definitely helps me detangle and keeps things under reasonable control when the dreaded humidity sets in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Suave products are very inexpensive, so that&#x27;s a double plus win!&lt;br /&gt;The money (and hassle!)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s extremely soft but light and fluffy.  </li>
      <li>Suave conditioner does exactly the same at a fraction of the cost and it even smells the same!</li>
      <li>I have thick, shortish, coarse hair that will absorb most conditioners I throw at it.  </li>
      <li>I have dry, straight Asian hair.</li>
      <li>Even my hair dresser asked me what I was doing differently with my hair because my ends weren&#x27;t as dry as they normally were.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional, expensive product junkie, but I would most definitely recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an old guy now, but I still have a lot of my hair, and it can feel dry sometimes even when I use a conditioner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this conditioner on clearance and have had it in my &#x27;stock&#x27; pantry .. I just got done bleaching and toning my hair, I went through my stock looking for something that was sulfate free and grabbed this one figuring I need moisture. I left the conditioner on for about two hours, just rinsed it out and blow dried my hair and wow! I cannot believe how soft my hair feels for just bleaching it. I&#x27;m a professional, expensive product junkie, but I would most definitely recommend this product! By the way, I have 3c hair and I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner after reading all the positive reviews of it. However, it made my hair super frizzy! I had to throw out my 3/4 full bottle.</li>
    <li> Sauve is always a good buy!  It is always a great smell.  it always does the job.  it is the perfect shampoo for kids that use too much.  it is a buy.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals, conditioner, humectant moisture, 28oz&lt;br /&gt;My favorite suave! Just as good as the name brand stuff only much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Omygosh!  I co wash with this and get my entire life every time!  I&#x27;ve gone as far as putting down my tresemme silky smooth, naturals &amp; luxurious moisture for this!  Tresemme is still in my arsenal and will stay but for the last 3-4 months co washing needs are met solely by suave humectant!  Minute it hits my low porosity 4abc hair my tresses melt and detangling while in my hair is a breeze.  After I rinse, still soft, clean hair.  AND ALL FOR UNDER 3$ whaaaaaaaat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re welcome</li>
    <li> I thought this conditioner would be great, especially comparing it to nexxus but I didn&#x27;t get the moisture out of it that my hair needed, I know some people love it, I guess I just need a heavy duty conditioner for my thick hair, but this did not deliver than extra moisture I needed, great price though but not for me</li>
    <li> I have waist-length 3b hair that can be a real nightmare to deal with. I love this conditioner and use it often. It definitely helps me detangle and keeps things under reasonable control when the dreaded humidity sets in. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this is certainly as good as other brands that cost 3-4 times as much. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite conditioners (the other being Aussie Moist). I have dry, straight Asian hair. I use this in combination with the matching shampoo, and my hair always feels healthy. Unfortunately, Amazon no longer offers this conditioner as part of the Subscribe and Save program, so I&#x27;ve stopped buying from them and I now buy from local big-box retailers. It&#x27;s a great conditioner, but not worth the money these third-party Amazon sellers are asking for it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such an affordable product to work so well.  Works better than many &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; conditioners.  I have thick, shortish, coarse hair that will absorb most conditioners I throw at it.  Usually the hair is soft afterwards but slightly weighed down, with this conditioner it&#x27;s extremely soft but light and fluffy.  I don&#x27;t what to make of it, I guess it&#x27;s good if you want more volume but this stuff definitely moisturizes sufficiently.  The coconut scent is quite strong, if you don&#x27;t like coconuts, you won&#x27;t like this.  After 24 hours, your hair still holds the coconut scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners. Name brand costly ones don&#x27;t compare to this. Even my hair dresser asked me what I was doing differently with my hair because my ends weren&#x27;t as dry as they normally were. I will be buying this over and over again.</li>
    <li> My kids love the smell of this conditioner but after using it for a couple of months their hairdresser said their hair was very dry.  Now we alternate between this an another shampoo.  The price is great for the quantity...especially on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t come across a better conditioner yet!  LOVE this Suave product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect too much, especially at this price point, but this Humectant Moisture conditioner (&amp; shampoo) is a keeper!  I tried the gold-colored Suave (argan oil?? I don&#x27;t recall the exact name) but THIS ONE truly provides the softness &amp; moisture much more so than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  (and I have a lot of products I switch between)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other fav is John Frieda Luxurious Volume.  It provides softness too.  I like it for volume, but I see more of a difference in my hair being smooth &amp; soft...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.... this Suave is a MUST HAVE!  I don&#x27;t rinse the conditioner completely out of my hair, I leave some of it in which helps a ton.  And no, my hair is not greasy or oily at all!</li>
    <li> I often get compliments on how nice my hair smells after using this. My hair is soft, shiny and clean with this inexpensive product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and still love it.</li>
    <li> Forget the overpriced salon conditioner. Suave conditioner does exactly the same at a fraction of the cost and it even smells the same!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is one of the best I have used.  There are a lot of pricier brands out there, but this one tops it for the price and the way it works for your hair.  I have very long and thick hair and when I use this it is so easy to comb through and style.</li>
    <li> Item as described new in package big bottle worth the price and it makes our hair very soft love it!</li>
    <li> With 3 daughters with long hair, we seemed to always be running out of conditioner, until I found this product!  I love having it in my cart, ready to go, and just add it on when I place an order.  This conditioner is just as good as the more expenisve brands and leaves my girl&#x27;s hair easy to comb and soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have had ultra-fine hair all my life.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products from super cheap to uber expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that Suave conditioner seems to work the best for getting out tangles and helping to keep hair moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Suave products are very inexpensive, so that&#x27;s a double plus win!&lt;br /&gt;The money (and hassle!) I saved by NOT going to Wal-mart paid for this easily!&lt;br /&gt;Large 28 oz. size bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> for  suave this is a wonderful product.. will use it over and over again...this is wonderful make my hair soft and manageable love it ...</li>
    <li> It does what conditioner is supposed to do, but don&#x27;t expect a true salon type conditioning.  Good for daily use, but once a week or so, I use the more expensive product to add to it.  But my hair is really dry.</li>
    <li> this conditioner provides wonderful slippage for detangling natural 4b hair and leaves hair moisturized and soft. A great affordable conditioner</li>
    <li> I love this product and I save even more with Subscribe and Save.  I also purchase the 28oz humectant moisture shampoo.</li>
    <li> Super duper, works great!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It smells nice and is really thick. I quit using it because I switched to natural conditioner. But I would still use it if I needed to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old guy now, but I still have a lot of my hair, and it can feel dry sometimes even when I use a conditioner.  This one however,&lt;br /&gt;is the best dog-gone conditioner I have ever used, and it, Thanks to Suave, cost less than most of the so-called Salon brands.  It is so good, I find myself using it on my face and arms too, to add moisture to my skin.  Who&#x27;d a thought?  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as Nexxus.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, a little bit dry, color treated, wavy hair.  This conditioner is so silky and smooth.  Leaves my hair feeling soft, non frizzy and smells wonderful!  A slight coconut aroma.  I know I sound like a cheap tv ad...but it&#x27;s true!  It&#x27;s so inexpensive and works just like a spendy salon product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell it leaves in my girls hair and they love the conditioner.  Great price but the bottle is large for small hands.</li>
    <li> This is a good substitute (and much more affordable) than the Nexxus hummectrus conditioner (which I also love).  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products on my multi-race family. Suave Humectant is the best for all hair types and I suggest it to anyone that asks how I keep my and my children&#x27;s hair so soft and healthy. The price is misleading... Most think that a cheap price means a cheap product but not in this case. I&#x27;ve personally had better results with this than products 4x the cost.</li>
