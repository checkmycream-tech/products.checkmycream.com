### Positive Reviews

      <li>excellent product and a very good atentio of Amazon, thank u.</li>
      <li>THE BEST OF THE BEST SERVICE &amp; PRODUCT, THANKS 4 ALL</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect, light day-time EdT with excellent persistence, and has an elegant freshness of citrus oil, cedar wood and pepper.</li>
      <li>Great product, great price - who could ask for more?</li>
      <li>it smells good for my boyfriend, he hasn&#x27;t tried it yet</li>
      <li>And I must admit I loved the price and the&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazing cologne.</li>
      <li>but I think is not that fancy but good for a daily thing and also the price was excellent.</li>
      <li>&quot; offer nice variations with more intensity and depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is a good Eau de toilette, traditional fragrance by Ferrari and a great delivery work by Amazon.</li>
      <li>He was happy and excited to receive&lt;br /&gt;the very cologne that he had looked at in the department store.  </li>
      <li>Cologne smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Red an Black are the best Ferrari perfumes</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for☆</li>
      <li>Somewhat reminiscent of English Leather, but with pleasant topnotes of orange and bergamot as well.</li>
      <li>This one was priced well and is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>time was fast.  </li>
      <li>So a real winner for us.</li>
      <li>is.&lt;br /&gt;Despite of what Ferrari has become, this is still a classic, understated scent.</li>
      <li>This scent has been a steady companion for over 22 years.</li>
      <li>how can I write a feed back on that product thanks your concern.</li>
      <li>Even if I didn&#x27;t have a Ferrari, I&#x27;d still wear this: A masculine scent that&#x27;s balanced, well-blended, and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>you want to \\&quot;evolve\\&quot; from this scent or are looking for a \\&quot;heavier\\&quot;, evening EdT, I highly recommend Guerlain \\&quot;Homme L&#x27;Eau bois&amp;eacute;e\\&quot; or Christian Brosius \\&quot;Cedarwood</li>
      <li>Not bad, is an almost entirely sporty fresh fragrance, can be used for daily use, not recommend for serious nightlife events.</li>

    <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
    <li> Been using Ferrari for quite some time now. I do not use anything else!</li>
    <li> What I received was a damaged product how can I write a feed back on that product thanks your concern.</li>
    <li> Even if I didn&#x27;t have a Ferrari, I&#x27;d still wear this: A masculine scent that&#x27;s balanced, well-blended, and not overpowering.

    <li> This is a good Eau de toilette, traditional fragrance by Ferrari and a great delivery work by Amazon.</li>
    <li> This scent has been a steady companion for over 22 years. It&#x27;s a perfect, light day-time EdT with excellent persistence, and has an elegant freshness of citrus oil, cedar wood and pepper. Some claim it has an initial \\&quot;air\\&quot; of gasoline, which I guess there is.&lt;br /&gt;Despite of what Ferrari has become, this is still a classic, understated scent. Later re-iterations, such as the Ferrari Extreme, have gone overboard on the gasoline theme (and also wear off way too quickly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to \\&quot;evolve\\&quot; from this scent or are looking for a \\&quot;heavier\\&quot;, evening EdT, I highly recommend Guerlain \\&quot;Homme L&#x27;Eau bois&amp;eacute;e\\&quot; or Christian Brosius \\&quot;Cedarwood Tea\\&quot; offer nice variations with more intensity and depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: After revisiting this large bottle after a few weeks of not wearing it, I cannot help but notice a strong Tonka bean base note, which also helps me put \\&quot;Ferrari Extreme\\&quot; into perspective. In the traditional \\&quot;Red\\&quot;, we are dealing with a medium Tonka and lemon oil aroma. In \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot;, it has been dialed up to a blunt vanilla and lime oil, which takes on a weird floral quality.</li>
    <li> Not bad, is an almost entirely sporty fresh fragrance, can be used for daily use, not recommend for serious nightlife events.</li>
    <li> My grandson saw this product in a department store in a neighboring town and went nuts for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;But the price was crazy!  This one was priced well and is the real deal.  He was happy and excited to receive&lt;br /&gt;the very cologne that he had looked at in the department store.  And I must admit I loved the price and the&lt;br /&gt;delivery time was fast.  So a real winner for us.</li>
    <li> excellent product and a very good atentio of Amazon, thank u.</li>
    <li> Amazing cologne. Arrived packaged well and had no visible damage. Cologne smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> it smells good for my boyfriend, he hasn&#x27;t tried it yet but I think is not that fancy but good for a daily thing and also the price was excellent.</li>
