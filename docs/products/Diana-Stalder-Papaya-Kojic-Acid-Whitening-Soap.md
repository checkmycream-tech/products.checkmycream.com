      <li>So I will be spending a little more for the best results.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as strong as I would have hoped.</li>
      <li>This soap is great, although I will be honest if you are a dark skin AA</li>
      <li>It was fine on the rest of my body though.</li>
      <li>and I already see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it if it were free.</li>
      <li>Overall, this soap is great.</li>
      <li>I ordered this help lighten my skin and possibly smooth it out some.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
      <li>every one just stairs in awww at me including my family and my husband</li>
      <li>My experience, I&#x27;m already light skinned</li>
      <li>I enjoy using it.  </li>
      <li>I also have to say that I have experienced the burning feeling, but only where I have the hyperpigmentation.</li>

      <li>and I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my freckles</li>
      <li>It makes you feel squeaky clean and is scent-less.</li>
      <li>i gave it a fair chance and used it for  a couple of months and really didnt see much of  a difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try pure kojic acid soaps to see if they work any better.</li>
      <li>nothing special about this soap i feel.</li>
      <li>I used Johnson Johnson baby wash because I wanted to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using something that may have a chemical reaction, so I chose something gentle.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this soap, especially if you are of fair skin like I am.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It leaves orage stains in the bathtub.</li>
    <li> So I bought this to get rid of years-old shaven scars around my bikini area. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for about a week and a half. Already, my newer scars are practically gone or blended into the rest of my skin. The older scars are taking a bit longer but they&#x27;re lightening up as well. The soap works but it&#x27;s not as strong as I would have hoped. I&#x27;m going to try pure kojic acid soaps to see if they work any better. I think the papaya in this soap dilutes the lightening effect.</li>
    <li> My face was really covered by dark spots due to acne. My supervisor recommended to me and in less than a month my face started clearing! By the second month, my face was drastically clear....I love this soap and I highly recommended to anyone that has dark spots!</li>
    <li> It came on time and everything but the product didn&#x27;t deliver as what I expected...from what the other reviewers said, I had high expectations. As someone w/ tan skin- it did not work for me</li>
    <li> It lightened up a little bit or it could be because i scrubbed the crap out of my skin. Ill probably give it one more try.</li>
    <li> This works great with the multi fruit liquid by the same brand. I have used it to successfully lighten areas that have been darkened due to shaving (bikini line mostly)</li>
    <li> I got Great results from using this soap and i want to purchase another one but the shipping fees are too high.</li>
    <li> When you first start to use this soap it&#x27;ll burn but that&#x27;s only until your skin adjusts to it. My experience, I&#x27;m already light skinned but when I get burned in the sun I burn bad and my arms seem to get the darkest. Before this I used to use topiclear in order to maintain until I learned you can get skin cancer from the hydroquinone. It made my skin pink and super sensitive. I used that for I can&#x27;t tell you how many years...6, 7 years. I use this in conjunction with the otentika fade out cream on floclaire.com because the soap is super drying. I gave this a 5 because to my knowledge there isn&#x27;t a soap that I can find that&#x27;s reasonable in price and does such a great job. It sloughs away the dead skin revealing brighter ever skin but you won&#x27;t really are the results in my opinion if you don&#x27;t have a brightening lightening or whitening skin cream. In my opinion you&#x27;ll appear ashy sometimes itchy, your skin will feel tight, look darker and just not what you want. This soap is also something you have to keep using the results are not permanent</li>
    <li> I got this soap about a week ago and i been using everyday when i take a shower i leave on my skin for about 3 or 5 min when i have time and I dont see any difference maybe its to early to see changes! But I&#x27;m going to keep using until is done! I will update my review and i will give five stars if really works! Btw I&#x27;m using on my knee cause they are really dark don&#x27;t know why!! :( .. If somebody is interesting will write about the Anal bleching cream from pink cheeks too! I got it like a week ago too! And I&#x27;m been using for about 7 days my anal and privetes are really dark too ( its so annoying to have all those areas dark i hate my skin cause everysingle part is kinda darker than my skin tone!! Knee elbows intimate areas even if i use a shoe it let me a dark spot on my ankle! So i tryng these 2 things the soap and the anal bleaching cream so far i haven&#x27;t see any difference! But i will update this in case this change! I dont think i can put pictures here so u guys can see if there is a difference in a few weeks</li>
    <li> This soap is good for african americans that would like to smooth out and even dark marks. It doesnt really make your skin lighter</li>
    <li> Gradually lightens not too drying. I apply  Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion after washing my face. Works great!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003NDIK30 Papaya Kojic Soap (Diana Stalder)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product&#x27;s and it really does work for me,I had acne scars on my face and fade&#x27;s away, even my skin tone are more soft and white.I will buy diana stalder always...love it so much...</li>
    <li> All nyou ahev to do is wash face , let dry with the foam on it ,m then rinse and apply face  cream and your age spots, sun spots will begin ti fade .But do not forget to apply sun screen or they will return again .It takes a lil time but it is worth it cause it works. And smells Wonderful too !All I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> This is a great KA soap, it&#x27;s just too small for me but it does leave your skin really nice.  I enjoy using it.  It&#x27;s too expensive.  I wish the bar was bigger.  I received everything in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Great product, cons are its a bit pricey and the soap melts away quickly. If you lather and leave it on too long you&#x27;ll peel badly. I&#x27;d recommend using on elbows feet and knees. Don&#x27;t use on your face, it&#x27;s very potent.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. Which is mildly upsetting. I hope this product works out for someone else though.</li>
    <li> This soap is great! It&#x27;s very drying, but it works wonders! I used it on my entire body, and in less than a week my dark spots began to fade. I am African American with a medium skin tone, so I expected it to take longer to work, but it worked right away. The skin on my face is a little sensitive, and this did irritate my skin a little bit on the face, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have sensitive skin. It was fine on the rest of my body though. I would just be careful about using it on your inner thighs because I did that and wound up getting some on my private area and it stung. Overall, this soap is great. I&#x27;ve also tried the black soap from this brand, and the kojic acid soap is definitely better!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product as it had so many reviews. Kojic acid soap just might not work for my skin type because I used this product morning and night for 2-3 weeks and had gotten darker as a result. I&#x27;m trying to lighten / brighten my skin and it set me back for 3 weeks. I started using Goats milk soap and have been happy and glowing ever since for the past month and I will continue to use goats milk soap. I love it&#x27;s toning and moisturizing effect. I glow beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I have oily acne prone skin. Used this only on body.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for whitening dark areas, but it does work to clear skin all over. You definitely need a moisturizer after,</li>
    <li> fast ship&lt;br /&gt;The product has a great smell&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for me at all I used it for over a month&lt;br /&gt;You must get in the shower, get wet, lather yourself up and then wrap the bar in plastic wrap&lt;br /&gt;to keep it from melting away.&lt;br /&gt;overall would not purchase again</li>
    <li> I have been washing the dark areas of my face with this soap.  Hopefully there will results soon cause I haven&#x27;t seen any thus far</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me except make my skin dry.  I bought it with hope of removing some blemishes from my face, my complexion is very fair, so I thought I would of get some result.</li>
    <li> Did absolute nothing it said it would, plus it made my skin rough and thick so now I have horrible crows feet around my eyes.</li>
    <li> nothing special about this soap i feel. i gave it a fair chance and used it for  a couple of months and really didnt see much of  a difference. and i hated that it left orange residues in my shower. i got tired of it and trashed the last bar of soap i had and went back to  the cheap palmers cocoa butter. did not repurchase and won&#x27;t repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> its ok, stains eveything</li>
    <li> This is one of my soaps of choice.....I now love the skin I&#x27;m in.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very drying and it does lighten your skin over time. i saw results in about 2-3 weeks. i will continue using this.</li>
    <li> smoothens and lightens skin effectively.. I&#x27;d be using this product forever. Shipment was fast. Can&#x27;t complain. I highly recommend diana stalder products..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care how good this soap is. Thought I would get three bars for the cost that I was paying for one bar. Would&#x27;ve returned but the box was damaged (probably got a box some other dissatisfied customer returned) and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with return drama. Get Koji San &amp; save your cash.</li>
    <li> This soap is whats up! My complexion had gotten really dull, and darker from the summer sun. Within in 3 weeks of using this soap. My sun tan was 80% removed. My natural tone is that of singer Kelly Rowland. My overall skin tone has improved dramatically, and even cleared up some bed bug marks that I had gotten a year earlier. I use this soap everyday. Letting sit on my skin 2 min before I rinse.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap after reading the reviews.  I read that since it contains kojic acid it would sting or burn.  I have not felt anything other than dryness from this soap.  I&#x27;ve even left IT  on over night and nothing happened.  Neither good nor bad not even stinging or burning. Nothing.  Could it be that the soap was old when it was shipped to me?  I wish I knew where to purchase a fresh bar.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. This soap was apart of some new skincare products I purchased about a month ago. I began using the soap that very evening. It makes you feel squeaky clean and is scent-less. I enjoyed the feeling of soft and clean skin. I lather it up on my face and then let it sit there for about five minutes while I do other things. When I rinse it off, I can see an immediate freshness/brightening to my skin tone.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t have awful skin but I also don&#x27;t have beautiful skin. I purchased this soap to help even out hyper pigmentation..Let me tell you...this stuff works! I used it all over my entire body. I managed to let the foam of the soap sit on my face/body for 3-5 minutes. After I rinse and pad my face and body dry, I noticed my skin had a natural shine! I moisturizers with a coconut oil and cocoa butter! My skin looked great to me but of course, we don&#x27;t believe ourselves until someone else commented on how beautiful my complexion looked! i have never recieved compliments on my complexion before. This soap is definitely a staple product for me. It probably would last longer if I can get my husband to quit using it! Lol He has no idea what the benefits are..he just grabs the 1st bar of soap he sees! Other than the price bring a little expensive, this product will not disappoint you! I love it!</li>
    <li> Loved this product. The orange scent is divine and the coconut oil really moisturizes your skin. No need for separate lotions, at least during the summer months, when you use this product. It leaves your skin with a fantastic glow and helps erase scars and discoloration marks as well. Unfortunately I could not use it on my face due to the oil, as I have oily skin and it would break me out. But it makes a great body soap for use when showering or bathing.</li>
    <li> It does not work! I would much rather use the regular papaya soap to help lighten my skin.. its cheaper!</li>
    <li> This is not the orignal product. I received my soap in a very timely manner, as I was excited to start using this product I opened the box right away.  I was very displeased to learn that this soap did not lather. Also even though I wasn&#x27;t looking foward to the burning sensation I was disappointed that I felt nothing after my use. I have been using this soap for a week now, and I can honestly say it wasn&#x27;t worth my 16.99.</li>
    <li> I know many people feel that this soap doesn&#x27;t work, but I beg to differ. I would recommend using this soap with a lightening cream, however, for best results. Also wear sunscreen!! This is super important because being an acid, this soap will leave your skin open to the harmful rays of the sun which can worsen your pigmentation and really damage your skin. Peeling and dryness are to be expected, this soap might cause your skin to get dry and then to peel, but in turn takes away the top, oily and dirty layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I personally scrub it into my face for about three minutes with each use with an exfoliater. This method is harsh and will have bad effects if someone with sensitive skin were to use it, but I find when using it religiously and scrubbing it into the skin I get better results.</li>
    <li> The only think I got from this soap was bumps. When I felt the burning sensation I thought it was working oh no</li>
    <li> This was terrible it did absolutely nothing for my skin it smelled nice though I saw no results I used it for about a month twice a day maybe it works for some people</li>
    <li> I recommend exfoliating for a few days to two weeks before using this soap, otherwise it will not penetrate your skin. If you leave it on for a minute (turn shower water off or low), it will tingle. Face is easier to exfoliate with soft sponge (do not use any velcro-like teeth for exfoliating!) so make sure you do not leave soap on too long, or it will start to hurt! You must double the amount of lotion you use on your face after, and I recommend something with SPF in it. I do not recommend doubling up on kojic acid products (such as lotion) on your face after a shower. You must give your skin time to &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34; and adjust. I would alternate this soap with an SPF protective lotion, and then on other days a gentle soap with a kojic-acid lotion like Lumi*Essence (highly recommended).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK very drying the lighting of the skin is minimal to none.  Will not purchase again. It did however leave you feeling clean best used for stripping heavy products,  creams,  tanning creams from skin or for extremely oily complexion.  Dry to combination skin will have to be careful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product always buy from DianaStalder, spent to many years in the sun and this soaps really cleans my burned  skin.</li>
    <li> I was suprised with the very fast shipment, but if you very dark its not going to work.  It burned my skin and no I have a dark spot under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews so I was for sure that this soap was going to lighting my dark lines. It actually burnt my skin and made a darker mark on my shoulders. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Great soap for brightening your skin, I like it a lot! I saw an instant glow to my skin. Definitely getting more</li>
    <li> My Mother and I have been using the soap for three days now and I already see a huge difference in my skin. I have hyperpigmentation around my mouth and the soap has faded it drastically. I also have to say that I have experienced the burning feeling, but only where I have the hyperpigmentation. My mother as well. I&#x27;ve also been using this on my thighs and neck, not as much change but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s only because its been three days. I&#x27;m so glad this is working :)</li>
    <li> I used this or about a week, didn&#x27;t see much difference. Then ordered kojie San skin whitening soap, just because that was cheaper than this one. Then started using diana stalder in the mornings and the other one in the nights, after a week noticed difference in skin. Also I read in some website that 2 whitening ingredients in one soap or cream is not a good option. Don&#x27;t know if this is true. But I liked the other soap and going to stick with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for getting lighter but my skin tone is very very untoned in my stomach hands anf sides im looking for an evan tone.I can see the difference with just one use, and i used no whitening cream! I exfoliated and then used the sope, my skin feels baby soft!!!! It smells nice and there was no irritation, i cant wait to see how i look with continued use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product . made my skin a couple of shades lighter. the only drawbacks are the smell and dryness</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews stating the soap burns or stings.  I felt nothing.  Not even a tingle.  I even had my kids try it.  They didn&#x27;t feel anything either. Maybe I got a bad or old batch.  Unfortunately, I bought 4 bars of the the Papaya and 3 bars of the Gluthahione (haven&#x27;t used yet).  This purchase with the shipping was very expensive.  I feel like I just threw away my money.</li>
    <li> Great product, use weekly</li>
    <li> I have a scar that I&#x27;ve been attempting to lighten through creams and other products, I then decided to give it a try to purchase this soap. I&#x27;ve gotten it recently on 4/24/14 maybe not everyone gets results it may depend on your skin color but for me I started to notice a difference after day 3 in fact starting on day 3 on-wards I noticed the shower water being dirtier than it normal is. I look at my arms and sides and notice already it is starting to lighten. I don&#x27;t leave it on long enough to burn I leave it on for approve 2-3 minutes then wash it off normally. Just the other night used organic moisturizing soap and instantly brought back all moisture into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now, from my experience with the product I would say this does work I have brown skin however so it&#x27;s easier to notice even smaller results on myself if I look. The scar on my face has lightened up as well, I personally find this soap acceptable as long as you use another soap after that re-moisturizes your skin, this route is a lot cheaper than doing a chemical peel. I would at least recommend trying it so I give this product a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> It really worked to even my skin tone. I noticed a difference within the first few days of use. My skin was brighter and smoother. Using it twice a day-- day and night - -keeps my face exfoliated. Be careful with leaving it on too long... it will burn you. This product also smells great.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this soap , it lighten my complexion about 2 shade up and my skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is not sensitive.  This soap lightens the complexion better than any beauty creams that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me at all.  I used it faithfully with no changes noted in my dark spots nor lightening of my targeted areas.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all! Used faithfully every morning and night and nothing! I used sunscreen and no change at all!</li>
    <li> iT IS A VERY HARSH SOAP ON YOUR SKIN NOT RECOMMEND FOR SENTIVE SKIN IT MADE MY SKIN EXTRA DRY AND CRACKY</li>
    <li> Just ordered more of this soap.  I switched to kojie and results didn&#x27;t last like Dana soap. So I will be spending a little more for the best results. With Dana soap discoloration went away in about 3 weeks. I used it more and nite with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This soap does not whiten your school. It will break your face out. The company is selling this product under false pretenses.</li>
    <li> This thing is great for acne or pimples. It stings a lot but I could see improvements in a day</li>
    <li> It darkens my face rather...</li>
    <li> I have been using Diana Stalder Papaya / Kojic Soap for a few years. I absolutely love how it microexfoliates the skin! You can see a visible lightening effect and complexion stays even and smooth! I am African-American and this soap has lightened me a few shades!</li>
    <li> The soap was a good product. The smell is wonderful. You feel the tingle which lets you know it&#x27;s working on the skin. it exfoliated my skin. however, it left certain parts if my face the same while exfoliating other parts of my face easily. I had to use cocoa butter to even it out. It&#x27;s not really recognizable since I use the cocoa butter to even it out a little.</li>
    <li> Bought it and only had my skin dried out.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything just like the rest of the product line. Its not worth anything I paid, or less.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it if it were free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap to rid myself of my pesky freckles (black girl with freckles).  Anyway, I was unable to continue using the soap because it began to sting unbearably.  I used it a couple of times last week and I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my freckles but I could never get used to that stinging.  It does make my face extremely clean after using it but the stinging is just too much to handle.  And I experienced some redness around my face.  Overall, it is a good product if you don&#x27;t mind the stinging.  Also, make sure to get a good moisturizer because your skin will feel clean but dry.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product; however, I think it burned my skin.  I am African American and wanted to soften marks from bra straps.  As gravity works, it rolled down my back which I didn&#x27;t think was a problem until I noticed dark patches of skin on my back and at my lower back.  Sigh . . . I didn&#x27;t want more marks . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not totally not recommend because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  I have normal skin (not dry/not oily).  My skin tone is the color of Jennifer Hudson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used it:  I would stand under the shower, turn the showerhead away from me, rub the bar on my shoulders until it suds, let it sit for 3 minutes, rinse it off, shower with Johnson Johnson baby wash then moisturize with raw shea butter.  I used Johnson Johnson baby wash because I wanted to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using something that may have a chemical reaction, so I chose something gentle.</li>
    <li> This soap didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I did feel the intense tingles and somewhat burning, but I didn&#x27;t see any results and I used as directed. I&#x27;m thinking of just going with a peel since I&#x27;m seeing alot of positive reviews about it.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin very dry but it&#x27;s works . I use it on and off. The reviews says it makes you peel but for me it didn&#x27;t but it works. I&#x27;m 2 shades lighter now. I will be ordering more !</li>
    <li> Works well when combined with Piona. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this soap, it lathers very easy. Lather your face and neck and let it sit for about 2-3 minutes or until it tingles. Wash your face and use an aloe leaf on your sensitive areas. I saw a difference in about 2 days in my complexion. If applying Piona, apply before using the aloe leaf . Apply Piona and wait at least 10 minutes before using aloe leaf.</li>
    <li> Would gave it a five star, but the burn sensation is unbearable and the soap is kind of small. I read some reviews where they said that the soap lives orange stains it the tub, that never occurred with me.</li>
    <li> This soap cost a lot, and it melt to fast when you use it. It should be so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> The bar is almost finished and my results are minimal I didn&#x27;t experience the burning and tingling that others rated about I&#x27;m looking for a stronger product I was not using it on my face only my  outter thighs</li>
    <li> I am completely unsatisfied with this soap. I bought it believing it could aid in the lightening of my acne scare, and all it did was dry my skin out. I had nice skin before using it, and now I have a painful rash and acne. It&#x27;s going to take a looong time to heal, too *sigh* I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this soap, especially if you are of fair skin like I am. Seek elsewhere, friends.</li>
    <li> The product is okay.  It is working, but it is drying my skin out.  I have to use a sunscreen and moisturizer</li>
    <li> 3* rating is not because I am unhappy but because it is too soon for me to provide a review. Great product so far, love the cleansed feeling it gives my skin, can tell its working because i experience a tingling sensation on my décolletage area after use. Shame I had to wait about 4 weeks for my sis to ship to me in the UK. Seller does not ship to UK :-(</li>
    <li> This soap didn&#x27;t work for me i used it twice a day did make skin softer than before but didn&#x27;t get rid of my dark spots.</li>
    <li> people this does really works but you need patience. at first i was like the others. i wanted to get something that will show a result right away like in a day but it didnt happen so i felt disappointment but i thought i wuld just keep using it since i already have it. few weeks later i see the result that my skin got lighter. although after i see the result i got excited and expected my skin gets more lighter but i guess my eyes got used to it and i coudnt tell if my skin got any lighter but it does works and you can tell the difference if you try it on a dark spot of your skin. this is like my 6 soap so far i have order from this product and seller respond rite away cos the shipping is very fast. if you want faster result try diana stalder kojic and glutathione soap together the result wuld be a lot faster.</li>
    <li> Most of it washed away in the shower before I could even use it enough to notice a difference .... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you have a special place for your used, wet soaps</li>
    <li> I love this soap. The first time I used it my skin felt soft and clean. This soap is a keeper for me. It hardly have a scent at all, does not interfere with my fragrance. There was no stinging or burning on my skin, and I have sensitive skin. Amazon is a place to purchase great products like this one and many more.</li>
    <li> This soap is soooooo amazing I still am amazed at how fast this soap works and how light my skin got ,it is just absolutely amazing,I&#x27;m getting compliments left to right,every one just stairs in awww at me including my family and my husband think&#x27;s I&#x27;m so pretty now!Although it does sting but you&#x27;ll get used to it .</li>
    <li> I thought my smooth glowing skin after using this was just in my head until I started to receive compliments within 2 weeks of using this. Very nice. Use a good lotion with this soap. A little expensive but it will work.</li>
    <li> This soap is great, although I will be honest if you are a dark skin AA it will not lighten you drastically. It is however excellent as an exfoliating soap to begin your skin lightening. If you got dark due to sun it will bring you back to your original skin tone. It will burn at first. Gradually your skin will get used to it. Moisturize well. Overall it is a good soap.</li>
    <li> Love it is awesome. Getting a new pack the stuff really worked on me is been about 2 weeks now</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference ni my skin except that this was a bit drying as most soaps are. Oh well.</li>
    <li> The soap was ok, it didn&#x27;t give any results for me. I used until it was gone didn&#x27;t see any results and the soap dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> Love how it really cleanses my skin, but as for taking away the dark spots and acne scars, it didn&#x27;t do much for it. Will not purchase this soap again.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. After using it for 3 weeks I have seen no results. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> The soap smells great. It works but slowly, you need to be consistent. You start to notice a difference in about 2 weeks. Also you will need a moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> works will on the face besides that no difference</li>
    <li> be careful when using this soap. Do not let any of the suds fall into any of your sensitive areas. My vajajay burned for three days when a bit of the Suds ran down my back and tummy. other than that it brightens well and softens skin. Just make sure you use a good moisturizer or it will dry you out and don&#x27;t use it for a prolonged period Of time.</li>
    <li> Skin appears clearer.  Optimistic about future results.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!!! Works amazing for skin discoloration.  I have very bad melasma and don&#x27;t like using chemicals. They really don&#x27;t work anyway.  This has lightened all my dark spots dramatically! I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling with melasma.  It works! I leave on for 30 second like another reviewer posted.  Then follow with 20% vit C serum, then manuka honey moisturizing cream.  My face looks amazing since I started this and I&#x27;m 46.</li>
    <li> Not sure about the whitening affect but my skin is left clean and not overly dry. Also unlike the lotion type of soap, I&#x27;ve only used a tiny bit for 2 weeks now. Looks like this one bar will last me an entire year! Woot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the soap for less than a week. After just my second use, I noticed the darkening and scaly skin- which apparently is a burn- but it was in just one small area on my neck. I bought the soap originally in hopes of lightening the dark marks left from my bra straps. I also used it on my neck and underarm areas, where I have hyperpigmentation. Had the soap on for 30 seconds or so and rinsed. Didn&#x27;t use the third day, but did today, along with an exfoliating scrub- concentrating on the burned area. I want to see if that helps the scaliness, darkening. In the interim, I am going to hold off on using this soap. I don&#x27;t want to make anything worse or risk another ugly burn! I wouldn&#x27;t dare use this on my face like I&#x27;ve read in some of the reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for three days and I came out an allergy in the face I thought it was acne but then I told my mom to try it to see if it was that produced the soap allergy and allergy effectively removes soap gives the red beans expensive than you think it is acne</li>
    <li> First time using this soap and it cleans my face/skin so good and plus I know that it will help me get rid of my dark spots caused by acne !</li>
    <li> MY first order was Diana Stadler Papaya Kojic Acid Acid Skin, Wonderful</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks twice a day and unfortunately I don&#x27;t see any changes on my skin. It was a waste of time n not wort $11 dollars for one bar.. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I am fist time user and with my experience;Not the best soap,not the bad soap,I think it is OK with me.But I like papaya authentic soap,</li>
    <li> I am a 54 year old african american woman. i attended a jazz show over the weekend and was sunburned. The soap helped bring my skincolor back and I was amazingly surprised that it tighten my skin.  I started my 55 year old husband using it and it has done wonders to his skin. I also started my 19 year old on it. I think its working on her pimples, I m unsure if she uses every day.I believe if she uses it everyday she will get a better result. There is a slight tingle sometimes. I find if you leave it on a little longer the tigtening effect is more obvious.  I used soap twice a day for about a month and my skintone was back to normal. I am still using soap twice a day. I love it.</li>
    <li> Just leave your skin alone, I learned the hard way and burned my skin, just invest in a good make up and learn to love your self, these majic potions are a scam, if you still insist, contact a dermatologist before you invest, trust me I told me derm and he told me to throw it away ASAP!</li>
    <li> i like this alot the sting it gave at first i got used too its to even the skin not to make you lighter.</li>
    <li> Very effective but use a good moisturizer for face or body.</li>
    <li> I ordered this help lighten my skin and possibly smooth it out some.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the decent reviews I&#x27;ve read on it, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I only used one bar and I&#x27;m almost positive that&#x27;s not enough product or time to rate fairly but&lt;br /&gt;from the little time that I used it, I did not notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Also, people have said that this soap burns. It does not....I&#x27;ve left it on my face and body for half hours at a time and&lt;br /&gt;it has never burned me once.</li>
    <li> if you have dark spots or scars that you want to clear up, this soap along with some Aloe Vera or coco butter will help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since May. It broke me out along with sunspots. I emailed the seller &amp; they told me to use sunscreen. The sunspots cleared &amp; the breakouts went down a little. That is the only change I saw. I used it twice a day for 3 min. Each with a moisturizer &amp; night cream. (That was the recommended time)</li>
    <li> I love this soap my face is so bright and nice after i use this soap I will buy again</li>
</ol>
