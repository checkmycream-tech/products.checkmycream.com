      <li>It is super easy to work with and glides through hair nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Other than that wonderful stuff!</li>
      <li>I love the original eco styler, but this one holds just as well.</li>
      <li>washed of your hands easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first one I used was the eco-olive oil, which gives me good results and hold; however the krystal clumps my curls the way I like.&lt;br /&gt;The curls are full</li>
      <li>but i find if i rub out the excess when it dries its just fine.</li>
      <li>my edges have not laid this smooth since i had a relaxer and my hair has living breathing curls.</li>
      <li>It is imperative that you use this product with a light oil or moisturizer underneath.</li>
      <li>It definitely is light and will build up on your hair if you use it a lot...</li>
      <li>so so cheap</li>
      <li>It does not look like a cheap 99 cent gel container.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to compare this to the $30 boutique natural gels that are out there.  </li>
      <li>The first time she used this product, she showed me the results with more volume and the softness.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this product is the cheap price.</li>
      <li>This gel has a clean scent and can air dry really fast and its wonderful for taming even the most unruly hair in a great slick do.</li>
      <li>I know, right?!  </li>
      <li>I love this gel because of the price, and the fact that it holds without drying too much.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
      <li>I have a super duper Xtra TWA (teeny weeny afro).</li>
      <li>My curls clump together and it dried beautifully, I use shea butter underneath (</li>
      <li>the first time, my twist-out was well-defined and lasted for longer than an hour!</li>
      <li>I occasionally had the flaky stuff on my hair but most of the time it was fine.</li>
      <li>Worth every bit of my 200 pennies.</li>
      <li>It looks more natural, IMO.  </li>
      <li>It gives me a more polished look, and brings out the natural wave I already have.  </li>
      <li>It seems \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; and more natural than LA Look.</li>
      <li>My white hair has a mind of its own, and looks fuzzy without something taming it.  </li>
      <li>Eco Styler is one of the BEST gels for natural African American hair.</li>
      <li>I made the transition to natural three years ago, and have since grown out a head full of voluptuous hair!</li>
      <li>It is huge and will lasta  lifetime for sure, but I am not getting the results I see other ladies get when they use it on their hair.</li>
      <li>I order this product first time</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am sure how to use this product. It is huge and will lasta  lifetime for sure, but I am not getting the results I see other ladies get when they use it on their hair. It definitely is light and will build up on your hair if you use it a lot...your hair will be sticky...</li>
    <li> I loved all the other eco gels cuz this use to get so hard it freezes on on u got this on amazon cuz it was a good price.</li>
    <li> I personally like this Gel because it is for the most part flake-free and being natural I have to use a nice amount when I want to pull my hair back. However, like the other reviews stated if you put other products on your hair such as leave in conditioner you may see that it turns white but only as your applying. The bad part is that it does flake after it drys. So I just try to condition my hair the day before and apply the Gel ofter then there is no flaking involved.</li>
    <li> I have a super duper Xtra TWA (teeny weeny afro). I just did the Big Chop a month ago and I havethe most unruly hair that refuses to stay down. Its stayed down once since I&#x27;ve been natural. I used the EcoStyler today after watching tons and tons of videos and reviews, and I loved it. As soon as I put it in my hair, my curls were straighter than i dont know what, and my waves came out perfectly, shiny, defined and awesome. Love it. I&#x27;m very impressed and it has absolutely no smell. Although I wish it did. I like my hair to have a smell. It does appear white when its mixed with another product. I had shea butter in my hair already when I put it on and it turned white, but it dries to skin tone and i wipe off the excess so I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel. No flakes, no smell and great holdin power. I have very curly hair and I love the way this gel defines individual curls and gives them shine. Only problem when i received my order the lid was craked. Other than that wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair gel I have ever used. The best thing is it leaves NO flakes. My hair is a mix of curl type 3a and 3b. This gel has great hold and defines my curls really well. It leaves them looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find this gel at the usual shopping places I go to, so I ordered it online. I don&#x27;t really like having to order hair gel online. I then remembered to check my local &#x27;Sally Beauty Supply&#x27; and found it there.</li>
    <li> I am have african textured hair 4b/c and i have been natural for about 3 years. I have not been able to get a wash and go look with any other product than the eco styler gels (i have used white, pink and olive oil like them all but pink made my scalp itch)i tried Kinky curly and although my hair did curl to my shock it dried horribly very gooey and sticky and white and i still had a lot of shrinkage. I tried the eco early on and although i saw some curl when it dried there was no definition or curl pattern. Finally i saw something on You Tube I think it was African Export and she was saying for our hair type you have to pile it on and actually apply like a relaxer. I NEVER would have though to do that. I would have thought that would be way, way to much gel. Well it works! my edges have not laid this smooth since i had a relaxer and my hair has living breathing curls. I cannot believe it, i just keep looking at my hair going, whose head of hair is that. My curls clump together and it dried beautifully, I use shea butter underneath (when i dont my hair is a bit dry) and it does turn white but i find if i rub out the excess when it dries its just fine. My advice try it and if you have very tightly coiled and dry hair dont be afraid to be heavy handed with the product you can always scale back later if you apply to much but the only way you will know what your hair can do is if you go for it.</li>
    <li> If you are an african american and have natural hair, this gel is a must! There is a couple of types so you might have to experiment with smaller sizes in order to find which one works for you.&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel. I have 4A hair and I use after a co-wash. I leave in a little Vo5 condish, and use my denman brush to&lt;br /&gt;detangle. Its really IMPORTANT that you use a denman brush to apply the gel to get the best curl defination for your hair. You have to take your hair and part into sections. Apply gel by smoothing from root to ends several times. Go over the hair one time slowly thru with the denman. This process takes about 30-45 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Ive never had a problem with breakage or flakes from this gel and ive been natural for almost a year. Never had any problems with this gel and the price is unbeatable for the type of protection it gives to your hair. This is one of my staple products. Will be purchasing always!!!</li>
    <li> This gel really does define my curls.  I guess if I had to type my hair it would be a 4a/4b.  This defines my curls and leaves my hair shiny.  It does leave my hair a little stiff, but I don&#x27;t mind as my curls look GOOD.  I am impressed and this product is now one of my staples.</li>
    <li> I love this gel because of the price, and the fact that it holds without drying too much. It doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t leave crud under your fingernails, it doesn&#x27;t suffocate your scalp, and it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive scent. It also mixes well with other products I use. I started using this ten years ago, and really didn&#x27;t want to purchase a 2 dollar gel but its better than some of the higher end stuff I have used.</li>
    <li> I love the original eco styler, but this one holds just as well. This is excellent for defining my natural curl pattern and it doesn&#x27;t flake!  You do have to be careful about what you use with this gel to keep white residue from forming in the hair.  The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
    <li> I personally have to say I&#x27;m an addict for the Eco gel.  I was first introduced to this product via youtube and since it has been bliss from there out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I used was the eco-olive oil, which gives me good results and hold; however the krystal clumps my curls the way I like.&lt;br /&gt;The curls are full and I hardly get much shrinkage.  It also lays down kinky edges on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drying doesn&#x27;t take too long.  It&#x27;s about 3-4 hrs (depending the thickness of your hair of course), so there is definitely not a long wait for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a few complaints about this particular Eco that it leaves the hair flaky if applied with leave-ins and moisturizers for example.  I haven&#x27;t experienced it first hand, but I know by day 3 or 4 I start to see some build up and it&#x27;s time to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I love this gel!! Works great on my hair and it&#x27;s the only gel I will use. It doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in my hair and It just makes my hair look neat and controlled. High Recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gell of all time! I use it every day to slick back my hair in a bun. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because Sally Beauty Supply doesn&#x27;t package it well for shipping. The bottle are just placed in a box with no padding, so when I received them, 2 of the three bottles were broken and the gel from one of them was everywhere! Buy this gel, just not from Sally beauty Supply!</li>
    <li> This gel is so amazing, and it is so cheap!!! Only $2. What! I have 4b/4c hair and my hair looks so good. Never thought i would be able to do a wash and go. I am so so pleased! Worth every bit of my 200 pennies. I used the Aragon Oil one, with the auburn top:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using LA Look mega hold for many years and it worked well for me. I occasionally had the flaky stuff on my hair but most of the time it was fine. I decided to try this ECO gel. I like the feel of it on my hair better than LA Look. Both products hold my hair well though. Overall I like this ECO gel better. It seems \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; and more natural than LA Look.</li>
    <li> I have hair that is hard to get to stay in place, so I ordered this hoping it would hold my hair. I have short hair which I spike on top, but this stuff will stay spiked for a while then look limp. It does not hold in place as expected though it does hold some. Just if you want hair to stand up or stay poofed this is not for you! However, as previous reviews noted, there are no flakes from it even when I comb through it later.</li>
    <li> Ive went through a lot of hairstyling gel solutions before, and I gotta say this one is by far one of the best hair styling gels Ive ever used!! I highly recommend this product..</li>
    <li> This is magical on my curly hair. My hair has always been a tad frizzy and after working this through my hair,  I can finally see all of my curls frizz free. Plus: a little goes a long way; you can&#x27;t beat the price either! My wash-and-gos haven&#x27;t looked better! .-_-</li>
    <li> I use these whenever I am rolling my hair, it holds each and every curl in place. It is super easy to work with and glides through hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a great product. I am African American and I wear my hair natural. I have a pretty tight natural curl pattern and I found this product to work really well with holding my curls. However, I did sometimes find my hair to be a bit crunchy after use. It is imperative that you use this product with a light oil or moisturizer underneath. Overall it was a good, affordable alternative to some of the more expensive products for natural hair on the market.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why anyone would consider this gel. Have you read the ingredients? As consumers we need to start reading ingredients. There are healthier and better alternatives.  [...]</li>
    <li> This is a great gel!  It&#x27;s alcohol-free, which is always a plus.  You get sooo much product for such a low price!  I have never said this about gel before: It&#x27;s moisturizing!  I know, right?!  How can that be? I don&#x27;t know, but I love it.  I use it for wash n go curls and for laying edges down.  The texture is quite thick.  Not watery at all. The scent?  Meh. Neither here nor there.  Great hold.  Apply too much.....and you&#x27;ll regret it!  (That&#x27;s with anything, though).  I am able to apply this to my 4a curls and get gorgeous definition.  It&#x27;s water soluble, so no reason to shampoo it out.  Just rinse thoroughly, and proceed with co-washing.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to compare this to the $30 boutique natural gels that are out there.  Those tend to have better ingredients, yes, but they also give a different look.  They give piecier curls...Eco Styler CLUMPS your curls.  It looks more natural, IMO.  It depends on the look you&#x27;re going for.  I do own the expensive gels, as well.... but THIS HERE is a keeper!  It&#x27;s all about technique when doing wash-n-go&#x27;s.    If you&#x27;ve been using brown gel (ew) try Eco Styler.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEEE THIS GEL Its the only gel I use. It does not flake and if it does its only when I try to cake on a few days on it, when I should have washed it out lol. This gel has a clean scent and can air dry really fast and its wonderful for taming even the most unruly hair in a great slick do. Eco have like 6 levels of hold and I must prefer this maximum hold. I have extremely short hair and when I am lazy and need a relaxer and want to look nice, I&#x27;ll slap this in my hair and I get so many compliments. If you add a pretty decent amount to your hair and slick it down it has a wonderful sheen! I&#x27;ll forever be faithful to this gel!!!</li>
    <li> I usually use Jam on my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t hold well or at least not all day.  Also, by the end of the day my hair feels dry.  With the Eco Styler gel I notice that it holds all day and it&#x27;s not too hard.  There is obvious stiffness to my hair, but that&#x27;s to be expected if I want my hair to stay in place.  And if I start messing with my hair after the gel has dried, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried-out like it did with the Jam.  I&#x27;m not saying that Jam is bad for your hair.  It just didn&#x27;t work well with MY hair.  I like the Eco Styler gel and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> The gel holds great and it does not have ANY flakeyness or anything like that. Great gel at a great price. No odor or color and your hair won&#x27;t get that 1950&#x27;s thick gel like look, it looks like there is no gel in your hair. I highly recommend this gel or that you at least try it. I am going to order two more containers just so I have them when mine runs out. Great product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. It has great hold , lasts all day too. I use it every day and you don&#x27;t need alot of product. And the price couldn&#x27;t be better....so much less than those sold at hair salons.</li>
    <li> if you need a product that will hold your hair, not smell perfumed and not feel greasy this is it.&lt;br /&gt;Also washed of your hands easily.</li>
    <li> I have 3b curls and this is the only gel I can use that doesn&#x27;t flake and has a strong hold but doesn&#x27;t turn my hair into one big crunchy ringlet. And it&#x27;s cheap, so I don&#x27;t feel bad using lots of it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this exact brand of hair gel for anyone looking to style their hair. Most gels leave the hair looking dried out, while this one allows your hair to stay completely dry, yet remain the \\&quot;wet look.\\&quot; So far I&#x27;ve been using this gel in moderation for about 2 months and still have about 75% of the container left. 5/5.</li>
    <li> One Spring, I became frustrated that my bantu knot-outs and twist-outs drooped before I&#x27;d even arrive at my destination, or sometimes would never come out defined to begin with. My hair would end up looking just awful every day, and that made me sad. I knew I needed a plan. I browsed natural hair forums, blogs and photos, and found out about Eco Styler Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blend a large amount of Eco Styler Gel into my DIY shea butter mix (a homemade mix of shea and cocoa butters and various natural essential and carrier oils). I have never used Eco Styler Gel alone, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works by itself. When combined with my shea butter mix, Eco Styler Gel provides superior hold that is not crispy, crunchy or flaky, and adds more shine, no matter what the season or weather. Eco Styler Gel is a lifesaver.  ♥</li>
    <li> This ideas delivered with two containers, one leaked because the container cracked and the other was half full?&lt;br /&gt;Get it from someone else.  Wish I could send a picture.</li>
    <li> I use this to twist my hair (dreadlocks) and it last long.  Even though it has a strong hold my hair does not feel stiff.  It neither leave a white residue nor does it flake.</li>
    <li> I love this gel!!!!    Absoulutely works wonders on my child&#x27;s curly hair. I use it for my 4 year old daughter who is tender headed.  It&#x27;s clear, flake free. It conditions the hair, and makes the hair more manageable. It doesn&#x27;t flatten her Afro puffs, and shows more volume than brown gel. Her hair is soft after using this, not wet/sticky.    Sometimes my teenage daughter combs my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. The first time she used this product, she showed me the results with more volume and the softness. She likes this gel much better than brown gel.    I had a problem with brown gels drying and caking with her curly hair texture. I no longer have to comb hardened brown gel flakes, or wash them out of her hair which is a pain.    Will purchase a bigger tub, tested a small tube.</li>
    <li> Just not working for my hair. I like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s supposed to be a more natural product, but it still has alcohol in it, and it isn&#x27;t stiff enough to anything for my hair. I ended up throwing it away. Sorry, but Im only giving it two stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural four years now and I have 4b/4c hair. I use this product with taliah waajid products and my hair comes out amazing. This gel left my hair feeling soft and moisturized. It just doesn&#x27;t have enough hold for me. The pink gel has the right amount of hold and softness without leaving my hair crunchy. The Krystal gel is great product too. It leaves your hair feeling moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t flake either. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a four star is because it didn&#x27;t have the hold I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love, This is beyond what I expected with a hair gel, all others tend to get stiff and sometimes my hair would break off when touching the stiff as a board hair; but not this. There are no words, I now understand why everyone with natural hair or textured hair speak highly of this product. Got a customer for life yo!</li>
    <li> I have jewish curly and thick hair.  It often gets very dry.  This is the best gel I&#x27;ve used (for the price) to keep it stylied and still be able to have a really good hold throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this gel, it&#x27;s easy to work with, it holds it does not smell bad, its made in the USA and it&#x27;s not tested on animals!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my natural 4c African American hair. I prefer the Olive Oil Edge Control. This specific hair gel is just like all the other brands that slick your hair back for 15 mins and then releases. However, it does make my hair really soft afterwards and there is no build up. I may use it with a scarf when I run out of my Olive Oil Edge Control...</li>
    <li> I usually dont use gel, because they make your hair so hard, and causes breakage. This works well...securing fly-aways and leaving my hair soft and not sticky.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The container is sturdy and has a professional look. It does not look like a cheap 99 cent gel container.&lt;br /&gt;2) The price is perfect. It&#x27;s not too expensive or too cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I have gotten some dandruff on my hair as a result of this product. It may be a bit harsh on your scalp.</li>
    <li> This hair gel works great if you know how to use it. I am African american and have natural hair. When using this product your hair must be soaking wet. When applying the gel, a little goes a long way. Do not saturate your hair with the gel or else your hair will get hard and start to flake.&lt;br /&gt;I personally like to put a small amount of glycerin in my hair before adding the gel. Once the gel is in my hair I do not apply any more products and just style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this gel as an everyday gel unless you wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the pink version of this gel many years ago, but stopped because it just wasn&#x27;t holding up anymore. I have very curly, coarse hair that likes to give me hell just because. I&#x27;ve used everything from oils, creams, all kinds of gel, mousse, EVERYTHING! My bathroom looks like the hair product isle at Rite Aid! Not anymore. I bought this a few weeks ago and did my typical curly girl method of cowashing, leave-in conditioner, applied gel, plopped for 30 minutes and diffused. I was incredibly shocked at the final result!! No frizz! No straight, difficult strands of hair, and the CLUMPS!! OH THE CLUMPS!!! I&#x27;m in love! I would recommend this gel to anyone who is looking for a very strong hold that defines curls, doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair, and provides zero flakes.  I went to my local Sally&#x27;s and bought two of the larger tubs for $6 total. They&#x27;re on sale so if you&#x27;re near a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, get your butt over there and stock up! I am also going to post a picture of the final result of my curly hair using this gel.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s clear.</li>
    <li> I order this product first time and i thought it will be a bigger size it came Small but package well</li>
    <li> Of all the ECO Styler gels, this one give the best hold for hard-to-hold hair.  No alcohol is in the product so no breakage will occur.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-Really good for crunching out the curl when your hair is dry, leaving curls really soft and defined afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is almost nonexistent, but fresh&lt;br /&gt;-NO SILICONES OR SULFATES!&lt;br /&gt;-Water-based&lt;br /&gt;-So so so cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Good hold (even against gravity! I&#x27;ve used it to give my niece a fauxhawk before lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t work all that well as a spray gel, probably because it&#x27;s water-based&lt;br /&gt;-Can leave weird white chunks of product in your hair if you don&#x27;t spread it thinly enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;This is an absolute staple for my 3b hair. I would recommend it anyone, even people with straight hair. 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4a/3c hair that is very dry. I am typically skeptical about gels, but I decided to give this a try since it has the same ingredients as the Olive Oil Ecostyler gel that almost ALL naturals swear by. However, this gel leaves my hair too dry and crunchy even after I moisturize and seal prior to using it. Also, this does not hold my hair like the Olive Oil Edge Control gel.  Will not repurchase, hopefully my little cousin can use it. The only good thing about this product is the cheap price. I purchased this gel from a local hair store. Too bad I can&#x27;t get a refund :(</li>
    <li> Eco Styler is one of the BEST gels for natural African American hair. I love that I can mix it with my oils and it doesn&#x27;t affect it. It provides great hold and curl definition. I use it on wet hair and mix it with almond and tea tree oil. It makes my curls pop and holds them all day. The only down side is that it does make your hair a little stiff but I don&#x27;t mind it. I will be trying the olive oil one next time.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel ever. I kept having the problem of all other gels flaking. It goes on well, has the right amount of hold, smells good and it doesnt flake.</li>
    <li> My white hair has a mind of its own, and looks fuzzy without something taming it.  This gel is water based, so it doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky or oily residue.  You can actually re-wet your hair to re-tame the frizzies from rain or wind.  I use it every time I wash my hair, and I don&#x27;t need to wash it out at night.  It gives me a more polished look, and brings out the natural wave I already have.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and it can be very difficult to slick my hair back...with all the curls and all but this product really came through. I had an interview and wanted to look professional. This was the only gel in my cache of hair products that meet my standard.</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend! I&#x27;m African American, have naturally curly hair (4a-4b), that&#x27;s about 4-5 inches past my shoulders. I have tried several gels in the last few years - Kinky Curly, Shea Moisture, Black &amp; Lovely, Aloe Vera - resulting in stickiness, crunchiness, or hair that would never dry. Because of this, I assumed my hair could not receive gel, and learned to embrace the frizz or just throw my hair in a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I decided this just isn&#x27;t fair! I made the transition to natural three years ago, and have since grown out a head full of voluptuous hair! I want to be able to wear it out and have some definition! So, I decided to try Eco Styler Gel. I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, my twist-out was well-defined and lasted for longer than an hour! There was absolutely NO crunch, and while my hair was moisturized, it wasn&#x27;t sticky. For the life of me, I have no idea how this stuff works. It clumps my curls without drying. I am in awe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: BUY IT NOW! You will not regret taking a chance on this stuff. And believe me, I do not sing praises very often or easily; I&#x27;m highly critical. Give it a shot!</li>
