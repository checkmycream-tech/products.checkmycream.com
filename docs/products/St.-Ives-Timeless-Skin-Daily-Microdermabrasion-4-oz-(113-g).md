      <li>I like to feel a good scrub on my face</li>
      <li>I loved the witch hazel</li>

      <li>This product is just as good as the others on the market  which sell for much more !</li>
      <li>I use it every day, and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs but none of them work as well!</li>
      <li>I love this scrub!</li>
      <li>so meanwhile I&#x27;m using my Clinique&#x27;s 7 day Scrub and St Ives product is wayy cheaper and works better!</li>
      <li>I used to buy this scrub consistently and always got wonderful results.</li>
      <li>I love this scrub!  </li>
      <li>I feel that my skin is more radiant, softer and smoother!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>It also have a nice scent.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;ve been hunting for a good microdermabrasion product since The Body Shop reformulated theirs to be more like (ironically) St. Ives&#x27; apricot scrub.</li>
      <li>It also has a bit of a nice smell, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.    </li>
      <li>but I would love to find more of this stuff!</li>
      <li>Purchased this to use on my fair, mildly oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I liked this product because it helped with my fine lines.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t try to scrub; the St. Ives does that for you, even if you are very lightly touching your skin.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful exfoliator, especially for the price!  </li>
      <li>I realize most people love that, but I don&#x27;t).</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I was worried that I might break out more because it isn&#x27;t labeled as noncomodogenic or oil-free, but I have been so pleased.</li>
      <li>But this St. Ives product would be better for those who need something gentler.  </li>
      <li>As well, you can receive the BEST results using not your hands but some sort of facial scrubber or brush (iSkin, Clarisonic)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better microdermabrasions.  </li>
      <li>But this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate at all, and my face does seem better after I use it.  </li>
      <li>Most scrubs do not serve me well because of the size of my pores compared to the size of the \\&quot;beads.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I would recommend buying more than one because St. Ives has discontinued the production of this product.</li>
      <li>i love how it makes my face feel.</li>
      <li>It appears that my local stores no longer carry this product, so I was very happy to find it online at Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I love St. Ives products.  </li>
      <li>but whenever I use it I feel really smooth &amp; nice skin.</li>
      <li>Also, on a side note, I LOVE how makeup primer goes on after using this...</li>
      <li>St. Ives products work as well or better than many of the pricier choices out there.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT,</li>
      <li>Do I need to say more?</li>

      <li>I have been using St. Ives products for years and am very impressed with the Timeless Skin facial line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Philosophy&#x27;s microdermabrasion kit and this is better.</li>
      <li>It does what it says, you have to use it more than once to see the results.</li>
      <li>i like this, so much better than the olay thermal one.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I never realized how special and amazing it is until I ran out.</li>
      <li>It is a nice scrub, and its a plus that you dont have to have any special tool to use with the scrub.</li>
      <li>St Ives&#x27;s product work pretty good</li>
      <li>Works great and makes my face look so clear and even :]</li>
      <li>Super-clear, fine, smooth skin for such a great price, thank you St. Ives!!!</li>
      <li>Overall a great product, though I was looking for a srub that was more nitty-gritty.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you want a good exfoliator that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
      <li>Four stars because it doesn&#x27;t help with my stubborn blackheads, but it&#x27;s good for normal face washing and keeps my acne at bay.</li>
      <li>it was fine.</li>
      <li>I use it two to three times a week and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth without drying it out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how smooth and refreshed my skin feels.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and the results have been fantastic.</li>
      <li>and I do not experience any dryness that cannot be combated with a light moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This makes my skin so smooth.  </li>
      <li>Such a great at-home micrdodermabrasion wash.</li>
      <li>I use this scrub with my clarisonic and I have baby smooth skin.</li>
      <li>It takes a few rinses to get all of the crystals off my skin, so it may be best to use in the shower.   </li>
      <li>I use it every morning, and I love the way it leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh for the start of another day.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth  and not stripped of moisture.</li>
      <li>It even makes my hands feel so smooth and clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>Love it so much!</li>
      <li>so got on amazon and found the newest facial cream and scrub and am loving using them again!</li>
      <li>It foams up nicely, has a nice scent and good exfoliating abilities, can be purchased at your local grocery or drug store, and can be quickly used daily in a minute during your shower.</li>
      <li>but the face does feel clean after use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed how clean my skin felt after using this.</li>
      <li>and when I wash my face with this product it feels clean no residue or anything.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and can be used daily.</li>
      <li>I used to be an avid user of a similar Mary Kay product, that cost way more and had similar results, best for price and results!!!</li>
      <li>The scrub is a good skin exfoliant, yes, but the tiny crystals work their way into my eyes when I rinse.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin and smells really fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I can start using it on a more regular basis!!</li>
      <li>Works super well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> St Ives&#x27;s product work pretty good I have been using them for a long time. I liked this product because it helped with my fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful exfoliator, especially for the price!  I use it two to three times a week and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth without drying it out.  I have a few sun spots on my chest so I also use it on them and they seem to be fading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed how clean my skin felt after using this. It really cleans deep into your pores, just make sure to keep out of eyes.</li>
    <li> Love it so much! Do I need to say more? Seriously, every girl needs one... must use every day (or every other day)!</li>
    <li> Purchased this to use on my fair, mildly oily, acne-prone skin. LOVE how smooth my skin feels after, and it also helps gently exfoliate the dead skin left over from drying acne.  I have only used it a few times, so I can&#x27;t say whether it helps w/ breakouts or not, but so far, I really like it!  Update: Been using for a little over a week and though I still am dealing w/ acne, I don&#x27;t think this is making it any worse or causing more pimples. I would recommend to those with acne to barely touch the surface of your skin as you put it on your face. Don&#x27;t try to scrub; the St. Ives does that for you, even if you are very lightly touching your skin. Anything more, and you will possibly irritate the heck out of your acne.  Also, on a side note, I LOVE how makeup primer goes on after using this... it&#x27;s as though your skin couldn&#x27;t possibly be softer. Great product....changing from 4 stars to 5!</li>
    <li> I finally had to throw this product away. The scrub is a good skin exfoliant, yes, but the tiny crystals work their way into my eyes when I rinse. They scratch and leave my eyes irritated for days after use.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for a year.  This makes my skin so smooth.  When they stopped selling this in my area I started rationing my last tube. A little goes a long way so I haven&#x27;t run out yet, but I&#x27;m glad I can start using it on a more regular basis!! I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs but none of them work as well!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I never realized how special and amazing it is until I ran out. I have pretty dry but clear skin but lately I&#x27;ve been noticing a few tiny bumps in random places in my face like near forehead or nose, and I realized I don&#x27;t use a proper exfoliator since I&#x27;ve run out of this. I just use Neutrogena&#x27;s grapefruit wash in the morning and Olay&#x27;s total effects cream cleanser at night, and it man it shows. My skin isn&#x27;t as fresh as before, or soft, and exfoliating is SO important! I haven&#x27;t been able to find this exact product lately so meanwhile I&#x27;m using my Clinique&#x27;s 7 day Scrub and St Ives product is wayy cheaper and works better! When I used to use this product my skin was always super fresh and soft, brand new and although I scrubbed everyday, as long as I didn&#x27;t rub it in like crazy it was fine. would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have tried a lot of facial scrubs and they tend to either be too harsh (like scrubbing your face with rocks) or too soft (don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything).  This product, however, is just right.  It foams up nicely, has a nice scent and good exfoliating abilities, can be purchased at your local grocery or drug store, and can be quickly used daily in a minute during your shower.</li>
    <li> This Product Is Wonderful. It Is the best face scrub around. St Ives thank You for this product.. Viki</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost all of the st. ives apricot scrub variations, and I chose to try this one because the word \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; caught my eye. I thought that it would be a good way to get rid of the dead skin buildup on my face that results in all of my acne. When I first tried it, I noticed that this product does not leave you with the extremely soft and exfoliated skin that the st. ives apricot scrub did when you wash it off. But I also think it  does a better job of actually cleaning the dead skin and oil buildup. All-in-all, It is probably going to become my new daily facial wash, but I recommend that you use some sort of toner (for oily skin) or moisturizer (for dry skin) with it, because I don&#x27;t think it will do everything on its own. As well, you can receive the BEST results using not your hands but some sort of facial scrubber or brush (iSkin, Clarisonic)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it every day.  After about a month of daily use I noticed it has decreased the size of my pores and caused my skin to look much younger and healthier.  I am hooked.  It is gentle - very gentle on my skin, it does not hurt or irritate it at all.  It is a much more economical way to have skin that looks like you get a facial all the time.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone - male and female - it works! It appears that my local stores no longer carry this product, so I was very happy to find it online at Amazon.com.  I received it quickly and in brand new condition, just like in the store.  Thank you! I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I found this item recently and have fallen in love with it!  I use it every morning, and I love the way it leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh for the start of another day.  I use drying agents on my face at night for problematic skin and also use mineral powder make-up during the day.  This product prepares my face by removing the flaky skin gently and preparing my face for the application of my make-up.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Such a great at-home micrdodermabrasion wash. After about a week, my skin was unbelievably soft and my pores were definitely minimized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled a lot with beauty items for my face and have been frustrated even with Clinique (moisturizers too heavy, astringents too astringenty). A few pimples here and there especially when I&#x27;m stressed out have kept me from having the clear skin I know I can have. But this stuff is amazing! Its gentle enough to use every day and cheap enough to do it with zero guilt! Super-clear, fine, smooth skin for such a great price, thank you St. Ives!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have large pores and acne scars, and it has worked very well. My skin is visibly smoother, and the pores are smaller. I was worried that I might break out more because it isn&#x27;t labeled as noncomodogenic or oil-free, but I have been so pleased. I will absolutely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review before but for this I couldn&#x27;t help myself. I have very oily skin. I tried almost every single product out there for my acne, even proactive. But after trying this I don&#x27;t think I want to try anything else. I use it every morning. It cleans your face very well and my dark spots are fading also. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as the others on the market  which sell for much more ! It leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth  and not stripped of moisture.</li>
    <li> This product rocks! After the first use you can see/feel a big difference in the quality of your skin. The crystals are super fine and with a gentle scrubing, it polishes away dry, dead skin, and leaves bright smooth skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin and smells really fresh and clean. Because it only takes are little amount, this 4oz tube will last a good while (at least 2-3 months with 1-2 uses a week    I developed mild adult acne about 1yr ago and had been fighting the good fight to get my even toned, smooth, healthy skin back.  I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on creams, cleansers, moisturizers, etc trying to find the right combo to clear my very dry skin and it seemed that nothing worked for long. This product has cleared up my acne and is slowly erasing my blemishes too.  Although it says \\&quot;daily\\&quot; I only use it 1 to 2 times a week because I have dry skin, but it works just as good as the first time, everytime. For daily use I wash my face morning and night with [[ASIN:B000NVF42A St. Ives Swiss Formula Makeup Remover &amp; Facial Cleanser All Skin Types 6 oz.]] I use [[ASIN:B0002FBOLW ATOPALM MLE Intensive Cream 2.19oz]] to moisturize afterward and my skin has the perfect glow. It takes a few rinses to get all of the crystals off my skin, so it may be best to use in the shower.   I would suggest this to everyone! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and the results have been fantastic. With a little more time, I&#x27;m sure my small blemishes and dry skin areas will be completely gone!</li>
    <li> i like this, so much better than the olay thermal one. this one doesnt irritate and you can feel it has A LOOTT more little crystals in it which is nice. looking forward to buying another one when i run out.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub! I use it every other day. Works great and makes my face look so clear and even :] I would recommend this ~</li>
    <li> GREAT Skin cleanser.....</li>
    <li> I used to buy this scrub consistently and always got wonderful results. It began to be harder to find it in stores, and it looks like they have discontinued it in the US market. I tried to purchase some online, but $30+ dollars a tube is a joke! I never paid more than $8 at any store. I get that the item is discontinued and hard to find, but for that amount I can find another product at a high end beauty store (or make my own!). St Ives should feel bad about releasing a good product, getting people hooked, and pulling it off the market so scalpers can sell it for 3x what they charged.</li>
    <li> works great! skin feels soft and smooth after use. would totally recommend for anyone who wants softer more youthful looking skin</li>
    <li> I had been trying out all different face washes because in my mid-twenties, for some reason, I&#x27;ve started breaking out worse than I ever did as a teenager... This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve tried and for a good price. It really feels like a microdermabrasion treatment at a fraction of the cost! It leaves your skin so soft and clean feeling. It even makes my hands feel so smooth and clean after I use it. Unfortunately, after trying to purchase more I learned that it is discontinued! I&#x27;m not sure why but I would love to find more of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Another wonderful St. Ives product!  After using this light textured scrub, my face feels soft and smooth and it helps keep breakouts down.  I use with the collagen facial moisturizer and it is an awesome combination and my face has improved in looks since switching back to the St. Ives brand.  I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores like I used to but got tired of the other brands not doing what St. Ives always did for me so got on amazon and found the newest facial cream and scrub and am loving using them again!</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives products.  However, I was a bit disappointed with this one.  After using the product daily for 3 days my face started flaking and peeling.  I was not prepared for this at all.  And so my skin has been looking horrible for a few days.  I must point out that I was not sunburned or under any extraneous conditions, I massaged in the product correctly, and moisturized properly afterwards.  I realize that this product might not have the same effect on everyone (even though I don&#x27;t have particularly delicate skin).  I do not recommend this product simply because the St. Ives apricot scrub is better for a daily exfoliating routine, costs a lot less, is easily available in drug stores, and you do not run the chance of looking like you&#x27;re shedding.</li>
    <li> this stuff does exactly what it says. i love how it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub!  I have tried almost every over-the-counter face wash and exfoliant out there but after trying this one I stopped experimenting.  The grit is extremely fine which is a huge plus for me because I have very small pores.  Most scrubs do not serve me well because of the size of my pores compared to the size of the \\&quot;beads.\\&quot;  I use this product daily along with an acne spot treatment and I do not experience any dryness that cannot be combated with a light moisturizer.  Every time I wash my face I&#x27;m amazed at how smooth and refreshed my skin feels.  DEFINITELY worth trying.  I only wish St. Ives would market this one better because I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores since the first time I purchased it over a year ago and ordering it online is not my idea of convenience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t aggravate my skin, and I was sure I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a microdermabrasion product that wouldn&#x27;t.  But this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate at all, and my face does seem better after I use it.  Four stars because it doesn&#x27;t help with my stubborn blackheads, but it&#x27;s good for normal face washing and keeps my acne at bay.</li>
    <li> leaves skin feeling like velvet, and has a great scent too.  not overly fruity or medical like some.  i use 2-3 times per week, and it is not overly harsh for that frequency.</li>
    <li> Well... the product is not what is pictured, however, it is still another St. Ives microdermabrasion product, just not the one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why they couldn&#x27;t just picture the product that they actually sell, but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been disappointed by St. Ives yet so I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
    <li> i WANTED TO RETRACT MY PRIVIOUS REVIEW ABOUT THIS SELLER. I SAID THE WRONG PRODUCT WAS SENT AND HAD NOT HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE SINCE I CONTACTED THE SELLER, WELL LOW AND BEHOLD, WHEN I GOT HOME THAT EVENING I HAD THE CORRECT PRODUCT SITTING IN MY MAILBOX WITH A RETURN LABEL FOR THE OTHER PRODUCT. SO, MY APPOLOGIES TO THE SELLER.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a long time, ever since I found it in the store, probably close to about a year ago.  My skin is amazingly soft, thanks to my using it twice a day. I love that it is not very harsh on the skin- I can use it morning and night with my other skincare products with NO problems, and it helps get rid of dead skin that would give my face a dull appearance. It also has a bit of a nice smell, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.    I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this product, because, well, I don&#x27;t usually have problems with St Ives :)</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been hunting for a good microdermabrasion product since The Body Shop reformulated theirs to be more like (ironically) St. Ives&#x27; apricot scrub. Really, I was looking for something that worked and felt like the crystal-type consistency of The Body Shop&#x27;s original formula. When I got this product (based on the reviews), I was a little disappointed that the consistency felt different (very very fine grain - I realize most people love that, but I don&#x27;t). However, the second I washed it off, I was thrilled with how well it actually works. This is leaps and bounds ahead of other products I&#x27;ve tried. It genuinely leaves your face smooth and I think it has improved the ability of my other skin care products to soak in. I also notice the dull quality of my skin when I haven&#x27;t used it for a few days. Also - the price is fantastic for something that actually works well. I&#x27;ve used Philosophy&#x27;s microdermabrasion kit and this is better. I&#x27;ve found it impossible to find in any drugstores (I hope this changes soon), which is why I got it from Amazon. Big shout out to the seller because there was some kind of a shipping snafu initially and I didn&#x27;t get my first order. I let them know and they reshipped no questions asked and magically my order arrived a few days later. It was very good of them to do that.</li>
    <li> This is an above average product.  It left my skin soft but not much more than than that.  I&#x27;d buy it again because you can&#x27;t go wrong with St. Ives products!</li>
    <li> St. Ives products work as well or better than many of the pricier choices out there.  This product is no exception.  It is very difficult to find, so I was happy Amazon carries it.  Thank you St. Ives for not testing on animals!</li>
    <li> I tried this along with many other products at 10x this price and now I use Medical Grade Aluminum Oxide crystals, yes it is the same crystals they use in the machines at the Doctors, I use it with a flat buffing pad and it is much cheaper and more effective than this or olay or anything else on the market.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is gentle and rinses well. I would recommend buying more than one because St. Ives has discontinued the production of this product.</li>
    <li> Never tested on animals but I&#x27;m wild about this stuff.  I use morning and night in combination with other purchased amazon products I recommend so please tr it if your skin feels dull or lifeless toy you, it will change it.  It&#x27;s gentle yet its definatley exfoliating to the max. I&#x27;m recommending it and stocking up.      ADD:  Now that I have had it a while  - they need to make the bottles bigger - MORE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I, however, found it to be too gentle for me.  I like to feel a good scrub on my face and this was not gritty enough.  I&#x27;m back to [[ASIN:B0000CCW1N derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub, 2 oz (56 g)]].  When I use the derma e product I feel like it&#x27;s really giving me a microdermabrasion.  But this St. Ives product would be better for those who need something gentler.  It has a pleasant scent and can be used daily.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product. It wasn&#x27;t bad either, just adequate.&lt;br /&gt; I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t bother me. Can&#x27;t say it really did much in terms of exfoliation though. Much better products out there in the same price range.</li>
    <li> excellent scrub, i use this also on my body and it feels great.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t want to risk overdoing it by using it daily. I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other scrubs, but every time after I&#x27;ve used it I feel that my skin is more radiant, softer and smoother!</li>
    <li> This is a super product that can be used daily. Removes makeup, is gentle, yet keeps my skin soft and smooth. For the money, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I used this product everyday for a while after receiving it. It was nice that it isn&#x27;t irritating and that you can use it everyday. But I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> The best face cleanser I have ever used. My acne was horrible before I started using this. And then I noticed my skin started to clear up after washing my face with this product everyday, using a over-the-counter medicated face moisturizer, and taking a zinc supplement everyday. Then I ran out of it and  boy did I freak out! It&#x27;s a must have and is very affordable. I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT!</li>
    <li> I use this scrub everyday and my skin has been transformed because of it.  The product smooths the skin and fades brown spots.  I never want to be without it!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has sensitive skin and unfortunately her skin did not react well to this product.  I used it too and it worked on my skin and really cleared up my face.  However, my girlfriend had a different reaction, her face has a burning sensation as well as her hands.  So just keep in mind of how your skin sensitive your skin is.</li>
    <li> I like this scrub and it is very nourishing to your skin, It has helped with my skintone and the hyperpigmentation I suffer from. Be very careful when using this scrub on face, you don&#x27;t have to scrub your face hard, just gently sweep it over your face and st ives will take care of the rest :.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and when I wash my face with this product it feels clean no residue or anything.  I highly recommend this prodocut!  Good job St. Ives sorry you pulled off the shelves and we can only order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better microdermabrasions.  I was hoping to like this one, because it&#x27;s for daily use.  It seemed to work well at first, but now my skin is back to looking dull.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to wash off, and does not do much for the pores on my nose. Also you have to take extra care to wash the hairline, else you end up with white film ....but the face does feel clean after use</li>
    <li> I used this product after reading that it could help refine pores and keep acne at bay. This product really did nothing for my skin and the bottle was small enough for it to really not be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would much rather use Mary Kay&#x27;s MicroDermabrasion set over this. With that set I can feel the difference and my pores disappear.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of dermabrasion to keep my skin clear and healthy.  I use it every day, and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Works super well.  Husband uses it, too!</li>
    <li> I love this product. So far I have used it for 3 days in a row. My skin has gotten smoother, and more even in tone. It is a nice scrub, and its a plus that you dont have to have any special tool to use with the scrub. It also have a nice scent. This is a great product. I think everybody should have a tube of St. Ives Microderm-Abrasion. It also helps your makeup to go on smoother.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub. I am kind of a lazy person so I don&#x27;t use it regularly but whenever I use it I feel really smooth &amp; nice skin.</li>
    <li> This St. Ives product makes the skin feel so soft and supple.  I need to use a scrub at least several times a week to combat dry skin.  I&#x27;ve tried other microdermabrasion products that were harsh and led to breakouts and skin lesions.  Not so with St. Ives Timeless Skin.  The granules in the product are very fine and quite small. If you are looking for a product with a thicker consistency, you might try [[ASIN:B00068CG3U Philosophy Microdelivery Purifying Peel]], which I had a good experience with but was costly.  This product helps me keep my skin clear and at a price that is not shocking. Timeless Skin has a slight floral scent.  I am typically very sensitive to products with fragrance but could tolerate this one quite well.  For extra softness, I turn to [[ASIN:B000GZJITI California Baby Calendula Cream, 2 oz]] after using Timeless Skin.</li>
    <li> This is the killer for your eyes. No matter how careful I was not to get it in my eyes I still ended up with &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; stuck between my eyelashes, under my eyelids, in the corners of my eyes. It takes several hours to get rid of it. You can imagine what it does to your cornea.&lt;br /&gt;I had to do eye irrigation, just like for chemicals in the case of emergency.&lt;br /&gt;Facial Apricot scrub of the same company does much better job without damage to your eyes.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law recommended this to me after seeing it on Dr. Oz.  I loved the witch hazel she (and he) recommended, but this did nothing to help with my acne.  Back to Proactive for me!</li>
    <li> I use this scrub with my clarisonic and I have baby smooth skin. Highly recommended if you want a good exfoliator that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> good exfoliator, would buy again...great value</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!!! Exfoliates like no other , leaves skin looking amazing fesh and clear!!!! I think this product might be discontinued because I can only find it here on Amazon!!! I used to be an avid user of a similar Mary Kay product, that cost way more and had similar results, best for price and results!!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting an abrasive scrub but since it is used as apart of a daily routine, I understand why it feels so gentle. My skin feels softer and brighter after one use and I use it every morning to wake up feeling refreshed. Overall a great product, though I was looking for a srub that was more nitty-gritty.</li>
    <li> I miss it so much - it&#x27;s been discontinued... WHY?????  I can&#x27;t find a replacement for it :(</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Wish it was still being made.  The only product that made my skin clear and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives products for years and am very impressed with the Timeless Skin facial line. I have used this product and am very impressed with it. I would recomend this to anyone. It does what it says, you have to use it more than once to see the results. I also recomend using the entire line together to see the results. I do have a hard time finding it and the price is really high. I will continue to buy it when I can only because I love this facial product and St. Ives is my only skin care. Please bring this product back.</li>
    <li> TOO expensive compared to the many years I have ordered this product.  I will start to find this product hopefully at a price half the price.  I have never had to pay this price.  But it is a very good product.</li>
