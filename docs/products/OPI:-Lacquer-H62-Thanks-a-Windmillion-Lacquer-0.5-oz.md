      <li>I love the color  , quality is  great as usual  </li>
      <li>very pretty.  </li>
      <li>Like everyone else before me, I think it is a beautiful milky green color.</li>
      <li>I also used a clear top coat to make my shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I painted two coats on a Wednesday, Thursday I painted 1 more coat and Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.</li>
      <li>Without the top coat the color is not shiny, it&#x27;s kind of dull.</li>
      <li>I purchased this some time ago when the Holland collection first came out.</li>
      <li>Pretty on my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty color.</li>
      <li>The quality is consistent with the wearing power of OPI.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s much more of a Tiffany &amp; Co. blue than the light blue that it looks in the pic</li>
      <li>idk i just really like this for the spring/summer maybe even fall seasons.</li>

      <li>It still looks professional enough for work and fun enough to go out on a date.</li>
      <li>it is a cool, subdued green, not too bright or flashy but</li>
      <li>its a really pretty sea foam-y green.</li>

<li> the only things wrong is that it doesnt dry as quick as my other opi..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little different than the picture</li>
<li> The color in the picture looks darker because the photo was taken at night in artificial light.</li>
<li> I tried wearing this several times before it dawned on me why I was having trouble.</li>
<li> and I think I will be picking up a few other colors from it.</li>
<li> (there&#x27;s definitely a little green in it).  </li>
<li> It looks like a sage green.</li>
<li> It was difficult to paint on the second layer because this formula felt too thick.</li>
<li> My bottle was too thick.</li>
<li> I dislike thick layers because I find that the nail polish chips easier if the polish covers the nails too thickly.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a bright color</li>
<li> When I painted my nails with a thin layer of this nail polish, it streaked.</li>

    <li> Nice color, i also like it with the matte top coat</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to get different colors and this one is a great summer color for those of us who don&#x27;t have gel nails!</li>
    <li> I am sanaa latham&#x27;s complexion and I really love the way the color looks against my hands and toes.  It&#x27;s not too out there, but still in line with the current pastel trend.  It still looks professional enough for work and fun enough to go out on a date.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a muted soft green. It&#x27;s not a bright color and I get complements on it everytime I wear it.</li>
    <li> Everyone that sees in this color in my stash loves it but I don&#x27;t think it looks that great on tan skin but gorgeous on white or pale skin amazing. Great quality like always!</li>
    <li> I cannot get this color retail anymore, so bought 3 on-line.  I get many compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> Great color for every season. It looks a lot better on your nails than in the bottle. I love it.</li>
    <li> This has been my color for several years but has become harder to find as OPI retires their colors. It&#x27;s just what I wanted and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> The quality is consistent with the wearing power of OPI.  &amp;#34;Thanks a Windmillion&amp;#34; is very flattering on my fair skin tone- it is a cool, subdued green, not too bright or flashy but very pretty.  Requires about 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Looks great on fingers and toes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly and smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would look good on most skin types - Enjoy</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful, I am fair skinned and it looks great on me. It also works for stamping nails.</li>
    <li> love the color.  easily one of my favorite colors once it finishes i shall order another one.  thank you guys</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of compliments!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this colour when I ordered it but I LOVE it.  I get more compliments on this colour than on the other 30+ colours I have. I think its because its so unique, and the colour looks really good on nails.</li>
    <li> This is the best color ever. It looks like a sage green. Pretty on my skin tone.</li>
    <li> In LOVE with this color!</li>
    <li> This color is awesome!  It&#x27;s a little different than the picture looks though, it&#x27;s much more of a Tiffany &amp; Co. blue than the light blue that it looks in the pic (there&#x27;s definitely a little green in it).  It pretty much goes with anything and is perfect for the Spring and Summer months!</li>
    <li> A color for all seasons</li>
    <li> My new favorite color!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful and looks great on any skin tone.. the only things wrong is that it doesnt dry as quick as my other opi.. idk . but its a great buy love it</li>
    <li> not so gorgeous formula. I tried wearing this several times before it dawned on me why I was having trouble. My bottle was too thick. I added 4 drops of polish thinner and now it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this colour. I ended up doing the same thing to &#x27;Roll in the Hague\\&quot; and \\&quot; Kiss Me on my Tulips.\\&quot; Great fix for all three which makes sense since they are all part of the same collection.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like color too opaque. Gave it away</li>
    <li> Unique color. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Super color!  I lean towards and blues and greens and this is my favorite after Go on Green by OPI.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Good service. I was extremely satisfied withnthe promt service...I received an email within hours of my purchase. The item was well wrapped (considering the fact thatbsome nail polishes aren&#x27;t wrapped and then brake in the shipping process).  I love the color! Will order soon again. Satisfied customer ;)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color of this OPI nail polish (Thanks A WindMillion). Like everyone else before me, I think it is a beautiful milky green color. I&#x27;ve just painted my nails, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what the color looks like in the day light. The reason I gave this nail polish 4 stars, and not 5, is because of the way it goes on nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put two coats of nail polish to make sure all imperfections are corrected. When I painted my nails with a thin layer of this nail polish, it streaked. It was difficult to paint on the second layer because this formula felt too thick. I dislike thick layers because I find that the nail polish chips easier if the polish covers the nails too thickly. I also used a clear top coat to make my shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached is a picture of my freshly painted nails to give you a better idea of what the polish looks like. The color in the picture looks darker because the photo was taken at night in artificial light.</li>
    <li> I love the color  , quality is  great as usual  recommend to all my friends people always want to know brand use .the delivery is fast and price is great</li>
    <li> I had tried this color once in a salon and couldn&#x27;t get over it, i had to own a bottle. Plus OPI is so long-lasting and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty color. I painted two coats on a Wednesday, Thursday I painted 1 more coat and Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat. Without the top coat the color is not shiny, it&#x27;s kind of dull. Seche is not that shiny either.  I could see through the two coats, that&#x27;s why I painted a third, but then in the sunlight, I could still see through the three coats. No way is this &amp;#34;too opaque.&amp;#34;  Who would ever complain that nail polish was too opaque? That&#x27;s what you want it to do, cover your nails with the color it is supposed to be!  This lasted til Sunday (5 days) without a chip, but I wasn&#x27;t doing dishes or yardwork either.</li>
    <li> Love OPI and love this color, it&#x27;s great for every season and I get complements every time I wear it, my daughter too, so that&#x27;s two generations using this color.</li>
    <li> its a really pretty sea foam-y green. it pairs really nicely with gold jewelry..idk i just really like this for the spring/summer maybe even fall seasons. its nice. i think it will look good with any skin tone. buy it if you have the money.</li>
    <li> Pretty color not to loud.... But hey if you go with OPI your never disappointed!! Only needs 2 coats ll</li>
    <li> I purchased this some time ago when the Holland collection first came out. Thanks A Windmillion is a gorgeous dusky green-blue. The formula is great. This entire collection is pretty awesome and I think I will be picking up a few other colors from it.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t wear nail polish, but I LOVE the Dutch names!!!! (I&#x27;m Dutch on both sides of my family)</li>
