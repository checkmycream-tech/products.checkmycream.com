      <li>Once I got it, the first thing I noticed was the name, It was was not the High potency as advertised on their listing, just C scape.</li>

      <li>Firming and overall tone is evident to me.  </li>
      <li>Used to purchase directly from a dermatologist but cheaper on line.  </li>
      <li>I am working on a doctorate on natural health</li>
      <li>I use a moisturizer directly afterwards.</li>
      <li>They actually advertise the &#x27;High Potency&#x27; one</li>
      <li>but I got the regular c scape serum, not the high potency.</li>
      <li>as I am half way through the first bottle it appears to be oxidizing already making me concerned that it may be old stock.  </li>
      <li>and I generally like it</li>
      <li>MUCH cheaper from other sources.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this product.  Great results.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using for many years. Used to purchase directly from a dermatologist but cheaper on line.  Delivery was quick.  Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Excelente producto. Tercera vez que lo compro. Los resultados se observan a partir del tercer día de utilización. Rostro más limpio y radiante.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and even my eldest son swears by it.  I was introduced to this product by my son&#x27;s dermatologist.  I recommend it as an anti-inflammatory against the agents of pollution, UV rays, and anti-aging.  I am working on a doctorate on natural health and I cannot over praise the greatness of this product.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit costly, but the high potency of the vitamin C is very effective in skin care.</li>
    <li> a bit expensive but lasts for ever!!&lt;br /&gt;one pump is enough to give the vitamin c your skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for 3 years and I am a big fan!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worths the money!!!</li>
    <li> I agree. This product is great. It always brings a glow.  I use a moisturizer directly afterwards. Pricey, but lasts at least 3 months. My dermatologist also gave it to me and he uses it also.</li>
    <li> Great product, first got,this from my doctors ofc, was glad to find here</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and I generally like it alot - this time as I am half way through the first bottle it appears to be oxidizing already making me concerned that it may be old stock.  So I may have to purchase it locally as that way i can ensure the quality.      Thanks,    Winnie McCormick.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it really helps slow down the aging process. I like the high potency product the best.  My skin looks pretty good for my age and it has a lot to do with this product.</li>
    <li> ...this price is scandalous! MUCH cheaper from other sources. Amazon should be ashamed of itself for charging almost double the going price.</li>
    <li> It is the best I have ever used. It was recommended to me.</li>
    <li> great stuff. got it first from my dermatologist .</li>
    <li> Nothing works like this product tightens you right up and feels great.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different Vit C products searching for something to combat the dullness of my skin.I have never written a review before but this is honestly the only product that gives such results.Gives such clarity to my skin I need much less makeup.I will be buying this forever.</li>
    <li> The real McCoy. My wife had ordered this product from another vendor and it was not the same</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It really makes my face feel good and not greasy.  I used it on my chest as well.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. Product seems to be working, although I was concerned about the numbers on the bottom of the bottle. Is that the manufacture date, because that was six years ago.</li>
    <li> I love DCL Serum.&lt;br /&gt;This product that i received in the mail, however, was NOT DCL Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know what it is. Smells like alcohol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last 4 years with great results. The third bottle I purchsed was from amazon. They actually advertise the &#x27;High Potency&#x27; one but what I got in the mail was just the C scape (no high potency). I was a little skeptical bacause I usually pay $58-$60 for the same bottle and this one was $42.98. Once I got it, the first thing I noticed was the name, It was was not the High potency as advertised on their listing, just C scape. Second, the smell was slighly like alchool and the texture was more watery and lighter in color. I decided to e-mail the company that sold it here on amazon, they responded very rudly stating  that they never made a mistake and shiped the right product as stated on the listing I purchased bla, bla, bla. To make a long story short, I ended up using it for a few months with horrible results I started to get breakouts and my skin was dull and dry (scaly, specially my forehead area) I blame this product because nothing else has changed on my beauty routine other than this bottle I order on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m went back to purchasing my serum locally and I can really tell the difference on the product. Even the bottle has a different shape. I&#x27;m glad I did! I hope my review helps.</li>
    <li> Always skeptical when trying new products and I rely heavily on reviews.  After trying many C products I have to say this is the best.  I noticed a difference in my skin in about a week after first use.  Firming and overall tone is evident to me.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product.  Amazon should look into this.  Product is not the same color and the lable washes of when wet.</li>
    <li> Essential for keeping wrinkles away. I have used this for more than 20 years on the advice of my dermatologist..</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> I ordered the products as you described it -High Potency C Scape Serum 25, but I got the regular c scape serum, not the high potency. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used this wonderful product for over 25 years</li>
    <li> A doctor recommended that I use the C-scape serum 25 as a part of my skin-care program.  I have used it for 10 years and found it keeping my skin looking youthful. Amazon offers me the choice of suppliers and I&#x27;m happy to find out that I can get this product at a lower price than from my doctor.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I have gotten it before and it was not a fresh bottle.  When it turns brown it is not effective. This was fresh and came in a timely manner.</li>
