      <li>This is a good cream, though my favorite product line item is definitely the capsules of serum.</li>

      <li>This creme is so rich.</li>
      <li>It is ok after using it but no change made me break out at first</li>
      <li>one super important thing though.....</li>
      <li>I bought other Meaningful beauty products before and have found them to be good as advertised by Cindy Crawford.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a little over a month and the smell and feel of the lotion is incredible.</li>

      <li>It really leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; supple.</li>
      <li>her products really works, it makes my face radiant, feels so smooth.  </li>
      <li>If you order direct from MB and do a customized kit, you can get all Meaningful Beauty products for $24 a bottle.</li>
      <li>been using it for 15 days, I use it nightly after washing my face, before going to sleep, my face feels super smooth and tight, my few wrinkles look softened and it has a nice smell, i&#x27;ve tried lots of nightly face creams before, this one is sure ls on my all time top #5!</li>
      <li>Worth the money and really works!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Uneventful transaction which in my book is ideal!!</li>
    <li> This is another product designed for younger skin. I will use it up but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve had, I guess I like the spokesperson.&lt;br /&gt;Pays attention to see how young they pick them for their product.</li>
    <li> The night creme feels very good on my face, but didn&#x27;t seem to do anything except feel good.</li>
    <li> I bought other Meaningful beauty products before and have found them to be good as advertised by Cindy Crawford.I wanted to try the night cream,I like the hint smell of melon,it is rich,creamy and when applied after facial wash it has a small sting to face,but I have not had any side affects to my skin. Applied at night before bedtime, works leaving my skin in the morning glowing and have noticed my skintone more even.</li>
    <li> i use this every nite and have noticed results. others have also commented that they can see a different in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> My cream smells bad. I can&#x27;t say it works because I can not use it because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the the service and turn around time to receive   the night cream. I would be more than glad to purchase something from you n the future.</li>
    <li> I applied this cream and went to bed, woke up with eyes swollen and welts across my neck dark red, had to miss a day of work because I had such an allergic reaction. Didn&#x27;t feel sick just looked terrible with all the welts, red and swollen skin.... had to return it.</li>
    <li> very good i will recommend others to use this cream makes your faces very smooth and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;very nice yes.</li>
    <li> Good product but a little to thick for my complexion.  I use it when my face and neck feel dry or tight.</li>
    <li> as the above, just started to use the night cream I will see in one month time the difference in all</li>
    <li> I purchased the full Meaningful Beauty line after watching an infommercial. This was the first time I have purchased something after watching an ad on TV and felt a little silly getting sucked into it, but I have zero regrets after having used the product for the past month. I love this product line. I had never used moisturizer or night cream before because my skin is extremely sensitive and prone to breakouts. However, as I get older I am becoming more conscious of sun damage and wrinkles. Because of this, I decided to give the product a try. Since using it for about a month now, my skin is softer, smoother, AND clearer! I am truly amazed. Now I only wish I would have bought 3-months worth of product up front.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The Anti-aging Night Creme feels so nice on your skin and I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone that is serious about taking care of your face.  Your skin feels so nice when you use it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I will purchase again. Just a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> just flat does not work feels good but that is it i took before and after and i looked no different</li>
    <li> I just think this is a wonderful affordable cream with great effects after just a few usages.  It&#x27;s affordable and I think a great product.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give Meaningful Beauty 0 stars if I could since 1 is even a stretch.  I purchased this and other products directly through the company and now they&#x27;ve made it impossible to cancel future orders.  Additional products keep getting shipped to my house and my credit card keeps showing $50 charges.  I have called numerous times and keep getting the runaround.  I feel cheated and scammed and at a total loss as to how to resolve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can these products be quality when the company clearly has no ethics?  I&#x27;m shocked that Cindy Crawford puts her name on this.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I will nrver go  ack to the old stuff my skin is  softer and  younger looking and a more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> I do love this product! This creme is so rich. I have been using it for a month or so and I can really see a big difference in my complexion. I have also been putting it on the back of my hands and my age spots are fading! Love this!</li>
    <li> This product has a foul smell to it. Smells spoiled. I think I wasted my money on this product. Would not recommend this</li>
    <li> I have given Meaningful Beauty products a try.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem like a beauty line for me.&lt;br /&gt;May be because I am a loyal fan of philosophy.</li>
    <li> This stuff clogged my pores and caused a little breaking out.  Back to my trusted Oil of Olay.  Sorry</li>
    <li> I love Cindi&#x27;s skin care products, i use all of them, the cleanser, creams, serum&#x27;s, ect. you will not be disappointed, not greasy, skin is so soft the next morning, great for being out in the sun all day and peeling!</li>
    <li> It is ok after using it but no change made me break out at first but I kept using it and I guess my skin got use to it will not buy again</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products and brands and this one works extremely well for me.  I wish I would have begun using it 20 years ago</li>
    <li> Could probably find something comparable for cheaper at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I have all her skin products ... This is now my 2nd year using it ... Everyone ask me why I stay looking young ... My dermatologist notice a difference ... I won&#x27;t stop buying it</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, well packed, good condition and it is amazing when you wear it so Cindy Crawford baby you&#x27;re the best</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have seen it advertised on T.V. so wanted to try it.  I haven&#x27;t been using it but for a few days but it leaves your skin feeling so soft. So far I like this product.</li>
    <li> A good moisturizer...but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very good delivery &amp; product</li>
    <li> This is a good cream, though my favorite product line item is definitely the capsules of serum. Unsure it I will keep using</li>
    <li> Make my skin feel great and it&#x27;s not real greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it works wonderful. My crows feet have diminished and the crease around my mouth has lessened in addition to my skin being very smooth and having a natural glow. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer a lot especially at night. It is rich &amp; creamy so if you have dry or dehydrated skin or just like a heavier moisturizer at night this one is great! It really leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; supple. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with dry, dehydrated or aging skin or also someone with normal skin as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Meaningful Beauty for approximately 10 years and this stuff really works.  I use this every night after washing.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Amazon is a great way to get it without the commitment. It was sealed just like when I used to purchase it from the Guthy Renker infomercial site.</li>
    <li> love it shipped well an on time</li>
    <li> If you order direct from MB and do a customized kit, you can get all Meaningful Beauty products for $24 a bottle.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Feels great on my skin :) I was skeptical at first but have been impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> Love ,ove love love love</li>
    <li> I really liked it. Your face looks so young and fresh. I would highly recommend the product although its expensive.</li>
    <li> My skin is more youthful looking. Using it with other Meaningful Beauty products has my skin glowing. I&#x27;m receiving complements on how good and fresh my skin looks!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this particular product gave me a red rash, I ended up having to go to a dermatologist to get rid of it. I had ordered the whole kit.  Usually I have no reaction to products. .</li>
    <li> I am 49 and typically use Dermalogica  Age Smart, but saw the ad on TV and ordered this product. I have to say I did not see any signs of improvement as the commercial claims. In fact, my skin was not hydrated ad started seeing dry patches. My small wrinkles seemed to be more apparent. Is there a way to ship back the un used portion for a refund?</li>
    <li> Have been an Olay Age Defying Moisturizer and Vanicream user in the past; thought I would try an upgrade after reading good reviews of MB.  Initially tried a small amount of MB at Sephora and thought it felt really nice under the eyes.  Then purchased on Amazon, and the product I received has dried out my combo skin.  Not entirely sure I even received the same product, though the bottle says so. In any case, I will most likely end of pitching the product, though I hate having wasted the money.</li>
    <li> Love this cream for face clears my blackheads skin and clears my entire face looks less dull and very clean</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft and renewed.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  The list of high quality anti-aging products is impressive.  It has a very pleasant fragrance.  I plan on ordering more!</li>
    <li> Not sure what ingredient was the &amp;#34;inflamer&amp;#34; but something in it caused a nasty rash on my face. I DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN so Id avoid like the bubonic plague if you do have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> What do you like about these products .. I did my homework and couldn&#x27;t believe all the chemicals in these products.. We&#x27;re are the ingredients that they claim  that work...chemical???</li>
    <li> Based on other scary billing/customer service complaints I&#x27;m not willing to buy MB products through the actual company, but my Saint of a neighbor wasn&#x27;t going through hers fast enough and gave me the whole line (minus the capsules and serum but I&#x27;m totally not complaining! :)) as a gift. I&#x27;ve always had great skin (I turned 39 [gasp!] yesterday and people think I&#x27;m joking, I get ID&#x27;d constantly) but in the last year or so, I think because of a medication I&#x27;m taking, my face had become sort of bumpy, reddish and rashy-looking in places and I was sooo upset (I&#x27;d look at pictures from a couple of years ago and wail, &amp;#34;i used to be so prettyyyy,&amp;#34; haha). Still not willing to crack and wear foundation, I started using BB creme to hide/even out my newly unfortunate skin. A month or so after starting to use this cream (morning as well, not just at night), the bumps went away and the rashy-ness was visibly reduced. 3 months later, the BB creme has gone from my makeup bag to the back of the medicine cabinet and my old pretty complexion is 90% restored, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Especially with my birthday approaching I was so upset about the way my skin had started to look and nothing else seemed to be helping, now even with the scary close-up mirror my skin looks great...smooth, even-toned and no more rashy-ness! I also have super sensitive &amp; dry skin and almost every other product I&#x27;ve used over the years caused redness and irritation; I was afraid that MB, with no &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; designation would be a problem and it&#x27;s been just perfect. Bear in mind also, when passing this over if you&#x27;re not thrilled with the price (I&#x27;d pay triple for it given the results), that I&#x27;ve been using  this cream for over three months and I still have half a jar left, you really don&#x27;t need much...a little dab goes a long way...I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough. Off to search for Creme de Serum and Capsules! :D</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work. Tried it until bottle was finished</li>
    <li> It came packaged and was brand new.  It was a good size for the price.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this stuff. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference in the mornings, this product works great.</li>
    <li> this product just sits on top of the skin, in the morning when I wash my face it feels as if never got absorved, meanwhile my face still feels dry, even after I apply this cream,  I have to use other products on top of this to get rid of the tight feeling of dryness. All the good reviews in here must have been from people paid to advertise it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy, applies like a dream and really leaves your skin soft, moist and smooth.  Hightly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the the meaningful beauty skin line through their website. Im so happy with the results :) You will notice the difference by the next day.  My pores are smaller, skin is softer and more even.  I have sunspots that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of and tried other products but nothing worked. I can finally see them fading away :) You can purchase this night cream on their website for $43.00 as a member and if you spend $50 you get a free cream de serum.</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> highly recommend this product. feels great and applies even better. it is NOT greasy at all. moistens your face beautifully.</li>
    <li> What a great product ,simply the best ,  It works with all of the other stuff that i use .....c</li>
    <li> I had heard numerous commercials about this cream and felt almost compelled to try it. Having purchased many much more expensive creams I was impressed with this one as it does seem to improve skin and I have very mature skin! I will be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> A little bit exceptical when I was told by a friend ( who saw the infomercial on tv and bought the whole package) Decided to give it a try, bought 3 products and this is one of them, and .....I love it! been using it for 15 days, I use it nightly after washing my face, before going to sleep, my face feels super smooth and tight, my few wrinkles look softened and it has a nice smell, i&#x27;ve tried lots of nightly face creams before, this one is sure ls on my all time top #5! ( also recommend PHILOSOPHY&#x27;S HOPE IN A JAR ) one super important thing though.....IF YOU WANT TO BUY ANY OF THE PRODUCTS TO TRY THEM OUT ( NOT MAKING A MONTHLY COMMITMENT) DON&#x27;T BUY THEM FROM THE INFOMERCIAL SITE, BUY DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON (my friend got charged for extra stuff she did not ordered...twice!)</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t know what to get my mom for last minute gift and they i said what about this seen she used this product&lt;br /&gt;and thank god amazon had it and for a very good prices....thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!! This product should be called meaningless beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  I found this out after waiting 10 days for my shipment and received nothing... not an email or even a phone call.  So I called them.  They said it was on back order but would be delivered in 5 days.  Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  Also something to remember if you buy the product from their site they automatically set you up for monthly shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products immediately.  The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample.. so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  I used the product as directed on my neck and my neck broke out too. My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  It was so painful. I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took pictures just incase they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them, explained what happened and they refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping.  The refund was tedious... i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product... don&#x27;t they already have this information?  They told me to hold onto the product for a month incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures of howbad this product was for me.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice cream to use every night and my skin looks great. I recommend this product to all skin types because it isn&#x27;t greasy looking or feeling. I&#x27;m on my third jar!</li>
    <li> i have been ordering meaningfull beauty for about a year now and its awsome,its the best product iv ever used in my life..i would recommend this to every women in the world</li>
    <li> This product is really good, no body believes my age , I plan keeping using this forever .</li>
    <li> purchased for a friend.....She loves it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for younger looking skin</li>
    <li> Smells like turpentine. Stings my face. Returning. Cannot use long enough to see any results.</li>
    <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is listed as the worst skin care. Draw your own conclusions. I used her products long before I saw that list and returned them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month and the smell and feel of the lotion is incredible. I think if too much gets on the face, that it has a hard time soaking in, so less is more. My only complaint is that for some reason it kind of burns the skin around my eyes ...it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s too strong for that thin of skin but other than that, I am well pleased!</li>
    <li> I receive the kit every other month but have not tried the night crème yet.  Can&#x27;t wait to receive this to try it.  Thank you for making the process so easy.</li>
    <li> Order arrived ok fully sealed. However the cream was yellow and did not smell or have the color of Meaningful Beauty. The cream was a cutsard yellow color and did not smell like the actual product that I used previously.  This was a masterful repacking  job.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I will use it from now on, it&#x27;s great!! The seller was really good getting this to me so fast and I thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product and everyone compliments my skin wanting to know if I use something special.</li>
    <li> This cream is magical. It&#x27;s soothing and it&#x27;s like intensive skin therapy while you sleep. I wake up in the morning and my face feels soft, supple and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed something extra at night.  It does a great job and my skin is not dry and cracking an hour after applying.</li>
    <li> I put this on before I go to bed and when I wake up I can see a defance it makes my face so sofe. Fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> I love Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty products for my face, neck, etc..  her products really works, it makes my face radiant, feels so smooth.  The wrinkling eye cream work for my crows feet, which everyone say I do not have.  The toner, cleanser, etc.  makes me look like I have a tan. YAY</li>
    <li> Thought it was the night fluid but it&#x27;s way heavier &amp; causes me to break out where the Night Fluid didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this for my skin.</li>
    <li> Works great not greasy and my face feels so soft and smooth love this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a week and am shocked at the results of these products. I seriously look younger and my eyes are less puffy in the morning after using the eye serum. My skin is more smooth and firm and I do not even have to wear foundation anymore. Worth the money and really works! GREAT product!!</li>
