<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These shipped very fast and I am completely satisfied with the product. I am so glad that they come with their own container!!! So many bobby pins come in cheaply made containers that cannot be used more than a couple of times. I re-use my bobby pins over and over again and am so happy that I don&#x27;t have to try and find something to house them all!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product I have really thick hair so I need a LOT of bobby pins and I always seem to lose them so the 300 pack is doing me some good!</li>
    <li> The product works as intended. My only problem was opening my box to find this on top with the lid off and the bobby pins spilled everywhere. They packed it last so they should have seen that the lid wasn&#x27;t on? :(</li>
    <li> Worked good and I like the plastic resealable container.  I used them for a craft project which turned out well.</li>
    <li> As posted before, lots of black paint chips upon opening. Not sure how well they will hold up over time but great for the price and quantity</li>
    <li> Not sure why these are priced so cheap when they are exactly like the expensive ones you buy in the store. I use bobby pins everyday and these totally met my expectations.</li>
    <li> No issues! Great seller. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t become stretched out easily. Good value considering its 300 for such an amazing price. Overall not bad at all</li>
    <li> This tub of bobby pins is awesome! They are really high quality pins and of course I lose mine all the time but this tub should last me a while especially because the packaging acts as a storage bin so the pins don&#x27;t get lost in my drawer. Fantastic! would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> After i bought them i learned that i got the best deal and never regret it! I use them every day, all the time! All the pins are in a good shape and they hold the hair good! Great for the price!</li>
    <li> Smells bad. But works.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are way better than the drugstore bobby pins, stay in all day I don&#x27;t have to keep readjusting it over and over</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference in quality. I use half the pins that I used to use.</li>
    <li> You would be silly not to get this deal</li>
    <li> Thus far, the pins are great, and its nice to have a large quantity around. The only major problem I had was that the container was cracked when I received it. Finding a new home for 300 bobby pins was no easy task.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy.  Plastic ends come off after one to two uses making them useless.</li>
    <li> Good bobby pins! Work well and there are plenty!</li>
    <li> my wife would lose all sorts of bobby pins. so i got her this pack of 300. this should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t complain for the price. just buy it.</li>
    <li> When we opened these they had a horrible paint smell.  We put them outside to air out but they got wet and rusted.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t count to see if there was exactly 300 but tub was pretty full so I&#x27;ll take their work for it. Great buy!!:) idk why but you can never haw enough of these. They always disappear!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what is described and shown. Bobby pins are pretty heavy duty. There was a smell when opening the tub but it goes away.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re actually really good quality. &amp; the fact that there are so many at a cheap price is definitely a plus. I&#x27;ve bought other bobby pins cheaper than this &amp; they never last. Thankfully, these are at a cheap price &amp; good quality too. :)</li>
    <li> I like the tub it comes in. Real useful and helpful to have all of the pins in one place.</li>
    <li> Even though it is ridiculously cheap, the quality is there and I will (hopefully) never have to buy more bobby pins ever</li>
    <li> Love not digging around for pins.  Undoubtedly I&#x27;ll be 7 years using all these pins but I love not having to obsess over where every pin is.  And the container is easy for traveling and storing them too.</li>
    <li> Great for their price.  Came on time.</li>
    <li> Not flexible enough, can be used only once.</li>
    <li> the paint is flaking off of the bobby pins, but other then that they serve their purpose. if you don&#x27;t mind flaking paint then they work fine.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints and you get a lot of bobby pins for the price. I recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> nothing fancy they got the job done</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re bobby pins so there isn&#x27;t much else to say. I used to always run out from losing them, then bought two of these tubs and have not had an issue since.</li>
    <li> when i recieved the package I ordered 2 and both containers were open and you could follow the trail of boby pins to where they were taken off the truck in the driveway. so I dont know how many are left but they were just falling out of the box</li>
    <li> Buy these every year as part of my daughter&#x27;s dance supplies for competition :)</li>
    <li> The black paint stuff on the bobby pins comes off way too easily. I had a few of them in my pocket &amp; I had a bunch of little black specks in my pocket for awhile afterward because the paint was chipping off of them. :/</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and these did the job in holding my hair in place. I really like them. Nice!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these after watching a hair tutorial on thesmallthingsblog.com. These are so much better than the kind you get at the drugstore. I have very smooth, hard to hold hair, and I can pin it up with these and have it last all day.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s bobby pins.  does what you think.  good paint coating on the pins.  i hate it when they are not coated properly!  will buy from this brand again for sure</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive purchase that always comes in handy.  You can&#x27;t buy 300 bobby pins anywhere for thtat price.</li>
    <li> They seemed just like the pins I&#x27;d buy from Walmart. I didn&#x27;t have any problems and there is enough to last me a long time.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is mad that these are all over the house. We got divorced. I guess thats my fault so FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> Love these bob pins they do the job right and they hold great. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Came with a strange smell and black paint chips everywhere, had to wash them and the container but great for the price.</li>
    <li> I will order again.thanks</li>
    <li> A few years ago I bought some bobby pins at a boutique in Hong Kong (I think they were made in Japan or Korea) and they are the absolute strongest, most amazing bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever had. I can&#x27;t find anything that compares since, and unfortunately that includes these. I was hopeful because they get the best reviews on Amazon, and I realize this is a weird item to be picky about, but they just don&#x27;t measure up to the HK pins. I have thick hair and need tight, flat pins for how I like to style it, and these have more give than I was wanting. Having said that, these pins are similar to most everything else on the US market, maybe even slightly better than what you&#x27;d find in Walgreens. And there&#x27;s LOTS of them, so it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
    <li> Besides trashed packaging and some of my purchase bobby pins falling out while mailed, they work just fine! No peeling or balls falling off.</li>
    <li> Purchased years ago and I still have half the pack left - awesome!</li>
    <li> Came fast! And is just like pictured</li>
    <li> Pretty average or lesser average than any bobby pin. The price is good and theres tons of bobbies in the container. Would totally re buy this product but the pin does tend to slide after about an hour.</li>
    <li> Goodie brand Bobby pins are better quality</li>
    <li> Good quality clips and awesome deal.  I see no difference in these vs. the more expensive versions.  I will buy these from now on.</li>
    <li> Now that the package was actually delivered to my home today, I wanted to come back and leave a great review on these pins. I love that they are in an easy to access tub. There are plenty of them. They are high quality. They are also tight fitting and hold well with my thick hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These babies have worked magic on my super long, super thick hair! The beast (my hair) ate store bought bobby pins for breakfast, bending them out of shape after one use. These 2&amp;#34; pins hold any do securely for hours and feel sturdy enough that I know I&#x27;ll get a ton of uses out of them. I also got the 1 1/2&amp;#34; pins which are also amazing and perfect for pinning smaller sections of hair. Oh and yes the paint starts to chip off after a few uses, not a big deal to me because the pins mostly get hidden in my hair the way I use them.</li>
    <li> I like using bobby pins for hair especially if I fix my daughter&#x27;s hair and keeps them in place.</li>
    <li> The bobby pins are good quality, and I love that the price is great for the amount of bobby pins you get. My only reason for not giving the product 5 stars is because the lid comes off very easily and I have had to scoop up the pins out my drawer multiple times. But other than that, it is great!</li>
    <li> They stay in better than any other product in the market. I have fine hair and throw my hair up in wacky updos all the time and I am the most pleased with this brand! Also they come up to be about the same price as wholesale (;</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much because of the price and the nice plastic tub they arrived in, but these bobby pins are pretty terrible. Many of them already came bent (and unusable...I threw about 15 of them away before using them) in the plastic tub, and the black coating came off after one use (on my hands and in my hair...yuck).  I gave them two stars because they are pretty comfortable, they hold well, and they are super cheap; but the black coating coming off is a huge NO for me. Won&#x27;t be ordering them again.</li>
    <li> Great sturdy bobby pins.  Love them</li>
    <li> These were recommended as the best bobbie pins ever and they really are.</li>
    <li> The bobby pins are great and very sturdy.  I love that they come in a tub- the lid snaps on nice and tight so I&#x27;m not worried about them flying anywhere if it falls off the counter.  They&#x27;re exactly what you&#x27;d expect when ordering quality bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Perfect size!! Also very strong i love them</li>
    <li> with three girls in my house I can never have enough bobby pins! Now when my husband throws away the ones he finds laying around it doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair. Bobby pins are a necessity. They also routinely make their way to various alternate dimensions of my apartment never to be seen again. Needless to say, I was very happy to see a goodly number of bobby pins offered at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a slight paint smell when I opened the container, but it quickly wore off. The pins themselves function as they&#x27;re supposed to (I don&#x27;t really expect anything more) and are pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find the container convenient as I&#x27;ve always hated prying bobby pins off of those cards they normally come in. Now if only I could remember to put them back ...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE TUB, THE PINS THEMSELVES ARE OKAY. NOT THE STRONGEST, AND THEY ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO OPEN WITHOUT USING MY TEETH , WHICH I DO NOT LIKE DOING. I WILL USE THEM UP BUT NOT SURE ABOUT REORDERING. I GOT THEM FOR MY DAUGHTERS HAIR, SO MAYBE ITS BETTER TO GET THE CHEAPER ONES THAT MAY GET LOST QUICKLY RATHER THAN PAYING FOR GOOD ONES THAT WILL ALSO GET LOST ? :)  NO COMPLAINTS, I HAVE DEFINITELY SEEN AND USED WORSE, BUT THESE WILL WORK FOR NOW</li>
    <li> This was a great deal on bobby pins. It was an add-on item, so I made sure I bought $25+ in other products, but there are 300 for just $2-3 which is a great deal. They are black and stay in my hair just fine. I recommend to all.</li>
    <li> Good quality, consistently shaped, and very affordable.  I use these bobby pins primarily for stage performances and they hold my hair securely in updos.</li>
    <li> Great hold, good color, strong, keeps hair in place. I love these. Glad I bought them. One too many in the box though, hopefully you have a friend to share them with</li>
    <li> Got tired of constantly buying bobby pins. Bought this and they love them (bonus point for mom) and I hope they last longer than two months (girls lose everything!)</li>
    <li> The black comes off of these and the tips as well. Glad there are 300 of them.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous way to buy bobby pins! I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again.</li>
    <li> The little grips at the end stay pretty well but the color chips off for nothing leaving a silver pin behind with black paint chips in your hair, in your mouth and on your lips,  if your are like me and put a pin between your lips while putting your hair in place.  Yuck.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this brand again. Also the lid on the container was cracked, not that it&#x27;s a big deal but almost all the pins were loose in the box they were sent in and I had to gather them all. Just a pain.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t tell anyone but these are what allows my hair to defy gravity.  The price is good and they are great to have on hand.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for the cost!  the only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give them 4 stars is because my batch (not sure if they all do) have the color come off in some patches and they open up more after a few uses - BUT that&#x27;s not really that big of a deal SO it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> These were ok, but a disappointment compared to the black we had previously ordered from this company. The black were super hold- for some reason in bronze they were no better than what you can buy at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> All the black come off in your hair while your wereing them not good. These bobby pins are very cheap!</li>
    <li> These pins are horrible. Upon opening this new tub of pins, the tub is coated in lots of black speckles from the paint chipping off. After wearing these pins for 2 weeks, most of the paint is gone – so now I have silver hair pins. These may be cheap, but so is the quality. I personally don&#x27;t want chips of paint in my hair, on my floor or to potentially breath them in. These are crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the seller requesting a refund and NEVER received a reply. Truly disappointed.</li>
    <li> They hold their shape well but the paint comes off VERY easily. Like that is comes in a tub, makes it easy to store.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this tub of bobby pins because you know bobby pins go to a blackout. You can never have too many bobby pins...however these were not coated at the ends so pretty much useless to use in your hair without snagging your own hair. Maybe it was listed in the description and I missed it, but I was very disappointed when these did not have coated tips and very painful to wear.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to fine strong holding bobby pins for my kind of hair (really straight and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl) I have tried many different companies and by far these are the BEST FOR THE BEST PRICE.I highly recommend them and will be a faithful customer from here on out.</li>
    <li> Excelent value , perfect product. It arrived on time and just as pictured. Very satisfied with the product and will order again when i lose them all :)</li>
    <li> These are functional, but they&#x27;re certainly not on the better end of the spectrum of bobby pins.  Not the sturdiest.  And my tub definitely contained far fewer than 300 (it arrived opened and unsealed), not that I counted.  But, for a couple of bucks, they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Please do yourself a favour and don&#x27;t buy these! The paint flakes right off and gets everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is, indeed, 300 bobby pins. They stay in well and are cheap so I don&#x27;t care about loosing them.</li>
    <li> This tub was cheap and came with a lot. I bought the black bobby pins and after a couple uses, I notice the black starts to fade and turns the original silver tone. But like I said, there&#x27;s a lot and these things eventually gets lost so it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Stronger than bobby pins I normally get at the drug store</li>
    <li> Love these bobby pins. Definitely hold better than the drugstore type. Wish they held their shape for a few more wears though, but you get quite a few for cheap.</li>
    <li> The bobby pins are great, and work well.  I bought these because it was a great deal, and I needed a lot.  However, the container was cracked, and when counted, there were 292, not 300.</li>
    <li> I go through bobby pins like water!! When I&#x27;m styling my hair, I hate scrambling to find a few extra ones, espcially when the sharp ends are exposed or if I simply ran out. These bobby pins are also really well coated, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any chipping or any snags. This 300 pack is PERFECT to keep in the bathroom so you can grab and go!</li>
    <li> I bought these because i am constantly using and losing bobby pins. they are a decent product for their cost the only complaint is that the paint chips off with a single use and the little plastic pieces at tips of metal fall of easily which causes them to have sharper ends when applicating.</li>
    <li> Bobby pins serve its purpose. However, what I have encountered are the soft ends that are suppose to be securely glued to the harsh ends slips off when removing them from my hair. Almost every morning I typically use roughly 4-6 pins to secure my hair in a soft French roll or to simply push back my hair from my face. They are great little pins but someone (manufacture, maybe) should pay a little bit more attention to the soft plastic ends. I tend to recycle my pins after every use and place the pins back in the container for future use but if the soft plastic ends are no longer there I am one less bobby pin for future styles. At any rate, again they serve its purpose, not all of the plastic ends have come off roughly 5 out of every 10 and it’s a great little tool in any woman’s beauty arsenal. Happy Styling!</li>
    <li> These are great for the price.  The tips are soft, so they haven&#x27;t torn my hair, but they&#x27;re only good for about a day&#x27;s use.  About half of the pins I&#x27;ve used have bent and couldn&#x27;t be reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the tips have stayed on well, and the bobby pins haven&#x27;t come out of place without me pulling them out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Would recommend buying for the amount you receive and the price is really cheap. I really like these bobby pins.</li>
    <li> they are everything i like. they stay in for a while and if you loose bobby pins like i do then this isgood. they come in a tub so when your done you can put them back (: dont loose them as easy(:</li>
    <li> I was taught not to say or write anything unless it is positive or constructive. I would be remiss if I failed to inform others about these bobby pins. I purchased 2 packs of the black ones. After  a couple of uses the coating sloughed off into my hair. The remnants are visible in my white comb. If you do not mind the sloughing, then this is a good bobby pin.</li>
    <li> These pins work well and do exactly what they are supposed to do.  They keep their tension for quite a while so I put the used ones right back in the container with the new pins to reuse. There&#x27;s a choice of color and the containers keep the loose pins neatly in place.  Much better than the card most bobby pins are clipped to.  All in all it&#x27;s a nice product I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews about the cracking of the black paint off the clips, but i think they hold my hair very well and i don&#x27;t find them to be single use (unless they start cracking) but that happened when they sat in water for a little while. I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase. The fact that there&#x27;s 300 pins in the tub and I&#x27;m not a hair stylist, I just may not have to buy any more. Perfect for the styles i want to achieve.</li>
    <li> Some of the bobby pins come stretched out or missing their protective plastic ends. These are basic pins but a very good value. There&#x27;s nothing fancy and they are kind of heavy duty. All in all definitely worth the buy! Though, I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase again once I lose all of these.</li>
    <li> The rubber tips come off after one use. I would not order the is product again.  I am sorry I got this large size.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price. Hold the hair in place.I would order them again when I run outof them in a long wwhile sknfebot has a lot of them.</li>
    <li> The pins are relatively okay, except they start to flake very easily. That leaves them looking more silvery than black, and there are black pieces of the material all over my room.</li>
    <li> These are great! They actually stay in my hair!! Others I have bought in the stores stretch out and bend so they are unusable after the first wear. These are not like that. I love them!! Would recommend!!</li>
    <li> Alright. So I bought these over a year ago and I&#x27;m not even halfway through them! 300 is a lot, but when it comes to bobby pins, it&#x27;s a LOT. These are a bargain, which is good. They are also cheaply made, which is not so good. I use a lot of bobby pins in my hair daily. I have some baby hairs that I like to secure by criss-crossing bobby pins together. But here&#x27;s the thing- the black paint chips off of these when I do that. It&#x27;s a bummer, but for the bargain I got, these can be disposable bobby pins for all I care. I mean, I still have more than half after a year. If you use these without criss-crossing them, you should be fine. Oh, and my boyfriend hates these because, you know, endless bobby pins to find everywhere :)</li>
    <li> Chipped paint pieces everywhere inside the container, label sticker was put on poorly (not that that part matters so much, but just another whoops), and the smell of spray paint was VERY potent.</li>
    <li> These are just normal bobby pins. That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. They are not the longer, thicker heavy duty bobby pins, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re&#x27;re looking for you shouldn&#x27;t order these!&lt;br /&gt;This container was great for us because there are so MANY of them. They were ordered for use on a 7 year old&#x27;s hair, and we don&#x27;t have to worry if she loses half of them. (Which she does). We&#x27;ll order these again when all of ours are lost!! :)</li>
    <li> These are alright... they&#x27;re not the highest quality bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever used, but I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected in bulk like this. The paint chips off pretty easily if you ever use the bobby pins on top of each other, like when making a cross. Also my tub came broken in the mail, so I had to duct tape it before it was even usable. Probably lost a bunch in the mail that way, since the contents had spilled out into the box. Considering the price and how often I lose bobby pins anyway, it was still a decent purchase.</li>
    <li> Great hold. Much better than drug store bought pins.</li>
    <li> Nice bobby pins for the price. Paint comes off easily though. They are Good for a poor college kid though!</li>
    <li> This product is very cheaply made. You think you&#x27;re getting a bargain, but the color on the bobby pins was already chipping on all of the when they arrived...which didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but when i started noticing the paint chips in my hair even after washing, I threw them out.</li>
    <li> As described. Great value. Purchased to make sure my daughters hair is always ready for performances. Gets the jb done.</li>
    <li> We received this product and it seemed a little light...  turns out they shorted us 50 of the bobby pins.  My daughter just had to count them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No contact from the company when we took the time to let them know.</li>
    <li> Great product and fadt delivery</li>
    <li> Keeps my layered, slippy hair in place! (Even though each time I pin my hair up, I use about 10-15 pins, but it works!)</li>
    <li> I broke one, but there is still 299 to go. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good bobby pins and a TERRIFIC value.  Ordered a container for me and then later, one for my sister and both times the lid had become loosened in shipping and a few bobby pins were loose in the box, but overall, not a big deal.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Color comes off easily</li>
    <li> I use these for when I put my hair in high buns and they really work well. They keep my hair in place!</li>
    <li> Apparently I needed a giant tub of bobby pins to make my world complete. Easy to find under the sink, and I&#x27;m never without a pin or 200. Awesome!</li>
    <li> LOVE! they do not tug on my hair, very smooth, and so far it does not shed like other bobby pins I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> These were highly recommended by a pretty famous beauty/hair blogger that I follow. They work so great!</li>
    <li> There were black paint flecks inside the container so I&#x27;m not sure how long the black paint will stay on. However they hold my hair perfectly and there are so many I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> i was wondering why it was so cheap..... but it does the job okay so I&#x27;m not gonna complain too much</li>
    <li> Black standard bobby pins. I&#x27;ve already lost 100 in the first week, but I expected nothing less! They get the job done.</li>
    <li> although they did come quickly the container the bobby pins come in was not sealed! im a germ freak so i ran them under some boiling hot water and some soap to make sure they were clean. you never know. but i would have liked for them to be sealed, just for the piece of mind.</li>
    <li> Bobby pins are like hair ties. You can purchase thousands, but lose them all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These worked well till they were all lost, lol.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as an add on but I&#x27;m not disappointing because I always lose bobby pins. I still have quite a few and I ordered them quite awhile ago.</li>
    <li> Paints chips off after several uses.  Still a good products, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a better quality after having these be recommended by a hair stylist.  These are a little thin for my taste and I picked up ones I like better at a local store.  They do work well.</li>
    <li> As a stay-at-home dad with two young daughters, I need bobby pins -- piles and piles of bobby pins.  But I also need a sense of virility.  I require something that tells the world I make a mean hair bun.  Solution: \\&quot;300-PACK TUB\\&quot; of bobby pins.  This product oozes manliness.  It&#x27;s for someone who can both charbroil a T-bone and tame flyaways.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Tons of bobby pins and a tub to store them in? Yes please. The tub keeps me from losing them all the time.</li>
    <li> A ton of pins for a great price but the paint comes off very easily which is not a problem if you buy less for more at the beauty store. Still, better quality than dollar stores!</li>
    <li> These are a great value for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work really well and they are sturdy. I have very thick hair, and I&#x27;m notorious for bending a lot of bobby pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had all of the luck with these!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tub of bobby pins. They are good quality, and hold my (relatively thin) hair quite well. I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s 300 in the tub, but what&#x27;s in there is more than enough for me, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> These pins are on the thicker side, so I would suggest fine or thin hair steer clear. They are durable! A+++</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair... it&#x27;s long and thick! These bobby pins are exactly what you&#x27;d expect, and there are lots of em!! They have a nice tight grip too! and unlike the pins you get in a drug store, these come in a nice bowl with a lid to store them in, instead of on a cardboard square! No complaints from me... well except maybe the weird smell when you open the lid!! lol</li>
    <li> I had no issues with any of the bobby pins whatsoever, my little sister also snags a few time to time and they never broke/bent but can if you are rough with them. This tub is great if you ever misplace or lose bobby pins like crazy!</li>
    <li> Perfect for those who lose a lot of bobby pins, that would be me.  For the great price, it is irresistible.</li>
    <li> Love!  Very good value.</li>
    <li> I always loose my bobby pins, it seems like they run away form me every time I use them. It is so convenient to have 300 pins.</li>
    <li> Great bobby pins for the price!! Well made and I love the container they come in, it helps me maintain their location! If not they would be all over the place! lol</li>
    <li> I use bobby pins for 2.1 million reasons and usually buy them from my local Sally&#x27;s or beauty supply but these seemed right priced. Nope! The are smaller than average. The bulbs at the end which prevent snags don&#x27;t even chip they are non existent. They&#x27;re also thin and slight feeling. I&#x27;ll pass. In fact, I might return them...</li>
    <li> The best bobby pins I have ever used</li>
    <li> Only some of the bobby pins have an</li>
    <li> Bought this tub of Bobby pins a few years ago and still have it. A girl can never have too many Bobby pins!</li>
    <li> Great amount of pins for the price.</li>
    <li> As good as the Conair bobby pins and you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of pins for awhile!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with bobby pins</li>
    <li> Bunch of pins and all have protective ends on them, so there is no unnecessary pulling of my hair. I like it.</li>
    <li> Awsome bobby pins. I will order again. Very strong. Way Better than goody brand. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the tub was not sealed. And they could have spilled. Otherwise. Order these!</li>
    <li> These are good quality bob pins that hold pretty well and tight. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent value compared to purchasing in a local store.  I&#x27;m able to secure my long hair in a bun with six pins.  These pins are of very good quality and the tub is its own storage container.  Bonus!  I will definitely buy them again, whenever I finally run low again.  ~  M Clipner</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered these bobby pins, She loves to do things with her hair and also he sister&#x27;s. She has no complaints about them. The only thing that she was slightly disappointed about was the amount she actually received. The description says 300-pack tub and since the picture showed 2 tubs...she was under the impression that she was going to be getting two tubs of them. So she was expecting to actually get 600 pins. But she realizes that it does say 300 not 600 so she understands. She said they are worth the price and that they are still a good buy!</li>
    <li> the pins are pretty good, i used it on my daughters hair which she have silky hair and the pins didnt slip off her hair. For the price and the amount of pins was a bargin. shipping was pretty fast too,got the product in 2 days</li>
    <li> IT WAS INDEED 300 until this day i still have some of these and you know bobbbi pins and always something u need to stack up on but not with this you literally have alot left dwl i even shared with my bff</li>
    <li> These were purchased for our granddaughter who is a jazz dancer and travels doing dance competions.  She goes through a lot of Bobby Pins and this was a great find and a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> ok so when i received the package i was exited that my bobby pins had finally came and as i picked it up a couple of them dropped then i noticed that there were multiple sticking out of the corners and then i opened it up the lids off there are like 2 in the container and the rest are flying around the box and there is only one little air thing in it  but over all thy are very good quality bobby pins definitely better than drug stores</li>
    <li> Great value and so easy to transport to my salon and back home, for in house updos. Glad I bout them.</li>
    <li> Standard quality Bobby pins but the plastic tub is helpful in keeping all of them together</li>
    <li> Cheap, crappy Bobby pins. The little ball things on the end fall off super easy and a lot of them have already come off by themselves in the package.. So they are unusable because they scrape against my head. wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
    <li> When I first got the 300 pack I was very excited since I kep losing my bobby pins and this seemed like a great deal. HOWEVER, I only got 298 pins which was ok but when I opened the box it was dirty with black \\&quot;dust\\&quot; turns out it was the black paint or whatever from the bobby pins. All of them chip really easily! All of them when I just slide my nail gently on pin the black paint starts chipping!&lt;br /&gt;They do hold up my hair-they&#x27;re reg bobby pins but I&#x27;d rather have them just gray if they were all going to chip off easily getting it all over my hand and hair. I will not be buying hem again</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are great! I use them for my wig works for my Cosplay&#x27;s. Like hair ties i loose bobby pins like no body&#x27;s business, but this is a nice pack of 300 which helps if ya loose some. They are good and durable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy cheap bobby pins, make the investment in these. . .you will notice the difference.  My only complaint, the black plastic piece on the ends of the bobby pins come off easy.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing deal! The bobby pins are really good quality and this was super cheap for a pack of 300!</li>
    <li> Being a soon-to-be hairstylist and hair guru, or just a girl in general, you CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH BOBBY PINS! It almost seems like they just disappear into thin air! This is a perfect price for a great value! Couldn&#x27;t ask for better!</li>
    <li> just bobby pins how can you go wrong i needed this very much the tube is more much more helpful then the card board i would loose them this i can place directly back in container good deal</li>
    <li> These came exactly in the container described above but was absolutely disgusting when I opened them. There were about 10 mounds of dust and dirt, LOOSE SCREWS, and I don&#x27;t even want to know what else. It was so filthy and unsanitary that I just threw the whole thing away. I suppose that&#x27;s what you get for it being so cheap.</li>
    <li> I like that these came quickly, however, these slide out of my hair no matter how I put them in.</li>
    <li> Strong pins, they&#x27;re great. The color chips off a little after a while... But what do you expect.</li>
    <li> Undepindable. Didn&#x27;t keep my pinterest. Understand the hairer of my ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are 300 bobby pins in this pack, I would not buy these again. Even if I could get just 3 bobby pins for the same price that would actually hold my hair and not slip out, I would do so before even considering this product. To accomplish the same amount of hold as a scunci or some other name brand pin, I have to use four of these - all oriented in some wrangled mess - just to keep hair out of my face long enough to write this. I&#x27;ve never thought about the brand of bobby pins previously, because why make a bobby pin that just doesn&#x27;t pin? I don&#x27;t have silken hair, I don&#x27;t even have soft hair - I have thick asian air - and no pin prior has ever had an issue staying put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I do not recommend these pins.</li>
    <li> If you use or need a large quantity of bobby pins, this is a good product. Some of the pins are bent or broken, but only a very small portion so overall I&#x27;d recommend these.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as shown. The bobby pins are a good size and a good price. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I needed these in my life, mine always go missing. Strangely, these are hard to find in all the pharmacies. I like a the two bars to be close together and just a small opening at the tip. Most are made either too far apart to hold thinner hair or have a giant opening that&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
    <li> These really are different from bobby pins you can get at the drug store....I will always purchase these from now on.  They hold my hair all day, also love the container with the lid</li>
    <li> Worked great, and lots of them.</li>
    <li> These are okay bobby pins. They hold well but the coating on them starts flaking after a first use and the plastic bulbs on the ends tend to fall off easy too.</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail container opened so I had to fish all of the pins out of package box. Good quality .</li>
    <li> What can I say, they are bobby pins. They are the quality and size I would expect from bobby pins, and a huge pack for a great price.</li>
    <li> Paint chips off of them after one use.  They lose their shape very easily.</li>
    <li> This was perfect price for more for the dollar amount. I brought some time ago and I still have them. A good Buy</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product it doesn&#x27;t hold your hair good, the  black pain come off in just one use and the black pain stink really bad.</li>
    <li> So, I was a little wary buying  these thinking that for that could of a price, they were probably gonna be those crappy bobby pins that you can maybe get one use out of, before it stretches out. But NOPE. These are just as good as the ones you pay 3+ dollars for 25 -50 bobby pins. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Very durable. Better than the ones from sally beauty. Wished the paint didn&#x27;t chip so quickly , otherwise it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality. Paint chipped off after first use and they seem to snag both mine and my daughters hair. As for strength they do the job and hold hair tightly in place...but OUCH when you have to take them out.</li>
    <li> Good Quality bobby pins!</li>
    <li> good, came as advertised.</li>
    <li> love that this is in a tub makes it easy to find and easy to put away .... don&#x27;t have to look through my draws anymore for hair pin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beekeeper and these are perfect for holding the foundation centered in the frame.  These are great!!!  I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins arrived a day late however they work good. They don&#x27;t peel easily and they had a very very faint smell of plastic.</li>
    <li> Best bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever used and they are so cheap for sooo many!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awful. The black coating chips off during first use, and it ends up all over your skin, costume, etc, and the tips fall off after a couple of uses. They also stretch out way too easily. Will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when removing. Holds well as expected.</li>
    <li> Great bobby pins, great value.  They work perfectly.  They blend with my hair and stay in place. I couldn&#x27;t have found a better value anywhere else.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. i could tell these pins were made cheaply. the black paint would fall off in my hair!! they smelled like paint. Total waste.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Holds better than all the other bobby pins I have purchased. Value for money too.</li>
    <li> Just ok... the little ball on the tips of these keeps snapping right off every time I use one. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> They are slightly small than usual but they are very sturdy. I&#x27;ve had flimsy bobbies before but these work just fine.</li>
    <li> These work okay. Don&#x27;t hold the best but they hold. First thing I noticed when I opened the package was a disgusting smell and the black powder coming off all the bobby pins. They also twist around for some reason while i&#x27;m trying to use them. Overall I give this a 2 just because they hold okay..</li>
    <li> Quantity is great, the quality not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because, like any woman, you can never have too many Bobby pins. After about a year I&#x27;m due for a refill.&lt;br /&gt; The only problem is the coating chips off easily. Not a big big problem but when I&#x27;m constantly covered in black specs from the pin I start to get paranoid about the amount of coating left in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll pay the extra few bucks at sallys next time.</li>
    <li> I wish I could like these more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these mostly for the quantity but if I&#x27;m honest, they&#x27;re not the best quality. The black colour scrapes off easily after one use and the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; part of the pins come off as well, thereby snagging your hair. If you want quality, I would suggest Goody. If you want quantity and can live with the silver / black combo and occasionally losing the plastic heads, then go with these. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing these, but I will be using these until I lose them all / they all break but they do do the job as intended.</li>
    <li> I think these are fine. Nothing to rave about here. They are just normal bobby pins. I use them for holding up buns and other styles, they work fine.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a good buy, since it was a tub of 300 bobby pins for a little over $2. And everyone in my house uses them, and loses them, so it&#x27;s a good idea to have them around. However, after wearing some, I noticed that the paint was coming off. I could deal with them just being grey, but the fact that there&#x27;s little black flakes in my hair bugs me to no end.</li>
