      <li>I feel confident with protection which I can rely on, from a brand I can trust.</li>
      <li>We love Degree products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this seems to be the way that most deodorants are going.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would try another anti-perspirant and see if it would work better.</li>
      <li>scent is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>What more could you want from a deodorant?</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pretty pleasant.  </li>
      <li>The Overtime fragrance is kind of sweet.</li>
      <li>but my husband commented on it being somewhat strong</li>
      <li>It is a strong anti-perspirant.</li>

      <li>/&gt;It feels fine on my skin and  does not cause a skin reaction.</li>
      <li>I myself thought it was great, non-offense and reminded me of Calvin Klein&#x27;s One fragrance from back in the day.</li>
      <li>Great solid.</li>
      <li>The container is wider to fit a man’s hand.</li>
      <li>Will keep you smelling clean after the gym till you take a shower.</li>

      <li>What more can you really ask for in a deodorant?</li>
      <li>My husband has been alternating his antiperspirants between this Cool Rush scent and the Overtime scent.</li>
      <li>It does a good job at controlling daily sweat and odor.</li>
      <li>So overall, I&#x27;d say this is a good bet for deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Either one would be a good choice because they both smell amazing and my husband says they both keep him dry and smelling great, which definitely says a lot because we live in the hot desert climate.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s promoted as having some kind of \\&quot;motion sense\\&quot; technology which I&#x27;m sure is just marketing BS, but it will keep you dry and smelling fresh</li>
      <li>---it dries quickly, but his perception is that somehow it might get on his clothes.  </li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself goes on pretty smoothly for an antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>I love the new Adrenaline series of antiperspirants from Degree.</li>
      <li>My new favorite smell and will never switch deodorants until they discontinue this series.</li>
      <li>My main problem is that I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong scent.</li>
      <li>The first and most obvious thing upon opening the mailer-envelope is the strong scent.  </li>
      <li>When I asked him about the scent, he said &amp;#34;what scent?&amp;#34;, and indeed, the scent is very mild---just kind of a general &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
      <li>Overtime applies discreetly, with a fresh clean scent, and keeps me dry in the most demanding situations.</li>
      <li>If I had anything critical to say about this product, it might be a little too strongly scented, but it works and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
      <li>This works great on the hard court.  </li>
      <li>;)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I work as a deckhand on the Mississippi River in south Louisiana and this does exactly what is says.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t notice any staining on any of my tshirts and have been using it consistently for about 5 weeks.</li>
      <li>My husband’s general feeling about deodorant is that they either work fine or they don’t.</li>
      <li>This particular deodorant met my husband&#x27;s expectations as far as functionality is concerned but we both found the scent to be too strong.</li>
      <li>head of the container is wide and it is easy and quick to apply.  </li>
      <li>I would say this one is about as good as the other Degree varieties, and maybe even a little better.</li>
      <li>It has a mild masculine scent with a sort of fruity undertone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommended only if you like or don;t mind strong perfume.  </li>
      <li>I typically use Old Spice deodorant, but I&#x27;ve heard good things about Degree</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy enough to grip but some other products are a bit better about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ingredients are much the same as any other deodorant that contains aluminum zirconium.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless this deodorant does work like most strong antiperspirant and deodorants do.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d need to really be worried</li>
      <li>I did not notice this issue as much as he did</li>
      <li>He works highway construction, so he really gives his anti-perspirants a workout.  </li>
      <li>That’s why it is going to be much drier.</li>
      <li>This has helped but not as much as the clinical strength brands on the market.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is fairly straight-</li>
      <li>Worked just fine for me, without any irritation, though I preferred the less obtrusive fragrance on the Cool Rush variant.</li>
      <li>It’s pleasant and subtle.</li>
      <li>it does notably decrease it during hot days and very active days.</li>
      <li>It easily covers me through a long business</li>
      <li>This deodorant has a fairly strong scent that lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I think if you like Irish Spring Original scent, or coast, you will like this scent.  </li>
      <li>He prefers the scent of the Cool Rush because it&#x27;s a little more subtle but very clean and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really all you can ask for a deodorant, but he asks a little more.  </li>
      <li>- it is not so masculine that a woman can&#x27;t enjoy it occasionally.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody looking for a decent deodorant.</li>
      <li>My husband works outside at a lumber yard (Often heavy, hot work) and he said it has been effective for him too.</li>
      <li>Perhaps not quite as much as Old Spice scent-wise, but the odor and antiperspirant protection are really, really long-lasting.</li>
      <li>but he does tend to be more heavy handed in his application process than I.  </li>
      <li>At the least, it is not offensive and a pretty safe bet if you are ordering sight unsniffed.  </li>
      <li>A deodorant should smell fresh, not overpowering and the scent of this one is present over his cologne.</li>
      <li>is $7 for ONE normal size stick of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My husband tried this as he was looking for a new deodorant for when out on his mountain bike and for going to the gym.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Degree products in the past and have always been satisfied.</li>
      <li>That being said, at $7 a stick (the current price), this is also pretty pricey</li>
      <li>Goes on clear, lightly scented will not effect other colognes you might wear.</li>
      <li>There are other similar deodorants in this series (the &amp;#34;Cool Rush&amp;#34; version smells better to me) which I&#x27;d go for.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my son rave, but it would take a lot to get a 16 year old to rave about deodorant!</li>
      <li>His experience is that they don’t really work any differently.&lt;br /&gt;The Degree fragrances are generally more subtle than the Axe products.</li>
      <li>The scent is a crisp masculine fragrance that smells like standard locker room cologne.</li>
      <li>My husband is very sensitive to the clear solids which make him itch, but this one has been fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so if you work in a fragrance free office this maybe a little stronger for sensitive people.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the product seems to stem the sweat from his underarms where he put it, but the strong scent of perfume (especially at the gym) made him self conscious for other reasons.  </li>
      <li>The scent is invigorating and helps clear the head in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This claims to last for 48 hours but haven&#x27;t really had to test this since I use deodorant everyday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I prefer when he wears the Overtime scent because it smells sporty and masculine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this deodorant for my son, and he reports it does what it says it does---it works well all day long.  That&#x27;s really all you can ask for a deodorant, but he asks a little more.  He says he doesn&#x27;t like the way it feels going on that much---it feels &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; going on.  I tried it, and it&#x27;s a fairly wet feeling gel---it dries quickly, but his perception is that somehow it might get on his clothes.  When I asked him about the scent, he said &amp;#34;what scent?&amp;#34;, and indeed, the scent is very mild---just kind of a general &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell.  So overall, I&#x27;d say this is a good bet for deodorant.  It didn&#x27;t make my son rave, but it would take a lot to get a 16 year old to rave about deodorant!</li>
    <li> This anti-perspirant works well enough to last multiple days, so I have no complaints there.  The fragrance is pretty pleasant.  It has a mild masculine scent with a sort of fruity undertone.  At the least, it is not offensive and a pretty safe bet if you are ordering sight unsniffed.  I recommend giving this a shot if you like a strong anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of coffee at times and it makes me sweat under my arms. I thought I would try another anti-perspirant and see if it would work better. The answer is no. The deodorant works well, but after a couple of cups of coffee, I still get pit stains. I can&#x27;t blame the product because I have not found one that works. Even Mitchum (the gold standard) does not totally eliminate sweating for me. The only thing that works for me is cutting back on my caffeine intake.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Lasted all day with great odor and wetness protection.  I also appreciated that the scent was subtle enough not to compete with my cologne.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Even though I am a woman I sweat like a man.  This has helped but not as much as the clinical strength brands on the market.  I did not have a personal issue with the scent but my husband commented on it being somewhat strong so I had him try it too.  He reported that he did not like the residue that it left on his work shirts.  I did not notice this issue as much as he did but he does tend to be more heavy handed in his application process than I.  I also have reservations about using a product with aluminum but if it works I will make an exception during the summer months.  I do not feel that this product completely satisfies our needs enough for me to put it on our shopping list.</li>
    <li> This is targeted at men who are active playing sports or doing manual work. It has an after shave scent to it. It is a strong anti-perspirant. The active ingredient in Degree is 19.2%, Secret is 18-19%, standard Degree 17.8%, and Dove 15.2%. That’s why it is going to be much drier. The container is wider to fit a man’s hand. It is a solid which is what men prefer except for those who like an aerosol spray.</li>
    <li> I think if you like Irish Spring Original scent, or coast, you will like this scent.  While it isn&#x27;t exactly the same, it is similiar, and very green and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a white solid that you rub on.  My husband is very sensitive to the clear solids which make him itch, but this one has been fine.&lt;br /&gt;I like it too - it is not so masculine that a woman can&#x27;t enjoy it occasionally.  I like it.  The scent is invigorating and helps clear the head in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the container is wide and it is easy and quick to apply.  The packaging is fairly straight- it&#x27;s easy enough to grip but some other products are a bit better about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an effective antiperspirant.  I use it on busy hot days, working out, working in the garden, and it keeps me dry.  My husband works outside at a lumber yard (Often heavy, hot work) and he said it has been effective for him too.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a fairly strong scent that lasts a long time. I haven&#x27;t notice any staining on any of my tshirts and have been using it consistently for about 5 weeks. If I had anything critical to say about this product, it might be a little too strongly scented, but it works and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning and it does the job the entire day. This is supposed to work for 48 hours.  I have not tested the 48 hour protection and instead use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels fine on my skin and  does not cause a skin reaction. It keeps me dry and smelling fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has even worked  well when I have gone out walking. I don&#x27;t feel the need to put it on again even after I have gotten sweaty walking or doing yard work. I do put it on again after I shower.  It seems work for  people who are active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels great on my skin, works even when I get sweaty and has a nice mild scent.</li>
    <li> Living in Phoenix, I&#x27;ve had a good chance to test this anti-perspirant. Works great. I&#x27;ve used Degree products in the past and have always been satisfied. I would say this one is about as good as the other Degree varieties, and maybe even a little better. The white solid goes on clear and I had no problems with it appearing on my clothes so long as I applied carefully. The scent is a crisp masculine fragrance that smells like standard locker room cologne. It&#x27;s promoted as having some kind of \\&quot;motion sense\\&quot; technology which I&#x27;m sure is just marketing BS, but it will keep you dry and smelling fresh so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Worked just fine for me, without any irritation, though I preferred the less obtrusive fragrance on the Cool Rush variant. Unfortunately, I could not quite detect any special motion activated protection - which may be that it is working exactly as designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A_E~</li>
    <li> Frankly it stretches my credibility to have a stick of deodorant say that it has patented motion sense technology for motion activated protection and that it responds to your body&#x27;s movement to stay ahead of sweat and odor. The ingredients are much the same as any other deodorant that contains aluminum zirconium.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless this deodorant does work like most strong antiperspirant and deodorants do. It keeps your underarm area dry. It has that typical &#x60;manly&#x27; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY as the main ingredient, which is what keeps skin dry. So, those who wish to avoid exposing themselves to aluminum may want to avoid this product.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Degree Male Adrenaline Series Anti-Perspirant&amp;#34; works well and has a pleasant smell. It does a good job at controlling daily sweat and odor. This claims to last for 48 hours but haven&#x27;t really had to test this since I use deodorant everyday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> We love Degree products. This particular deodorant met my husband&#x27;s expectations as far as functionality is concerned but we both found the scent to be too strong. It&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s a great product otherwise. A deodorant should smell fresh, not overpowering and the scent of this one is present over his cologne. For that reason we wouldn&#x27;t use this variety again.</li>
    <li> My husband’s general feeling about deodorant is that they either work fine or they don’t. He usually uses Axe, which is made by the same parent company as Degree. His experience is that they don’t really work any differently.&lt;br /&gt;The Degree fragrances are generally more subtle than the Axe products. The Overtime fragrance is kind of sweet. It’s pleasant and subtle.</li>
    <li> My husband tried this as he was looking for a new deodorant for when out on his mountain bike and for going to the gym.  The first and most obvious thing upon opening the mailer-envelope is the strong scent.  After opening the deodorant and putting it on, my husband put it on for a 2 hour ride.  Obviously he wasn&#x27;t smelling the perfume in the deodorant while he was riding as the wind was moving it away from his face.  However, when he finally got home, both he and I could still smell it on him.  It was still quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product seems to stem the sweat from his underarms where he put it, but the strong scent of perfume (especially at the gym) made him self conscious for other reasons.  While he was not stinky, he was definitely smelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this seems to be the way that most deodorants are going.  So the only solution is to use unscented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended only if you like or don;t mind strong perfume.  A fully functional deodorant.</li>
    <li> I clicked this item thinking it was a twin-pack, as it was listed right alongside the other 2 flavors (?) of Adrenaline Series deodorant twin-packs at the same price - about $7.00.  AmazonPrime $7 for a TWINPACK is a great price.&lt;br /&gt;This is $7 for ONE normal size stick of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I feel scammed.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little less aggressive than some of the other Degree products. Moreover, the product guards well against odor and perspiration. Nonetheless, I kinda loathe white deodorants ... they leave streaks on clothing, making me put my Spray N Wash into overtime. So, if you wear a lot of black t-shirts, this may not be the product for you. Otherwise, this is an excellent deodorant.</li>
    <li> Great solid. Great to use when going for a run or working out. Will keep you smelling clean after the gym till you take a shower. Does not mess up your clothing with the fatal white strip. Goes on clear, lightly scented will not effect other colognes you might wear. Over keeps you dry.</li>
    <li> This works great on the hard court.  Even after the basketball game it does what it supposed to do.  This is designed for people on the move.  The stick spreads invisible and one application is all you need.  I prefer a milder scent though as if you aren&#x27;t wearing any protection at all.</li>
    <li> Wow! Amazing scent and the best protection I&#x27;ve ever used. I work as a deckhand on the Mississippi River in south Louisiana and this does exactly what is says. I wish I could find cologne in this fragrance. My new favorite smell and will never switch deodorants until they discontinue this series.</li>
    <li> I love the new Adrenaline series of antiperspirants from Degree. Overtime applies discreetly, with a fresh clean scent, and keeps me dry in the most demanding situations. I feel confident with protection which I can rely on, from a brand I can trust. This is an excellent antiperspirant stick.</li>
    <li> This appears to actually deliver on the &amp;#34;motion sensing&amp;#34; part. The scent seems to be reactivated by arm movement. I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I&#x27;m guessing it has to do with friction and how the product layers on to your body such that you &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; off some of it when you&#x27;re active. If you&#x27;ve frequently found yourself with body odor issues during or after exercise, this can be a very good thing. My main problem is that I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong scent. It&#x27;s just a bit overbearing for my tastes. There are other similar deodorants in this series (the &amp;#34;Cool Rush&amp;#34; version smells better to me) which I&#x27;d go for. That being said, at $7 a stick (the current price), this is also pretty pricey and I&#x27;d need to really be worried aobut workout-induced odor to put out that sort of cash on a single stick.</li>
    <li> This works well for my husband and I like the scent.  He had been using Old Spice and while it worked well, it was blue and left blue pit stains on his shirts.  This degree deodorant doesn&#x27;t stain his clothes, works well, and smells nice.  What more could you want from a deodorant?</li>
    <li> My husband is using this deodorant, and he likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t tested out the 48 hour claim, but I haven&#x27;t noticed him smelling sweaty at any point. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is overwhelming. It&#x27;s smells a bit like a nice, manly soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, no complaints.</li>
    <li> My husband is a heavy sweater.  He works highway construction, so he really gives his anti-perspirants a workout.  I gave him this to try, and he reported that he did like it, and sweated less than with the Speed Stick that he normally uses.  He didn&#x27;t complain about the fragrance, but I don&#x27;t personally like it.  I can smell it if he&#x27;s within 3 or 4 feet of me.</li>
    <li> My stepson can break into a sweat with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;Also due to allergies many &amp;#34;high powered&amp;#34; anti-antiperspirants (ie those that cover up the smell of sweat with heavy scents) don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product while having some scent is not overpowering.  And while it does not stop his sweat all together (he can be a sweat machine) it does notably decrease it during hot days and very active days.</li>
    <li> I typically use Old Spice deodorant, but I&#x27;ve heard good things about Degree and I like to have an antiperspirant in my anti-stinky arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. Perhaps not quite as much as Old Spice scent-wise, but the odor and antiperspirant protection are really, really long-lasting. It easily covers me through a long business day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself goes on pretty smoothly for an antiperspirant. It has the typical chalky feel of an antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s not overly dry or clumpy.</li>
    <li> With its active ingredient being Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19.2%), its the same as all its Adrenaline Series anti-perspirants I believe. I like this one best, it has citrus tones which keep me smelling clean all day and I swear I even sweat in the dead of winter. Degree has given me my confidence back with this product, I used to use a prescription anti-perspirant but this seems to work just as well without all the skin irritation. How they did that I do not know, but I am pleasantly surprised. Just a note, the smell is a little on the stronger side so if you work in a fragrance free office this maybe a little stronger for sensitive people. I myself thought it was great, non-offense and reminded me of Calvin Klein&#x27;s One fragrance from back in the day.</li>
    <li> My husband has been alternating his antiperspirants between this Cool Rush scent and the Overtime scent. He prefers the scent of the Cool Rush because it&#x27;s a little more subtle but very clean and fresh smelling. I prefer when he wears the Overtime scent because it smells sporty and masculine. Either one would be a good choice because they both smell amazing and my husband says they both keep him dry and smelling great, which definitely says a lot because we live in the hot desert climate.</li>
    <li> Good smell, goes on fine, protection lasts. What more can you really ask for in a deodorant? I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody looking for a decent deodorant.</li>
