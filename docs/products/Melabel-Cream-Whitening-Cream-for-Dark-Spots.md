      <li>I love this cream</li>
      <li>I strongly love it</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>then I found this product and very excited about the cream and just 1 week I can see result.</li>

      <li>I will be ordering another bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a good product.  </li>
      <li>After 3 week significant lightening</li>
      <li>My face is sometimes dry and flaky even though I use good moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>i liked this product because when i applied it to my face there was a big difference</li>
      <li>The smell fades pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true, but once daily works for me.</li>
      <li>and i saw results very fast.</li>
      <li>After researching many different products online I went with Melabel cream.</li>
      <li>I have used the cream on the top of my hands and also noticied the same changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I woudl say, is the smell when you first put in on.  </li>
      <li>My only compliant is that I would like to see how much lotion I am paying for and to make sure I am using all of it after I can&#x27;t pump anymore out.</li>
      <li>Spots tend to darken before peeling but not so much that anyone has ever commented on it.  </li>
      <li>After a month I started seeing the spots lighten but not by much.</li>
      <li>Even gentle products like those from Elta MD cause a burning sensation and temporary redness.  </li>
      <li>It gave my shoulders a much smoother and more even look from sun spots and other scars.</li>
      <li>I tried so many cream for my black spots on my face</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the results and would recommend this to anyone with dark facial discoloration.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an older person</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll wait a few more weeks to see if it really is working</li>
      <li>I am a white male, 60 years old, with Fair skin, blue eyes and Blond hair.  </li>
      <li>and I have only used for about 3 weeks and highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>I now wear a sun hat every day--lots of good ones on Amazon!--in part because sunscreen is irritating.  </li>
      <li>so I always order another one on the day I receive the new jar.</li>
      <li>So far I can see a lightening of the spots.  </li>
      <li>I like that the ingredients are natural.  </li>
      <li>Having applied this product once a day for seven weeks I estimate that dark spots on my face and hands have diminished 50% overall--darker, older ones less so and lighter, newer ones more so.  </li>
      <li>I have seen a major difference in my skin</li>
      <li>When applying the cream, it gives a slight burning sensation at first, but that is minor and goes away.</li>

    <li> I have used this daily and I have noticed a difference in my brown spots on my face.  They are getting lighter in color.  I have used the cream on the top of my hands and also noticied the same changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative I woudl say, is the smell when you first put in on.  The smell fades pretty quickly.  I will be ordering another bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a good product.  Maybe some day they will totally disappear!!</li>
    <li> i liked this product because when i applied it to my face there was a big difference and i saw results very fast.</li>
    <li> Maser up my face it dried it all out very bad and at the end of it it didn&#x27;t even erased the dark spots out</li>
    <li> After using it 3-4 times my skin became worst, it burned my skin and now I don&#x27;t know how to improve my skin :  very bad ........</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have dark olive skin (latin) and had some hyperpigmentation due to a bad laser peel.  I applied this product and within one day I noticed a difference!  People started commenting on the improvement within a week.  I am very pleased with the results and would recommend this to anyone with dark facial discoloration.</li>
    <li> I tried so many cream for my black spots on my face then I found this product and very excited about the cream and just 1 week I can see result. Recommend to every one that has same problem with me. Works great!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. After researching many different products online I went with Melabel cream. I began seeing results after one week of use. I would recommend this product to anyone who is seeking an affordable skin lightening cream that works.</li>
    <li> Used it twice a day. It gave my shoulders a much smoother and more even look from sun spots and other scars. Doesnt work quite as well on very dark spots but still lightens them. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> It took me 4 weeks to get products.  I think it will directory delivery from Europe.  Then I tried for 4 weeks in morning and evening each day.  Somehow skin has been cleared but brown spots or scars does not effect at all.  I ordered second one after 5 weeks and tried for another 3 weeks but I don&#x27;t see better result.  I think it does cleanse skin but not for brown spots.  I would not order this item anymore.&lt;br /&gt;During trial, I used 100+ Sun block. It seems like Melabel cream is dry up skin.  Sun block has been helped from drying skin.  Of course, when I go out, I had big hat to cover my face.</li>
    <li> Working well along w apple&lt;br /&gt;Cider vinager</li>
    <li> Used it for two week nothing happen. Bothered my skin very much and has bad ingredients do bother on gettin it.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my dark spot. I do not recommend this product. The product have a odor that stay around for a while.  This product really sucks for black skin.  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream and on the darker areas, I am starting to see a difference.  I&#x27;ll wait a few more weeks to see if it really is working but I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and the darker areas have slightly lightened BUT, the liter brown spots on my face are still about the same.  But since it is working on the darker areas, I&#x27;ll use the rest of it.  I do see a difference on the darker spots though, sooooo, i do believe it&#x27;s working.  Porcelana, esoterica, etc.. have done nothing and at least this is working.</li>
    <li> I have dark spots on my face from years of acne.  I have tried all sort of products and I found that this product works the best.  I have seen a major difference in my skin and I love it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The pump would not dispense.  I tore it apart and there is nothing in the bottle.  Would not purchase from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;I would contact them but they are out of the US and I do not have a number for them.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen a different so the price</li>
    <li> I followed the directions for the required amount of time and finished the product. No difference that I could discern.</li>
    <li> I have noticied a difference and now am hooked I love this cream it also gives me confidence I have Melasma and I have only used for about 3 weeks and highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is helping to lighten and soften the sunspots and age spots that I have on my face.  I like that the ingredients are natural.  I recommend this product.  I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> its great, its plenty good and the price is amazing..</li>
    <li> i dont recieve my order yet, if I&#x27;m going to tract my oreder it won&#x27;t go trough, it says \\&quot; oreder not found</li>
    <li> This cream works and is hydroquinone free. I can use it to fade sun spots and melasma during my pregnancy without worrying about my little bean. It takes a while to get in from Europe so I always order another one on the day I receive the new jar.</li>
    <li> I have Been using the cream for about 2 weeks.  I am a white male, 60 years old, with Fair skin, blue eyes and Blond hair.  I purchased this cream to try and remove several age spots on my face.  So far I can see a lightening of the spots.  Whether it is going to totally remove the spots is still up in the air, as the company says it takes up 4 weeks.  One thing I can say is that I have had no side effects from the cream.  I have been using it at night and in the day time if it is cloudy.  When applying the cream, it gives a slight burning sensation at first, but that is minor and goes away. I will give another update after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I was dubious but this product was the best reviewed.  Have been trying it on dark spots from removed pre-cancerous moles on forehead.  After 3 week significant lightening</li>
    <li> i have been using this cream for a while now but it does not work, you can give it a shot if you want</li>
    <li> Works well to slowly reduce spots. My only compliant is that I would like to see how much lotion I am paying for and to make sure I am using all of it after I can&#x27;t pump anymore out.</li>
    <li> It does help but it&#x27;s a slow process. After a month I started seeing the spots lighten but not by much. 2.5 months later I&#x27;m still trying to get them lighter. Haven&#x27;t had any side effects like peeling and can use it 2 times a day with no dryness.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;d give it zero if I could. doesn&#x27;t work at all. used it for a month. it&#x27;s yellowish so when you put on your make up it hides the hyperpigmentation but does not lighten them.</li>
    <li> This is unbelievable, during three days of use you can see the different obviously in just three days. I strongly love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen no results from the Melabel Cream. It does not &#x27;smell&#x27; very good either.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how good it is since I was allergic to it</li>
    <li> Didnt work as  expected</li>
    <li> Having applied this product once a day for seven weeks I estimate that dark spots on my face and hands have diminished 50% overall--darker, older ones less so and lighter, newer ones more so.

Even gentle products like those from Elta MD cause a burning sensation and temporary redness.  My face is sometimes dry and flaky even though I use good moisturizers.  But those are small prices to pay for clearer skin.  The instructions say you can use it twice a day for faster results and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true, but once daily works for me.</li>
    <li> i have been using melabrel for over 2 months. I have seen some improvements such as fading, but spots have not fully gone away. still going to finish the bottle to see further results.i had quite a few freckles and some age spots the age spots have only faded a little, but they were quite dark some freckles are gone but not all, so only time will tell. I have had no reaction or any type of side affects.will continue to use until gone I as hoping for better results.</li>
