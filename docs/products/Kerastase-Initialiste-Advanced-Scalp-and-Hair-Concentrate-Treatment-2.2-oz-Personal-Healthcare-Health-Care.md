      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Great smell too.</li>
      <li>LOVED IT AND WILL USE IT.</li>
      <li>I know from my hairdresser that the product itself is meant to sensational, but the way in which the bottle itself arrived makes me hesitant to recommend this wholeheartedly.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This may be OK but with one bit proviso.</li>
      <li>My hair feels in better condition.</li>
      <li>My hair seems to be with more volume.</li>
      <li>I do love this product.  </li>
      <li>(I have fine hair but a lot of it).  </li>
      <li>and my fine hair looks fuller after drying and styling it.</li>
      <li>Worth to try!</li>
      <li>and this really makes it look and feel so much better.</li>
      <li>The bottle arrived packaged but did not seem full.</li>
      <li>Really, there is no substitute!</li>
      <li>I like the product but am very upset.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>I can not tell you if it works, yet, but it arrived fast and as pictured.</li>
      <li>but I really like it</li>
      <li>It really does help my hair grow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of this stuff so far, and my bush is still a long way off from looking like a full fledged, Lord of the Rings worthy forest.</li>
      <li>My hair was extremely damage and now it&#x27;s becoming healthier.</li>
      <li>This product was highly recommended by my friend</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wishing I would have just purchased it directly from Kerastase and paid a little more money to get the real thing...</li>
      <li>It does not generate new follicles.  </li>
      <li>The way this product works is it regenerates hair growth from existing but dormant hair follicles, so it takes quite a while to grow new hair.  </li>
      <li>My one issue with the product is that unlike previous bottles I have purchased, this lasted barely a month when others have lasted more than two.  </li>
      <li>I started using initialiste a couple months ago for a form of seborrheic dermatitis and unlike other products that dry out your hair, this works great without making hair limp either</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft but I have noticed nothing else as far as benefits from this product</li>
      <li>and I can definitely see new growth all over my head.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately the beautiful bottle it comes in is transparent so it is impossible to tell if it is full or near empty.</li>

<li> My hair is in really bad shape - thin, dry, etc.</li>
<li> The product was quite expensive</li>
<li> Though it is annoying to have an inch of growth which often looks like frizz or fly-aways, I know in another 6 months to a year I will have a thicker head of hair.</li>

    <li> I CAN REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN MY THIN HAIR USING THIS PRODUCT. LOVED IT AND WILL USE IT.</li>
    <li> The product was quite expensive but I really like it and it has lasted a long time.  My hair feels in better condition.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It works!</li>
    <li> I think it helped my hair get thicker after I use it I see volume</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Kerastase is the best!!! Really, there is no substitute! Just a little goes a long way. My hair is in really bad shape - thin, dry, etc. and this really makes it look and feel so much better. Great smell too.</li>
    <li> Best product of its kind</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really does help my hair grow. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now. The package comes in a sealed package with directions. It&#x27;s priced about $15 cheaper than purchasing it from my salon.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipment</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by my friend so I bought two of those. I can not tell you if it works, yet, but it arrived fast and as pictured. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Thank you! This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I do love this product.  I started using it when I had severe anemia and lost my hair.  After months of iron supplements and Initialiste, my hair is completely back.  I continue to use Initialiste about three times a week after shampooing.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for three years.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I am choosing this rating at this time because I have only been using the product for a little over a month. However for the cost I would have expected results sooner....but I will be patient.</li>
    <li> The way this product works is it regenerates hair growth from existing but dormant hair follicles, so it takes quite a while to grow new hair.  It is like growing hair after a hair cut.  It takes months and months to regrow inches that were cut off.  This is the same theory.  It does not generate new follicles.  I have been using the product for about 7 months and I can definitely see new growth all over my head.  Though it is annoying to have an inch of growth which often looks like frizz or fly-aways, I know in another 6 months to a year I will have a thicker head of hair.</li>
    <li> This may be OK but with one bit proviso. The package arrived in a very timely way, but the bottle had clearly been opened so I am feeling insecure about the quantity left (it is hard to tell given the bottle is opaque and the liquid viscous). I know from my hairdresser that the product itself is meant to sensational, but the way in which the bottle itself arrived makes me hesitant to recommend this wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of this stuff so far, and my bush is still a long way off from looking like a full fledged, Lord of the Rings worthy forest. Guess I&#x27;ll jus thave to bite the bullet and get a merkin.</li>
    <li> My hair feels soft but I have noticed nothing else as far as benefits from this product</li>
    <li> No! The bottle arrived packaged but did not seem full. Unfortunately the beautiful bottle it comes in is transparent so it is impossible to tell if it is full or near empty. I used 2 syringes a day and it only lasted 3 weeks! It is supposed to last for at least a couple months. I read other reviews and saw it lasts up to 3 months for some people. I like the product but am very upset. I definitely got ripped off!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I went online and found a video at the Kerastase website showing how to apply it. The stuff is actually making my hair grow faster!</li>
    <li> I started using initialiste a couple months ago for a form of seborrheic dermatitis and unlike other products that dry out your hair, this works great without making hair limp either (I have fine hair but a lot of it).  My one issue with the product is that unlike previous bottles I have purchased, this lasted barely a month when others have lasted more than two.  As with the other reviews and the opaque bottle, it makes me wary of purchasing from this seller again as I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> My hair seems to be with more volume. My hair was extremely damage and now it&#x27;s becoming healthier. Worth to try!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and have been using it for 3 weeks and notice zero difference in my hair. I just looked at some of the reviews, and all the recent 5 star reviews that are only 1 sentence or a few words seem to be fake reviews... I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product. I&#x27;m wishing I would have just purchased it directly from Kerastase and paid a little more money to get the real thing...</li>
    <li> Have been using Initialiste for a couple of weeks and have noticed big improvements-less hairs falling out and my fine hair looks fuller after drying and styling it. Will not stop using this product!!</li>
    <li> great option and price</li>
