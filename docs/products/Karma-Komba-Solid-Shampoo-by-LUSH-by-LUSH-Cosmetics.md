      <li>Its a million times better!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>

      <li>This is just amazing.  </li>
      <li>but it definately smells kind of foresty and nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a unisex kind of scent, so I have to fight over it with my husband when we travel.</li>
      <li>It lathers really nice and smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>Yum and easy to use travel with!</li>
      <li>Lush and Burt&#x27;s Bees, Jason and The Body Shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell, and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over.</li>
      <li>, I love it, I love it.  </li>
      <li>I immediately ordered 3 more \\&quot;rounds\\&quot; to have on hand when this one is finished.</li>
      <li>It lasts for months, my hair is shiny and weightless, and I love the patchouli scent.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a bit more citrusy.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>Better for the environment.</li>
      <li>&quot; This was my reaction when a friend showed me her latest method for washing and de-tangling her hair.</li>
      <li>Give it a try; you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It works well for most hair types.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Afterwards I follow with the American Cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe)</li>
      <li>But kept dry, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>I have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured, instead its slippery and wonderfully light.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the smell is not that strong at all...especially in your hair afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling full and shiny and better than any bottled shampoo I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I take very good care of it, always have, but any product that leaves more than a touch of residue, (for conditioning purposes), weighs my tresses down.</li>
      <li>My hair is plentiful, but it is baby fine and flyaway.</li>
      <li>I am completely impressed with all the LUSH products I have tried and am looking forward to giving LUSH for Christmas !</li>
      <li>It smells too light, not musky and earthy like patchouli.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean but not stripped and that is important since I color it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo stick with me like this and my hair feels light and shiny and just clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light, clean smell.</li>
      <li>I visited a Lush store in Vancouver, Canada for the first time; just wandered in and had a great time testing all the soaps.</li>
      <li>It rinses out leaving my hair squeaky clean - with no tangles.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell, the scent seems to linger in my hair all day whereas the \\&quot;New!\\&quot; shampoo bar doesn&#x27;t so much and</li>
      <li>Made with essential oils, with undertones of citrus and spices, this product is also good for the scalp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and fresh..  </li>
      <li>To cut down on bringing a whole bag full of bath products to the gym, I use this as a shampoo AND soap, and it works wonderfully for both purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; I had my doubts just like everyone else, and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped, and if it would later at all.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get a oily as quickly as before.  </li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite of the LUSH line!  </li>
      <li>Fantastic soap, but wish it wouldn&#x27;t melt as fast as it did.</li>
      <li>Great for camping, travelling, bringing to the gym, or just using as an everyday shampoo.</li>
      <li>It smells great with all of the Lush conditioners - especially Jungle and Coolaulin.</li>
      <li>Would still go back for more, tho&#x27;   Enjoy - DK from AZ</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh</li>
      <li>Lush describes it as oranges in a bowl of spices; I&#x27;m not so sure about that</li>
      <li>hard shampoo lathers up beautifully and quickly.</li>
      <li>First of all, I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it lathers.  </li>
      <li>The bar makes a nice lather and lasts a really long time.  </li>
      <li>MUCH better than those little bottles of foul-smelling shampoo and bath gel you get at most hotels.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t remember the exact name right now, but it is reddish orange in color.</li>
      <li>I will likely stick with my \\&quot;New!\\&quot; shampoo primarily but will order this again in the future for sure!</li>
      <li>also from Lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft, with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on.</li>
      <li>The bar is also bright green, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I decided to try this solid soap shampoo and LOVE everything about it.</li>
      <li>my hair did seem a bit more manageable and soft after use that what it is normally</li>
      <li>so I would most definitely recommend it!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a positive difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy, organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin.</li>
      <li>It rinsed off very well with hot water</li>
      <li>The result is glossy, soft, full bodied hair.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough for my oily scalp, but gentle enough for my really fine hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a recent convert to Lush products and I have to say I&#x27;m thrilled to find this new shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Very highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with tangling to begin with.</li>
      <li>and I really like this one.</li>
      <li>I love Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it when I first bought it, but it has come to be one of my most favorite scents!  </li>
      <li>I have since tried other LUSH products and have had good results so far.</li>
      <li>It lasts very long, it lathers extremely well, and best of all, it leaves my hair shinier than I have ever seen with other shampoos I have used.</li>
      <li>smell, of course, is grand - if you&#x27;ve smelled other karma-scented products from Lush, you&#x27;ll know this.</li>
      <li>This stuff really makes your hair soft.</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that there&#x27;s no plastic wasted for bottles.  </li>
      <li>Far, far better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>In general, Lush doesn&#x27;t have the powerful woodsy patchouli scents, though.</li>
      <li>shampoo leaves my hair FAR less tangled than most shampoos I use, so</li>
      <li>And it cleans better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s conditioning at the same time...</li>
      <li>This is the first solid shampoo I have used</li>
      <li>I am a new convert to LUSH products having stumbled upon them while at the Orlando airport.</li>
      <li>this is a fun new way of washing their hair with no chemicals and natural botanicals that truly do wonders and enhance every single hair.</li>
      <li>Still an awesome product, just wish it was a bit less expensive.</li>
      <li>The only caveat is that you need to make sure that it rests on a plastic pad or somthing that lets it dry out after use, or it will get too soft if left in any standing water.</li>
      <li>No matter how much I try to clean regular shampoo from my hair it seems to weigh it down.</li>
      <li>people say than can go without conditioner with this shampoo, but I wouldn&#x27;t go that far.</li>
      <li>You WILL need the lush tin, or an equivalent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This shampoo is amazing.  A rub of the bar over your hands or at the roots of your hair and you have a head of lather.  Far, far better than I expected.  And  someone always comments on the smell of my hair.  Leaves your tresses soft even without a conditioner.  Give it a try; you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awsome. the lather is great, the smell is wonderful.  Try it. I promise you will like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to Lush products and I have to say I&#x27;m thrilled to find this new shampoo.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I started using this a couple of days ago and I&#x27;ve noticed a positive difference in my hair. My hair wasn&#x27;t a total mess using silicone shampoos, but now that I&#x27;ve changed brands I can see the potential my hair had and I didn&#x27;t even know it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length really thick hair with a few waves and curls. I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with tangling to begin with. All I needed was a couple of swipes down my hair and this will lather right up. It smells awesome in the shower. Lush describes it as oranges in a bowl of spices; I&#x27;m not so sure about that but it definately smells kind of foresty and nice. It rinsed off very well with hot water and I followed with Jungle conditioner.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hours later in the day I can stil smell Komba shampoo wafting around my head. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo stick with me like this and my hair feels light and shiny and just clean. No matter how much I try to clean regular shampoo from my hair it seems to weigh it down. My boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;. This is just amazing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend keeping the shampoo in an airtight container. Keeping it on a shelf where any water will hit it will deteriorate its longevity. I keep mine in a very tiny tupperwear container in the shower. The size of the bar is small, but it will go a loooooong way.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite of the LUSH line!  The scent is hard to describe.. and I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it when I first bought it, but it has come to be one of my most favorite scents!  I&#x27;m hooked!  This is also the only shampoo that the smell stays in your hair ALL day, even after using Conditioner.. It&#x27;s so light and fresh..  simply amazing.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this solid shampoo after reading several of the positive reviews on here about it.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I felt that I needed to give proper kudos to this product.  I have long, thin, fine, oily hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for products that will provide body, but that won&#x27;t leave my hair dried out or leave a lot of build up behind.  This shampoo is fabulous!  First of all, I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it lathers.  A few rubs on the scalp and boom!  And it cleans better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s conditioning at the same time...I didn&#x27;t know a such product existed.  I only have to use half of the amount of conditioner that I did before and I only use that for my ends.  Also, and this is a big deal for me...I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for the past three days and I&#x27;ve found that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get a oily as quickly as before.  I usually have to wash my hair twice a day because I look like a grease monkey otherwise.  Not with this stuff!  I am so pleased with this product.  I love it, I love it, I love it.  I will certainly be ordering some other products from the \\&quot;Lush\\&quot; company.  Oh, and the smell is not that strong at all...especially in your hair afterwards.  It&#x27;s a light, clean smell.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Shampoo that looks like a round, green lava pumice stone - you&#x27;ve got to be kidding!! Who thought up that packaging gimmick?\\&quot; This was my reaction when a friend showed me her latest method for washing and de-tangling her hair. My hair is plentiful, but it is baby fine and flyaway. I take very good care of it, always have, but any product that leaves more than a touch of residue, (for conditioning purposes), weighs my tresses down. Also, I color my hair and have to be careful I don&#x27;t dry it out. Skeptically, I tried out Karma Komba, and WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hard shampoo lathers up beautifully and quickly. It rinses out leaving my hair squeaky clean - with no tangles. I just use a dab of conditioner - and that&#x27;s not always necessary with Karma Komba. Made with essential oils, with undertones of citrus and spices, this product is also good for the scalp. It works well for most hair types. A slight scent of patchouli lingers - but very faint and pleasant. The result is glossy, soft, full bodied hair. I immediately ordered 3 more \\&quot;rounds\\&quot; to have on hand when this one is finished. I am addicted - a real fan! I have since tried other LUSH products and have had good results so far. Very highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
    <li> Karma Komba is awesome. It smells so fresh and it does wonders detangling my hair with millions of suds. I use Bed Head styling products and some of them are very heavy, but this little bar cleans without drying and you only need to use a little. It lasts me between a month and a month and a half.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some people say than can go without conditioner with this shampoo, but I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. It smells great with all of the Lush conditioners - especially Jungle and Coolaulin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and great scent</li>
    <li> I usually use Lush&#x27;s Irrisistible Bliss.  I bought Karma Komba one day because by the description I thought it would be good for my hair.  I used it once and I smelled like a stoner for 3 days!  I could not get rid of the patchouli smell.  So I moved it into the garage sealed in 2 ziploc bags and my garage still smelled like Patchouli.  I only suggest this shampoo if you LOVE Patchouli or are trying to cover up a more nasty or illegal smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff really makes your hair soft. It took me by surprise. I do not use any other products in my hair so it was quite an effect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would have NEVER guessed there was patchouli in the fragrance. It smells too light, not musky and earthy like patchouli.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this shampoo just after one use.  I almost cried when it was gone.  It lathers nicely and smells great, too! If you haven&#x27;t tried it, I think you should. I also love the fact that there&#x27;s no plastic wasted for bottles.  Better for the environment.</li>
    <li> I usually use the \\&quot;New! (hair)\\&quot; shampoo bar but decided to try this one during a recent online shopping spree on Lush&#x27;s site.  I LOVE the smell, the scent seems to linger in my hair all day whereas the \\&quot;New!\\&quot; shampoo bar doesn&#x27;t so much and my hair did seem a bit more manageable and soft after use that what it is normally so I would most definitely recommend it!  I will likely stick with my \\&quot;New!\\&quot; shampoo primarily but will order this again in the future for sure!</li>
    <li> I visited a Lush store in Vancouver, Canada for the first time; just wandered in and had a great time testing all the soaps. I decided to try this solid soap shampoo and LOVE everything about it. It lasts very long, it lathers extremely well, and best of all, it leaves my hair shinier than I have ever seen with other shampoos I have used. The only caveat is that you need to make sure that it rests on a plastic pad or somthing that lets it dry out after use, or it will get too soft if left in any standing water. Other than that, I&#x27;m a believer!   They also have a great smelling LUSH \\&quot;signature\\&quot; soap, that is, a fragrance that is their \\&quot;signature\\&quot; and that is also AWESOME. Can&#x27;t remember the exact name right now, but it is reddish orange in color. Fantastic soap, but wish it wouldn&#x27;t melt as fast as it did. Would still go back for more, tho&#x27;   Enjoy - DK from AZ</li>
    <li> This solid shampoo smells just like Lush&#x27;s Karma fragrance- orange and patchouli.  I find the patchouli to be a bit heavier in the shampoo than in some other Lush products.  The bar makes a nice lather and lasts a really long time.  The bar is also bright green, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides are: first, that this is a love or hate fragrance.  I happen to like it, but it&#x27;s not to everyone&#x27;s taste.  Second, this is a strongly scented shampoo, and it&#x27;s hard to find a complementary conditioner.</li>
    <li> This bar really dried out my hair and made it drab. I was looking forward to a treat for myself, and ended up feeling ripped off. The only way I will ever use this bar again is if I am forced to pack light for travel or camping.</li>
    <li> I love Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos. You WILL need the lush tin, or an equivalent. I was too stubborn to pay extra for it so I had to keep this in a sort of awkward, dry spot in my shower. Otherwise, the bar gets gooey and it wastes away. But kept dry, it&#x27;s perfect! It lasts for months, my hair is shiny and weightless, and I love the patchouli scent. In general, Lush doesn&#x27;t have the powerful woodsy patchouli scents, though. They&#x27;re a bit more citrusy. Still an awesome product, just wish it was a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> For those bored with the same old bottles of shampoo an hair products at their local drugstore this is a fun new way of washing their hair with no chemicals and natural botanicals that truly do wonders and enhance every single hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; I had my doubts just like everyone else, and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped, and if it would later at all. To my surprise this small disc turns into an avalanche of bubbles once I wet it and rub it between the hands. I also wet my hair and rub the bar all over, working with the lather form my hands and the lather from the wet bar. I have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured, instead its slippery and wonderfully light. Afterwards I follow with the American Cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe) also from Lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft, with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The scent itself is wonderful, citrusy and earthy, with Patchouli Oil, Orange Oil, Lavendin Oil, Pine Oil , Lemongrass Oil , Elemi Oil , Gardenia Extract and the Roman Chamomile Flower. I often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy, organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin. After using drugstore and even expansive brands of hair products and skin potions, I find that my skin and hair never really benefited from all those preservatives and unnatural products derived from mineral oils and god knows what else. Lush and Burt&#x27;s Bees, Jason and The Body Shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell, and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Kasia S. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair look better.</li>
    <li> I am a new convert to LUSH products having stumbled upon them while at the Orlando airport. This is the first solid shampoo I have used and I really like this one. It lathers really nice and smells fantastic! It leaves my hair feeling full and shiny and better than any bottled shampoo I have ever used. My hair feels clean but not stripped and that is important since I color it. I am looking forward to trying the others and a conditioner as well. I am completely impressed with all the LUSH products I have tried and am looking forward to giving LUSH for Christmas !</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried a solid shampoo before, you definitely should! Great for camping, travelling, bringing to the gym, or just using as an everyday shampoo. To cut down on bringing a whole bag full of bath products to the gym, I use this as a shampoo AND soap, and it works wonderfully for both purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo leaves my hair FAR less tangled than most shampoos I use, so if you don&#x27;t often have to use conditioner, you probably won&#x27;t need it if you use this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, of course, is grand - if you&#x27;ve smelled other karma-scented products from Lush, you&#x27;ll know this. It&#x27;s a unisex kind of scent, so I have to fight over it with my husband when we travel. MUCH better than those little bottles of foul-smelling shampoo and bath gel you get at most hotels. The earthy, citrusy smell of lemongrass, orange, lavendar, and pine is a wonderful way to wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to a Lush store, you can usually get a free tin to store your shampoo bars in if you buy 2 bars.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at the Lush store in my town.  I had a hard time believing that it would work as well as liquid shampoo.  Its a million times better!  It is strong enough for my oily scalp, but gentle enough for my really fine hair. And it smells great, too.  My hair is super shiny and smooth without feeling heavy and slick. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Yum and easy to use travel with!</li>
