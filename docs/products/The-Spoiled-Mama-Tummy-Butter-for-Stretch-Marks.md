### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Aside from that, this cream is the best.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I had ordered this product before from Amazon and LOVED it!</li>
      <li>and i loved it!</li>
      <li>It feels great and soothing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard good reviews</li>
      <li>this is a good stretch mark prevention cream</li>
      <li>I was extremely happy with this product and would recommend it to all pregnant women!</li>
      <li>Loved the product, planning to buy some more.</li>
      <li>The texture was nice and creamy</li>
      <li>The best prevention to stretch marks is staying hydrated and maintaining healthy weight gain, but this has certainly helped as well.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s def the best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>This butter is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>The texture is great, the smell isn&#x27;t intolerable and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money to be able to show my tummy without embarrassment.</li>
      <li>I love this tummy butter.  </li>
      <li>I tried several brands, but this one was the best.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s safe for pregnancy</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with this lotion because it faded my stretchmarks and my c-section scar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This makes a thoughtful gift for the mama&#x27;s to be in your life!  </li>
      <li>For the price I was hoping for better results.</li>
      <li>Since using this product I have not had any more pop up</li>
      <li>This was a gift, so I can&#x27;t really be sure.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it says to apply it multiple times a day for best use.</li>
      <li>but it gives it a wonderful healthy glow and leaves it feeling super soft.</li>
      <li>It does smell pretty good</li>
      <li>Since there&#x27;s nothing we can do about genetics, I tried to focus first on maintaining a good veggie, fruit, and meat-based diet.  </li>
      <li>Great results so far!</li>
      <li>I liked the product texture but the smell is not my favorite, I would not be able to use it during the first trimester.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought, wow, this works great!</li>
      <li>Also it ran out very quick</li>
      <li>I read such great reviews</li>
      <li>But it did fade them significantly.  </li>
      <li>like I did the first time, great experience and the security they have your back covered if there is any problem</li>
      <li>The key factors seem to be genetics, diet, hydration, and use of a good anti-stretch mark cream.  </li>
      <li>I regret paying so much for something that probably doesn&#x27;t work any better than the $5 coco butter you can buy at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>It really works, but mostly importantly, it brings a lot of fantastic relief to an itchy tummy throughout pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>I used this liberally, along with the bump gloss, two times each day (morning and evening) since the moment I found out I was pregnant.</li>
      <li>, this morning (32 weeks pregnant), I woke up to stretch marks across my lower belly.</li>
      <li>You have to live a healthy lifestyle too and hope your genes don&#x27;t work against you.  </li>
      <li>works just fine, but i really didnt care for the smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is not bad, and it absorbs very quickly which is good because I usually put it on before getting into bed.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the price if you hope to return to your pre-baby body without stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the</li>
      <li>My doctor told me that no cream or oil or skin regimen would stop the marks from coming and she was right.</li>
      <li>I would use it again in my next pregnancy, again, just to feel like I was doing the most I could do.</li>
      <li>more then the actual spoiled mama Web site.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed several more stretch marks on my belly and they get darker every day.</li>
      <li>I already had some stretch marks from my first pregnancy, but I&#x27;m 31 weeks now</li>
      <li>Used for my first pregnancy, not one stretch mark</li>
      <li>I am going to try other creams/oils that is more smell friendly to morning sickness</li>
      <li>I had stretchmarks from my first kid to begin with</li>
      <li>I was excited about all the natural ingredients but</li>
      <li>My sister in law says this is her absolute favorite tummy butter of several that she has tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(So I have lots of time to write unnecessarily long reviews on Amazon :) ) and still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>If you applied it as much as recommended you would need to buy it in bulk just to keep up use.</li>
      <li>It really works and hydrates your skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s important to stay hydrated from the inside out and the outside in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant, and so far so new stretch marks.</li>
      <li>and I caught mine early enough to prevent them from becoming purple.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones yet!</li>
      <li>so it feels not only super stretchy and moisturized</li>
      <li>I used this product when I was pregnant with my last baby.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side, it did make my skin feel very soft the couple of times I used it; however I had to wash it off almost immediately to get rid of the stench!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not Bath and Body Works....and who cares if it really works right.</li>
      <li>I am still developing new &amp;#34;tiger stripes&amp;#34;, but they did lighten a bit with the cream use.</li>
      <li>and I have had a very sensitive nose.  </li>
      <li>I am days from my due date, now scrapping the bottom of the jar, and totally stretch mark free!  </li>
      <li>I first only purchased the oil..</li>
      <li>I was told that my order would not go through because of a discrepancy on my billing address and that the charge declined, surprised I check my bank account to verify this and find The Spoiled Mama billed me ALL 3 TIMES!</li>
      <li>Still early on at 7 months</li>
      <li>So far so well.</li>
      <li>Really helped with itchy stomach and keep my skin moisturized for long time</li>
      <li>I thought the other reviews were exaggerating, but the smell really is quite overpowering and not to my liking at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about returning it as I&#x27;m not satisfied with how much it cost compared to the returns...</li>

<li> It smells like a cross between coco butter and citrus, which doesn&#x27;t sound so bad normally.</li>
<li> My stretch marks are pretty bad and getting worse, but it does feel good to be using one of the highest recommended products out there I could find.</li>
<li> No authorization, no pending charges, these are completed transactions already deducted from my debit account and confirmed by the bank, what does their customer service say: Sorry we can&#x27;t do anything for you on this end because the charges declined.</li>
<li> Used this on my stomach my entire pregnancy and immediately afterward, and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark on my stomach!!</li>
<li> I finally broke down and bought this and am thankful I did.</li>
<li> you just spent $110 and received NOTHING...</li>
<li> and it is a little smaller than I expected because the pictures can be a little deceiving.</li>
<li> Anybody who has serious stretchmarks will have to buy at least 2 of these a month because the consistency is so thick that it runs out really fast.</li>
<li> GREAT PRODUCT BUT HORRIBLE COMPANY AND POOR SERVICE,</li>
<li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t start using this product until after I got a few stretch marks.</li>
<li> I slipped up and got this a little late in my pregnancy (6 months) and some stretch marks had begun to develop.</li>
<li> however I ended up making the VERY EXPENSIVE mistake of ordering directly from them just to save a couple $$$...</li>
<li> I forced myself to try it even though I was gagging from the smell already.</li>
<li> Only problem is, it is sooo expensive!</li>
<li> Very small jar for the price</li>
<li> Amazon is supposed to be the cheaper place, not more expensive.</li>
<li> Sorry girls.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why people think it smells weird,</li>
<li> so sorry for you</li>
<li> but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not, because the smell was so awful that neither my husband nor I could stand it.</li>
<li> Very sad about it, it did soothe the itch</li>
<li> It smells bad.</li>
<li> Does not smell as bad as the reviews say</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed to see though that Amazon is selling it for 3+dollars</li>
<li> This gave me allergies :(</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first only purchased the oil.. But they sent me a sample of this and i loved it! So i bought this to last for the rest of the pregnancy and after!</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and bought this and am thankful I did. No stretch marks on my tummy</li>
    <li> This is well worth the price if you hope to return to your pre-baby body without stretch marks.  Before purchasing this product, I did a lot of research about avoiding stretch marks.  The key factors seem to be genetics, diet, hydration, and use of a good anti-stretch mark cream.  Since there&#x27;s nothing we can do about genetics, I tried to focus first on maintaining a good veggie, fruit, and meat-based diet.  No cream can negate the effects of gaining 50 pounds during a pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read it&#x27;s important to stay hydrated from the inside out and the outside in.  I drank water regularly and avoided juices and soda.  The last piece of the plan is the actual cream.  I tried several brands, but this one was the best.  You skin will be noticeably softer with just one use.  I even used it on my dry, cracked hands during the winter months and it provided instant relief.  I maintained a strict regiment of twice a day from 3 months on, and I purchased three jars during this time.  I am set to have this baby in two weeks (So I have lots of time to write unnecessarily long reviews on Amazon :) ) and still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.  Just keep in mind that no cream can work miracles.  You have to live a healthy lifestyle too and hope your genes don&#x27;t work against you.  Aside from that, this cream is the best.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. I was excited about all the natural ingredients but&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s Over priced, I payed close to $40 for 4oz...&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells bad. I thought the other reviews were exaggerating, but the smell really is quite overpowering and not to my liking at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about returning it as I&#x27;m not satisfied with how much it cost compared to the returns...</li>
    <li> This was a gift, so I can&#x27;t really be sure.</li>
    <li> Way too over priced for such a tiny bottle. Anybody who has serious stretchmarks will have to buy at least 2 of these a month because the consistency is so thick that it runs out really fast. Not to mention it says to apply it multiple times a day for best use. If you applied it as much as recommended you would need to buy it in bulk just to keep up use.</li>
    <li> As described. Just tiny bottle</li>
    <li> So far so well. Still early on at 7 months but I have not noticed any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> My sister in law says this is her absolute favorite tummy butter of several that she has tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes a thoughtful gift for the mama&#x27;s to be in your life!  Everyone buys gifts for baby, but I like to get gifts to pamper mama.</li>
    <li> For the price I was hoping for better results. I am still developing new &amp;#34;tiger stripes&amp;#34;, but they did lighten a bit with the cream use.</li>
    <li> I love this tummy butter.  Used for my first pregnancy, not one stretch mark and I gained 60 pounds!!!  Now I&#x27;m using it again for my second pregnancy although I tried cheaper versions at local stores.  This butter is by far the best.  It does have a scent but I personally like it.  It might be pricey but will be cheaper than a mommy makeover in the end.  Give it a try...</li>
    <li> Used this on my stomach my entire pregnancy and immediately afterward, and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark on my stomach!! I was extremely happy with this product and would recommend it to all pregnant women! Start using it from day one!</li>
    <li> I bought this because Mederma wasn&#x27;t working for me. I read such great reviews so I decided to give it a shot. It does smell pretty good and I like how it feels when I put it on, almost a menthol feeling. Since I started using it I have noticed several more stretch marks on my belly and they get darker every day. The price is outrageous for the amount of cream you get. I&#x27;d say save your money and go with something else.</li>
    <li> I slipped up and got this a little late in my pregnancy (6 months) and some stretch marks had begun to develop. Since using this product I have not had any more pop up and I caught mine early enough to prevent them from becoming purple. The texture is great, the smell isn&#x27;t intolerable and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money to be able to show my tummy without embarrassment. A definite must have!</li>
    <li> Hated the smell and the texture. Switched to Mama Mio and never got a stretch mark.</li>
    <li> I used this liberally, along with the bump gloss, two times each day (morning and evening) since the moment I found out I was pregnant. At first, I thought, wow, this works great! Totally worth the $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this morning (32 weeks pregnant), I woke up to stretch marks across my lower belly. I have only gained 13 lbs. I regret paying so much for something that probably doesn&#x27;t work any better than the $5 coco butter you can buy at the drugstore. Bummer!</li>
    <li> Great product! Wish I bought the bigger bottle. Only problem is, it is sooo expensive! But it&#x27;s def the best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all I used it and on my last tri mester I got stretch marks. Very sad about it, it did soothe the itch but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. Also it ran out very quick</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product before from Amazon and LOVED it! It really works and hydrates your skin so it feels not only super stretchy and moisturized but it gives it a wonderful healthy glow and leaves it feeling super soft. BUT BEWARE! Yes the product is $5 cheaper on the spoiled mama website however I ended up making the VERY EXPENSIVE mistake of ordering directly from them just to save a couple $$$... I tried placing an order on their site, received an error message stating the order could not be processed to please try again later, tried again later same thing, tried one last time: same message. Contacted customer service for assistance to place order and had a horrible experience! I was told that my order would not go through because of a discrepancy on my billing address and that the charge declined, surprised I check my bank account to verify this and find The Spoiled Mama billed me ALL 3 TIMES! No authorization, no pending charges, these are completed transactions already deducted from my debit account and confirmed by the bank, what does their customer service say: Sorry we can&#x27;t do anything for you on this end because the charges declined. THATS IT&gt; so sorry for you you just spent $110 and received NOTHING... all for trying to save $5.... BIG REGRET I WISH I HAD ORDERED FROM AMAZON like I did the first time, great experience and the security they have your back covered if there is any problem + they handle all the billing. CONCLUSION: GREAT PRODUCT BUT HORRIBLE COMPANY AND POOR SERVICE, DEFINITELY RECOMMEND BUT ORDER ONLY FROM HERE JUST IN CASE!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Sorry girls.</li>
    <li> I bought the bigger size when my stomach started feeling itchy in the second trimester.  I am days from my due date, now scrapping the bottom of the jar, and totally stretch mark free!  It really works, but mostly importantly, it brings a lot of fantastic relief to an itchy tummy throughout pregnancy.  It feels great and soothing.  I didn&#x27;t mind the smell at all and I have had a very sensitive nose.  The best prevention to stretch marks is staying hydrated and maintaining healthy weight gain, but this has certainly helped as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not, because the smell was so awful that neither my husband nor I could stand it. I never had morning sickness or nausea, except when I used this. On the plus side, it did make my skin feel very soft the couple of times I used it; however I had to wash it off almost immediately to get rid of the stench!</li>
    <li> I liked the product texture but the smell is not my favorite, I would not be able to use it during the first trimester. As for the results, too soon to say</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> This gave me allergies :(</li>
    <li> just got my bottle and it is a little smaller than I expected because the pictures can be a little deceiving. Does not smell as bad as the reviews say but it&#x27;s definitely not Bath and Body Works....and who cares if it really works right. Will follow up at the end of</li>
    <li> Loved the product, planning to buy some more. Really helped with itchy stomach and keep my skin moisturized for long time</li>
    <li> Very small jar for the price</li>
    <li> I read online this is a good stretch mark prevention cream and it&#x27;s safe for pregnancy so I bought it even though it&#x27;s one of the more expensive creams out there. It didn&#x27;t occur to me that I might hate the smell. I forced myself to try it even though I was gagging from the smell already. It smells like a cross between coco butter and citrus, which doesn&#x27;t sound so bad normally. The texture was nice and creamy but I still think it&#x27;s too pricy for the amount. I am going to try other creams/oils that is more smell friendly to morning sickness preggers like me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 7 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any stretch marks. I&#x27;ll let you know what happens after I give birth.</li>
    <li> works just fine, but i really didnt care for the smell. i ended up just using it before bed. couldn&#x27;t bear smelling that all day at work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant, and so far so new stretch marks. I do feel that the tummy butter has helped minimize the apperance of stretch marks on my hips that I have always had. The smell is not bad, and it absorbs very quickly which is good because I usually put it on before getting into bed. I&#x27;ve heard good reviews so I&#x27;m praying it works miracles like others say it has!</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t start using this product until after I got a few stretch marks. My doctor told me that no cream or oil or skin regimen would stop the marks from coming and she was right. My stretch marks are pretty bad and getting worse, but it does feel good to be using one of the highest recommended products out there I could find. Maybe if I hadn&#x27;t been using this stuff the marks would have been even worse...who knows. I would use it again in my next pregnancy, again, just to feel like I was doing the most I could do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this belly butter since my second trimester. I already had some stretch marks from my first pregnancy, but I&#x27;m 31 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones yet! I don&#x27;t know why people think it smells weird, to me it smells like Tootsie Rolls. I like it. A bit pricey, but I wish I had used it for my 1st pregnancy. Great results so far!</li>
    <li> I used this product when I was pregnant with my last baby.  I had stretchmarks from my first kid to begin with and I fell in love with this lotion because it faded my stretchmarks and my c-section scar. I bought the 12oz jar with the bump oil.  I got it when I was 3 Mon along and used it up till about 8 months along.  It didn&#x27;t keep me from getting stretchmarks, I don&#x27;t think anything can it just has to do with your skin type.  But it did fade them significantly.  I&#x27;m disappointed to see though that Amazon is selling it for 3+dollars more then the actual spoiled mama Web site.  So don&#x27;t buy it from here.  Amazon is supposed to be the cheaper place, not more expensive.</li>
