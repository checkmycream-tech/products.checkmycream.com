<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not just for your BeautyBlender. This is the best make-up tool cleaner out there. The solid form makes it really easy to clean applicators and brushes.</li>
    <li> Works as expected! Very easy to use and cleans my sponges quite well.</li>
    <li> It does clean the beauty blunder.</li>
    <li> great for brushes and beauty blenders.</li>
    <li> This cleans my brushes super fast and keeps them looking new.</li>
    <li> I take this with me when i travel. it takes just a few minutes to get my brushes clean and it has a nice earthy/herby scent</li>
    <li> Simply put, the best way to clean your beauty blender or other similar makeup sponges. I also use for my larger foundation/powder/blush brushes and it does a wonderful job! I didn&#x27;t need another beauty blender, but if you are buying one for the first time, try to get a set with a blender and the soap. You&#x27;ll want to clean your beauty blender often!</li>
    <li> Works fine,  but I&#x27;ve found a cheaper alternative.  Google &#x27;dupes for beauty blender solid cleanser&#x27; and you can find the product for a fraction of the price. I won&#x27;t buy this again,  way over priced considering. Also the dupe is all natural.  Bonus.</li>
    <li> Came fast as promised! And this product is great!!!</li>
    <li> I got a smaller version of this at Sephora with points I had and loved it so I wanted to get a full-sized one that had the container to store it in which also makes it a much better option for travel.  I also have the Beauty Blender liquid cleanser and I find this a much better option.  With the liquid cleanser I&#x27;m sure there is more waste of the product and I like the foaming texture of the solid when it gets wet and find it easier to massage thru and out.  Very happy with this product and so glad someone at Sephora told me about it!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTE FAVORITE sponge/brush cleanser. I used to use baby soap and coconut oil on my brushes which I thought worked really well...Until I got this cleanser. It works so amazing and it takes me about 30 seconds per brush, compared to about 2 minuets. 100% recommend</li>
    <li> I used it as soon as it came in bc I had just started using a new beauty blender. It seems to clean my blender very gently, but well.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean all my brushes ..</li>
    <li> If this cleanser were a man, it&#x27;d be going down.</li>
    <li> This is such a great cleanser for sponges and for your brushes I use it for both and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far so good! Fast shipping, too!</li>
    <li> the best brush and beauty blender cleaner</li>
    <li> Great Product.... My daughter is absolutely in love with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean my beauty blender, and it is AMAZING. I use this for my brushes as well. This really gets all the product out of my brushes and the beauty blender, with only a little bit of the cleanser itself. One swipe through the cleanser, and some water and rubbing and ALL of my makeup is gone from brushes and the beauty blender! LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product but bit of slow delivery.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective brush cleaner. I&#x27;ve used those clear spray brush cleaners before but this lathers up like a bar of soap, smells really good, and cleans super quickly and thoroughly. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Kind of smells like lavender. I&#x27;m not sure if the soap is too harsh for my fancy real hair makeup brushes or if it&#x27;s supposed to be only for the blender but I like anyway. The product is pretty simple. A round disk of soap not unlike a bar of soap in texture comes in the white case. It has a little plastic grid that I believe is supposed to sit under the product so that when it gets wet it is raised from the bottom of the case so it doesn&#x27;t dry glued to the bottom. Great product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Easy to use, smells great, and gets my brushes clean!</li>
    <li> You guys could buy a bar of dove soap because it has a mosturizing chemical in it, and clean your makeup brushes the exact same way all the high end and los end products do. Plus its cheaper and i know everyone has a bar of soap in there house. I do that method on all my makeup brushes and it cleans them to a spotless finish. Hope this helps save you guys money 😊😊</li>
    <li> I used baby shampoo only on my first beauty blender, so when I bought a new one I decided to purchase the cleanser to go with it. I&#x27;m not entirely impressed with it. Yes it cleans my beauty blender great, and get&#x27;s all my makeup out from inside the beauty blender as well, but I found that I had to use a lot of it in order to clean my beauty blender properly. And since I clean my blender after every use, it&#x27;s not feasible, and I also found it to tear my blender due to massaging it into the bar while it was rubbing on the sides. I&#x27;ll be trying the liquid cleanser next, but I won&#x27;t repurchase the bar again.</li>
    <li> That product is wonderful to clean your brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of MAC brush cleaner for years but this cleaner blows that out of the water.  I initially bought it for the beauty blender but now use it for all of my brushes. This works way faster than MAC and costs less. Highly. Recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect make up brush cleaner! It works very quick to remove the make up and it&#x27;s not messy!</li>
    <li> Very good... I loved it.</li>
    <li> Smells good, little smaller than I expected but will definitely get the job done. It was kind of weird that they sent it in a big box but at least it came quickly. Looking forward to using this with my new Sigma brush cleaning glove :)</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for the beautyblender! Havent found anything (face wash, body soap, etc.) that cleans it better!</li>
    <li> Seems expensive for &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Works very well and definitely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It works like magic! Not only did I use it on my beauty blenders, I also use it on my brushes as well!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this. It does its job like its suppose to. Was a lot cheaper to buy than at my local sephora store. Only downfall was it was still a little pricey for this product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The first time I ever used the Beauty Blender Cleanser, I thought it was an amazing product. It cleans all my brushes and sponges thoroughly. However, once I smelled the product I immediately knew it was basically Ivory Original white soap. So, I ran to the dollar store and picked up a 3 pack of Ivory for $1.50 to test my theory. Hot Damn! Smells the same, cleans the same. Wow, It&#x27;s the same! What a disappointment. Here I am - a working, struggling makeup artist - and was scammed by a company selling Ivory soap for $14+. It&#x27;s $20 at Sephora Sad.</li>
    <li> I received this cleaner free with my purchase of a Beauty Blender. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong - I love my Beauty Blender. It&#x27;s the best makeup sponge I&#x27;ve ever used. But the cleaner is pretty expensive for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some grumbling around the beauty community that this cleanser is basically the same as a bar of Ivory soap. I looked into it, and well, they sure have the same ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the ingredients in the Blendercleanser: Palmate Sodium, Palm Kernelate, Water, Glycerin, Coconut Acid, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Palmitic Acid, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here are the ingredients in a bar of Ivory soap (this is the plain white soap without any frills): sodium tallowate and/or sodium palmate, water, sodium cocoate or sodium palm kernelate, glycerin, sodium chloride, fragrance, one or more of the following: coconut acid, palm kernel acid, tallow acid or palmitic acid, and tetrasodium EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that ingredients are listed from the largest amount to the smallest. Compare them, and then make up your own mind. If you need more help, compare the price: $13.59 as of this writing for an ounce of Blendercleanser, or $3.99 for TEN four-ounce bars of Ivory soap. That&#x27;s the Amazon price; I guarantee you could buy one bar of Ivory soap at your supermarket for less than a dollar that would last you the next five years!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great smell, cleanses my blender fabulously!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice .. Smells good ,, but honestly I&#x27;m not thinking of buying it again ,, i prefer a foamy cleaner ,, or i can use any good facial soap bar with less price and good quality</li>
    <li> I like this so much better than my liquid beautyblender cleanser. Shipping was real fast too! Its a Definitely must try out.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser and the beauty blender at the same time, and before i used my BB I wanted to clean it. I used this and it seemed to have done the job with no product on the sponge. I&#x27;ve used it to clean my BB after using it with a full coverage foundation and I&#x27;m not sure if it gets the sponge completely clean. I may just need to work this product more into the BB. It does have a nice fresh lavender scent though.</li>
    <li> This is awesome cleaner! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money! And I use this for ALL my brushes! It makes washing my brushes fun and it works like a charm. And of course, works perfectly for the BeautyBlender and leaves no leftover makeup.</li>
    <li> Not only does it keep my BB clean, but my brushes are immaculate.</li>
    <li> It even cleans my Kabuki brushes well. And it&#x27;s easy to carry around. It&#x27;s the best cleaner!</li>
    <li> Product does a good job of cleaning. Good price.</li>
    <li> this product is great, it really cleaned my beauty blender! and you dont waste that much product, I completely recommend!</li>
    <li> If you have a beauty blender, you NEED this. You can also use it to wash your brushes but it runs out quickly that way. I use it strictly for my beauty blender because there is nothing else I&#x27;ve tried that cleans it like this does.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that can really clean my foundation brush!  Have tried other cleaners, but this is it!</li>
    <li> love it!! can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything else to clean my blender or brushes. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This works great--especially with the Beauty Bleder mitt.  I really get my brushes much cleaner with this cleaner than with other liquid brands.</li>
    <li> This makes my Beautyblender sponges and my IT brushes look brand new!  I&#x27;ve never seen anything clean this well.  It takes waterproof makeup out of my sponges!  Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> Great for the price!!!</li>
    <li> A must have for your beauty blender, I have tried the liquid and this solid, I prefer this one seems to work better and nice for vacations since vompact</li>
    <li> Absolutely a most have, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> Great product. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used all types of different cleansers, high end to low end. Ive used MAC, Japonesque, baby shampoo, brush wipes, just to name a few. This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used to clean my brushes. I own about 30+ brushes and to sit down and clean them next to the sink can be a long process. This literally took me about 8 minutes. I wet the brushes some one by one some 3 at a time then I rubbed them on the solid bar, I gently rubbed the brushes with my fingers ran them under lukewarm water and within seconds the water was clear and I laid my brushes to dry. I have never seen my white brushes so white since I bought them,  the water was super clear for all my brushes including my beige and black ones. Can&#x27;t say enough good things!</li>
    <li> I like this better to clean my brushes, not so much for my beauty blender. It kinda ruined my beauty blender. Other than that it works amazing to keep my brushes nice and clean, not to mention the soap is does a really good job at cleaning the brush AND dry faster. The soap is not like any other soap which I think why this soap is way better to use compared to regular bar soap. A+</li>
    <li> This cleans my blender and my brushes.  It gets the long wearing foundation that I use out right away.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my bristles dry.  I will continue to purchase.  The price is great as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Beautyblender liquid cleaner for over two years and decided that I would try the solid cleaner. I&#x27;m glad I did! The solid cleans my Beautyblender sponge just as quickly and easily as the liquid. I&#x27;ve stopped using the liquid cleaner and am only using the solid now.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a second and third Solid cleaner. This works amazingly! I clean my clarisonic brush, makeup brushes, and beauty blender with it. It smells so good and is so easy to use and travel with. Simply wet your brushes, swirl them around on the soap, then rinse! I watch all the makeup come right off and nothing has ever cleaned my brushes as well as this product. Amazing! You will not be unsatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This cleanser REALLY works! It smells decent and really gets all the makeup out of my beauty blender, it still looks brand new! Best of all, this cleanser is travel size friendly!</li>
    <li> really work and clean great</li>
    <li> Love this product. My brushes feel better than new when dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the big makeup brands and DIY and nothing gets my brushes as clean as this soap does. Works wonders on the beauty blender sponge and my brushes. It&#x27;s a little pricy for the amount you get and I wish it came in a larger size but it gets the job done. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite cleaner for beauty blenders, but I LOVE it for brush cleaning. It makes cleaning my brushes super easy.</li>
    <li> so I just bought this. I wish I read more of the reviews before I ordered this. This is way over priced for what it is. I tried to cancel but it was too late. Guess I&#x27;m stuck with it (returning stuff is a pain) but yeah, better off buying soap.</li>
    <li> I have heard others say not to &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; money on the Beauty Blender cleansers.  I have tried so many other soaps, but always come back to the beauty blender soaps.  They clean the foundation out of the sponge way better than anything else I have tried.  I especially like the solid.  It is compact, travels well, lasts a long time, and gets the foundation out with minimal suds and effort.  Great product, and I will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> The cheap and easy way to clean your brushes. You know you&#x27;re supposed to clean them more often than you are, right? Liquid brush cleaner is made for professionals who need to constantly sanitize and aren&#x27;t necessarily near a sink - it works but it&#x27;s expensive and rough on your brushes. I used good quality people shampoo to keep my personal brushes supple and clean. This is a great alternative. Works better than shampoo but is still gentle, and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. It cleans well, lasts and lasts, and is very compact. It also works well on makeup brushes. I find the soild lasts longer than the liquid probably because, at least for me, it is too easy to pour too much of the liquid out at one time.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my make up brushes as well as clean the sponge. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a amazing brush cleaner!  I thought  I was gett my beauty blender and brushes clean before I got this cleanser.  It&#x27;s amazing! Gets rid of all makeup on brushes and beauty blender. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great! I didn&#x27;t want to get the liquid one because I thought this would last longer and was perfect for travel on planes. My beautyblender (and even brushes) get so clean with this and I love it! The only thing is that my beautyblender bleeds the pink dye when I use this but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal with any cleanser I might use on it. But overall, it gets my stuff clean and its great!</li>
    <li> When I purchased my beauty blender I honestly thought I could clean it with just a regular washing liquid and be on my way. WRONG! I purchased this a few months ago and I should have purchased this sooner. It&#x27;s so easy to use and is perfect for the beauty blender...obviously! I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for a cleaning agent but I caved since it could never full get my beauty blender clean with the normal cleaner I used for my brushes. It really cleans everything out of your beauty blender and makes it last longer!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It cleaned my brushes so well and even worked on my beauty blenders. Would totally recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I bought the Beauty blender and wanted to maintain it&#x27;s quality. This cleanser was a pain in the neck. It took too long to actually clean the beauty blender every morning. I&#x27;ve found another alternative that works much better.</li>
    <li> Love this cleaner, it does exactly what it needs to do without leaving residue in the sponge like other cleaners.  It also work son brushes...the only con is that I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> This item was not as shown it was way smaller. It is about the size of a silver dollar. Not the original size of a beauty blender solid which I have been using for quite some time so I know what they look like and their size. It doesn&#x27;t come close to filing the tin. I didn&#x27;t get mine with a tin but they kindly sent me a free small beauty blender which was super nice of them. So customer service is excellent. But was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> works but can get the exact same experience from bar soap</li>
    <li> I think I remember someone posting that the smell of this smelled like an old lady. When this came in the mail I was scared to wash my brushes and beauty blender with it because of that review. Well let me tell you that it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like an old person. I personally think it smells fresh and clean, kinda like dove soap. The smell isn&#x27;t strong once you clean the brushes and they dry. This cleans my brushes better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I used to clean them with olive oil and dish soap and would have to sit there and clean them forever. This stuff cleans my brushes in less than 10 minutes (for about 12 brushes or so) and leaves them squeaky clean. Once I&#x27;m done cleaning my brushes I run the bar under water and leave the lid off overnight to dry.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this product does not work as advertised.  I purchased the BeautyBlender sponge and the solid cleanser at the same time.  Used both yesterday for the first time.  The cleanser absolutely did not remove makeup from the sponge, and I hadn&#x27;t even dipped the sponge directly into the liquid foundation as the instructions say to do.  I had applied the foundation with a foundation brush, then used the sponge to blend and smooth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Blendercleaner.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best brush cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used. I will always use this brand</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not much better than less expensive bar soaps I have used. This cleans BB creams off my beauty blender, but it struggles with long wear foundation. I end up soaking my sponge to get those products off. Works well on brushes, gets them white again. But if you wash a lot of brushes/sponges, or wash them frequently, you are gonna use this up so fast. Not economical. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> The best cleanser EVER for my brushes and sponges also takes out any type of odor that brushes can sometimes carry love it !!!! Not the price though it&#x27;s expensive ....which is why I only gave it 4 stars ....</li>
    <li> This solid cleanser is SO easy to use and it gets my beauty blender and make up brushes SO SO SO clean! I have used other cleansers for my beauty blender and make up brushes and they don&#x27;t even compare. I can see a major difference and I have only used this cleanser TWICE. My brushes look brand new again! So clean. I&#x27;m in love. If you hate cleaning your brushes, but want to get the job done properly (like myself) then this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this, because I couldn&#x27;t understand how it could be so much better than any of my other cleansers.  Well, I LOVE this.  Super easy to use and effective.  This is an absolute must!  I use it with my beauty blender and all my brushes.</li>
    <li> Cleans the black blenders better than the pink ones. I like that it&#x27;s small to. Thay should make a liquid form as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best sponge and brush cleaner.....</li>
    <li> Cleaned my brushes with this for the first time and got all the gunk off my brushes which usually takes me forever to take off with spray. I&#x27;ll be buying this again</li>
    <li> Works perfect!!!! I wish it came in liquid form!!!</li>
    <li> This is just a solid soap.  I think if you looked around you could use a less expensive bar soap to clean the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BB solid cleanser on my brushes and it does the trick. I was using the Bare Minerals Well cared for brush shampoo and it was drying out my brushes. The BB solid returned its softness. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail quickly..it was exactly what I wanted. I think it&#x27;s the best product for cleaning your make-up sponges and brushes. A little goes a long way. The price is well worth it!</li>
    <li> The best cleanser out there for your beauty blender sponges!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else and I love the solid over the liquid.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best brush cleaner I&#x27;ve come across. It used to take me like 25 minutes to clean my brushes, and this gets it done in half the time. The only qualms I have about it are the size and it&#x27;s kind of drying. I wish it came in a bigger size, because you go through this so quickly. Also, when you are doing all of your brushes (if you have a decent sized collection like I do), it makes your hands feel really dry. I can only imagine it&#x27;s drying out the bristles of your brushes as well. But you can recondition your bristles, and nothing else will get your brushes as clean as quickly!</li>
    <li> Easy and works great for brushes. Love it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Dawn and olive oil to clean my brushes. I picked up the Beauty Blender Solid with my Beauty Blender. Now, I use it to clean all of my makeup applicators and brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so awesome???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s travel-friendly&lt;br /&gt;- It comes in an awesome container that drains any excess water&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- Formulated without parabens, sulfates, phthalates&lt;br /&gt;- Nice, light scent&lt;br /&gt;- REALLY cleans and gets the makeup off of my brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be a little pricier compared to my Dawn and olive oil method but it&#x27;s worth it! It cleans brushes better and faster!</li>
    <li> I bought this previously, but I lost it (or someone stole it lol). This product is essentially a hypo-allergenic soap that is mild enough to clean all brushes. I have very sensitive skin; I was able to use my brushes right after I bought this. The bar is small but it lasts a LONG time! It is very concentrated, just be sure to use hot water with this product, so it develops a good foam.</li>
    <li> Awesome product :)&lt;br /&gt;I choose this cleanser over the bottled on because I feel that the solid actually does it&#x27;s job with out wasting so much of it on the liquid one, it practically cleans it by it&#x27;s self!</li>
    <li> I love this it seriously cleans my beauty blender spotless I dont habe anythimg negative tonsay and its small enough for traveling</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It gets those magical beauty blenders clean so quickly. Perfect for that early morning cleaning when you get the blender wet and ready for your daily use. I leave my blender cleaner open to air dry after use. It is small enough to travel well. You won&#x27;t have to worry during air travel, it isn&#x27;t a liquid. It is more like a highly effective bar cleanser. I will buy again, but not for a while they seem to last a while. :)</li>
    <li> Best cleaner. Not only for your beauty sponge, but for brushes as well! Easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This cleaner is amazing. It&#x27;s the best and easiest thing I have used to clean brushes and my beauty blender sponges, It really cuts down on time and mess.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. A little on the pricey side. But I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone who need to clean their makeup brushes and beauty sponges</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using soap to glean my brushes and beauty blender.... This is a game changer. It makes it so easy to clean your brushes and beauty blender.  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning all my brushes. Just wish you cojld buy a bigger size!</li>
    <li> Wow! Just wow, buy it!</li>
    <li> This really works! It cleaned all my beauty blenders AND brushes I like that it was easy to use and didn&#x27;t leave a lot of build up or mess very convent and easy clean up good product&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great product for cleaning the sponge applicator.</li>
    <li> I like the convenience of the way the product works, but it doesn&#x27;t clean very thoroughly.  I find I have to wash, rinse, wash, rinse several times.  I used to use shampoo which probably isn&#x27;t the best choice, but it sure worked quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this to take on a cruise with me.  Most amazing brush soap to date.  I ended up using this more than the liquid cleaner by beauty blender when I got back from my cruise.  Cleans the blender and make-up brushes really well!</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my beauty blender only.. I use other soap products to clean my brushes.. This is expensive so again only use it for BB and It works very nicely and really cleans the BB.. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without my beauty blender cleanser .. it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This solid soap cleans my makeup sponge (like Beautyblender) wonderfully.  I tried using a good olive oil or goats milk solid soap for this.  Yes, those do clean, but I think this is way better suited, and the sponge (and brushes) feel different when I use this cleanser.  I DO start with one of those other soaps I mentioned, to get the worst of the makeup out of the sponge, but I follow with this, because it just seems to make the tool I am cleaning feel.....nicer, I guess.</li>
    <li> If you have makeup sponges of brushes this is a great cleaner. Make sure you get the solid, because the liquid does not work as well.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush cleaner EVER! I absolutely LOVE THIS! I will be repurchasing again and again! So much easier! Just wish it was a little larger! Oh well I still love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!. I&#x27;m amazed on how well this cleans my brushes and it was fast and easy ! I will buy this again</li>
    <li> After struggling to clean the beautyblender with soap, face cleanser, and even eye makeup remover to no avail I thought I would try this out. So glad I did! It really is the best way to clean it. Works quickly, no residue, and removes makeup well.</li>
    <li> First, let&#x27;s start with the bad thing:&lt;br /&gt;This smells like my grandmother did. It might bring up some fond memories or something, but I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely tolerable, especially considering how well this cleans my makeup brushes and the BeautyBlender sponge, and how fast.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;They should have this come with the kit, not the liquid one. It&#x27;s much better. You just roll it around in it, wash it, squeeze — clean.&lt;br /&gt;Completely clean. Like magic! Stinky, grandmother-smelling magic!</li>
    <li> Works well, but doen&#x27;t last long...I now use Dr Bronner&#x27;s bar soap (comes in several fragrances) and lasts longer.  It seems to work about as well</li>
    <li> works as described and cleans my brushes with ease.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I prefer this over the liquid one</li>
    <li> I tried the liquid cleanser first but the solid form is so much better. I used it to clean my make up brushes also and it leaves them clean and conditioned. Great purchase</li>
    <li> My daughter in California turned me onto this...I love it!</li>
    <li> I think the Beauty Blender Cleanser does a great job cleaning my sponges and brushes, but yet I find it so expensive for such tiny product that doesn&#x27;t last alot. I had read a review that Ivory soap does the same job and I decided to give a try, I had nothing to loose by trying. Ivory Soap cost me $1.89, and it was a 3 pk of soap. I inmediately got home to try it. As soon as I opened it almost smelled exactly the same. I decided to compare both soaps ingredients and to my surprise the ingredients were the same. The Ivory soap left my brushes and sponges sooo clean and the cleaning process was so quick. Definitely do not spend so much money on such tiny soap. IVORY SOAP IS THE BEST! Cheaper, better, and much more product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I love it. It cleans my beauty blender to like new state. I can already tell it is going to last way longer than the liquid.</li>
    <li> tried this on my brushes and they look BRAND NEW. the only thing i&#x27;ve ever used to totally clean my brushes, keep its original soft texture and they smell great. obsessed. will never use another cleaner, will try it on my beauty blender next.</li>
    <li> Cleans all my brushes!</li>
    <li> This works well, but I think I would prefer the liquid cleanser instead. It seems like the liquid would be easier to use.</li>
    <li> but, having tried various other shampoos and cleaners, this is the easiest and best.  I almost didn&#x27;t buy it but read a review that said it was so great and gave it a chance.  If you have a beauty blender this is a no brainer.  I clean mine each morning before I use it again (having let it dry out first) and it works amazing.</li>
    <li> i like this cleanser. It works very well with the original beauty blender. It cleans better that a regular soap.</li>
    <li> This lathers so nicely I use it to clean everything, my brushes and the Blender.  Very easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> quickest and easiest way to clean brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and haven&#x27;t found anything else that cleans as well (including the goat&#x27;s milk products); however, the case is a poor design.  First, it&#x27;s hard to know whether to take the soap out to clean your sponge or leave it in the case.  If you take it out, it will eventually get deformed and won&#x27;t fit into the case anymore.  It also eventually breaks in half.  The &amp;#34;draining tray&amp;#34; that comes with it is so flat, it&#x27;s pretty much useless.  I struggle along with this design, but I&#x27;ve purchased this 4 or 5 times now and will do so again until someone comes out with something better.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! In the past, I&#x27;ve always used extremely gentle shampoo to wash my expensive makeup brushes. That didn&#x27;t work for the Beauty Blender, so I figured I&#x27;d try this. It works so well in my Beauty Blender and I use it on all my brushes as well. I&#x27;ll never go back to shampoo!</li>
    <li> Love it, so easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for both the Beauty Blender sponges&amp; your makeup brushes. I have the liquid cleanser also, and I tend to grab this 1st. I do use something else (usually my face wash that&#x27;s also conditioning) when I want to &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; my brushes, BUT if you choose this, you can get them really clean too, it&#x27;s a preference thing. I like the BB solid for when I&#x27;m wanting to quickly clean my brushes. Typically, I find myself using this for my eye/smaller brushes. All I do is wet my brush bristles, swirl it around on the solid, then i use my hand to clean the brush (I was shocked at the amount of lather this gets), rinse brush&amp; set to dry. Just make sure you dump out any water that collects in the soap container. I think my only complaint is that this, and the liquid cleanser has an &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; scent, but I don&#x27;t sit around smelling my brushes, and it&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s THAT noticeable. Overall, does the job!</li>
    <li> I am sure this item works fine, I wanted to buy this item, but I am making a conscious consumer decision to buy another product that does not include Pail Oil.  there are alternative vegetable oils that will work just as well. The environment means more to me than clean make-up tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palm oil touches our lives every time we take a trip to the supermarket. Palm oil and its derivatives are used in a ubiquitous array of packaged foods, including ice cream, cookies, crackers, chocolate products, cereals, breakfast bars, cake mixes, doughnuts, potato chips, instant noodles, frozen sweets and meals, baby formula, margarine, and dry and canned soups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destruction inside palm oil plantation leases is driving the end of this great lowland forest, despite years of efforts by local communities to defend their forests and livelihood. Indonesia is pushing this forest’s unique population of Sumatran orangutans to the brink of extinction</li>
    <li> This solid is just ok.  Would never buy again.  Much prefer the liquid beauty blender cleanser.  Go for a travel size of the liquid instead.</li>
    <li> Works great but that price.. Ouch! I went through it in a month.. :l</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews. I don&#x27;t thing it is as great as everyone makes it out to be. I used it for my beauty blender and it did not remove all of the foundation. I wash my blender after every single use! I used for  a few bushes too and it dried them out. Aslo it strips the dye off the blender. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, removes make with little effort.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to clean the beauty blender sponge.  I&#x27;ve tried soap but found it very hard to get the residual suds out.  The beauty blender cleanser does give me this problem.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel. Works very well. I would definately recommend this.</li>
    <li> The only thing that REALLY cleans my beauty blenders</li>
    <li> This works so much better than the liquid and it lasts a long time too! I am ordering two more soon and I honestly use it all the time. I started out using baby shampoo, moved to the BB liquid and now I have been using this solid for almost 6 months. It works so fast and it doesnt smell weird like the BB liquid does. My brushes are cleaner more often thanks to this easy to use product...that actually works!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush cleaner for ALL brushes, not just the beauty blender! I love using it. It suds up so well and leaves all of my makeup brushes perfectly clean with minimal effort. A++++++</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully to clean your beauty blender.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to buy it.  I&#x27;d been using baby soap, but it never fully got back to the original blender color.  It looks (and feels) brand new every time.  Will buy again !</li>
    <li> Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;No residue to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Beauty blender nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Some color does come out of the blender when washing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. After nearly ruining my BB with my old washing routine, I knew I had to suck it up and buy the cleanser meant just for it. It is super easy to use, cleans my BB beautifully and it lasts forever. I have used mine quite a few times so far and you can&#x27;t even tell any has been used. I haven&#x27;t tried it on any of my other brushes yet because I am hooked on my Cinema Secrets for brushes but for the BB, this is hands down the easiest, most effective way to get the job done. The only real complaints I have about this are the price and the smell. If it wasn&#x27;t quite so pricey and didn&#x27;t have such a strong smell, this would easily be 5 stars, but considering how great this works, those are not deal breakers for me.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Love that when you clean your brushes an beauty blender, it&#x27;s not messy an doesn&#x27;t take to used! Perfect</li>
    <li> This solid cleanser cleans my brushes and beauty blender sponge so effectively and quickly I will never buy another cleanser. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s travel friendly. To use as little as possible, I use baby shampoo (or extra virgin olive oil + antibacterial dish soap) to wash my brushes first and finish off with this solid cleanser to remove any excess makeup that remains. I have already repurchased this and will continue to repurchase!</li>
    <li> There is no better product out there to clean your Beauty Blender. I like this much better than the liquid. It&#x27;s also easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser for bb and for any brushes.  I&#x27;ve just recently starting using a bb and cleaning it is quick and easy with this.</li>
    <li> I am not one to automatically purchase the special cleansers or accoutrements that come with a product.  But nothing was cleaning my beloved Beauty Blender and so I purchased the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; cleaning product.  Definitely worth it.  I have no idea why, but it&#x27;s the only thing that cleans my blender.</li>
    <li> I love this item! Cleaning my makeup brushes is a breeze with this item. Just swish your brush in the wax then rub the brush on the palm of your hand under running water and watch the makeup rinse away. It takes me less than 5 mins to do all 15 of my brushes. I recommend this item for any makeup lover.</li>
    <li> This solid cleanser is great not only for the beauty blender but also makeup brushes! Works far better than the liquid cleanser.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser ever.  I use this for all my makeup brushes.  Incredible.</li>
    <li> The solid cleanser is so much better than the liquid cleanser. It isn&#x27;t messy, it&#x27;s good for travel, and works great. I use it daily. Super recommend to anyone who has a blender/sponge.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It cleans not only my beauty blender but my other brushes also. It makes them look like new!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy it!</li>
    <li> Works so good on getting the make up out of my beauty blender and my make up brushes!</li>
    <li> Love using this for cleaning brushes, I find it&#x27;s a little expensive for the amount you get---but I do like the results. I use it for my beauty blender and brushes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about the performance of this brush/blender cleaner. It has made cleaning my brushes ridiculously easy. However, it runs out rather quickly. When I looked at the soap&#x27;s ingredients I realized that it contains the same stuff as regular bar soap. So I tried using a bar of Dove on my brushes. I was delighted to see that it worked just as well! So I will use it instead.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as advertised. A bar soap that cleanses the sponge without drying or removing the sponge properties. The container has  a slotted bottom for that even if a little water is in there it doesnt dissolve the soap. It leaves the sponge with a nice fresh scent but doesnt interfere with the sponge application.</li>
    <li> Best brush cleaner ever... Takes off all residue make up and shadows leave behind... I bought 5 more to keep in stock... Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Cleans my brushes well and is not a time consuming, messy affair.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner for the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> The rave reviews are true! I&#x27;ve been over wetting and scrubbing my brushes for ages trying to get them clean. I&#x27;ve dreaded trying to clean them as it was so much work before! Not any more! It is like a magic wand for your brushes. Seriously, a couple gos and your brushes are brand new! Shampoo never worked that well for me. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this on most of my cosmetic devices that require continuous care.  Love it!  I just wish it was available in a larger container!</li>
    <li> This gets most (thats why its 4stars) of the foundation off</li>
    <li> not what i thought it would be, but good deal</li>
    <li> I ordered it from BePretty and was really impressed by the fast shipping!  I really enjoyed this product as it gave my brushes a great deep cleaning. I live in a rural area of Canada and the closest place to buy this would be 2 hours away. The price including shipping was only a few dollars more expensive than the closest Sephora (a two hour drive). That being said I wish the product last longer for the price I paid, but it&#x27;s just a good makeup brush cleaner I immediately ordered two more!</li>
    <li> I used to wash my brushes with antibacterial soap and/or baby shampoo.  Although these cleaned them well, some of my brushes became brittle and dry.  I have noticed that my brushes get cleaner faster without drying them out when using this blendercleanser.  I feel my brushes should last longer by using this product.  Very easy to use.  Remember to drain out any water left in the container and allow the blendercleanser to dry before closing it.  This will help the blendercleanser last longer &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it with both my powder and liquid foundation. Easy to use, I just followed the instructions! I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> Gets off all color from my brushes with ease! Definitely going to repurchase. Saw this advertised on YouTube from some makeup gurus</li>
    <li> Love it! Deff worth the price!</li>
    <li> Best makeup Brush  cleaner ever! I&#x27;ll never use anything else</li>
    <li> It works really well. It cleans my beauty blenders and brushed great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  It gets the foundation right out of the beauty blender.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, and I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a strong smell.  I even use it on my makeup brushes and it cleans them wonderfully.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it if you want a really clean BB.</li>
    <li> Makes my brushes SOOO clean, its such a simple and easy/non messy way to clean brushes. Swirl around under warm water and VOILAAAA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bad thing is I did my entire brush collection in one sitting and it has left a big dint in the solid, so it may not last as long as I&#x27;d hoped but thats ok!</li>
    <li> I always buy this from sephara， but I found it is cheaper than sephora ...... this product is really useful for cleaning the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I had to run a single brush multiple times to get it cleaned. Small eye brushes were easy but as the brush size increased and it&#x27;s thickness,  the harder it was to clean. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my beauty blender yet. I tried it on my flat top kabuki from sigma and it did nothing for it. I had to wash the old fashion way with antibacterial soap and e.v.o.o.</li>
    <li> As a freelance makeup artist, I can tell you that this product is the best on the market! I have tried so many different brush cleaning products over the years and nothing beats this. Do not be disappointed when you see the size of the bar of cleanser - a little goes a longgggg way!</li>
    <li> works wonders to clean my makeup sponges, (namely the beauty blender) and even works great on brushes of all sizes and kinds.  A little goes a LOOOOOOOONG way.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my brushes, which was a problem with my old brush cleanser.  [[ASIN:B000EN9R4S Bare Escentuals Well-Cared For Brush Conditioning Shampoo]] was my old brush cleanser, and it dried out my brushes badly.  I had to use regular \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; shampoo to help them hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a much better deal to buy the dry then the wet.  Even when I think about how much soap I used with liquids it&#x27;s insane.  I&#x27;ve washed dozens of brushes on this, and my makeup sponge every day, it looks barely used.  just make sure to pour out the extra water so it doesn&#x27;t get icky.</li>
    <li> Have had trouble cleaning my beautyblender using traditional methods.  I have a rubber mitt for my brushes that works very well,  But, you can&#x27;t use the mitt on the beautybleander because you will tear the rubber.  Have used baby shampoo, Dawn dish soap, makeup remover facial cleanser;  none has worked to clean the  beautyblender.  I like this much more than the liquids out there to clean the beautyblender.  Seems as if it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> really good for trips but i prefer to use the liquid cleanser</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t leave a review because it already had so many positive ones but it&#x27;s too good not to.  I usually use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap which works like a charm.  I didn&#x27;t imagine anything would work as well but this actually works better.  The make up washes out of my brushes so quickly and the soap rinses out of the hair easily.  It has a very light, fresh, lavender scent.  I&#x27;ll never use another cleanser.</li>
    <li> i would highly recommend this! I had a foundation brush that I absolutely couldn&#x27;t clean for the life of me. I now have it spotless with this product.</li>
    <li> This was a GREAT way to clean not only by Beauty Blender, but also my other brushes.  It was great having a solid soap to clean the brushes thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to used alternatives to this solid beautyblender cleanser, but I still always come back to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the cheaper lavender soap bars and making my own cleanser. Honestly, though, this is probably the easiest way for lazy brush cleaners like myself. The convenience in being able to just open it and scrub the brush around and its portability are both major pluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only qualm I have about this is the size; they definitely need to make a larger one. With regular brush cleaning, I probably have to get a new one every month. My review is strictly for the solid beautyblender cleanser though; I do not like the liquid one at all!</li>
    <li> Great beauty blender cleanser! It&#x27;s amazing how clean it makes my beauty blenders. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my brushes yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will work wonders, too!</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best makeup brush cleaner I&#x27;ve every tried.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This solid soap works great on the beautyblender sponge. Get the sponge wet and rub the soap on it. Squeeze it a few times and rinse. It&#x27;s that easy. No smell and cleans the sponges beautifully.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying this product. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and I love it. I&#x27;ll be honest, I hadn&#x27;t washed one of my foundation brushes in almost a year. It just never occured to me. I would use them for about a year and just buy new ones. I used this product on one of the old foundation brushes that was caked with foundation and it took it all off. I then proceeded to clean the rest of my brushes and they seem as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easly to clean them. I ran the brush under water and then swished it around the top of the soap bar. Underneat the soap bar, you&#x27;ll find a little plastic item with holes between it. I took it out and rubbed the brush across this (with soap on the brush) and the makeup started coming right off and going down the drain. I repeated this process several times until it washed clean. Then, I patted the excess water off the brushes and laid my brushes flat to dry. (I read it you leave them standing up to dry the water will make the glue adhesive eventually come off the brushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting the plastic grate on top of the soap bar as I saw someone else recommended, but this leaves lines in the soap and I found I was using more soap when I didn&#x27;t need to. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; barely even made a dent in the soap bar and I washed 6 brushes that hadn&#x27;t been cleaned in ages, so I imagine this will last a long time. It was so easily to use, I&#x27;ll be sure to wash them regularly now. I also bought a product to spritze them into between uses, since I can&#x27;t wash them everyday. However, I like this better as the spritz spray does not seem to take much off.</li>
    <li> I will never use another product to clean my makeup brushes for the rest of my life. This bar lasts a while. You only need so little of it to clean even the dirtiest of brushes. My foundation brushes are PACKED with product after even three days (I use an antibacterial spray each day, but it doesn&#x27;t clean the brushes of product), but I just use a silicone pot holder glove (cheaper than special make up cleaning gloves and just as effective), and rub my brush on the bar (sometimes I&#x27;ll rub the brush dry onto the bar to avoid transferring makeup onto the bar; most times I wet the brush a little and then rub it against the bar), rub the brush against the glove and that&#x27;s it! It takes less than 2 minutes to completely clean a brush and they look brand new. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> Amazing, but goes fast.</li>
    <li> Cleans your beauty blender and brushes like a dream! So convenient too. Love!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous....better than any brush cleaner and THE ONLY cleanser for the Beauty Blenders.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Overpriced but does work well.</li>
    <li> works amazing on beauty blender and brushes. it is the perfect gift for anyone who loves makeup. woo woo woo</li>
    <li> I read that you can clean just as well with mild soap and warm water, but this cleanser to clean faster/easier. I don&#x27;t know why it is so, but I think it is worth it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not only works on the beauty blender but on my other brushes too. It leaves them really clea. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best invention since the wheel! I used to dread washing my brushes, I tried baby shampoo, sensitive shampoo, dish soap, you name it, I tried it. My brushes used to stay \\&quot;tattered\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;battered\\&quot; plus not to mention how long &amp; messy the old process took.  This was a recommendation from Amazon (thank you Amazon), now I wash my brushes every other day &amp; it&#x27;s such a breeze, my brushes have never been so clean, easy &amp; best part is they still look brand new even after many washes. I highly recommended everyone try it, you will not be disappointed! You will be happy you did &amp; this will be the only cleanser you buy &amp; trust for your brushes. I Love mine!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing for cleaning not only my beauty blender but also my makeup brushes. I always get so tired of cleaning my brushes but with this product its super easy and saves so much time.</li>
    <li> By far, the best brush cleaner EVER!!!</li>
    <li> worth buying, I have the liquid too and this works just as great.</li>
    <li> Love this its so easy to use and cleans the brushes well</li>
    <li> Works amazing, just a little will do all the dirty works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot tinier than I thought it would be, but it does the job well! After using it to wash my bb cushion sponge, it left my sponge with a nice clean scent. I&#x27;m waiting to see how long it will take to run out. A bit expensive for such a tiny thing but it seems to be good for washing sensitive things like cushion sponges.</li>
    <li> Does the job! Cleans my beauty blenders fast and have plenty left over for multiple washes.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Gets my sponges really clean.  They feel send look brand new after I use this product</li>
    <li> Cleans like nothing else. Totally impressed me! Good for sponges and brushes. Love the solid form the best just like others recommended.</li>
    <li> Use to clean all of my make up brushes, works perfectly</li>
    <li> I use this to clean all my beauty blenders and all my brushes. My blenders come out looking brand new once cleaned. Almost no makeup gets left behind. Highly recomend. Works like a charm</li>
    <li> Great brushes cleaning soap...but its smaller than it appears...little smaller than a woman&#x27;s palm...but a little goes a long way and cleans brushes thoroughly and leaves them soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I use this for all my makeup brushes it works like a charm they all look band new right after. The only reason I rate this 4 out of 5 stars is because I hate the smell of it. It doesn&#x27;t linger on your brushes though which is good!</li>
    <li> I actually use this to clean my beauty blender rather than the liquid.-This works far better for me, and it is a better value. Cleans the BB wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Just used this on my beauty blender for the first time and it works amazingly! Everything came right off! Don&#x27;t know if I would buy it from amazon though, I got mine from sephora.</li>
    <li> Best way to clean your makeup brushes for sure!!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Cleans my beauty blender like new.</li>
    <li> Great product to clean any beauty sponge. Leaves sponge like new again. Love this.</li>
    <li> best sponge and makeup brush cleaner out there</li>
    <li> Excellent cleanser!  Works on my make up  brushes exceptionally well! Gets all my foundation and concealer out of the beauty blender. Just wet  your beauty blender well,  soap it up then squeeze it out. The make up and soap come right out- rinse well and you&#x27;re done! Very happy with it!!</li>
    <li> Way better than the liquid cleanser. My beauty blender looks brand new. Also works great on my other makeup brushes</li>
    <li> Works quickly - both makeup brushes and sponges. Just a couple of quick swipe across the disc and warm water and your done. Wish I had found this years ago. It would have probably increased the life span of my brushes. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This cleanser works well but the markup is RIDICULOUS considering the ingredients are nearly identical to Ivory soap (more specifically Ivory Aloe soap). Works just as well, costs a ridiculous amount less.</li>
    <li> Works so well! And works quickly.</li>
