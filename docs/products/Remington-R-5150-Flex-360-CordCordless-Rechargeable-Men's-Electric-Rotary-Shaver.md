      <li>/&gt;All-in-all, I suggest that you buy a better shaver.  </li>

      <li>, to top it off, I unlatched the hinged top to shake out the shavings from the unit.</li>
      <li>This shaves better than sme others.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with them.</li>
      <li>VERY CLEAN SHAVE.  </li>
      <li>It seems that manufacturers are building their products more and more cheaply, leaving out the incidentals that always made a purchase a bit more palatable.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use and can be used in a circular motion to be sure to cut all the hair.  </li>
      <li>Washing is easy and holds a good charge IF you did the 24 hours pre-charge before the first use.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy any product that they manufacture because of their reliability and concern that the customer is completely satisfied with their product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to know that some companies take pride in the merchandise that they make and sell !</li>
      <li>I washed my face, applied pre-electric lotion, and got the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had with an electric in just a minute or two.  </li>
      <li>but it is real useful.</li>
      <li>Easy to shave with.</li>
      <li>I received the item very quickly.</li>
      <li>The flex heads can easily be damaged in a cluttered drawer or travel bag.</li>
      <li>Amazon makes shopping so easy, 7 days to deliver.    </li>
      <li>My grandfather has had no complaints about this easy to use cordless shaver.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ergonomically, it feels fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, cuts well, and is easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It shaves so close and smooth</li>
      <li>This Remington gives a much closer shave and is amazing on neck hairs.</li>
      <li>I felt the R-5150 felt cheap.</li>
      <li>So, my wife went to Wal-Mart and picked up a Cheap electric shaver</li>
      <li>My old Remington rotary&#x27;s rechargeable batteries finally gave out after many years of excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great close shave especially around my neck and chin.</li>
      <li>I recently got an infection and cleaned with alcohol and it was great.</li>
      <li>Amazon had the lowest price at the time at $44.99 with free shipping (Dec2011).  </li>
      <li>It feels cheap in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Seems like something you&#x27;d buy cheap at a dollar store.</li>
      <li>So easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I bought this product in order to get a smooth clean shave.</li>
      <li>It was easy to order and the delivery was quick.  </li>
      <li>My last Remington (which isn&#x27;t sold any more) wore out and it was a great razor, but this one is pure junk.</li>
      <li>I was caught off guard at first with how the rotary tends to pull your hair more if your let your beard grow out a bit.</li>
      <li>Still, it gets the job done adequately and is just fine for the price (which by the way is cheaper now at WalMart ($39.97).</li>
      <li>This model is a quick charge model and has a battery charge indicator light bar.  </li>
      <li>It takes forever to get a clean shave which irritates my skin.  </li>
      <li>If one places one&#x27;s index finger naturally over the top edge there is no noise!  </li>
      <li>The razor is very light and seems very cleaply made.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Products are only as good as the reliability of the manufacturer and without doubt, Spectrum Brand , the manufacturer of the RemingtonR-5150 shaver gets an A++ .</li>
      <li>A good shaver especially for travel, thank you.</li>
      <li>I think the only reason there are good reviews in here is because we&#x27;ve lost our ability over the years to separate quality from trash.</li>
      <li>It suits my purpose and should last a good amount of time as I have purchased the replacement blades once they are needed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t as close as a good razor shave but the Remington 5150 is suited for shaves that only need to meet the needs of appearances.</li>
      <li>for\\&quot; rings true.</li>
      <li>This will save you from buying a 5150 and buying a better model on top of the first when you realize you can&#x27;t live with the power capacity.</li>
      <li>It does not shave close or quickly.  </li>
      <li>This product shaved so quickly, even on my neck, the razor never heated.  </li>
      <li>It also is quickly rechargeable.</li>
      <li>Remington didn&#x27;t make a better shaver, they only made a more profitable one.  </li>

    <li> Old shaver was elect flat 2 blade so this took 6 weeks to get my beard organized or used to circular blades(normal), great shave and it cut right through 2 and 3 day beard.  Water cleaning is really great, use dish sink sprayer and warm water!!!! it saves allot of time and energy.  (water is a small lubricant over time)  Disappointing that the charge only last 1 week though it says 3-5 weeks.  Either i have a bad battery or there is a trick.  I have tried to keep the unit in the charge and plugged in for 3 days and that didn&#x27;t work.  ideas are welcome?</li>
    <li> I bought this product in order to get a smooth clean shave. Unfortunately, this product does not deliver what&#x27;s expected to do. You will find left over hair and rash marks along the neck. This product should be looked at and redesigned for a better closer shave experience.</li>
    <li> *** Don&#x27;t buy this shaver from JTIDIRECT.com! I received two REFURBISHED shavers, with 90 day limited warranties, and no cleaning brushes!  JTIDIRECT AND AMAZON FALSELY advertise the R-5150!</li>
    <li> Had switched from a Braun razor to a base model rotary Remington. Started using Norelco rotary mid scale razor. Never got as good of a shave as I did with Remington. The Remingtom r-5150 is simply the best Electric shaver I have owned. Great close shave especially around my neck and chin. It takes less passes to get the job done than my Norelco and the blades last longer and are cheaper than Norelco. For the price and quality of shave it just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;This shaver gives a very close and comfortable shave, much improved over an older Remington rotary which left my face irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically, it feels fine. The shaver fits my hand well, and it is easy to clean under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is absurdly short. I can only get two shaves out of it before it poops out. More expensive shavers in the line seem to contain higher-capacity batteries, so you may want to look at those first. This will save you from buying a 5150 and buying a better model on top of the first when you realize you can&#x27;t live with the power capacity. Hmmmm. Maybe that was the general idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short battery life would not be much of a problem if the shaver came with a charging stand. You could then have it constantly charging. But it does not. You have to find an open AC outlet and a place to lay the shaver down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t shave while the shaver is charging if the remaining charge is low to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greedy:&lt;br /&gt;Made to a price point (not especially cheap if you have been buying shavers for years). Deliberately crippled battery life, no charging stand. Your eventual dissatisfaction will lead you to buy yet another shaver. Remington hopes it will be one of their expensive models.</li>
    <li> I used Remington for 50 years,  Great shave, no problem. I don&#x27;t know if the new shaver is to close to my skin, or my skin is to delicate and smooth at my edge ( 80 years old) I used the new shaver once and I felt a burning  sensation but I did not see any blood on my face. I put lotion and it burn.  I would like to hear your opinion.</li>
    <li> I just received the Remington R-5150 shaver so I really can&#x27;t comment on it yet. However, if I were to give a company 5 stars on reliability,&lt;br /&gt;concern with customer satisfaction and every thing else to please the customer, I would give Spectrum Brand, the manufacturer of the Remington R-5150 shaver FIVE STARS PLUS !&lt;br /&gt;They do all they can to please a customer. I previously purchased a Remington R-1260 shaver and had trouble with it . I subsequently called Spectrum Brands and they immediately sent a new replacement . No problems , no questions asked !!&lt;br /&gt;Products are only as good as the reliability of the manufacturer and without doubt, Spectrum Brand , the manufacturer of the RemingtonR-5150 shaver gets an A++ . I would definitely buy any product that they manufacture because of their reliability and concern that the customer is completely satisfied with their product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to know that some companies take pride in the merchandise that they make and sell !</li>
    <li> My grandfather has had no complaints about this easy to use cordless shaver. He&#x27;s in his late 80s and has no trouble reading the battery meter or getting several shaves without a charge in between. He can be rather picky about things, but has no complaints about this gift.</li>
    <li> i was searching for a clean and flexible shaver and found this product as a most suitable for my rough beard. it has  a magical smoothness.</li>
    <li> This is an averge to slightly above average razor for the price - about $40.  It shaves close enough, but, I just cannot get used to the floating pivot head assembly.  It&#x27;s constantly moving and clicking, and I think it interferes with getting a close shave on my upper lip right below my nose.  I&#x27;m going to switch back to a Norelco lift and cut type with reflex heads - it is easier to control, about the same price, and shaves at least as close as the Remington.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about a month. The shaver does not charge anymore. I don&#x27;t know what happened. I do know this. Manufacturers don&#x27;t make shavers good anymore. The power cord for the R-5150 is very think which means that copper wire can easily break or get worn. I still have my first electric shaver R-845 is still working, but the mouthstache trimmer broke when I dropped of which I understand.I&#x27;m disappointed with The R-5150. I give it 1star because It took quite a few shaves to break it in and then the shaver doesn&#x27;t share anymore!</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor after a remington I had for fifteen years quit working.  The first time I used it the razor pulled out as much hair as it cut. Maybe it was just a bad set of cutters but I would never by this model again.This is the first product I have bought at Amazon that did not conform with product excellence.</li>
    <li> VERY CLEAN SHAVE.  VERY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD AND USE.</li>
    <li> After five weeks of use I abandoned this razor. My face was a patchwork of scarcely shaven hair and razor burns, and the razor burns in the neck area produced very annoying itching. The burns were produced by the need to continually go over spots where the razor would not adequately reduce stubble. This was simply a very, very bad experience. The purchase was a big mistake that resulted in five weeks of pain and embarrassing stubble.</li>
    <li> I got this Remington R-5150 cord/cordless Rotary Shaver.  It came quickly on time.  It works very well.  It does not cut really deep into the skin as a razor blade, but shaves enough to be looking sharp and clean.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend lots of money on an electrical shaver, try this one.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have used a safety razor for years and I am not used to an electric razor.  Although, 50 years ago, when I was a teen I used a Remington Electric razor and it was excellent.  Unfortunately, I recently was in the hospital for a few days and the Doctor put me on blood thinners, which I have to stay on for quite a while.  So, my wife went to Wal-Mart and picked up a Cheap electric shaver so I couldn&#x27;t nick myself and bleed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the Remington I had from 50 years ago.  It pulls the neck hair.  It clicks as I use it due to the \\&quot;Pivot Head\\&quot;.  It takes forever to get a clean shave which irritates my skin.  It feels cheap in my hand.  The build quality is poor. It didn&#x27;t come with a charging station, or a protective cover for the blades.  It didn&#x27;t come with a case or bag to protect the shaver while traveling.  It didn&#x27;t even come with a little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good part: It is a rechargeable so you can use it plugged in and unplugged.  It holds its charge for 3 to 4 shaves (this could be better).  You can rinse out the clippings under the faucet which is great!  I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part:  This stupid thing stopped working altogether after 4 weeks.  I was very careful with this shaver not to damage it.  I know it was not my fault.  What good is a shaver that doesn&#x27;t shave?  It isn&#x27;t even heavy enough to use as a door stop.  So I called Remington and talked with Customer Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Best part:  Customer service was very gracious.  They sent me a brand new R5150 shaver without an argument.  I got it today via FedEx.  It took about 2 weeks to receive it.  They want me to send the dead shaver back, and sent me a return label to use.  I&#x27;ll drop it off at FedEx tomorrow.  .....I wonder how long this replacement will last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I suggest that you buy a better shaver.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap shaver even though the price is cheap.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It also has a beard trimmer. I didn&#x27;t know what this was before I bought it but it is real useful.</li>
    <li> First off, let me preface this by saying that I have a moderate beard. I need to shave daily but it I would not consider it heavy by any means.  As far as shaving, it does that job for me and meets my needs. I expect the titanium blades to work for the duration of the razor (as was the case in my previous Remington rotaries that last 6 years and were disposed of only because the batteries died). But this purchase left me thinking I should have replaced the batteries on the previous razor and dealt with the diminished aesthetics.  The problems I have with this razor are:  1) The floating head assembly is annoying. It&#x27;s constantly clicking as it moves with the contours of my face.  2) The razor is very light and seems very cleaply made. The fissures where the parts connect are rough and do not fit well.  3) It did not come with a protective plastic head nor with a pouch/bag.  4) It didn&#x27;t even come with a small cleaning brush.  5) The converter is on the cord and not in the razor. I&#x27;d rather have it built-in as in every other cordless Remington I&#x27;ve owned.  Look, it does the job and I paid only $45 with shipping for it. But the construction and design leave much to be desired. I cannot recommend this and wish I would have bought it locally so that it could have been returned more easily.  It seems that manufacturers are building their products more and more cheaply, leaving out the incidentals that always made a purchase a bit more palatable.</li>
    <li> I bought this instead of getting new blades for my other Remington. It works just like my other one R4130. It is a little faster but not the WOW that some of the other reviewers are giving it. I hate cutting myself on blades so i use these. For way under a hundred bucks it does the job.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this model and won&#x27;t use anything but this one!  He was amazed that he could purchase it through Amazon.  The only negative would be it did not come with head protector.</li>
    <li> I bought the R-5150 to replace the R-950 which gave me a close shave.  My first impression is the 5150 shaves about as close and with less irritation.  The heads are larger which makes for more coverage.  The \\&quot;pivot and flex\\&quot; technology (floating head assembly) causes some noise and seems unnecessary.  As others have noted the charging cord has a block at the plug.  I don&#x27;t know why it was desireable to move voltage converter out of the shaver, but I don&#x27;t find it especially large or inconvenient.  The LEDs showing the remaining charge are a nice feature not usually available at this price point.  One quibble I have is the 5150 doesn&#x27;t come with either a case or a blade protector.  This is a poor choice to save a few pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given the R-5150 four stars because it shaves close with minimal irritation - that&#x27;s the bottomline for a shaver.  I can overlook the noisy floating head assembly, and lack of a case and blade protector.</li>
    <li> PRECHARGE FOR 24 HOURS BEFORE 1ST USE, it is in the manual but many miss this! A MUST for this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used Philips Norelco and recently the Norelco models are all above $80+ at my local store. So I thought to give this Remington a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is a bit on the low end compared to my previous shavers but otherwise provides a nice close shave. Washing is easy and holds a good charge IF you did the 24 hours pre-charge before the first use. I had to buy a second one since I only charged my 1st one until the indicator blinked FULL, from there on my first one would only hold about 1/3 of the charge on a full charge and lessens even more over time. SO AGAIN, CHARGE IT FOR 24 HOURS AS THE MANUAL SAYS BEFORE 1ST USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a budget price tag, this is still a pretty good shaver for daily use. This shaver is not built to be very water resistant like the Philips Norelco models (even the dry models), so when you wash it, be careful not to get any water into the handle assembly.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a remington R-845 that I used for 15 years and was very-very satisfied with but the battery life has been decreasing.  Both were about $50.  I had high expectations but am very disappointed.  I have pretty light beard for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  It is fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  It looks nice enough.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  They moved the DC converter from inside the shaver to a massive block on the cord.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  This is much bigger than my old one, which makes the above complaint all the more frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  The old one had the heads close together and this one has them spaced out more.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  This feals flimsy, light and cheap compared to the old one.  Cheaper materials and everything sorta wiggles.  The old one was thick plastic and metal and everyhting screwed together.  This one is a bunch of plastic that appears to snap together so that they can manufacture it on a faster moving assembley line.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  It does not glide across the face like the old one.  This kinda drags and is not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  After shaving with it, my wife said that I was still scratchy so I grabbed the old one and sure enough I could hear it cutting everything left behind.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  the flip up trimmer looks like it can&#x27;t wait to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a metaphor for everything else in this world.  In 15 years all the changes appear to have been negative.  Whatever happend to engineering design and manufacturing quality?  Maybe they don&#x27;t want to go another 15 years without my money.  Remington didn&#x27;t make a better shaver, they only made a more profitable one.  I think I&#x27;ll just need to charge the old one every day and stick with it.  This thing might not even survive being shipped back without disintegrating into a pile of plastic dust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old have used the Norelco all my life. My Brother in law passed away several months ago. My sister gave me some of his things and his new Remington R-5150 Flex 360 was in with what I received. I tried it. Unbelievable cordless, closes shave from an electric shaver Ive ever had. So easy to clean. Two rows of blades on each cutting wheel. The people with bad reviews much not have much of a life if they can find things wrong with this shaver. Thank you</li>
    <li> It works very well and is easy to use.  It charges well and stays charged a reasonable amount of time.  It was easy to order and the delivery was quick.  It was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Tends to pull hairs eventually, still trying to find out why. I used oil to attempt to fix it, still a no go.</li>
    <li> works good no problem</li>
    <li> This cordless has great power and does a remarkably close shave, effortlessly.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> A good shaver especially for travel, thank you.</li>
    <li> Remington used to have much better shavers in the past. The R-5150 is okay, does the job, but definitely not more than that.</li>
    <li> I love this cordless razor.  I use it to keep the hair on my head at a very short length.  It is so easy to use and can be used in a circular motion to be sure to cut all the hair.  I have tried other razors but must admit that I prefer using this razor and find it an easier method,</li>
    <li> Had this a week now. Does a good job. Dry shave. Since it&#x27;s both AC and cordless, it&#x27;s ideal for keeping on hand to prevent five o&#x27;clock shadow wherever you are. It&#x27;s light and convenient, though the trio of heads isn&#x27;t ideal for getting the moustache area under the nose. The 5150 has been well-behaved; the only time I&#x27;ve had even a hint of it possibly grabbing onto a hair and yanking it was in trying to get that under-the-nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LEDs indicate battery life. It&#x27;s like a cell phone, you&#x27;ll want to reconnect it to the charger every day because it&#x27;s good for two shaving sessions, no more than half an hour total. The pop-out trimmer works well, I tested it on the sideburns and away they went. There&#x27;s a hinge on the head assembly so with the push of a button it pops open for easy cleaning. The device is well-designed; buttons are positioned in just about ideal places on this unit. Hold it in your hand and the buttons are right there at your thumb and forefinger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t as close as a good razor shave but the Remington 5150 is suited for shaves that only need to meet the needs of appearances. Thus, it&#x27;s good enough for married men, it&#x27;s good enough for work, but if you&#x27;re a single guy with a date tonight, I&#x27;d use a razor for \\&quot;kissing close\\&quot;. With this electric shaver you&#x27;re definitely not prepared for anything more intimate than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Dropping this from four to two stars. Just found that I wasn&#x27;t using it. To get a decent shave takes as long or longer than using a disposable razor. Typically, after using this shaver I would wind up \\&quot;cleaning up\\&quot; or detailing with a razor anyway, especially below the cheekbones. That eliminates the convenience factor. The popout attachment for trimming sideburns is still handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to top it off, I unlatched the hinged top to shake out the shavings from the unit. Gently bumped it against the edge of the sink to shake loose shavings. Two of the three heads promptly fell off and went right down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose there&#x27;s always the option of [[ASIN:B001EJMSA6 Remington SP-5161 Teflon Coated Rotary Replacement Heads and Cutters]], currently priced just under thirty bucks.went right down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose there&#x27;s always the option of [[ASIN:B001EJMSA6 Remington SP-5161 Teflon Coated Rotary Replacement Heads and Cutters]], currently priced just under thirty bucks.</li>
    <li> Shaves well. Easy to shave with. Has been used for several months with no problems. The shaver has to be set in the recharger just so or it doesn&#x27;t recharge</li>
    <li> This shaves better than sme others. I like it.</li>
    <li> Floating heads not as flexible as previous models.  Seems to take longer to shave as did previous models.  Harder time getting to areas around nose.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift, works fine and appreciated it.</li>
    <li> I think the only reason there are good reviews in here is because we&#x27;ve lost our ability over the years to separate quality from trash. Now granted, it does seem to shave close, but I could be wrong since I&#x27;ve used the same Norelco for the last 10 years, and it wasn&#x27;t exactly sharp anymore. It quit working even plugged in so I was forced to buy another shaver. Norelco for some reason thinks their shavers don&#x27;t need flip up trimmers any more, which is really bad for me because I&#x27;m stuck with cheap trash. First thing I noticed was how much it felt cheap, plastic and light compared to my now dead Norelco. Upon using it I noticed how much weaker the motor was in comparison too, as the blades snag on hairs every so often and you can hear the revolutions slow a bit. It&#x27;s even worse when not plugged in because there isn&#x27;t &#x27;as much&#x27; power available when on battery only. Getting tired of Chinese garbage. Bought a manual edge trimmer recently from depot that collapsed/bent under my 155 lb weight. Are you kidding me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit. Norelco&#x27;s do have pop up trimmers. Not sure why I was having a hard time finding one at the stores.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed is this razor does not come with a protective cap or cover.  The flex heads can easily be damaged in a cluttered drawer or travel bag. The recharging transformer sticks out from the wall outlet 2 1/4 ins and should have been flush mounted.  It took me awhile to figure out how to remove the cutter head for weekly cleaning (need fingernails, pull straight out).  And although the instructions discuss in length how to remove the batteries for safe disposal it is not clear if the batteries are replaceable.  Amazon had the lowest price at the time at $44.99 with free shipping (Dec2011).  It&#x27;s not so obvious the model number for replacement heads but they showed up on an Amazon search ($20.88). Remingtons have always worked well for me in the past, adequate and inexpensive, but the thing has to first be initially charged for 24 hrs. Amazon makes shopping so easy, 7 days to deliver.    The floating pivoting moving head thingy is sometimes difficult to press against tough spots.  The razor is very lightweight and has a cheap feel.  Still, it gets the job done adequately and is just fine for the price (which by the way is cheaper now at WalMart ($39.97).</li>
    <li> Bought a refurb. 1st unit overheated and wouldn&#x27;t charge correctly. Returned at my own cost :(  and received another shaver. This time the power chord had a bad cable that wouldn&#x27;t work from faulty wire. Had to curl the wire portion of cable to work. I requested another cable which was sent and I got a week later.. All is working now.. Good cutting razor. Lasts for three shaves, but I also use to shave head as well as face each time daily.</li>
    <li> This is a good product considering its lower end price range. It suits my purpose and should last a good amount of time as I have purchased the replacement blades once they are needed.</li>
    <li> Una de las mejores compras que hice, muy útil para un caballero como yo.</li>
    <li> I received the Remington 5150 as a Christmas gift. Now that I&#x27;ve had it for a week I thought I&#x27;d comment on it. I&#x27;m a hairy beast and can grow a nice beard in less than a week.  I&#x27;ve had Norelco rotary electric razors for at least 20 years and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with them. My last Norelco, a Reflex model, I&#x27;d had for about 10 years. I have replaced the blade assembly a couple of times (cheaper to buy replacement blades on Ebay than at stores). It got to a point where this razor would not hold a charge for more than two shaving sessions and the blades were worn out. I figured I&#x27;d get another Norelco and was surprised and a bit disappointed when I unwrapped this Remington on Christmas Eve.   First thing you notice is that it&#x27;s very lightweight. This could be due to the fact that the transformer for the charger is outboard of the razor and also because the battery pack is lighter in weight. But almost everything built nowadays is lighter and therefore seems flimsier. It didn&#x27;t come with a travel pouch or a blade cover, but it does have a charging stand. This model is a quick charge model and has a battery charge indicator light bar.  Next thing I noticed is that it is quieter in operation than my old Norelco. Also, the head floats and pivots as you move the blades over the contours of your face. Another reviewer complained that it was constantly clicking as it pivoted. It does click at times as the blade head contacts the edge of the razor body, not constantly, but I don&#x27;t find it annoying.   Finally, I must admit that it shaves very, very well. The first time I tried it I was dubious it would work well since it was so lightweight, so quiet, and well, plasticky. A very close shave, it takes only one pass over the cheeks, mouth area and chin, and it handles my neck hairs with ease. My Norelco would require a couple of passes over these areas and had trouble with neck hairs--I would have to go over my neck area multiple times, swiping from different directions to get aclose shave. This Remington gives a much closer shave and is amazing on neck hairs. In fact, I shave off (pun intended) about a minute and a half from my morning routine using this razor. Perhaps this is because the rotary blades on the Remington are about 33% larger than on the Norelco and/or the fact that the blade head floats over contours.   A couple of negatives--the pop-up trimmer works well, but unlike my Norelcos, when shaving the hairs on the back of my neck and upward to behind my ears (to freshen the clean cut line you get at the barber shop) I can only draw the razor in one direction. With the Norelcos I could pull or push the razor. I only do this once a week so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. Also, the spring and latch mechanism that allows the blade head to pop open in order to rinse off the blades doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as I would like but should not be a problem as long as I&#x27;m careful with it.  Not sure where it was purchased but WalMart has it for $39.96.  Summary--awesomely close shave, great on neck hairs, a time saver over my Norelco. It shaves so close and smooth I&#x27;ve got to give it five stars even though I&#x27;ve got a couple of quibbles with things unrelated to daily shaving performance.</li>
    <li> Running on battery, it runs out of power after only 3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is worth the extra money - you can go weeks on a charge.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver a few months ago, and my experience has not been good. At first it delivered adequate shaves, though with some discomfort due to a tendency to irritate my skin. This irritation effect has gotten worse, and the shave quality has deteriorated to the point where I have to touch up substantially with a blade razor. The shaving sensation has never been one of gliding over my face, but rather more of a coarse \\&quot;mowing.\\&quot; The head is a lightweight material, perhaps plastic, and the latch is balky on my unit. A handy feature is the charge level indicator - I get 6 to 7 shaves before recharging is necessary. However the shave quality seems to decrease as the charge level drops. The sideburn trimmer works ok. I now am shopping for a new razor, and am unsure what brand to try, as I&#x27;ve had battery issues with Norelco. When I get a new shaver, I plan to throw the R5150 away.</li>
    <li> This was a good choice. My wife got me a Remington Foil shaver and they did not work as well as the flex shavers do. I had and older Remington and it finally gave out. I like this model with the LED charge indicator. So far it is working very well.</li>
    <li> Nice balance, comfortable grip, close quick shave makes this a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: this nice stand/charger fits the R 5150 even though it&#x27;s not listed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008RA0MZ8 Remington Charging Stand for the RemingtonÂ® F-5130 &amp; F-7130 Shavers]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this electric razor.  It&#x27;s light, cuts well, and is easy to clean.  It also is quickly rechargeable.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I am a prior Remington user, and currently own a Remington R-845 that is several years old. As soon as I took it out of the (frustrating to open package) I felt the R-5150 felt cheap. Very lightweight and plastic. Seems like something you&#x27;d buy cheap at a dollar store. All you get is the razor and a power cord, not even a plastic cap to protect the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor seems lightweight. I used it every day for ten days, some days 2x a day, and could never get a decent shave. With the R-5150 I never got a close shave, it looked like I had a 3 O&#x27;clock shadow, and my facial hair is just average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it came down to for me is that my old remmy, even being several years old and still having its original cutting head, still gives me a better quality shave. ( Go figure! )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think Remington is a great brand, but it looks like you have to go for one of their more expensive models to get the quality I expect.</li>
    <li> It does not shave close or quickly.  The reason for purchasing the shaver Remington R-5150&lt;br /&gt;Flex 360 is that I take coumadind 9BLOOD THINNER)for a open heart surgery and wanted to stop using a razor because I cut myself often.</li>
    <li> Excellent  article. It arrived at time</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. I plugged it in for 12 hours to give it a good charge, used it for a few minutes, and the battery meter showed 40%. The trimmer function has no brace to hold it up. You can&#x27;t trim upwards or the trimmer door collapses.  My last Remington (which isn&#x27;t sold any more) wore out and it was a great razor, but this one is pure junk.</li>
    <li> very easy to use very handy</li>
    <li> I  bought a Braun 3-360 and was so disappointed in it I had to purchase this shaver.  I was really surprised at how quickly and closely it shaved.  Its as close as a blade and shaves in much faster time.  I&#x27;m just upset that I didn&#x27;t purchase this shaver before I wasted my money on the Braun.</li>
    <li> Have shaved with a Norelco for years 40+ This Remington has an extra circle of cutters and shaves me 2 times as fast.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Remington prior and motor burned out in 3-4 months. I had got it with Casino points at Foxwoods who did not have this razor when went last. So was dissapointed and as I had no proof of sale I sprung for another. Best move ever on shaving.</li>
    <li> this is R-5150&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had this for 1+ years &amp; don&#x27;t like it.  battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, pop-up trimmer got useless dull after 6 months &amp; the shave head pulls a little bit if using the battery when low charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at least it works when plugged in, battery dead or not!!!</li>
    <li> After three uses it needs to be recharged.  Increased shaving time because of thenecessity &amp;#34;to go vere&amp;#34; the same area several times.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my father who has no complaints so I am sure it satisfactory. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have a very dense, tough beard so I tend to be rough on razors. This was my first attempt at a rotary instead of doing it with a manual blade or even a side-to-side shaver. I was caught off guard at first with how the rotary tends to pull your hair more if your let your beard grow out a bit. But I found that if I move quickly and press a bit harder, it wasn&#x27;t too bad. The trimmer on the side is convenient, but it&#x27;s really flimsy and stopped cutting my side burns after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way that the heads are set in a ways from the outer edge makes it difficult to get the hair just under my nose and also to get a clean line shave up to my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel like I get a close enough shave, but wish it was better. I would probably not recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This does an decent job of shaving but the latch that holds the head closed is so flimsy that it is constantly accidentally popping open and spilling the shavings all over the place.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver because at least in part because my last Remington lasted so long.  In spite some disparaging remarks about the flex head, I really like the speed and comfort it provides.  If one places one&#x27;s index finger naturally over the top edge there is no noise!  I fully expect to get many years of close shaves out of this one too.</li>
    <li> My husband owns the cordless Remington and was unhappy with the lack of shaving time; with the 5150 more shaving time and he says it gives a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Came DOA,No charge so returned to sender.</li>
    <li> Received on time and as described</li>
    <li> Although the electric razor is performing well so far, I did not realize it was refurbished when I purchased it. I guess I missed that disclaimer. But it&#x27;s fine so far and I imagine being refurbished is why it was priced so well.</li>
    <li> I have a DA-307 which cuts very well only that the blades and cutters are too expensive, so i bought this RS150. Wow! the RS150 was a pure disappointment. The rotors turn slowly, it pulled my haie not cut. I was saying Ow! Ow! Ow! until I stoped. It was charged as per instructions before the first use, but it was pure pain and disgust on my first use.&lt;br /&gt;This product has no plastic rotor cover to protect it and does not come with any cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase this product again. I will try some other brand next time.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m stuck with my DA-307 for now buying expensive blades and cutters from Remingotn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought a Remington, it was ripping hairs out so figuring it was defective I sent it back. They sent me an upgrade..... which very painfully ripped hair out just as the lesser model did. I tried oiling the screens with machine oil.... didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy another Remington.</li>
    <li> I very well pleased with item and it works very well. I have told many of  my friends about it.</li>
    <li> this is the best shaver i have ever had its gives the&lt;br /&gt;closest shave and is great  on the neck and trimming your sideburns</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for decades and this is by far the worst, but not the least expensive, one I&#x27;ve ever had.  Now I have to either try a new shaving head for $22+ or buy a new razor because this one doesn&#x27;t cut it.  When they said &amp;#34;titanium&amp;#34; blades they must have meant the color, not the material.  Six months and it can&#x27;t keep up with my daily growth.</li>
    <li> I recommend it for all you that shave your head. It cuts great and cleans up easily. It also holds a great charge.</li>
    <li> Its a good electric shaver. He had a foil type before, it didnt last a year. he likes this one it doesnt matter if he goes a few days without shaving, it still works good and quickly</li>
    <li> People really are different.  My shaver arrived today and it was a returned item from someone who obviously did not like the product.  (I recently returned an item to Amazon myself so I guess this their way of getting even).  Anyway, I had a three day growth to try my new shaver on.  I washed my face, applied pre-electric lotion, and got the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had with an electric in just a minute or two.  Other shavers I have had always took several minutes of going over and over my face which heated the shaver and left razor burn.  This product shaved so quickly, even on my neck, the razor never heated.  This Remington is outstanding for me.</li>
    <li> This shaver was received around April 2nd. It LITERALLY fell apart before April 20th. The portion of the shaver that hold the razor heads broke into multiple pieces. The number of stars for this issue should be a negative value but since one star is the lowest acceptable rating that is the rating it has earned.</li>
    <li> After my 15 year old Braun died, I bought this razor mostly based on price- $30 at WalMart. The old adage \\&quot;you only get what you pay for\\&quot; rings true. This razor pulls more hair from my face than it cuts. The latch doesn&#x27;t stay closed during operation. The coarse effect on my face leaves constant irritation. I tried replacing the blades with new, thinking the factory installed cutters may be cheap/ineffective- nope! The new ones were just as bad- another $17 wasted. Spend a few extra dollars and get something of better quality. Definitely research online reviews first.</li>
    <li> I like the product but am disappointed that I did not receive a little brush cleaning kit with it. I have a light beard and sensitive skin. When I use the razor I use a downward motion as if I were wet shaving. Then I gently use upward direction to finish the job. This way there is little or no irritation. The charge goes down to the second mark after 5 shaves, then I recharge.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington products for years.  as a matter of fact, one electric razor lasted me for years.  Recently i needed to replace it because it was dying.  i purchased this unit to replace my old one and i am very very disappointed. given time, i can get a good shave, but the cheap plastic body of this thing is not good. The swivel head (more like a loose head) doesn&#x27;t function as it should at all. it just drags and snaps as far as it can swivel. i found that i need to hold the head with my fingers to make the necessary contact with my face.  Maybe all new razors are cheap now, but this one certainly is.</li>
    <li> My old Remington rotary&#x27;s rechargeable batteries finally gave out after many years of excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this model and man, what a let down. Underpowered, spins too slow, pulls a lot, and leaves a shave like a lawn mower with dull blades would. I even bought new blades thinking I had gotten a bad batch but still a poor performance everytime. It is not a joy to use and most of the time now I just use a blade razor. Oh, and the catch gives way now and then dumping whiskers in to the drawer where I keep it. After a year of owning it I am going to go out and buy another brand.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver one star because you can&#x27;t give it negative stars. This thing is terrible. The motor runs too slow to be effective. Like one reviewer said it \\&quot;shaves like a lawn mower with dull blades\\&quot;. It&#x27;s going to the trash where it belongs. Remington.....you can do better.</li>
    <li> First few times it seemed ruff but after the third use it is the best shaver have ever had. Love that blades can be washed with H20. I recently got an infection and cleaned with alcohol and it was great.</li>
    <li> I have an expensive futuristic looking Norelco that I thought would solve all my shaving problems.  However, I have to go over my neck at least ten times and it still didn&#x27;t get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does the job in one or two passes.  I am finished in one fifth the time and I have a close shave!</li>
    <li> I received the item very quickly. it is a nice cordless to shave. But it is not what I really expected in therm quality. than is why I rate it 3***</li>
    <li> I really like my razor,but I wish it had a charging stand. It gives a nice close shave and the power seems to last.</li>
