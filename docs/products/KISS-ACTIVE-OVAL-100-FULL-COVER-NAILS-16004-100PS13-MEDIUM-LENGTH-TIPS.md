      <li>KISS is my favorite nail brand</li>
      <li>/&gt;Natural shape :)</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite product of its type.  </li>
      <li>And, on top of that, there are so many, that you can use many times!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The cost of postage and a  more reliable glue prevents a five star rating.</li>
      <li>love the look,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find them on Amazon, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price- quick delivery, too!</li>
      <li>Have to file to fit better</li>
      <li>og glue &amp; easy to find</li>
      <li>so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Great product no regrets.</li>
      <li>Was Shipped Super Fast!!!!</li>
      <li>as this assortment is no longer available  in retail stores, l appreciate the fact amazon.com carries this.</li>
      <li>The ones that don&#x27;t fit me, my daughter uses.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t get them from here got them from my local Walmart there great for u lady&#x27;s who like</li>
      <li>I don&#x60;t even want to put a nail polisher yet, because I enjoy them</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like 10 free fills of &amp;#34;acrylic at the nail salon&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Comes with toe and finger nails and the glue is super strong</li>
      <li>The glue is strong, quick and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>I think they look great even before you file them, if you want them that long.</li>
      <li>And they definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Great for cosplays or anyone not willing to trash their nails-boy do they come off easily.</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply and fun to polish.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and just the right length</li>
      <li>The nails have a great shape, but the glue is far less than good</li>
      <li>However, they come in too many large sizes.</li>
      <li>However, you should be prepared to buy a better grade of glue if you are really &amp;#34;active.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t do a full set with the sizes provided.</li>
      <li>so I have to trim the smallest to fit right</li>
      <li>Excellent for such a low price .my picture is the nails with some nail stickers from &amp;#34;minx nails&amp;#34; I just used a file and they are al set .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like going to the super centers without leaving home.</li>
      <li>Shopping on amazon is so much fun.</li>
      <li>I have always preferred oval, since it looks way more natural.</li>
      <li>Came right on time as described.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure would work well for most average sized hands.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and look very natural.</li>
      <li>The price is great and there are tons of extra and different sizes to work with.</li>
      <li>delivery was fast and on time!</li>
      <li>Much more bigger sizes than I can use...</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!</li>
      <li>Nails seem to be of good quality, but when I went to use the glue I found it had dried in the bottle...</li>
      <li>The nails were nice enough, nice and strong, but I have a long nail bed and they were not long enough.  </li>
      <li>My friends were amazed because they looked so real.</li>
      <li>Have gotten tons of compliments, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like these nails.</li>
      <li>But this should fit any regular sized women.</li>
      <li>I like the mid length oval because they are too long, but still look nice on the hands.  </li>
      <li>Not flimsy and great for fixing broken nails!</li>
      <li>If you live in a rural area home delivery might be worth the cost of postage.  </li>
      <li>They look very natural.  </li>
      <li>and I have to shave some down to fit.</li>
      <li>the nail salon look for half the price they fit my nails</li>
      <li>These nails aren&#x27;t too thick which is a huge plus, they last for well over a week if applied properly and the oval shape is a lot more natural than square.</li>
      <li>my nails are a bit oddly shaped.. somehow I always find some that will fit.</li>
      <li>I just forget that my hand are so small that most full coverage nails will not fit me.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t too long and they look real.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The nails are real short. Except the thumb nails. I have to fle down the thumb nails for my middle finger and so those are the 2 longest nails. It&#x27;s weird how they do the sizing. I wish they were the same length. Other than that they&#x27;re doable</li>
    <li> Looks like I went to the salon, but I can change the polish over and over with ease. So much better.</li>
    <li> Perfect 😍😍 came in in about four days and they look so great and natural on the nail! (I did file them to a square shape</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for a long time, buying it at a local Beauty Supply.  I was pleased to find them on Amazon, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price- quick delivery, too!</li>
    <li> I really like these nails. They aren&#x27;t too long and they look real. Very comfortable. My nail polish stays on them perfectly throughout their wear. However, they come in too many large sizes. Much more bigger sizes than I can use... I only used two sizes (I don&#x27;t wear these on my thumbs) and I have no use for the rest of the 400+ nails. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again for that reason. Also, I usually have to glue my nails twice so I would recommend finding a better glue.</li>
    <li> Great product - fast excellent service.</li>
    <li> I love these nails!! They take the place of what nature cheated me. They are easy to apply and fun to polish. I wish I had discovered them sooner!! Shopping on amazon is so much fun. It&#x27;s like going to the super centers without leaving home.</li>
    <li> Excellent for such a low price .my picture is the nails with some nail stickers from &amp;#34;minx nails&amp;#34; I just used a file and they are al set . Pun intended!</li>
    <li> These nails look great and they stay on for almost two weeks without regluing and I garden! I like the natural oval shape and they arent too long. The price is great and there are tons of extra and different sizes to work with. I&#x27;m impressed with Kiss.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite product of its type.  This is a must have  if you play acoustic guitar or Nashville style electric.  It will save you if you break a nail in the middle of a gig.&lt;br /&gt; The price before postage is very competive, but the total is about the same as the local drugstore.  If you live in a rural area home delivery might be worth the cost of postage.  However, you should be prepared to buy a better grade of glue if you are really &amp;#34;active.&amp;#34;  The cost of postage and a  more reliable glue prevents a five star rating.</li>
    <li> Came right on time as described. Perfect when I want to grow my nails out and don&#x27;t want to paint them. I can actually make whatever designs I want on the nail before placing it on always easier.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the kit I hit a dead end. The entire bottle of glue was dried solid. My second issue is that the curve of the fake nail doesn&#x27;t really match up to real nails well, leaving a lot of room for air bubbles to form. Lastly, the nails themselves are relatively flimsy. It&#x27;s day two of having them on and one already had a noticeable crease from bumping it. I&#x27;ll have to cut it and reshape my nails all over again.</li>
    <li> The glue bottles in all kits were empty!  Nail Kits is a fraud, it&#x27;s just nails! I was truly disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nails seem to be of good quality, but when I went to use the glue I found it had dried in the bottle...very odd considering none of the seals were broken. Not a fun discovery to make right before I&#x27;m about to leave.</li>
    <li> The nails have a great shape, but the glue is far less than good</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Easy to apply and just the right length</li>
    <li> i was very disappointed. The kits i couldn&#x27;t get from walmart had 200 pieces, not 100. Even though, I still used them, i just didn&#x27;t expect them to take out a hundred nails</li>
    <li> Great product! Not flimsy and great for fixing broken nails!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years and have been finding it increasingly hard to find them in my local stores. Easy to apply and look very natural.</li>
    <li> They look the most natural compared to other fake nails I&#x27;ve tried. They are nice and thin, but not too thin, just enough to look real. I think they look great even before you file them, if you want them that long. I have always preferred oval, since it looks way more natural.</li>
    <li> These are a bit big for me but I&#x27;m sure would work well for most average sized hands.  Of course, that is how they are advertised.  Just couldn&#x27;t pass up the bargain.</li>
    <li> I can only use the 2 smallest for all my nails and I have to shave some down to fit. I do have unusually small hands. But this should fit any regular sized women.</li>
    <li> I like the mid length oval because they are too long, but still look nice on the hands.  They look very natural.  Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Last quiet some time for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Easy to use fake nails.  Lots of different sizes to choose from.</li>
    <li> Good price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I thought they&#x27;d be longer and the same shape as the ones I brought localy before cutting if from the market.</li>
    <li> Great product and way cheaper than going to the nail salons.  People ask me where I got my nails done!  So awesome that I can save money and still have attractive nails.</li>
    <li> Was Shipped Super Fast!!!! Quality is good. Happy Customer</li>
    <li> KISS is my favorite nail brand &amp; I LOVE the ovals! So pretty &amp; easy to pain/decorate &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;Plenty og glue &amp; easy to find size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#x27;t buy mine on amazon. Guys Walmart &amp; Mijers &amp; probably;y a ton of other home-pharmacy groshers sell this for $5.50!&lt;br /&gt;The price here isn&#x27;t bad at all, but just so u know ;)</li>
    <li> I would rate it higher but the small nails are not quite small enough for my pinky so I have to trim the smallest to fit right</li>
    <li> After going to get gel nails put on for years I have finally found an easier and cheaper alternative. These nails aren&#x27;t too thick which is a huge plus, they last for well over a week if applied properly and the oval shape is a lot more natural than square. They also do not feel uncomfortable, I.E. They do not put pressure on my nail beds. The compliments keep coming and no one is able to clock my &#x27;press ons&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Having bought the self adhesive ones for quickness, I realized how awful they were and bought this pack instead! Brilliant value for a brilliant product that is soooo easy to use! My nails always last at least 2 weeks, and I can also put Jamberry nail covers on them really easily. Great product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT!!! The nails are GREAT!! they look SUPER-natural! and amazing as it is! I don&#x60;t even want to put a nail polisher yet, because I enjoy them so much!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the Oval shape!!! It looks so feminine and different! Very gentle look!&lt;br /&gt;the length is PERFECT! Not too long, not too short, however, if someone will find it long, they can always trim it down. I trimmed couple of them with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;There are GREAT variety of sizes, so that anyone can find the right one for oneself. And, on top of that, there are so many, that you can use many times!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using false nails for almost 5 years and I have to say, These ones by far are ONE OF THE BEST! And they definitely worth the price! Would totally recommend it and will re-order them again!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast and on time!</li>
    <li> Beautiful nails!  These are sturdy and don&#x27;t bend.  The ones that don&#x27;t fit me, my daughter uses.</li>
    <li> Great for cosplays or anyone not willing to trash their nails-boy do they come off easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a struggling college student; had to give up my manicurist.&lt;br /&gt;for 10$ this is awesome. The glue is strong, quick and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to shape and apply, happy. It&#x27;s like 10 free fills of &amp;#34;acrylic at the nail salon&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy, from now i&#x27;ll be doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural shape :)</li>
    <li> prefect product as decribed</li>
    <li> Did a vampire costume for Halloween and not only did these serve as my nails, they doubled as my fangs with a little filing and Fixodent. My friends were amazed because they looked so real. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Happy to receive this discontinued item.  Just as described, shipped quickly and in perfect shape. Have used this product for many years and creates a perfect nail and very natural.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. Always a great nail, never have to worry about them breakin off.</li>
    <li> I like these. The only negative is that some of the nails are to wide for my fingers,&amp; I have pretty big hands. Have to file to fit better</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product! Now I no longer have buy the pack of 28 at the drugstore for the same price as 100.  I use pink gel glue from the beauty supply store instead of the included glue, and my nails look so natural, especially with the oval shape.  Have gotten tons of compliments, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> as this assortment is no longer available  in retail stores, l appreciate the fact amazon.com carries this. love the look,&lt;br /&gt;and so easy to apply. love!!! have used for years!! hope amazon carries them for a lone time.</li>
    <li> when i bought these i was expecting average size nails, and i don&#x27;t mean length... the width of these nails were WAY too wide! i could fit the two largest sizes on my toes!!! very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The glue is awful but the nails are nice.</li>
    <li> Way longer than I thought. A hassle to use.</li>
    <li> Great product no regrets. Comes with toe and finger nails and the glue is super strong</li>
    <li> my nails are a bit oddly shaped.. somehow I always find some that will fit. these are great- I just wish that there were some that could survive the nail polish removal process, and that could be repainted. I guess that&#x27;s why they give so many extras!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get them from here got them from my local Walmart there great for u lady&#x27;s who like the nail salon look for half the price they fit my nails prefect polish looks awsome on the nails 👍</li>
    <li> The nails were nice enough, nice and strong, but I have a long nail bed and they were not long enough.  I also didn&#x27;t like the fact that they were pointed.  I guess that was partly my fault.  I didn&#x27;t research them enough.</li>
    <li> The best nails of all on the market. I keep them in shape for at least two weeks, with use of NON-ACETONE polish remover, simple filing, and a re-touch of glue to smooth over where fill in would otherwise be needed. I get many complements on my manicure, and a family member even had to ask if those were my &amp;#34;natural nails.&amp;#34;  I have my hands in water a great deal, and am amazed by the durability of these nails.</li>
    <li> Came as expected and included small gift. I just forget that my hand are so small that most full coverage nails will not fit me. I can&#x27;t do a full set with the sizes provided.</li>
