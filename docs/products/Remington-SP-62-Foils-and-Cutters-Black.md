<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are worth the money that you spend for them.</li>
    <li> We were looking for this product in stores, but were unable to find it. It is exactly what my husband was looking for.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this product is acceptable but doesn&#x27;t fit the Microscreen 2 razor that I have. I have sent it back hope it fits someone else razor</li>
    <li> just what I wanted and needed</li>
    <li> Just be aware that these are completely different then what came with your razor.  The blades and foil width are considerably smaller.  You will notice it immediately!  But that wasn&#x27;t the main problem.  The real issue was that the foil just didn&#x27;t fit my older DA 307.  Even though the actual foil was smaller, the plastic was too wide.  If I tried to force it in the foil would bend.  Just wasn&#x27;t a proper fit.  May work with other models, but didn&#x27;t work with my classic 307.</li>
    <li> I like the razor and could not find refills in the dept. stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor is very easy to hold and does a good job</li>
    <li> Quick repair for old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Received (Prime) item in two days.</li>
    <li> The blade assembly I received for the SP-62 is not like the original.    It has been cheapened with fewer blades -- two rows of 19 blades instead of 28 blades as shown in the picture.  And it makes a big difference.  It takes far longer to shave and continues to miss areas. It&#x27;s about as good as the wornout 28-blade cutter.  I will be looking for a new shaver from another manufacturer altogether.</li>
    <li> The product was either an after market version or packaged incorrectly. The product was junk. It did not match the part being replaced and the shaver does not cut properly. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package for this replacement cutter, I thought maybe it was a cheap knockoff. The number of cutting edges was reduced by about a third compared to the original. The foil insert had an eighth-inch thick plastic frame around it which reduced the exposed foil area. Some obvious cost-cutting had occurred here. When I checked with Remington&#x27;s Customer Service Dept. they confirmed that the changes in the product were factory changes, though no explanation was offered as to why the changes were made. In practice, these parts fit and work OK, but I can&#x27;t help feeling a little cheated.</li>
    <li> Remington has changed the design of the SP-62 replacement foils and cutters and they do not even last one month now.  Amazon provides great service in getting the product out in a timely manner and I have absolutely no complaints with their service.</li>
    <li> The style of shaver head that was sent to me was not the correct shaver head as was advertised.  In trying to install it, the delicate construction (much more so than the original part) was damaged making it not returnable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Remington razor for a couple of years, and find that the replacement heads do a terrific job.  The price I paid can&#x27;t be beat...which is saying a lot in this time of inflated prices!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected!  Happy with purchase..</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because recently I purchased a Remington Electric Shaver. In about two months the foils broke and the cutters were exposed. Went back to the store where I bought the shaver and they did not had the replacement SP-62. So, either I threw the shaver in the trash or looked into Amazon inventory of items and found what I needed at about half the cost Remington advertised it !! I purchased 2 of them !!!</li>
    <li> We received the replacement foil and while we were on vacation the foil got a hole in it so we have to order another one.  The last one we received lasted the full 3 months maybe this was a defective item?</li>
    <li> The items were not packaged as picture showed so were not shipped together.  We called and it was resolved right away.  Worked fine for my razor and  good value.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this cutter set the screen said it was a discontinued item by Remington. So, I assumed that it would fit my older model DA307 shaver. Bad assumption. Guess I should have asked first.    What I received was the newly designed replacement cutter set - it does not fit my older DA307.    Fortunately I had recently purchased a new model DA307 as the older one is getting long in the tooth.    However, it was a diappointment. I won&#x27;t order from them again.    The discontinued note is now gone from this seller&#x27;s page, but it still suggests that it&#x27;s the old design -  it says \\&quot;Only 4 left\\&quot; as if they are running out of stock of the older design.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in the promised amount of time and is exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this same foil and cutter several times and they have all worked great. Now this one is COMPLETELY different. The cutter is smaller and the foil has small holes. Would not shave at all in my frazor. A complete waste or money and EXTREMELT high shipping costs. Will N EVER buy on Amazopn again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The blades and cutter were actually shorter than the ones I had. Also, the spring is not strong enough to press the blades up against the inside of the cutter, resulting in a less than satisfactory closeness of the shave. I guess you can say that I&#x27;m disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> These were bought for my brother.  They are good.,</li>
    <li> Needed them a long time............didn&#x27;t know where to purchase them. Good old Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works well. Way too much expensive. Cost just a little less than the whole shaver itself with screen and cutter.</li>
    <li> Razor is getting a little old and replacement blade kit is hard to find in stores. Amazon had it at a great price. Works great.</li>
    <li> Nothing covers my problem in the Amazon menu. I&#x27;ve been trying to contact someone  who can tell me what to do. for my problem listed below.I opened my SP 62 package, it looked completely different than the SP 62&#x27;s I   had been buying the last two years, after they  replaced the DF 10. I tried   them in the razor and I hard time fitting the cover over them, and shaved   with them, but they didn&#x27;t cut. It seemed like the cutter wasn&#x27;t getting   fully on my face.   I just read some of the reviews which say they were   fine. If I ask for a replacement, I wouldn&#x27;t want the same foil and cutter.   I could return yours and mine to show you the difference.    Although I&#x27;m not sure if the package they arrived in was yours or my old   one.  Can you give me any instructions on how to handle this ?    Thank you,    Dennis Long</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to be able to obtain spares / replacements for a manufacture discontinued electric razor. However, it appears that for some reason the &#x27;foil &amp; cutter&#x27; for this razor has been re designed. The new design makes the cutting width slightly smaller, this is not too much of a problem but does mean the old and the new &#x27;foil &amp; cutter&#x27; are not interchangeable. I accept there are now many so called new super electric razors on the market but after trying various new electric razors, some of which  were very expensive I still find my old &#x27;Remmington Micro Screen Two&#x27; one of the best providing that is the foil and cutter are regularly replaced.</li>
    <li> This cutter is misrepresented.  The cutter they sent us is a more cheaply made cutter and does not look like the one in the picture.  The old worn cutters work just as good as this new cutter does.  I will probably switch to Braun in the future because of Remington&#x27;s misleading practices.</li>
    <li> Actually this product is not what it appears.  The description calls for a replacement cutter and screen for (among others)the DA-370 Remington razor but the actual product shipped is the wrong size...obviously the wrong size.  It&#x27;s sad too as apparently the proper cutter and screen are no longer available.  Sad  as this is probably the best razor I have ever used. I tried to call it to Amazon&#x27;s attention but they couldn&#x27;t have cared less.  Sad!</li>
    <li> Glad I was able to find this as I didn&#x27;t want to have to replace the razor!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the new screen or blades yet but they look totally different from the old ones hope the blades don&#x27;t cut through the screen LOL</li>
    <li> This is a item , I used to be able to find at Walmart ,K-Mart and local drug stores. This item works just fine, and I could only find it at amazon.com.</li>
    <li> You are warned.  Do NOT waste your money on these replacement blades.  They do not look like or perform like the original blades.  Don&#x27;t know if they were redesigned by Remington or if they are cheap knockoff counterfeit blades being packaged and sold as Remington&#x27;s. Impossible to get even a mediocre close shave using these blades.  You&#x27;re better off continuing to use your old worn out blade while you look for a new shaver.  These blades are a major rip-off!</li>
    <li> My Remington Microscreen (DA 307) is getting old and I was so happy to find these replacement parts. I couldn&#x27;t find the parts in retail stores so I&#x27;m giddy to keep my old razor going.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price for this product (&lt;$20.00). The blades are styled a little differently than all the previous ones I have ever bought, but can&#x27;t tell any difference when I use my shaver. They look different than in the picture.</li>
    <li> I looked at several websites for these Remington foils/cutters; Amazon offered exactly what I was looking for at a good price.  I recommend this as an alternative to buying a new electric razor.</li>
    <li> I bought these items for a replacement for my son&#x27;s razor.  It was one of his Christmas presents!  He is happy with them.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy installation. Works as good as new. This is the second time I have ordered this replacement part for this razor. The quality is still excellent.</li>
    <li> The original cutter that came with the Remington shaver had more blades.  It simply cut better. The replacement SP-62 provides a comparable foil but the cutter is far inferior with less blades. Why would Remington retooled manufacturing to come out with an inferior product is anyone&#x27;s guess. The bottom line may be the driving force but if customers don&#x27;t buy Remington products, what happens to Remington&#x27;s bottom line? I am seriously considering buying a different brand shaver to avoid having to buy any more SP-62.</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t love the shaver, but the foils and cutters -- they are what they are and you can&#x27;t beat this price.  Great having them come to me regularly without worrying about them.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered Remington SP-62 Foils &amp; Cutters replacements and that is what was shown on the Amazon site but what was received in the package was not the SP-62 for my shaver.  Although the package was labled as an SP-62, it was something different and had to be returned to Amazon.  Not a good experience.</li>
    <li> Sp-62 Foil and cutter.    The price was outstanding and the product was as described. I got a excellent Deal and am satisfied.  This item purchased thru Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this item twice now, once last year and again this year, from these same folks with NO problem - got exactly what I ordered, cutter and foil, and at a  GREAT price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back again if the shaver lasts that long...  ;)</li>
    <li> At less than $8, this set is a great value.  It contains one of each of the following: screen, blades, and spring.  I couldn&#x27;t find this for less than $19 anywhere else.</li>
    <li> very good product great .  BUT when I placed the order it stated 3 pack ,  where&#x27;s the other 2 ??  the price I paid for 1 is the same as going straight to Remington and getting them . when I went back to the item description there&#x27;s no mention of packs  OR sets  . I only purchased this product because it stated 3 pack and  (( I though great this is  cheaper than going direct to Remington and its a 3 pack ))</li>
    <li> Not too much to say about this item, except that it fits the razor that I ordered it for and it does a fair job as far as shaving with it. I did not as I was removing the original and putting on this replacement that the replacement has about half the blades that the original had. I had bounced the razor and mangled one end of the foil on my originals. It kept \\&quot;biting\\&quot; me, but as long as I stayed away from that it was still shaving well. the replacement does shave me, but with more effort.</li>
    <li> I must use this production as my lifestyle.  I have different to find this production at my local store.  I know that at K-Mart have this production, but they was sold out.  I found this production in this site.  It is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Remington Microscreen 2 (DA 307) for years. It still works great, and I&#x27;ve been buying new screens and blades once a year, switching to Amazon last year when stores stopped selling them. This year the blade design was noticeably different - narrower overall, with a different shape for each blade. It didn&#x27;t shave nearly as closely as the old design, and now, after only three months, the redesigned blades have ripped a big flap off the screen, something I&#x27;ve never had happen before. Doesn&#x27;t Remington test their designs? If they do, they must know this is inferior. If they just want to motivate us to buy new razors, it worked, but my new razor won&#x27;t be a Remington.</li>
    <li> Cutter didn&#x27;t fit.  Spring didn&#x27;t fit.  Was able to use the foil which, fortunately, was what was bad on mine.  Mated my old cutter with new foil...time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not highly optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/19:  Old Cutter with new foil will not shave.  Done with that.  Guess I&#x27;ll save by money until I can buy the new, correct replacement for my old Braun 7526&#x27;s, of which I have two.  Both shave great, batteries are about done.  I believe they&#x27;re still the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had my DA-307 longer than I can remember (20+ yrs ?) but haven&#x27;t bought a replacement blade/screen for quite awhile because I couldn&#x27;t find them in a local store.  Then I checked the internet/Amazon and voila!  Got the best Internet price I could, but still paid too much (when considering the necessity of adding shipping) but a very noticable improvement in shaving performance AND especially comfort (niiice).  I am dissappointed that the new blade is not as wide as the original, but it&#x27;ll do (screen is the same).</li>
    <li> I have 2 Remington shavers (home and travel) that use this system,and have had others in the past 15 years or so.  They were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest foil &amp; cutter sets use a slightly differently shaped cutter, and the foil doesn&#x27;t seem to fit quite right on either of my shavers.  The result is that it takes me twice as long to shave, the system \\&quot;skips\\&quot; some whiskers much more often, and the foil manages to abrade my skin like it has tiny burrs all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total junk.  I&#x27;ll try one more set to see if they&#x27;ve solved the problems.  If not, my Remingtons go in the trash and I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> When you need a new blade, you need a new blade.  In order to maintain the superior shave of an electric (over a traditional razor blade) you&#x27;ve got to replace the heads periodically.  There&#x27;s a minor design flaw in these Remingtons in that the little spring for the cutters easily pops the cutters off when you&#x27;ve removed the foil to clean it.  When the tightly wound new spring pops, it really flies, and it&#x27;s tiny, and when you just woke up and lose this little tiny spring in your bathroom, it&#x27;s just gone, very very frustrating.  And, this package only comes with one spring, you can&#x27;t buy a single spring.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see this item available due to the difficulty in finding replacement blades and screens for my old, but trusty, Remington electric shaver.  When I first saw the blades in the package, I knew something was amiss.  The part number matched the old package (SP-62), but the blade looked different.  I managed to get the screen in with some difficulty, but it seems to work fine as does the spring.  The problem is with the blades.  They&#x27;re shorter in width than the older blades and do not hold on the \\&quot;mount\\&quot; where the blades attach to the shaver.  If I&#x27;m lucky, the blades will hold on just long enough for me to grab the cover and snap it into place.  Sometimes the blades pop off, occasionally with the spring in tow, and I have to start over again.  By chance if I get lucky and get the cover on, it seems to fit fine.  It makes no unusual sounds when it operation, but doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the older model/style of blade.  Due to the difficulty in messing with a blade device that barely stays on the shaver, I only clean it when I feel I absolutely have to.  My Remington shaver has been a trusty companion for many years but since I&#x27;ve had this problem (and it looks like this may be the only replacement blade available for such an old shaver) I won&#x27;t be buying this item again.  It may work well for more recent models, but not mine.  Cynically speaking, perhaps this is the manufacturers way of forcing people to buy a new electric razor in spite of the fact that the old one they currently own is in perfect working order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another major disappointment was the price.  Last time I bought this item at a local discount chain store (who no longer stocks them), the price was several dollars less.  At almost $19.00, I don&#x27;t consider this anything but overpriced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Remington man all my life (mid-30s) and am only on my third Remington razor--one of them because I dropped and broke it.  They&#x27;re the only thing that could shave my thick facial hair.  Replacement cutters have always been great, had to start buying them from Amazon when stores stopped carrying them.  Always had great luck.    Until they copped out on the latest design.  They \\&quot;narrowed\\&quot; the cutters by a blade on each side so it now takes much longer to shave, also the plastic saddle the blades sit in is reduces, and instead of a curved metal blade design they&#x27;re now tiny washers pressed onto a couple metal rods held by a tiny plastic piece.  Very disappointing, doesn&#x27;t work well, takes longer to shave, don&#x27;t expect the quality to last long.    May be time to consider the Braun my gal keeps telling me about.  Apparently an executive decision by Remington.  Poor job on the latest design.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the SP-62 replacement blade (and screen) since 1997. This product is made DIFFERENT. It is made in PRC JUNK. Yes, even try to disguise that it is made in China by putting made in PRC (people&#x27;s republic of china). The blades are farther apart (fewer blades) and cut poorly.</li>
    <li> Wish they would invent a razor that would shave as close as a raxor blade without distorting your face.  But this passes me 4 of 5 days.</li>
    <li> Did not fully fit the available space but was adequate and still functions well as a razor.  Always better than buying a whole razor replacement</li>
    <li> When I bought this, a real SP62 was shown in the picture. What I received is the one now shown in a replacement picture. It is narrower, with several fewer blades than a real SP62 and does not function nearly as well. Don&#x27;t wast your money on this piece of junk, it makes the shaver not worth using.</li>
    <li> Changed design from originals - shorter - so it takes longer to shave, and blades are spaced further apart - so the shave is not as smooth.  I dislike companies who fundamentally change their product - and market it under the same name.  The shaver I bought (DA-307) is not the same with these smaller less efficient blades.  When these get dull, it looks like I will have to get a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Typically, a redesign is better than the older design.  However, this one has fewer cutters, a smaller screen and is less efficient than the original.  I can&#x27;t seem to find the proper replacement with the correct nomber of cutters.  So long Remington...I guess I will be looking for a new shaver...</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for his Remington shaver but cheaper and easy to find than in retail stores.  can be tricky to replace and you have to be careful not to cut yourself replacing the blade part.  you first have to insert spring, then blades (must be level) then pop on screen.&lt;br /&gt;if your eyesight is lacking, you will need assistance replacing it, otherwise, works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Received it quick and in good packaging. Item was new and worked as expected. Fit my razor perfectly. I can no longer find this item in stores, so it was  much better than having to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> Product arrived earlier than scheduled and was brand new in its original packaging.  Good price and good company to deal with.</li>
    <li> Shaver works much better with new blades. The new cutter and head are not quite as wide as the original, but works well anyway</li>
    <li> I have an old remington DA-308 I have owned years. About once each year I buy a set of Foils and Cutters, from Amazon. Never fails each time I replace them it makes my electric razor shave me like new each time. :-)  Jeff</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00006IV46 Remington SP-62 Foils and Cutters]]I am in the process of ordering this product one more time. My past experience has been entirely satisfactory. Recommend.</li>
    <li> In 2010, Remington started giving us a new design of SP-62 without warning. It was a narrower design, and did not seem to cut as well. Further it was not the original design meaning pieces could not be mixed and matched. The result was a series of 1-star ratings after the product got mostly 4-5 star ratings. They have apparently gone back to the original screen but the cutter is still the new one. I find it takes me considerably longer to shave than I used to. There is nowhere else to go. I don&#x27;t like the feel of Norelco shavers, and Braun shavers are far too expensive. Using a razor encounters the chance of scraping my face. I will therefore stick with this brand but wish I could have something that could do the job quicker.</li>
    <li> They came on time - worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is not the same cutter as the original Remington part for SP-62. Performance seems OK, but it makes the shaver much louder.</li>
    <li> Found these for my dad on Amazon.  His foils had fallen apart on his favorite razor.  So, to Amazon I went to find a replacement for him.  Of course, Amazon had it in stock and my dad was very pleased.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> iF WHISKERS GET SOME LONG ONES TO CUT IT WON&#x27;T DO IT. SIDE CUTTER FAILS ALSO.</li>
    <li> It was a bit smaller than the original, but it worked just fine, as Remmington made a generic replacement set for several models.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 DA307 shavers in the past 6 years and liked them both.  I thought I would treat my 1 year old one to a new set of cutters --- big mistake!  Now it misses areas that I go over twice and takes a lot longer to shave.  It reminds me of the F3790 shaver that I quit using after a month.  I put the old cutters back in and am satisfied again.  This is my last purchase of anything Remington.</li>
    <li> This purchase saved me from buying a new shaver and the foils and cutters can be used on backup shavers I have.&lt;br /&gt;Price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> bought as extras just in case the foil breaks down quickly</li>
    <li> My cost for the replacement cutter head and cutter for the Remington was the correct price.  Pleased with the prompt delivery.&lt;br /&gt;It was a very smooth experience.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. A little less expensive than buying the whole razor again. Great razor though! Holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> These are the genuine article, I have bought replacement blades before only to find they were 1/3 the cutting blades and 1/2 the screen of the originals, these were perfect just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Purchased these last December and installed them after Christmas.  The cutter didn&#x27;t look the same as the original: it is a little shorter and has fewer blades spaced farther apart, but it fit perfectly and worked great.  The screen was what I really needed as the original one had worn through.  The screen was identical; it fit and worked perfectly until just recently (early October 2011) when it too wore through making a hole that bites/scratches if I&#x27;m not careful.  That&#x27;s over nine months of daily use.  I believe the recommendation is to replace at six months, so there&#x27;s no complaint here.  I just wish they were less expensive.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; shaver.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 90 year old father who has been nursing his old, reliable Remington for more than 30 years, and he was estatic upon opening the box.  Had just worn-out an aftermarket SP-62 acquired from somewhere in Canada that had a shorter foil - did not exend the full length of the cutters - that he had been using for several years.&lt;br /&gt;But this is new, old stock was received in great condition, and he was so thrilled that he called me (middle of the night here) when he received the box.</li>
    <li> After using several months only, the surface of foil was broken during shaving and made scratches in my face. Compared to the old ones, this new foil is too thin to be broken anytime while you are shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought these to have on hand, so when the factory foil, and cutter blade was wore out, I could re-place them. Great item to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it with remington.  The quality control or lack thereof is terrible.  The screens don&#x27;t hold up and that plastic assembly for the spring is a joke. Do yourself a favor, spend a few more bucks and upgrade to Braun.  I did.</li>
    <li> They seem to be of very good quality and perfect fit. This seems to be the only source for this product.</li>
    <li> the right product, good price, and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Not much to add to a simple item. It works with the razor. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny thought though. People who use non-electric razors... they&#x27;re hit with adds about 2 blades, 3 blades, teflon coated, etc. While shaving with blades, a man (or woman) can only cut so close. A close shave is just that... a close shave. You cannot get more whiskers or stubble without stripping skin. Bwahaha</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as the original foils did on the shaver.  I have two of the shavers and the comment is the same for both.</li>
    <li> I will answer the 3 &amp;#34;Consider:&amp;#34; questions first then I will give my opinion. Q. Why did you give this rating? I chose the lowest rating I could - you folks do not give me a negative minus stars option. Q. What did you like or dislike? I dislike the fact that the cutter blade is aprox. 25% shorter than the blade it is supposed to replace. I also dislike the fact that I was not able to force it onto the spindle. Who would you like to recommend this product to? Absolutely nobody!&lt;br /&gt;I still have the old SP-62 package that contained the last set I bought. It has the same bar code this one has but the cutter is not the same. It has been cheapened. Obviously, Remington has sold out to the Chinese. I have been a loyal customer of Remington for more than 40 years but I will never buy another Remington. I have installed the new foil with the old cutter and am using it until I can choose a new shaver.</li>
    <li> This makes an older shaver work and shave like new. It is remarkable however that they are almost as expensive as a new shaver. Kind of like toner!</li>
    <li> Shaver performance improved after replacement, which was quite simple.  Much cheaper than a new shaver, but the results are the same!</li>
    <li> i have looked for this part for a couple of years only to find them at near the cost of a new razor (40), this was a perfect fit and works like a new one</li>
    <li> The replacement SP-62 foils and cutters are easy to install on my Remington electric foil razor. The foils do wear out over time, and the price of these replacement foils and cutters from Amazon is much cheaper than buying a brand new electric razor every time the cutter foils wear out. To extend the life of these foils, you must use Remington&#x27;s FaceSaver Pre-shave powder sticks on your face prior to shaving. Any other electric preshave solutions, such as alcohol based solutions, will result in the foil wearing out very quickly. I have been using Remington foil electric shavers for many years, and purchasing these replacement foils and cutters extends the razors useful life.</li>
    <li> quick and easy to install,works great</li>
    <li> Got a much better shave after installing the new SP-62 foil, which was easy to install. Sure beats buying a whole new razor, although the cost of a new razor isn&#x27;t much more.</li>
    <li> The new foils and cutters made my old Remington shave like new again. What an improvement !!&lt;br /&gt;The new parts were well worth the time and money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only a razer blade @ screen, and it works! What more is there to rate?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OK with me.</li>
    <li> The parts arrived on time and in good condition.  My 100 year old relative installed them and he has no complaints.  (They were for him.)</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> This was the exact replacement for my Remington. I could not believe how much of an improvement of the shaving experience a new foil and cutter could generate!</li>
    <li> The foils and cutters were according to the order and met the specifications to give a good smooth shave.  While the foils can get holes in them  through much use, the razor can keep giving a good performance for several years; therefore it is good to get new foils as needed.</li>
    <li> Remington makes a great electric shaver and this was worth the purchase.  YES, I said this but I am changing my rave review to one of great disappointment. The electric razor is still working after a number of years but this replacement foil is not the same quality. It lasted about a year before the screen was worn out to the point where my face was all scratched up because of that thin foil wore out.  I didn&#x27;t see anything amiss but after I shaved one morning, my wife asked me about the scratch marks on my face. I looked in the mirror and because of the many long strokes, there was only one explanation. I went to my razor, passed my fingers along the surface and sure enough, a slight raising of worn out foil was protruding. A closer look at my face and neck and I saw ugly red swellings, more than a dozen, running up and down my face and neck, exactly according to the directions I always shave with the electric razor.</li>
    <li> my father was very pleased</li>
    <li> Not like those original Remington blade sets others point out. How do you make sure you get the good ones? I have no idea.....</li>
    <li> works as advertised... have purchased many.......not as original, but better than having to replace a perfectly good razor. been using them for years</li>
    <li> works as well as O E M great product and price and shipping</li>
    <li> These foil and cutters for the Remington razor are very good and they endure very well too.  They provide a nice smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> Great timing My dog grabbed my razor and tore the old foil. Amazon foil replacement was sitting on the porch. I didn&#x27;t have to go to work looking like a shaggy dog.</li>
    <li> Good product, have ordered repeatedly with great success.</li>
    <li> I purchased three shavers.  One of the foil screens was torn.  Very disappointing since the foil screens tear easily and was the only reason I purchased them.  I have used this model shaver for years and like it with the exception of the foil screen.</li>
    <li> An even better replacement than the original heads. The original head had less cutting edges and the replacement does a much better job.</li>
    <li> This is the only place that I could find the foil for my remington. Other places have them but for alot more $$$.  It&#x27;s to bad that Walmart, Target or other large box stores stopped selling it.  If you like you DA307 razor then this is the best price I found.</li>
    <li> Product was not in original packaging, but was just what we ordered and expected.  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> Full quality and functionality as always.</li>
    <li> This item is what I ordered and is right on the money, it fits my razor. I like the newer design compaired to the old style. I will order this again!</li>
    <li> Much better than the original cutters that came with my razor.  These have far more blades and it takes less time to get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> This product worked just fine.  Yes it does look different than the cutter that was in there.  Evidently the design has changed.</li>
    <li> Replaced foil and cutters on my F3800.  Contrary to some comments this is identical to the original - two rows of 25 blades. And, like the shaver, itself, was the best install I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a Remington product.  Just turn the cutter, remove spring and replace in reverse order.  The foil, tho similar to the first Remingtons, is far easier. Spring clips on the ends now hold an assembly.  Just pinch and extract inwards.  To replace push the new assembly in from the bottom and remove the protective foam.</li>
    <li> easy to change.  Does feel like a new razor.  I will see how long it stays sharp.</li>
    <li> This is not the same as original equipment-- the blade assembly is shorter in this replacement leading to more shave time needed to do my face. But it does a fine job never the less. Screen and spring are just like original and it beats having to discard the electronic components by buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> The REMINGTON SP-62 FOILS AND CUTTERS are skin friendly and efficient. However, they don&#x27;t last very long, and usually the foil must be replaced even though the cutter is still good. The cutter should come with two foils instead of just one. When you shave, try to be as smooth as you can to protect both, your skin and the foil. It is recommended to buy at least two or three replacements when you order, unless you have an extra shaver at hand (but if you do, don&#x27;t forget to charge it!). There may be other good products in the market, but when I tried Remington many years ago it worked for me so I keep using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these and returned it thinking it was the wrongs size, but after my second one came in the mail it took me 5 seconds to realize I returned it for nothing.</li>
    <li> I have an old Remington Razor and found this on line after searching through stores in my area that used to carry it.  It was delivered in a couple of days and I have the Amazon Prime so I didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping or handling.  Very happy with the product.  Exactly what I have been searching for.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend cannot find replacement parts for his clippers anywhere, but on Amazon. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Great price and easy to replace. Bought as gift and told it works like brand new!!! Saved myself from buying him brand new razor. Cleaned up his old one, put in new blades and added a bow.</li>
    <li> Factory Replacement at 20% discount</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the OEM version but it works.</li>
    <li> Works great when new, however, dulls really quickly.  Recommendations to change every 3 months, but feel like It should be changed more frequently.</li>
    <li> Did what it needed to do. Fit one of my shavers but had trouble with the other I had. Works fine, but for a couple of extra bucks I can get a replacement shaver. Still, it was cheaper and two of mine work fine, so no real complaints.</li>
    <li> very good  will shop again,thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and my shaver works like new.</li>
    <li> I changed for a Braun now and love it so much more than my old Remington.</li>
    <li> It was fast!and they fit!</li>
    <li> need to find the Replacement cutters and heads&lt;br /&gt;•For Shaver Model F3790  only</li>
    <li> It is not cutting any better than the one I replaced it with.  Guess I just need to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> Worked well ... for a few weeks. Then the screen all to quickly got a hole in it. The blade seems like decent quality, but the screen seems to be of a much lower quality than the original, which lasted me years. Then again, I suppose it could be the blade that&#x27;s at fault, and it damaged the screen. Either way, the replacement is not working out for my DA 307.</li>
    <li> A different shape from the original and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  It also made the clipper on the shaver sound very loud when in use!</li>
    <li> we will definitely get this again when he needs them</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these foils and cutters for this old of a shaver. Glad I can still get them here.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that the price is a little high for such an old razor.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> needed a new screen for my razor and works great</li>
    <li> nice to have a new blade without buying the whole razor</li>
    <li> Good to go works just like new.</li>
    <li> Get this routinely for father in-law.  Glad to be able to get parts as he wouldn&#x27;t stand for any different shaver.</li>
    <li> I rated this product a 3 star for the following reasons.  The shaver is fairly new and the foil started coming apart exposing the sharp blades inside.  I cut myself with it before I noticed!  So I felt it had failed prematurely.  I only wanted to replace the foils, but they are only sold as a kit with a new set of cutter blades!  I wish I could have just bought the foil only.  This shaver works very well and cost very little, but now I&#x27;ve nearly doubled my original purchase price due to their strategy of not inferring the foils separately.!</li>
    <li> Seems to have resuscitated the old razor, though I&#x27;ve wondered for years why these replacement cutters and foils have to cost nearly half as much as all new equipment. Begs the question &#x27;is it worth replacing parts, when you know the battery eventually won&#x27;t hold a charge?&#x27; Well, I don&#x27;t shave all that often anyway - but these did make a difference.</li>
    <li> Good product, no complaints.  Will buy another when needed.  Works great and gets the job done.  Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These parts make my shaver perform like brand new. I am completely satisfied. The installation was simple. The packaging was a little difficult to open.</li>
    <li> The product never arrived and I received no response to two follow up messages to the company.  Very dissappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> The cutters are slightly smaller in length but still cut well with the foil. You can see this in the picture. Therefore , the cutting width on your face is smaller (as seen in the picture). My foils always fail at the extreme ends. Since cutter does not reach this area, the smaller cutter may prolong the life of the foil. A source that used to sell these in bulk for $5 each now charges the same higher price. I have used a Remington double headed razor for about 30 years now. Close , smooth shave that does not irritate skin like a blade.</li>
    <li> This is from the manufacture, but it actually works better then the orginal as it has been improved. There is less cutters so they stay clean longer</li>
    <li> excellent product to up date my shavers that are in good shape except for the foil had a bad spot in the surface metal. now I am back to a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Great price and super quick shipping.  And most importantly the new parts work perfectly.  It is like having a new razor.  I highly recommend this item and vendor!</li>
    <li> exact replacement parts, just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I saw comments about this replacement having fewer blades and not fitting well. My replacement is for the F-3790 shaver, and the replacement actually has more blades than my original. The parts all fit together just as they should. Flimsy, yes, but what do you expect? I&#x27;d give it five stars except for the price. I guess they really want to straddle a fence between making it possible to keep an old shaver going and enticing you to buy a new one. But it&#x27;d be good to get one of these replacements for ten bucks.</li>
    <li> These replacements cost almost as much as my entire razor when I bought it new.  The original foils weren&#x27;t all that great, even when they were new.  The new ones performed adequately, but still did not provide a &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; shave.  Then some lady at a rummage sale simply GAVE me a Norelco 8240XL cordless triple-header rotary razor that nobody had ever bothered to clean out.  After a good cleaning it was good as new, and gives me the best and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve had in my 40+ years of shaving.  So the replacement foils and cutters were a waste of money.  Know anyone who needs a good inferior shaver?</li>
    <li> Good item, works well.  I would recommend this item to replace worn out razor screens.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased this item from Remington. The price I paid here was at least half as much as Remington&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my father - since he could not find them in the retail stores.  It arrived in just a few days - and is exactly what he was looking for!</li>
    <li> Excellent but delicate. Prone to break if not cleaned regularly. Does not do a 3 day beard but trimmer first works.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product,price, service and packing, many thanks.  Gerald.</li>
    <li> The ad on this site says it is for DA 307 shaver but it doesnt work on my shaver. I compared it to the one Im replacing and the new one is totally different. Maybe there is a different model 307 that it works on but I dont think so cause why would they use the same # for a totally different shaver?</li>
    <li> These are the right screens and cutters for the Remington F3800 series razors. No retail stores near me carry these things. The screens don&#x27;t last long but the razor does. So, thanks Amazon for making these parts so easily available. Price and speed of delivery were good.</li>
    <li> Bought this item before, works just like new!</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Third screen on razor, first one a piece cracked off, second was my fault- dropped razor, third - here&#x27;s hoping...</li>
    <li> Pretty good timing and the correct parts.  I was able to quickly find, order, and receive the parts for my razor</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t have too many back ups!.</li>
    <li> my husband loves these</li>
    <li> works!. They are not like an OEM part, but they do work. No issues, no worries.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Shaver performs good as new.</li>
    <li> Quality and arrival time excellent. Pricing excellent.</li>
    <li> The price is good and it Last a long time. I buy this Item for my father in law because this is what works for him. A bad day for me will be if I make a mistake when I place his order. I learned my lesson Remington SP-62 is engraved in my mind.</li>
    <li> Great quality... quick delivery</li>
    <li> This was a good find since my husband&#x27;s razor badly needed help.  The  product is as advertised and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutters were reasonably priced and arrived in a timely manner.  Everything was just as advertised.</li>
    <li> The new foil for my shaver saved me the expense of buying a new shaver.  Love it, good price too.</li>
    <li> The foil is far thicker than the original foil for my DA307 model. Therefore it doesn&#x27;t even cut my facial hair.  I am forced to keep this purchase simply because I needed both a new cutter and foil, truly false advertising/ poor engineering; the cutter works, so far. While I look for another shaver, no sense in paying for 2 sets of defective replacement parts for the same price, I am struck by the number of poor ratings that this product has received. My bad - next time I&#x27;ll read the reviews, noting about 50% gave a 1 or 2 of 5 (quite an inverse bell curve for reviews). Oh Yes, The replacement spring works great!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised but the price is higher than like. It is what I had expected and as a result, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of blades and screens back in December,2009 and they are still working fine! I should point out that I own several electric shavers of various brands and types (corded, cordless, rotary heads, etc.) and use them all at different times. Still, I have averaged about three shaves a week with my Remington for the past three years, and that says a lot for these SP-62&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe keeping the shaver clean and using preshave lotion helps, or maybe my beard is not quite as tough as others, but the fact remains: Remington shavers have always performed and lasted very well for me, and still remain my favorite over other brands!</li>
    <li> All as expected! fast shipping.</li>
    <li> We bought this Remington razor refurbished and it&#x27;s better than a new one. As long as we can get this SP-62, we&#x27;re happy.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these this purchase.  The first one had a defective screen, one half of the screen had a crease in it, that turned into a razor blade immediately. These screens tend to wear out and when they do, holes appear in the screen and become very sharp edges that cut and scrape.  This new one came out of the package that way.  Since the postage is as much as the cost of the item, it is just another of those bad experiences.</li>
    <li> The screen fit but cutter did not ,sat to low in cradle. I think cutter was out dated.would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Good foil, bad cutter.  The foil works fine, but I noticed that the new cutter was noisier and generated a lot of extra heat while shaving, no matter which foil was installed. More heat means more friction, which will wear out the parts faster. Also after 4 months I was cleaning the cutter and it popped off the little peg and wouldn&#x27;t stay put on the peg after that--it wore out.</li>
    <li> I bought similar foils and cutters in the past which was supposed to be as good as factory, but only lasted a few weeks instead of the advertised months. I only buy the real thing now and I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Right product.  Working great.  Gives a good close shave.  Expect to get a year of shaving from this product.</li>
    <li> The cutter is actually a tad bit smaller (length wise) than the originals, however they seem to work just as well. Wally-world stopped carrying them, so luckily I found them here. The shaver still has a lot of life left in it and with these replacements I can keep using it.</li>
    <li> Just want to thank the guys who wrote reviews for this- I bought a screen with blades from another vendor and what they supplied didn&#x27;t fit my DA307 at all. You guys just saved me the trouble of ordering one of these and being disappointed again. That DA307 is the best electric razor- too bad they don&#x27;t &#x27;make em any more like they used to.&#x27;</li>
    <li> This product is an exact replacement. It was easy to find on the website. It arrived in a timely fashion , and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;What more can one ask ?  Buchmann</li>
    <li> They are a good replacement for my razors.</li>
    <li> THE PART WAS NOT LIKE THE OLD ONES. VERY CHEAP AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY. REMMINGTON SHOULD BE ASHAMED WHAT THEY DONE TO THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I had used a Remington for many years, replacing the foils and cutters once or twice a year.  Then Remington decided to downgrade the quality (and probably cost) by reducing the cutters and cheapening the foil.  Last foil broke while I was using the razor, providing a sharp edge to scratch/cut my face.  I could not order the better replacement any longer and switche to a new Braun.  Very happy with my decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my electric shaver for five years and this is the first time I changed the blades. Fast shipping, works great thank you</li>
    <li> Easy to install, fits perfectly, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> great shaver replacement heads, good price!</li>
    <li> does the job well...use it repeatedly..durable, dependable</li>
    <li> I need to replace my head on my razor about once a year. The razor just keeps on running after several years.</li>
    <li> Would only cut to a stubble regardless of how long I worked at it, and the stubble was easily visible. I also tried one of Remington&#x27;s new razors with the round cutting heads -- same result. I&#x27;ve owned Remington razors for years and years, and my father before me. With this, I&#x27;ve switched to another brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just glad I can still buy these foils/cuttes for my old shaver.  The MS2-290 I bought  to replace my DA is a piece of junk, won&#x27;t hold a charge  for even an entire shave (remember the commercial &amp;#34;I liked the razor so much, I bought the company?).  Well, they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to. All you complainers out there (the cutter is shorter than it used to be, waah waah) should just deal with it.  Really, I can&#x27;t tell and difference in &amp;#34;shave time&amp;#34; with these cutters.</li>
    <li> Two week delivery!&lt;br /&gt;Cutter fits fine but screen is too short for both of my razors.</li>
    <li> I purchase these for my 90yr old grandfather because he can no longer find them in stores. He loves these and we are always happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged and improved shaving as my old one was over six months of use.</li>
    <li> Just what my razor needed.</li>
    <li> The local stores have stopped stocking replacement razor heads.  The alternative is to buy a new electric razor when the head gets worn.</li>
    <li> I could have bought a new shaver and junks the old one but it still works so this was perfect</li>
    <li> Just as good as the original</li>
    <li> Works well.  Wish they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> purchase this for $15 and the whole NEW razor and blades is only $18.40</li>
    <li> I liked and have bought this item from Amazon before.  It is cheaper to order the screen only but I am sure I will purchase this again too.</li>
    <li> Have been using Remington shavers for years.  Easy to clean and holds a great charge.  Great product, and very affordable.</li>
    <li> Replacement was perfect.</li>
    <li> Was real glade to be able to get this item. So I even got two. It came right on time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> THE IDEA OF ATTACHING BLADES TO A SPRING IS SO STUPID!  YOU TAKE OFF THE COVER, BRUSH THE COVER-FINE.  THEN, YOU ACCIDENTLY TAP THE BLADE AND IT FLYS OFF AND DOWN THE DRAIN!  THAT IS THE ON LY REASON I GOT IT----TO GIVE THE RAZOR A SECOND CHANCE.  3 DAYS LATER---BYE BYE AND HELLO NORELCO!</li>
    <li> Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Gre at show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed at a reasonable price. Fast delivery. Works fine. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just wish it was a little cheaper.  For $5.00 more you can get a new razor.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut as well as original, also head is smaller. I have a DA307.</li>
    <li> Fits nicely. Gave a good shave with a 2 day growth. Just move head in circles to maximize cutting of whiskers.</li>
    <li> we received the two that we purchased.  Seems as though one of the foils has a small hole in to so it doesn&#x27;t work properly ...... haven&#x27;t opened the other one ... but the cutters work great, just used the old foil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fit and it works, what else you want me write ?</li>
    <li> It is like having a new shaver.  I did not realize how dull my old cutters were.</li>
    <li> I got it at a very good price (less than $16.00). It lasts over 6 months, up to 9-10. That&#x27;s fine!</li>
    <li> I had holes in the foil but liked the razor, so replacement foils are the thing to buy!!  I hate buying new razors!!</li>
    <li> The electric razor by Remington that my husband uses needed replacement parts... I was hoping that these were the correct ones. They are, and his razor is working much better than it was with the older (and damaged from wear) parts. In fact, both of his razors use these replacement parts, and in the near future we will be purchasing another set of these Foils and Cutters for his other razor. I recommend these parts as a replacement for your Remington razor, too. (Check the make and model of your razor to assess which Foils and Cutters you need.)</li>
    <li> This was for my son first razor and it has worked fine &#x27; It came fast thank you for your service</li>
    <li> The fit seems to be a little loose for the foil, so I question whether it&#x27;s specifically designed for my razor.</li>
    <li> This product i rec.the Remington sp-62foils and cutter fits great and works like it should i would recomend it to anyone</li>
    <li> One of the two foils was slightly bent when it was received and now less than 45 days since it was received and used, the foil is now torn. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase and the speed of delivery</li>
    <li> Got these for my Grandpa who doesn&#x27;t want to switch shavers and can&#x27;t find them anywhere else. He says they work great but I think the price is to high and cheaper to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electrics most of my life (in my 70s). For about 35 years I have been using a Norelco rotary first--it gets the long stuff off quickly but not close--then finish with a foil-type--it gets what&#x27;s left, close. My observation/strategy is that I pay around $15 to $25 for a new shaver (discontinued model, usually), and never buy the replacement heads/screens as they cost more (double?) than an entire new shaver. I recently bought a Remington F3790 foil shaver on sale for $13, but see that the replacement foil-cutter kit costs $16 and up. This strategy is patently wasteful--discarding a working razor--but makes sense from a financial point of view.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington products for years and find they work well for me.  I know there are a lot more expensive and sophisticated products out there, but when I have something that does the job for me, I stick with it unless the quality drops.  So far I&#x27;ve had no issues with these parts or the shaver.</li>
    <li> same as all ways, factory original</li>
    <li> They worked better than the original set.</li>
    <li> We have these on auto order because they wear out every few months. Super that we can get them so easily!</li>
    <li> After reading certain other reviews I was concerned that I would be disappointed. However, I am pleased to report that the new cutter and screen work just as well as the originals and maybe even better. I get a very smooth, close shave and would recommend these to others. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> just what I needed....works great</li>
    <li> The cutters are definitely shorter on the ends than their predecessors. The other reviews are correct, I compared the new cutter against the old one in my shaver. Foil seems to be the same. As far as I can tell, works as expected, I haven&#x27;t noticed the missing cutters in terms of performance.</li>
    <li> I love these screens. They give me a nice close shave every morning.</li>
    <li> This foil and cutter system really do give a nice, close shave with no pain but the lifespan is fairly short which is a problem.  They usually die right when you are getting ready for an important event.</li>
    <li> So glad these parts were still available.  My husband is very specific when it comes to shaving and this by far has been the best shaver. Reliable, dependable and always with a nice clean cut. Always have the best of luck when looking on Amazon for our needs.</li>
    <li> I need this specific type of foils and cutters updated on my electric shaver every few weeks.  It works great on my shaving every day and I&#x27;m glad I can still get these on my old Remington electric shaver from you!</li>
    <li> Good quality and price.</li>
    <li> After installing the replacement parts my shaver works like a new one.It&#x27;s a good deal. I&#x27;ts like buying a new machine.</li>
    <li> as long as you replace the head with the mesh top you are okay. if you go on the remington site you will see that they clearly state that this new head and mesh top are slighter smaller in size than the original one, so if you only replace the head and use the old mesh top, not only will you get a lousy shave but you will be nicking yourself with each motion of the shaver. Once we replaced the mesh head with the new head we have had no problems since. smooth shaving all the way!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not as good as the original but good enough and does the job. for that reason 4.5/5 installation was quick and easy. they should last a very long time</li>
    <li> Perfect fit works great.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly thick beard and Remington foils/cutters would last me 6 months.  With manufacturing now moved to PRC, I get only 3 months!  I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if the cost was halved too, but it&#x27;s not!  Come on Remington give us the product we are paying for!</li>
    <li> Good replacement parts. Works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cutter to fit the razor I currently have, and over a year back I replaced a very old razor to fit a supply of these cutters I had. This time-tested cutter design still seems to work well. My biggest complaint is that it is too hard to open their plastic packaging, although I recognize the need for strong product protection and safety while handling the packaging. Including an extra spring is good because it sometimes gets lost.</li>
    <li> I originally just wanted the foil so I said ok and replaced heads to. Glad I did my razor was getting dull, so that was a great package deal!!!</li>
    <li> Great for my dad who refused to replace his old Remington with a new one. Saved a bunch of money here rather than buying from the Remington website.</li>
    <li> NUNCA ME LLEGO; I NEVER RECIVED IT; NO LO RECIBI; NO TUVE NOTICIAS DEL PRODUCTO; NO PUEDO DECIR MAS NADA</li>
    <li> I only needed a foil, but my only option was to buy this set for almost as much as the cost of the razor.  The new foil only lasted a little over 5 months of light use (I only grow a goatee).  A much older, boxy, Remington last years without a problem (and it could stood on its side, to save shelf space). I would pay thrice the price to be able to buy one like that again.  Time to switch brands, again.</li>
    <li> It is needed to keep a good razer running to have replacement cutter heads and foils. These are them and will not be availabe for long.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have been looking for a replacement shaver and i finally got it. So thanks Amazon for keeping me happy and my wife hands on me.</li>
    <li> As others have commented, this blade is shorter than the previous blade. Makes it a little difficult to get up next to the ears. Don&#x27;t know why they reduced the blade length, unless it was to save a few pennies on manufacturing cost. Otherwise it seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> Part is too wide and does not function properly.</li>
    <li> The product was short the springs that normally are included.  I am disappointed that the picture on the web included 3 items and when the shipment arrived it was not as specified in the picture on the web.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Th right screen and blades replacements for the electric shaver!</li>
    <li> Remington shaving head cutter is user friendly...</li>
    <li> Restored my shaver to original shaving condition, BUT I still wish Remington would bring back the ES-1000 Bump Control&lt;br /&gt;or something similar to the old flathead &amp;#34;Blackman&#x27;s&amp;#34; shavers that they used to make---NONE of the &amp;#34;new &amp; improved&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;shavers that I have tried of the years by ANY manufacturer seems to quite do the trick for me as well as those old&lt;br /&gt;shavers did. I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; various brands and types for over 25 years! I still have 1 ES-1000 Bump Control shaver that still&lt;br /&gt;works, but the head set has seen it&#x27;s better days</li>
    <li> I have reviewed these products. They work great.</li>
    <li> wish the blade replacement wasn&#x27;t the same cost as buying a whole new rayzor. If you have a frys near you they have the best price and availability for blades replacement and best price for rayzor replacement as well as price of both is the same.</li>
    <li> I emailed Remington to ask how many cutting blades the SP-62 replacement has.  At first they dodged the question, so I wrote back.  Then they admitted \\&quot;The SP-62 has been redesigned so it has less cutting blades.\\&quot;  The original cutter has 28 blades, and that&#x27;s what the photo on their own website currently shows.  But photos on Amazon and elsewhere show only 19 blades on the \\&quot;redesigned\\&quot; cutter, confirmed by some Amazon reviews.  Maybe Remington thought customers wouldn&#x27;t notice or care.  I will never buy another Remington product.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent replacement...</li>
    <li> Sp-62 will fit shaver head, but leaves a gap between foil and razor head. This will not give a close cut. Should have ordered sp-63.</li>
    <li> These last a long time and give a great close shave.  I haven&#x27;t had any tear or wear out.  I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, though.</li>
    <li> Fits the razor that I&#x27;ve had for about 15, 20 years great. The only thing is the foil wasn&#x27;t easy to put into the frame. The last one I had which was the same type went it just fine so I might have just been this one.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect, are sharp, good length and are stainless</li>
    <li> The thinness of the screen is a bessing and a curse because it will rip before the cutter dulls. I&#x27;ve had to buy a few in this razor&#x27;s lifetime so maybe looking into a new razor.</li>
    <li> I read scores of and sometimes hundreds of reviews before purchasing most items whether in stores or online. Went to see if the SP-62 replacements were available and was surprised to see they WERE and were so inexpensive. After a quick scan of these reviews and an actual comparison of the 12-year-old Remington SP-62 replacement package I just opened, it was obvious that the item shown here is NOT an adequate replacement. Check out the Amazon item #B000BKSI9E if you&#x27;re looking for the same quality that came with the shaver. Unfortunately, at the time of this review it&#x27;s priced around $40 but will at least equal the quality of what the user is used to. At that price, it may be time to look for a new shaver. Those reviewers who compared the number of cutter blades on this item to that of the original are dead on -- 19 versus 28 on the original. This MUST make a difference and leads to the poorer ratings. No thanks, on this one, Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- item #251478246071 on that \\&quot;other\\&quot; auction site (as of the time of this edit) shows the exact same packaging I purchased years ago. It can be had for $19. On the back of my packaging it says \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; and has a copyright of 2001. The items enclosed were exactly the same as the replacements I&#x27;d put in DA-757 Remington 12+ years ago. Reviews on the Amazon item #B000BKSI9E I referenced above make it seem like even that item does not have the same quality as the original replacements by Remington. Even Remington&#x27;s own website has complaints about the ones sold directly from their online store these days.</li>
    <li> The screen and spring fit well. The cutters are short 2 blades on each side than the original. It does the job but your going to get shorter.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are complaining about. It seems to work as well as the old one that got damaged. It &#x27;s not quite the same , but it does the job.  If you need closer shave , use a razor and some shaving cream !!</li>
    <li> Fits as it was suppose to and I received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Everything was delivered on time with no problems. It was put in a huge box though, it was kind of a waste of paper.</li>
    <li> It was time for a replacement of my foil and shaver head. This unit fits shaver well, no problems with use,</li>
    <li> The replacement part is OK, but does not shave as well as the original part, which even looks a little different.</li>
    <li> It fit my razor and provided a close shave.</li>
    <li> Far more blades than the original set. I get a better shave than the blades that came with my clippers, yet it doesn&#x27;t eat my face up like the far more expensive ES-Lt41 Arc3 shaver that I purchased. A truly good shave for my skin.</li>
    <li> thanks i enjoy doing business with you all,keep up the good work.the iitem was in good shap, every thing was on time</li>
    <li> The foils give closer shaves than competitors and last about three months for me. To get the most life from the foil I oil it frequently.</li>
    <li> I have gotten other ones that did not fit correctly. This one does. It has served well and one it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> The foil did not lay flat in the middle.&lt;br /&gt; The two plastic end catches did not work properly.&lt;br /&gt; Very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> These replacement parts are often hard to find locally, but AMAZON makes it easy and with unbeatable  prices.  If you have to shave, buy accessories isn&#x27;t a problem here.</li>
    <li> The design is a little different than the original one.  It seems to work okay according to my son.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and no problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Remmington shaver for ages now and with these replacements, I find it will probably last indefinitely, or until the motor burns out...Highly recoment them.....</li>
    <li> Not great, but gets the job done. As others have noted, this product seems the result of cost cutting. The cutter and foil are smaller than the original, and the foil doesn&#x27;t stay in place as easily. I like my razor, so I&#x27;ll keep using it, but it seems like they want us to buy new products rather than keep using old ones, even though the old ones work fine.</li>
    <li> Works fine and is a great help.</li>
    <li> needed these to keep my old razor going&lt;br /&gt;thanx</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine. The blade is just a bit shorter than the original. I have used it for a few months now and again it works fine but already seems to be getting a little dull.</li>
    <li> Being wedded to the older Remington shavers, these foils fit perfectly in the shaver.  I do not know yet how long they will last..</li>
    <li> Good price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be direct from Remington, for the DA-307, but they have made the usable width of screen smaller, and the cheap plastic frame bigger. I am sure they save a penny on the steel this way,  but the screen is jammed into my shaver,  slightly crumpling one side of the foil. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> smaller than the original</li>
    <li> I had trouble getting the foil screen to fit but with some persistent effort got it in.  It&#x27;s a little wrinkled but functional.  The blades r much shorter than the original and it pops out every time I take the head off to clean.  However, it shaves fine and was much less than buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Carefully packed, fast delivery. I needed a replacement blade and head for my razor and it wasn&#x27;t easy to find. I am happy I found it here and my shaves are comfortable again. If you have the same Remington razor, Amazon is as good a place as any to get replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Just as described, arrived in good condition.  Thanks.</li>
