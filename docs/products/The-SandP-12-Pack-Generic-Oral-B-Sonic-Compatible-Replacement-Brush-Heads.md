      <li>these fit the Oral-B toothbrush and it is great because the name brand has been discontinued but my electric toothbrush still works.</li>
      <li>I was kinda holding my breath as I was wondering if these would be suitable replacement heads or not.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased when the new head fit perfectly on toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Ok, if you don&#x27;t want to buy another brush</li>
      <li>Would buy more.</li>
      <li>ughhh most of the brushes we cracked and damaged.</li>
      <li>Would rather pay more for better quality</li>
      <li>I need to change them more often, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>And they work just as well as the Oral-B brand which can run 3 times as much or more in the stores.</li>
      <li>Otherwise ok</li>
      <li>Good as the real ones</li>
      <li>pretty good knock off of the original oral b brush heads at a tenth  of the price.</li>
      <li>They fall apart really easily.</li>
      <li>everything else is just fine</li>
      <li>Fits our brush motor just fine seems to work well.</li>
      <li>The brush work fine and  the price is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Came promptly and fit.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Brush heads fit my machine.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t quite fit as OEM ones.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my Oral B Sonic as stated.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit my electic toothbrush.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t fit toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They do fit my Oral B Sonic but leave a gap between the bottom and the body of the Oral B. About 1/3 inch.</li>
      <li>Wish they were available again.</li>
      <li>The heads fit the brush and it works, but bristles tend to come out easily on the one I am using right now.</li>
      <li>Sure I can return the unopened packages, that is if I didn&#x27;t have to open to SEE IF IT FIT!</li>
      <li>I ordered and package arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Thought it was a great deal for the quantity and price but not worth it.</li>
      <li>The brush heads are a good tight fit.</li>
      <li>A real bargain!</li>
      <li>so they last more than a month.</li>
      <li>but I think you would be better to spend the extra dollars to replace you</li>
      <li>Good value but fits a bit too snugly and a bit stiff.</li>
      <li>Much more tight than the original Oral-B brush heads.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and exactly what I needed!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
      <li>These are just as good and last every bit as long as the name brand.</li>
      <li>The brushes appear very well made as the OEM.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, and you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Not a perfect fit but works and a good price</li>
      <li>These heads may be a tiny bit softer than the original Oral-B replacement</li>
      <li>The replacements are as described by vendor and perform as well as the original Oral-B type but at a vastly reduced cost.</li>
      <li>They should get a 5 star but fit a little to loosely on the handles locating shaft and make a buzzing sound while brushing.  </li>
      <li>I have a really old electric tooth brush.  </li>
      <li>Also, the first couple of times I brushed my teeth with it, some of the bristles came loose in my mouth.</li>
      <li>Hard to fit on wand.</li>
      <li>I would give this a five star except that the brushes were made by a different company than the manufacturer and did not fit exactly the same.</li>

    <li> It works, but it fits very tightly on the toothbrush. Much more tight than the original Oral-B brush heads. I have to force it in to the handle. Also, the first couple of times I brushed my teeth with it, some of the bristles came loose in my mouth. But after a few times it stopped happening. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Cheep with good quality!</li>
