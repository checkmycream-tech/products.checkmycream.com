      <li>The swiveling cord is amazing as is the temp control.</li>
      <li>This gives me really nice waves</li>
      <li>I purchassed this one under the recommendation of 2 of my sisters who are cosmetologists, and my wife has so far been very happy with it.</li>
      <li>and so far is working great!</li>
      <li>It was a great iron,  just to large in diameter for my length of hair.</li>
      <li>i love the material as it does not damage my hair</li>
      <li>I love the adjustable temp, and swivel cord.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
      <li>the different heat settings are great!</li>
      <li>love the looks of it.</li>
      <li>love that there are heat choices and that it has a swivel cord.  </li>
      <li>Again, i cant say too much about it because i am no persanally using it, but it has sure bade her happy</li>
      <li>my favorite iron to use, gives me the glamour curls that I love.</li>
      <li>i LOVE this curling iron.</li>
      <li>Love this curling iron.  </li>
      <li>It feels nice and smooth on my hair when curling.</li>
      <li>It looks very nice, and heats up insanely fast.</li>
      <li>I have hair that is almost to my waist and thought this product would be the perfect size, but apparently not.</li>
      <li>holds my hair that is pretty stay for a good chunk of the day.</li>
      <li>so doesn&#x27;t pack easily.</li>

      <li>Heats quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron before, but chose this one because I was impressed by the temperature controls this product offers, as well as its reputation as a professional&#x27;s tool.  </li>
      <li>Really good curling iron that makes my difficult hair look great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably try the flat iron instead, since THAT product has the ceramic plates on BOTH sides - maybe that will glide through my hair more easily (and without removing hair in the process!!).</li>
      <li>I have to keep an eye on it to make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally move it too hot.</li>
      <li>I liked my new curly iron.</li>
      <li>Great for loose beachy waves.  </li>
      <li>Gets super hot, gives great curls instantly.</li>
      <li>This one is much more easy to use use than the marcel and creates great curls that last all day long.</li>
      <li>It heats quickly.  </li>
      <li>The large cool tip at the end makes it easy to hold while curling.  </li>
      <li>This curling iron gets HOT!</li>
      <li>I found it easy to use and loved the lowest heat setting, since I have baby-fine hair, BUT I found myself pulling a few hairs out</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Hot tools is really the best of curling irons, even for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>has a nice, long cord.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with this product because I can make a lot of different looks with the larger barrel!</li>
      <li>so it is a good one and the size gives me good wavey curls, not too tight, not super curly.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it was clicking at each temperature or if it wasn&#x27;t so loose.</li>
      <li>It gets really hot.  </li>
      <li>It falls off and lands on the hot iron and there is no auto shut off.</li>
      <li>Just used it for the first time.  </li>
      <li>but I think they all come with warranties, so if you buy this curling iron, I encourage you to keep the box and warranty so that you can return it to Hot Tools.</li>
      <li>I already have a 2&amp;#34; hot tools curling iron and a 1.5&amp;#34; marcel.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s my technique, but I finally gave up trying to use it, as the snap top kept pulling out hair.  </li>
      <li>She uses it everyday and says it is a good product.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m such a huge fan of all hair products hot tools.  </li>
      <li>No matter how much product I put in my hair, this is just too large and doesn&#x27;t curl well.</li>
      <li>The large barrel allows you to create very loose waves, mostly at the end of your hair.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast.</li>
      <li>Seems very well made.</li>
      <li>This curling iron really heats up the hair evenly</li>
      <li>and i really don&#x27;t want to burn my hair.</li>
      <li>It has a long cord for easier use and heats up very quickly to whatever heat setting you desire.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i can tell by holding it that it is really high quality, and well built.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for curls this size.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this tool.</li>
      <li>My hair is semi short and it is just the right size.</li>
      <li>the light is still one but the curly iron is not hot anymore.</li>
      <li>It was highly rated and so far it has lived up to the reviews.</li>
      <li>The big curls more like waves are exactly as expected!!  </li>
      <li>In a couple of hours, it looks like you had a professional salon blow out.</li>
      <li>i had my old hottool curly iron for about 3 years</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and provides lasting results.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot like the other one i have, but for my hair it did the job.</li>
      <li>one day i was curling my hair and it just died in the middle of me trying to get ready to go out.</li>
      <li>only adds a little body to a straight look.&lt;br /&gt;So much better than my previous 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron because the clamp holds hair in place and the cord swivels.</li>
      <li>Never had any issues with other Hot Tools products</li>
      <li>Big bouncy curls and waves are so much prettier than flat.</li>
      <li>but i don&#x27;t use it past half way heat either to be safe</li>
      <li>The place you put your thumb to open the clamp gets a little hot.  </li>
      <li>i really wish it can last little longer.</li>

    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She uses it everyday and says it is a good product. It was highly rated and so far it has lived up to the reviews.</li>

My hair type is thick and straight and usually curls well with other Hot Tools irons I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m such a huge fan of all hair products hot tools.  great price and great product.  i tried a CHI and preferred this product over the more expensive CHI.</li>
    <li> I love this curler! The large barrel allows you to create very loose waves, mostly at the end of your hair. In a couple of hours, it looks like you had a professional salon blow out.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this. It heats quickly.  It curls to perfection.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for curls this size.</li>
    <li> Great for loose beachy waves.  This curling iron really heats up the hair evenly so curls last!</li>
    <li> holds my hair that is pretty stay for a good chunk of the day. i love the material as it does not damage my hair but i don&#x27;t use it past half way heat either to be safe and i really don&#x27;t want to burn my hair. but it stays even at less than half heat so it is a good one and the size gives me good wavey curls, not too tight, not super curly.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time.  The big curls more like waves are exactly as expected!!  My hair is semi short and it is just the right size.</li>
    <li> This gives me really nice waves</li>
    <li> Just like the one you&#x27;d buy at Ulta or any prefessional salon store.</li>
    <li> This product is heavy and unbalanced when sitting. It will not sit on the wire. It falls off and lands on the hot iron and there is no auto shut off. The  iron coating came off after a year.</li>
    <li> The place you put your thumb to open the clamp gets a little hot.  The swiveling cord is amazing as is the temp control.</li>
    <li> I bought the 1 1/2 inch iron. I like the fact that it&#x27;s ceramic. It feels nice and smooth on my hair when curling. It heats up fast and provides lasting results. My only dislike would be that the temperature dial is very loose and in the area were my fingers naturally sit. So I found myself hitting the temperature dial and changing the temperature unknowingly. It would be nice if it was clicking at each temperature or if it wasn&#x27;t so loose. I have to keep an eye on it to make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally move it too hot.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron.  It has a long cord for easier use and heats up very quickly to whatever heat setting you desire.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are heat choices and that it has a swivel cord.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron before, but chose this one because I was impressed by the temperature controls this product offers, as well as its reputation as a professional&#x27;s tool.  I found it easy to use and loved the lowest heat setting, since I have baby-fine hair, BUT I found myself pulling a few hairs out almost everytime I ran this through my hair.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my technique, but I finally gave up trying to use it, as the snap top kept pulling out hair.  I&#x27;ll probably try the flat iron instead, since THAT product has the ceramic plates on BOTH sides - maybe that will glide through my hair more easily (and without removing hair in the process!!).</li>
    <li> Item was broken when I got it. It did not turn on.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this curling iron. and i&#x27;ve owned many! it&#x27;s well made. sturdy. has a nice, long cord. love the looks of it. the different heat settings are great! and it came with spare springs. this company thought of everything when they made this iron. would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have only used this once and so far is working great! i hope it keeps up. Will update later.</li>
    <li> The iron worked well until the on/off switch button became loose and stopped working. I am unable to turn on the curler anymore. A similar issue happened to another customer on here, so buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I used this curling iron twice and it worked great. The third time I went to use it, the on/off switch had loosened and then snapped off inside the shaft of the curling iron.  After that, it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore, even if I tried to switch it on using an external utensil.  Unfortunately it was past the return window so I was out $45 for a tool I used two times.  Not worth it.  Never had any issues with other Hot Tools products but I think they all come with warranties, so if you buy this curling iron, I encourage you to keep the box and warranty so that you can return it to Hot Tools.</li>
    <li> I already have a 2&amp;#34; hot tools curling iron and a 1.5&amp;#34; marcel. This one is much more easy to use use than the marcel and creates great curls that last all day long. Hot tools is really the best of curling irons, even for my thick hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> This curling iron glides thought my hair. It gets really hot.  I have relaxed hair and it definitely will make your hair silky.  It&#x27;s really heavy and has a professional quality feel to it.  The large cool tip at the end makes it easy to hold while curling.  It is very long so doesn&#x27;t pack easily.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I have a 1 inch barrel curing iron, but could never get the big boho curls I wanted. I am so happy with this product because I can make a lot of different looks with the larger barrel! Heats quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!</li>
    <li> This curling iron gets HOT! It also holds my hair firmly.  I recommend this for people with longer hair or those who just want a wavy look. The cord is also really long which I guess is a positive and a negative.</li>
    <li> I liked my new curly iron. i had my old hottool curly iron for about 3 years and now i see this model so i decide to buy one on amazon. it was good for 2 months. it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot like the other one i have, but for my hair it did the job. one day i was curling my hair and it just died in the middle of me trying to get ready to go out. the light is still one but the curly iron is not hot anymore. oh well. here goes my 40 bucks. i really wish it can last little longer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling iron!  Great size, easy to use.  It glides thru my hair easily.  I love the adjustable temp, and swivel cord.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Really good curling iron that makes my difficult hair look great! You can tell it is made of quality materials. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Seems very well made. It is heavy.  Heats up fast. I like that I can dial different temps. Only takes one &amp;#34;swipe&amp;#34; to defrizz my hair but I thought that it would create bigger waves....only adds a little body to a straight look.&lt;br /&gt;So much better than my previous 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron because the clamp holds hair in place and the cord swivels.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. my hair holds curls for the entire day. Curling iron does not seem to damage my hairs</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was faulty equipment, a possible refurbish, or what. But I literally used this product twice &amp; it quite working on me. I used it earlier on in the night &amp; I was going to touch up my hair before I walked out the door, However, I couldn&#x27;t because it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. The on/off switch was real loose and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have never had a curling iron before now and I will never live without one again! Big bouncy curls and waves are so much prettier than flat. I highly recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> It was a great iron,  just to large in diameter for my length of hair.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my wife, and she loves it! i can tell by holding it that it is really high quality, and well built. I purchassed this one under the recommendation of 2 of my sisters who are cosmetologists, and my wife has so far been very happy with it. It looks very nice, and heats up insanely fast. Again, i cant say too much about it because i am no persanally using it, but it has sure bade her happy</li>
