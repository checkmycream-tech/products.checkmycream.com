      <li>This product makes my skin feel smooth and poreless.  </li>
      <li>Found this originally at Marshall&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It feels ver rich and non sticky.</li>
      <li>I use it more at night or when its very cloudy, b/c sunscreen is still the number one wrinkle fighter.</li>
      <li>Great value &amp; finally a daily moisturizer that&#x27;s not a ridiculous price!</li>
      <li>Great consistency-not too heavy.</li>
      <li>Smells really fresh and does not rub off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using most brands that have any ingredients that aren&#x27;t natural.</li>
      <li>so I think the price listed here is worth purchasing.</li>
      <li>i have sensitive skin, so most skin care products irritate me.  </li>
      <li>Great product you can use 1/2  of this item daily compared to other brands with better</li>
      <li>Nice moisture for winter when my combo skin gets dry.</li>
      <li>but this is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>No more flaky skin, and most importantly, it doesnt break me out!</li>
      <li>and I went back to look for more</li>
      <li>When I first used it I thought it was a bit</li>
      <li>I will continue to use and hope to have a better review later.</li>
      <li>After the first week, I found that my skin was glowing so much</li>
      <li>I actually use their cleanser as well and enjoy that too.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I purchased at a location that accepts returns on such items.</li>
      <li>Skin seems to look better by the time the tube was empty</li>
      <li>and I was not expecting much.</li>
      <li>Because Amazon charges too much for returns i just kept it to use on my feet</li>
      <li>Really makes your skin look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good product, I have been using this product for several months, I was sucked into a more expensive face cream, like over $170.00</li>
      <li>The scent is sooo yummy and the product leaves my extremely dry skin so smooth and glowing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a favorite everyday lotion for me.  </li>
      <li>but as time passed, I found I STILL needed more moisture for my face, especially on the dry patches.     </li>
      <li>since you really have to squeeze just a tiny amount(too much will just sit on your face, skin won&#x27;t absorb the rest).</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to perfumes and the scent of this product did not bother me at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is for maturing or mature skin.</li>
      <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>midlife crisis for me for this 49 years 11 months and 13 days old man.</li>
      <li>I love it on my neck only because it is a bit heavy for the face.</li>
      <li>I kinda feel like I fell for a marketing ploy as I expected this to be a more natural raw product with ingredients I recognize and won&#x27;t find in a materials safety database.</li>
      <li>most moisturizers i try are either too heavy and oily and therefore make me break out leaving my face looking greasy throughout the day, or they are not moisturizing enough, thus leaving my face with dry patches.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin soft  and and reduces facial line and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
      <li>It is not expensive and have used very expensive products that don&#x27;t seen to do anything better.</li>
      <li>This is a higher price than I paid the first time I purchased the product, but a little hard to find.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was too greasy and heavy for my face. Because Amazon charges too much for returns i just kept it to use on my feet</li>
    <li> This cream is terrific and inexpensive.  I use it daily and then follow with a richer moisture cream.  This product makes my skin feel smooth and poreless.  Looks great.</li>
    <li> Nice moisture for winter when my combo skin gets dry. It doesn&#x27;t leave skin shiny either that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and really think it helps make my skin look good.  I actually use their cleanser as well and enjoy that too.  I would recommend it and will continue to use it.  It is not expensive and have used very expensive products that don&#x27;t seen to do anything better.</li>
    <li> This product is paraben free and not tested on animals.  It has a yummy scent!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this gives me the moisture I need.  I am very sensitive to perfumes and the scent of this product did not bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since the summer( not much difference in my skin).  I will continue to use and hope to have a better review later.</li>
    <li> For the past five year I&#x27;ve being useing it in my face with huge results lots of moisture, last all day long,&lt;br /&gt;But is hard to find it.</li>
    <li> I get the impression they started with a fair quality moisturizer base similar to what you might find in an oil of olay product, and added a few extracts and vitamins and a sweet/fruity smell and called it done. I kinda feel like I fell for a marketing ploy as I expected this to be a more natural raw product with ingredients I recognize and won&#x27;t find in a materials safety database.</li>
    <li> i love this moisturizer!  i have sensitive skin, so most skin care products irritate me.  but this is very gentle.  and a little bit goes a long way; one pea-sized amount will do your whole face.  most moisturizers i try are either too heavy and oily and therefore make me break out leaving my face looking greasy throughout the day, or they are not moisturizing enough, thus leaving my face with dry patches.  40 carrots, on the other hand, is perfect!  it smells great too.  plus, it contains retinol, which is the number one ingredient to fight wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great moisture and not greasy. Skin seems to look better by the time the tube was empty so I was on the hunt for it. This is a higher price than I paid the first time I purchased the product, but a little hard to find.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It smells great goes on smooth not greasy. It makes me look 10 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;No midlife crisis for me for this 49 years 11 months and 13 days old man. It saved me an affair, a Porsche and a Divorse.  I found it at  Marshall&#x27;s for 7.99. Thank you 40 Carrots!</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my skin, it is light and I could feel it tightening like I have a mask on. I wish they can work to improve their eye gel.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I have been using this product for several months, I was sucked into a more expensive face cream, like over $170.00 Do not  let the hype get to you, the find print reads on there reviews that the people were paid to say these things. BEWARE,,,, This is a retinol base and that is what works, and this product is slow but keep using, my husband said just the other day I looked 10  yrs  younger, yea!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a product I am going to use everyday</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this for 4.50 at TJMAXX and I was not expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The scent is sooo yummy and the product leaves my extremely dry skin so smooth and glowing. I love love it and I went back to look for more but there were none so I think the price listed here is worth purchasing. Paraben free, yummy smell and glowing moisturized complexion, its a winner. I use it more at night or when its very cloudy, b/c sunscreen is still the number one wrinkle fighter. anyway enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven, deeply moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy. Why wouldn&#x27;t you get it?</li>
    <li> this is the third bottle of this stuff for me. I love it on my neck only because it is a bit heavy for the face. However, if you have a sunburn this stuff works wonders and aids in the prevention of pealing and wrinkles!</li>
    <li> My mom bought this moisturizer and one day I was looking to try ANY of my other creams that I had in my bathroom cabinet and found this. To my surprise, this is one of the BEST moisturizers I have EVER put on my face. I am in my mid 30s and my face is dry and prone to acne (terrible combination) but when I tried this cream at night, my face felt so supple, I LOVED IT. It balances my face, so it doesnt feel greasy and its definitely moisturized! No more flaky skin, and most importantly, it doesnt break me out! I will be ordering this for me and finishing my mom&#x27;s tube lol...</li>
    <li> Found this originally at Marshall&#x27;s.  Liked it so much looked on Amazon and was happy to find it. Love the fragrance too.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer cream. It leaves your skin soft  and and reduces facial line and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> When I first used it I thought it was a bit greasy(it&#x27;s thick) since you really have to squeeze just a tiny amount(too much will just sit on your face, skin won&#x27;t absorb the rest). Once u put it on your face, after about 2 minutes your face tightens up, which I thought was good....but then I noticed my face became soooo dry!!!! When I applied make-up over the moisturizer, the make-up caked up due to the dry skin. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with this moisturizer, but I won&#x27;t use it again.  Now, after two weeks of using it, my face has rough patches and it looks like my skin is flaky, like I haven&#x27;t moisturized it in months!!!! Maybe it&#x27;s a good moisturizer for someone who has oily skin since it really drys your face.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  However, after buying this item from Amazon, I found it at two other stores for 1/2 the price!  Just sayin&#x27;,,,,,</li>
    <li> Great product you can use 1/2  of this item daily compared to other brands with better results.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have been on a years long quest for a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t just sit on my skin, dry it out or leave it greasy, especially in the cold winter months. I found this product at Marshall&#x27;s for a fraction of what it costs elsewhere. I like the consistency of this product and how it absorbs into my skin without making it feel dry after. It leaves a suppleness that other moisturizers do not. I also like that it has Retinol, which is a great anti-aging product and helps fight against acne.    If you are looking for a good, non-drying product that doesn&#x27;t contribute to the formation of acne, this is the product for you.    ETA: August 31, 2014    I hate to have to eat my words, but this product did leave some dry patches on my face. I think it might be the Retinol in it. I liked it at first but as time passed, I found I STILL needed more moisture for my face, especially on the dry patches.     I have since switched to another face moisturizer and have not had any problems since.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a favorite everyday lotion for me.  Smooth and creamy, works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> Product isn&#x27;t greasy. Good to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;smells great. Hard to find. Good price. Comparable to name brand products locallyn</li>
    <li> the smell, it&#x27;s great. Too bad the product isn&#x27;t all natural. I&#x27;ve stopped using most brands that have any ingredients that aren&#x27;t natural.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and fragrance of this product it is one of the best moisturizers  I have ever used for my over 50 Skin. I have used more expensive products but 40 Carots performance rivals their results . A great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Used this only one time and found it extremely drying. As another reviewer commented, I felt a tightness in my face after applying, but thought that perhaps it would absorb into my skin and moisturize it. However, the next day, I saw wrinkles, where they didn&#x27;t show up before. I don&#x27;t think this is for maturing or mature skin. Fortunately, I purchased at a location that accepts returns on such items.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about the 40 carrots line.  I just love there products.  I use this, the Vit C gel, the eye gel, the cleanser, the sleep cream and they scrub and regular wash.  Love the smell, love how it makes my face feel.  Just wonderful!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer i have found thus far. Hydrates and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> This moisture cream has a really nice consistency.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I discovered it at TJ maxx, the eye gel anyway. Loved it, seems to really plump my aging skin. So I ordered the lotion and it is great! It has a nice smell too.</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  It is light, not greasy but makes my skin feel wonderful. Smells really fresh and does not rub off.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering &amp; it does work well enough for my dry skin.  The price point for this product is a huge plus. I put it on while my face is still damp.  During the winter months, I use extra moisturizing over this product. If you&#x27;re someone with very dry skin, you may want to try this in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewers that have found to to be too drying. This may be due to the retinal in this product&lt;br /&gt;and having a sensitivity to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product would be more of a stand alone product for those with combination skin. I am happy with it&lt;br /&gt;as a daily moisturizer for under my make-up. But, I still use a heavier moisturizer at night. ( why 4 stars instead of 5 for my skin type. )</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I have been using it about twice a day now for a couple of months. After the first week, I found that my skin was glowing so much I didn&#x27;t even need foundation most days! Really makes your skin look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a way to give it 4.5 stars, my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen built in. I love moisturizers with sunscreen for in the summer so I can just skip foundation/powder altogether!</li>
    <li> My fav daily face moisturizer! Smells &amp; feels great. Great consistency-not too heavy. Great value &amp; finally a daily moisturizer that&#x27;s not a ridiculous price! Their nighttime cream is fab too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product I&#x27;ve used it before. It feels ver rich and non sticky.</li>
