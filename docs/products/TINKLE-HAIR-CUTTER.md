<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> after using this my hair looked less healthier</li>
    <li> This item really helps with home hair cutting.  It is easy to use and the handle is very nice as it gives a better grip than the variety that fits in the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact brand at a local beauty supply shop for about $3 for use on my cat, who has medium length fur.  Here is what I learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The comb has a top and a bottom in addition to two sides.  The top is the flat side where you can access the razors to change them.  THE TOP SIDE SHOULD ALWAYS FACE THE THE CAT or you will have a terrible time getting the loose hair out of the comb after each stroke.  It&#x27;s a night and day difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There are two ways I found to use the comb on my cat:&lt;br /&gt;  1) Thin the fur and trim it down a little (1/4\\&quot; or so) by combing with the top face almost PARALLEL to the skin and in the direction of the fur&#x27;s growth.  My cat LOVES this feeling, but don&#x27;t expect to finish the job in one session.  Just sit, watch TV with your cat on your lap, comb her, and put the fur in a ziploc bag so the mess is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;  2) Cut the fur shorter where you want shaping (e.g. around the butt) by taking a pinch of it, gently pull it towards you and then comb this section towards you with the blade at a steeper angle than when you were thinning the fur.  You&#x27;ll hear it cut and the section will come off in your hand.  It looks nicer than if you&#x27;d used scissors. Again, make sure the top of the comb faces the cat.  (DON&#x27;T USE SCISSORS ON YOUR CAT... IT&#x27;S TOO TEMPTING TO KEEP GOING, THEN YOU END UP CUTTING BITS OF SKIN BECAUSE IT&#x27;S SO PLIABLE... THIS IS MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH SAFER)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Both types of teeth cut, but the coarse side almost magically selects the top coat when thinning, and the fine side selects for the undercoat.  When cutting, I like to use the coarse side, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this comb.  I gave it four stars because it has no instructions on how to use it, and this took me quite awhile to figure out.  My cat likes it as well.  When I showed her this comb and one of her old combs recently, she nosed this one (indicated it&#x27;s the one she wanted used).  I had used it on her many times before letting her choose her comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to use this comb on a human (and have it be presentable), but I imagine a small dog wouldn&#x27;t be so different.times before letting her choose her comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to use this comb on a human (and have it be presentable), but I imagine a small dog wouldn&#x27;t be so different.</li>
    <li> Was very tired of a heavy Bob. This little tool is very fun to play with! Look on U-Tube about how to use it correctly first though and always work from the bottom up. Have fun!</li>
    <li> I love this little hair cutter.  I even like the name, it&#x27;s such a cute name…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are replaceable, which I like.  I purchased the replacement blades on Amazon also at a reasonable price.  The blades last a long time for me, though, because I only use one side of the comb and can flip them over when one side of the blade gets dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the freedom of being able to trim my pixie myself between salon appointments.</li>
    <li> It worked fine on my dog.</li>
    <li> only good on straight european hair</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like using a razor so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot. This works great!</li>
    <li> A usefull tool for my wife .</li>
    <li> Works well however the blade does get dull after a few uses, Also I used it on my moms hair, much thinner than mine and it snagged a few times because it got stuck on the locks that hold the blade in.</li>
    <li> It was exactly was I was looking for.</li>
    <li> a necessity for layering hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and affordable. This makes layaering easy, althought I don&#x27;t recommend using this on your natural hair. The razor in this form may be too harsh and pull hair out, also risking damage to the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> This razor comb is an amazing piece, especially for such a low price!! Such an amazing value. I love this and use it constantly. The two different sides make it easy to go between razoring for length or for layers, and the piece is made to very easily replace or clean razor blades!! Seriously in love with it and I will totally order more in the future.</li>
    <li> My husband cuts his own hair and this little product is very helpful. He had used something very similiar to this year ago, but it was lost. He&#x27;s very happy to have this hair cutter again. It arrived in perfect condition and before date promised.</li>
    <li> This is the first time to use this cutter to cut my hair. Its very easy to use, cutter my hair shorter. I got compliment from friends and very happy with this item. Thanks</li>
    <li> Shipment was quick and I instantly used it (for my dog). Blades were very sharp and I was able to cut hair with ease.</li>
    <li> Dear creators of Tinkle Hair Cutter: please consider renaming this item.  Other than the name, it is an amazing tool!  I was a bit hesitant to use it on my hair at first, but it did a terrific job of trimming my hair to give it that nice, &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look with textured ends (just like Heather Locklear, I swear!), rather than a blunt just-cut look.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my split ends! I went by the recommendation on the package and use it on my hair while it was wet and received great results. It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
    <li> it serves most purposes</li>
    <li> When I saw this I thought....yea sure....but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I found this product. It&#x27;s really simple--you won&#x27;t need any special skill or aesthetic sense; just use it to \\&quot;comb the hair\\&quot; lightly, the hair will be neatly cut shorter. The product will work excellently if you are already satisfied with the style and just want to make part of the hair shorter. It also won&#x27;t leave an artificial cut line; your hair will look very natural. I use it to cut my mom and my husband&#x27;s hair (both short) and they&#x27;re pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A potential issue you may have is, because the comb would drag the hair a little bit, the person whose hair you&#x27;re cutting may feel a bit painful. A solution is that you use your other hand to press the root of the hair during the hair cut.</li>
    <li> Works awesome for my overly thick hair</li>
    <li> Cuts wells but not great.</li>
    <li> fragile, ineffective, weak</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I bought it under the advie of a friend who told me I could use it to layer my wig for my cosplay. It works wonders! Only complaint I have is that sometime the hair gets tangles around the small teeth but their easy to get out.</li>
    <li> Made cheaply. Get  get the feeling 10 uses but it worked ok so maybe you can  try it.</li>
    <li> I love this little thing!  I use it to give my bangs that choppy razor cut look and it works like a champ.  I just do a little bit at a time until I reach the desire length.  Its simple and portable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it works well with layering my long wigs. Very sharpe so be careful you don&#x27;t cut yourself. Must keep it away from children.</li>
    <li> great for styling short cuts</li>
    <li> I swear by this thing...everytime I do hair I use this</li>
    <li> i used it to thin out my extremely thick hair. i&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and i hate going to the stylist because they always chop off too much of my hair, even if i just ask them to thin it out. my hair before this was super thick and hard to manage, not to mention the gnarly dead ends in various parts of my hair. the only way i could deal with it was by putting it up in a ponytail. now it&#x27;s really soft and it looks really nice, and no more dead ends! super cheap way to manage my hair from now on!</li>
    <li> I bought another more expensive one, but I can&#x27;t find it.  So, while this one does not do a great job it is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> tinkle hair cutter is not good to use my girlfriend bought it and it messed up her hair tottaly now she has an appointment to go to hairdressers</li>
    <li> I love this thing it works awesome with layering my hair</li>
    <li> Received the item with dull blades (or so I thought), so I ordered some new blades online. Still unable to use it as replacing the blades did not work either. I am thinking it would probably work better on thin hair as it certainly does not do anything for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! The hair cutter worked even better then I thought it would! My sister wanted an asymmetrical bob and I am not a hair stylist, but I normally cut/trim her hair for her. So, I decided after watching some videos on how to do an asymmetrical bob to purchase this hair cutter. The Tinkle hair cutter was affordable, easy to use, and it worked marvelously on my sister&#x27;s hair. She has really thin straight hair and this cutter helped me give her hair lots of beautiful layers, giving her hair lots of body! After I was done her hair looked like it was professionally done, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. Now, I want to add layers to my own hair!!:)</li>
    <li> Works as expected, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the blade will last in these but for now I am absolutely in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my own hair with them, wanting that razor cut, slightly uneven look on the edges and they worked beautifully. This hair cutter makes me wish I had kids so that I could become a novice stylist ;)</li>
    <li> very cheaply made! Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Worked great for the price and being an at home tool! I used it for my bangs.</li>
    <li> Worked great, fast shipping!/</li>
    <li> Works well for trimming the side of my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this comb for one of our cats, she gets mats really close to her skin that I hate cutting out because I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;m going to cut her. This comb works really well for them, she was almost purring when I combed a couple out! I read reviews of other similar combs and I decided on this one because of its reviews and price. It works, it&#x27;s cheap and if you have cats with mats I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this little comb. Great for keeping my pixie cut in shape. Now I&#x27;ll have less trips to the beauty salon.</li>
    <li> The blades are extremely dull, it pulls on the hair, leaves the hair with rough, horrific- looking ends and the plastic is very cheap and, way too flexible. It&#x27;s worth all of $4.00.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used it on my hair and my son&#x27;s hair now.  i&#x27;ve been using youtube videos to learn how to use a razor.  i really enjoy using it and love the effect it has in shaping hair.  i&#x27;m still learning how to really use it right and make the most of each cut.  made the mistake of cutting a few layers too short on my kid... but he&#x27;s 4 and doesn&#x27;t care, so it&#x27;s a good way to learn:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as i can tell the product is great.  the blades are sharp and do exactly what i need them to do.  the comb is easy to dismantle  to either clean out hairs or eventually replace blades.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and works quickly.  I comb through my son&#x27;s hair to thin it out and trim it up.  It takes me about 5 minutes total.  That&#x27;s great news for a boy who cannot stay still for 2 seconds.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. simple to use. stays sharp a long time. Keep your hair looking perfect and save money. I will buy another just in case. good price also.</li>
    <li> Received with rusted blades.Seller has issued a refund.Went to trash,I mean recycled trash.I saw lot of reviews but my barber show to me better than this on he bought it from a salon supply.&lt;br /&gt;Good seller.Issued refund immediately.</li>
    <li> nice product good for the unexpected spit ends and just to trim your hair how u want it .the product came on time and lloved it ever since.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this so that I could easily cut some clip-in hair extensions, and make them blend naturally with my own hair. It does that very well, but also allows me to cut my bangs with ease too. Previously I&#x27;d just take a regular pair of scissors to my bangs and then have to snip into them to texturize them a bit. This tool makes trimming my bangs a one-step process. It cuts the hair and provides a natural texture all at once. One word of caution is to work with the thinner razor first until you know what you are doing. The thicker side chops the hair with nearly one swipe.</li>
    <li> I like the item and it is sharp. However, I saw a couple ones at DAISO (Japanese dollar store) for only 1.50</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of money. You get what you pay for and this things isn&#x27;t worth a dime. Hair catches in it and gets pulled. I would not buy it again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It made it easy to cut my own hair. It cost me about $4 and there is no shipping on this item. I went to Sally&#x27;s Hair Store and they charge about $8 for a razor comb. This comb also allows you to change the blade when it gets dull. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I don&#x27;t really mind. It functions well and it saved me $16 on a haircut (and will continue to save me).</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t think it works well and it tends to pull the hair rather than cut it. I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> This hair cutter works just fine and helps me do my own hair and save alot of money. I have cut and styled my own hair for over 20 years and the one tool that makes this easier is this hair cutter and I hope more people try this and see there is nothing to be afraid of, just be careful and you will be able to style your own hair.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  I use it on my animals.  Should have ordered a larger one, but this is good for my smaller cats.  thanks!</li>
    <li> Razor is pretty dull. My barber uses something similar to cut my hair so I got this hoping to safely cut my 18 month old&#x27;s hair. No go. Kept snagging and pulling out hairs, ouch!  Maybe not the right tool for the job. Pretty cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Does the job it cuts the hair very nice and the way you want it layers blunt cut.  Love this Tinkle hair cutter it helps me out on all styles I do.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Took very long time to get it but I am like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cat...it makes a great way to thin out her fur and she actually loves the feel of it. Then I cleaned it and well...decided to try it on me! I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m an expert at it but it did trim my pixie cut a bit on the sides and back. Just go slow and be careful. It&#x27;s not a perfect cut but it seems like it can help between hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I use this to create really choppy bangs. I have short hair and the bangs of my reverse emo hedgehog mullet (aka long bangs and two inch spikes in the back) grows out pretty quickly. I think this product works better than scissors but you really have to pull on it, and in turn it hurts. Maybe if it was sharper it would work better. It is worth the buy simply because it is cheap and my bangs only take five minutes to cut with it...but I wouldn&#x27;t use it to cut more than that. It is a bit too painful to stand for a full haircut.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this to actually cut my kids hair, it pulls too much I think.  It works great for adding quick layers in my daughters bangs or on my son&#x27;s entire cut though.  The last time I cut my son&#x27;s hair, his hair cut looked like it was cut by someone who knew what they were doing!</li>
    <li> Very good.  Just as advertised</li>
    <li> Works really well on short hair.</li>
    <li> Simple but works wonderfully at trimming my fringe when I leave it too long in-between trims.  I have a fringe that sort of slides down at the bangs so this is mostly good for the straight part and then I use scissors for the bangs, but I&#x27;ve used these for the bangs as well as it lets you get a straight angle.  Perfect for me since I can manage the left side of my bangs just fine, but usually end up butchering the other side and having to cut the bangs shorter than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great for fringes and bangs, and perhaps not a bad idea for maintaining bobs.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a hair trimmer I purchased over forty years ago that gave up the ghost and finally broke. This one is designed much better so should last a long time. ( Bought two of them )</li>
    <li> Finally learned how to do razor cuts with this little gadget! I am a do it yourself person, but not a hairdresser. This product made is so easy and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This Tinkle hair cutter is work well, it easy to use, and easy to replace it blade.  and the blade it cheap too.</li>
    <li> Simple hand-held hair thinner. Not too well constructed -- the teeth break easily -- but it&#x27;s cheap and works well using standard razors. We bought a handful to keep on the shelf. These are really all you need for hair trimming.</li>
    <li> Became useless after 3 uses. The plastic piece holding the two parts together brought down into pieces making the piece totally worthless....</li>
    <li> Seems to pull the hair a bit more than tolerable.  Not that great.</li>
    <li> This comb works well for trimming the puppy&#x27;s coat. Great for the price. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get the knots out of my Persian cat&#x27;s fur. The combs have little notches that pull her fur, and make it almost impossible to be of any use. I think the construction could be better to allow the comb to have teeth while still allowing the razor to cut...</li>
    <li> Easy to use, texturizes very affectively. Blades have not yet gone dull since time of purchase (about a year ago). Only a slight learning curve. Saves a whole lotta time and pain if you&#x27;re used to texturizing with scissors. The simple design makes care for this product very easy.</li>
    <li> I bought three different razor combs and have given each of them a test run. The three were Diane Tinkle Hair Cutter (DTHC),the Diamond Edge Platinum Hair Shaper (DEPHS) and the Seki (most expensive). I liked the DTHC for the following reasons: It was the least expensive of the three and, in comparison to the Seki, it&#x27;s an excellent product for the price. However, it is plastic, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be too sturdy. The Seki has variable settings and the DTHC has two edges, one on either side. In the vendor&#x27;s picture, you will notice that the Diane Tinkle comb (DTHC) has two notches along the center of the comb; those notches are the tracks to open the comb to change the blades. I have feminine hands with arthritis and the comb was fairly easy to open. If I have a problem opening the unit, I insert an ice pick into one of the notches to help me glide the comb&#x27;s cover. I couldn&#x27;t open the Seki. And, unlike the Seki, the DTHC&#x27;s two double edge blades are positioned vertically, making the cutting edge two times longer than the Seki. Both of these cutters use regular double edge blades, have two cutting edges (one on either side), and although I probably won&#x27;t use them in my lifetime, I purchased 500 blades for less than ten dollars from an Amazon vendor. The way the blades are positioned within the Seki, only one edge of each blade is exposed for use; with the DTHC comb, both edges are exposed (one is for a short cut and the other is for a longer cut). I recently tried the Diamond Edge Platinum cutter (DEPHS), it has interchangeable heads and a blade that I can replace very easily with my arthritic hands, even easier than the DTHC. However, the length of the cutting area is about 25% shorter than the DTHC comb, and that blade&#x27;s design is a single edge blade with a unique length, given that it is 50% longer and also narrower than normal single edge blades. If and when the user needs a blade replacement for the DEPHS comb, that factor may be a problem. And, although the DEPHS has different heads, they all appear to be the same height, but designed with different angles and increasingly wider spacing between the teeth. I chose a head that had about 1/4 inch space and was satisfied with the cut until I realized that I had accidentally knicked myself in a few places, including my ear. I may have positioned the blade at a wrong angle. The blade is so sharp that I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, but I did notice the drop of blood on my ear and later felt a couple of stings on my scalp. I finished the cut with the Diane Tinkle comb because it hasn&#x27;t hurt me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I use the DTHC, which is about once a week, the more I like it. I&#x27;ve had it for about four months, and I haven&#x27;t replaced the blades yet; I simply clean and reinsert them. I notice that it works best on dry, clean hair. I suggest that after you get a barber or salon cut, maintain the length by using the DTHC periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these razor combs is going to give you a salon style cut. They make uneven cuts,and the Seki and the Diamond Edge Platinum Tip tend to pull the hair at times. With the bad winter, I didn&#x27;t cut my hair during the duration of the season and when I went to get a cut, both the hair salon and the barber shop had gone out of business. My solution was to give myself my first haircut; I grabbed a Fiskars Softouch scissors (another excellent product) and proceeded to fill my small paper trash can with hair. Then I grabbed the Seki to finish the job (razor combs don&#x27;t work well near the ears, so you may need a trimmer for that kind of work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs don&#x27;t come with instructions, so I start at the back of the neck and work my way north and forward as I try to follow the hair&#x27;s natural directional growth. I have thick, wavy hair and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with any of these products&#x27; ability to cut. In the end, I was satisfied that I had a short cut and hair that washes with less effort, but it&#x27;s definitely not a designer style and it&#x27;s something that I can live with. A couple of weeks later, I did the second trim with the Diane Tinkle Hair Cutter, which I now use once a week, as I mentioned earlier.live with. A couple of weeks later, I did the second trim with the Diane Tinkle Hair Cutter, which I now use once a week, as I mentioned earlier.</li>
    <li> pixie cut, thick hair grows fast,&lt;br /&gt;expensive haircuts never last.&lt;br /&gt;searched &amp;#34;self trim&amp;#34; on youtube&lt;br /&gt;tinkle&#x27;s easy to use, even for a noob.&lt;br /&gt;i thin mine out every other week or so&lt;br /&gt;every other month at salon, for even grow.</li>
    <li> This razor comb works perfectly to keep my pixie cut manageable. It took a few tries to get it right, but now I know how to use it and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Cuts the spiky hairs right off</li>
    <li> Best hair cutting device I&#x27;ve ever used and low priced besides. Get a few</li>
    <li> Well, it cuts hair, but tugs hard enough that I think I will stick to my thinning scissors, as opposed to this.  I was going to use it on my hair-dog, but if I don&#x27;t like it, then I can&#x27;t do that to his sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m sure it will be fine for some, especially at this price, which is a steal.</li>
    <li> I had bought one of these hair cutters years ago &amp; during moving, remodeling, etc., I lost it.  While I was on Amazon scrolling thru products--saw this lil wonder--just had to order 1--love it, love it!!</li>
    <li> I. Not. Reciving. This. Produc. Yet</li>
    <li> I used this to cut off the knots from my long haired cat.  It worked wonderful.  The vet would have charged alot more money than the cost of this wonderful little comb. The cat never even realizes that I am doing it. Just thinks I am combing his long hair...Very safe too. thank you.</li>
    <li> Received this product faster than I thought enjoying using this while I make my new wigs. Glad I have it great product.</li>
    <li> This little tool is amazing!  I had several holes and uneven spots from trying to trim my hair myself with scissors.  I cuatiously ran this thing over the trouble spots several times, and my hair was almost completely blended evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt you can use is it all the time instead of getting haircuts, but between fewer cuts it will be a great cost saver.</li>
    <li> Such an inexpensive item!  I admit I was skeptical when I placed the order.  But, guess what!  This hair cutter works very well.  It takes some getting used to -- so go slowly or you will learn why some barbers say \\&quot;The difference between a bad hair cut and a good one is a few weeks of hair growth.\\&quot;  Seriously, I have not gone to a barber since this item arrived, saving me $12 (plus tips) every other week.  I have a flat top hair style.  The only tricky part (at first) was dealing with the transition from the sides to the longer hair that makes it a flat top.  The top of the head (flat portion) is a snap!  I cannot imagine using this hair cutter for longer hair styles, but perhaps it is possible....  Don&#x27;t forget to buy some double-edge blades -- they are cheap!</li>
    <li> Works well, but I&#x27;m not the best at cutting my own hair</li>
    <li> Not as useful as I thought</li>
    <li> Great to trim my bangs and also my yorkie&#x27;s facial hair. Makes a nice feathering. The blade doesn&#x27;t last long, but easy to replace with a better one. Cheap price.</li>
    <li> Received them promptly; today is the first time I do hair cut by myself, I used almost nothing else other than this cutter, it is so easy to operate, very sharp, hair does not get stuck in between, it cut off and layer my hair exactly the way I want. I ended up having my own hair layered and cut just like a barber would do on my hair for $30. The value of this cutter definitely exceeds its price.</li>
    <li> For a simple trim without being disappointed at the barber shop this is a good deal.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little tool. Be very careful withe the shorter edge as you can easily take out a hunk of hair you meant to just trim.</li>
    <li> Received this today, fast too, just ordered it yesterday. Used it soon as it was out of the package.Asboutely love it. Works great and fast. One swipe on my bangs and they were no longer an unruly mess.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use and great quality.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair when cutting making it too painful to continue using.</li>
    <li> this product was totally ineffective on my Persian.  It pulled, but did not cut at all.&lt;br /&gt;i was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and save us all the time.</li>
    <li> Very well. made and strong.  Does the job.  I bought two razor hair cutter and this is the best one.</li>
    <li> Came just in time for me to get ready for a con, and it works great! And it was great for being so cheap!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it on dry hair, but my fine hair was really split by&lt;br /&gt;the razor.  I saw the rough texture later after washing and air drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can do is cut off the rough ends : (</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Light weight, sharp, two comb sizes, nice length, easy to clean. I can finally cut my own hair and look good.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I usually cut my mothers&#x27; hair in layers to make it look thicker (she has short thin hair) and let me tell you, this little cutter just reduced the time it takes me to make the layers to maybe 3 minutes. It&#x27;s so simple I&#x27;m surprised I never heard about it before. Her haircut looks amazing and her hair looks a lot thicker at the top when I use this and she loves it. I would give it 10 stars if i could!</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times and it does cut your hair. You have to be careful because it can take out more than you anticipate. It arrived on time in a nice packaging. Not bad for a cheap product!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly to trim a pixie cut</li>
    <li> Love and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works so good on my long haired dogs. And they don&#x27;t seem to mind it at all.</li>
    <li> great product to get the hairstyle you want</li>
    <li> I regularly cut my husband&#x27;s hair and , as I am not a professional in the field, regular scissors are not always the easiest to use successfully. This little comb makes the task an absolute breeze! Highly recommend it. Pretty much fool proof.</li>
    <li> This item shipped in two days! I was a little concerned when I saw it, because it looked like plastic and metal, not very impressive, but when I used it, it was a WHOLE different story. Although the side I would prefer to use tugs a little bit on your hair, it still works really well. For the cheap price, it was well worth it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to thin out or layer their hair for cheap. :]</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It can use regular two sided blades which are not that hard to find and can be bought anywhere for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. As a college student, I thought this would be the perfect tool, both affordable and easy to use. However, it gave me split ends and ruined the condition of my hair. I do not know if the blame is this specific hair cutter or just razor combs in general, but I will never use this product again. I really don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews but just a heads up for other college students (just invest in a good shear).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one the positive thing was that the razor seemed to be moderately sharp. It might be useful for cutting dog fur or guy&#x27;s hair. I might just test using this on guy&#x27;s hair since I have no use for this tool anyways. Perhaps, I&#x27;ll have better things to say for that.</li>
    <li> Week, i wwuld not hold buy the handle. Wulld.  Not buy again .clad it was cheap</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this item and a few others on Amazon before I made my purchase, and I can see why this is the most highly rated. It&#x27;s easy to use on my short hair and the standard razor blades are easy to replace. Definitely worth it, especially because short hair needs maintenance so often.</li>
    <li> Thins your hair very well. I love it.</li>
    <li> after a few uses blade needed to be replaces, however  great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product ... actually does what the supplier says it will</li>
    <li> I use this all the time on my bangs and trimming my dad and brother&#x27;s hair. It works excellently! I just glide it on my brother&#x27;s hair and it lightly thins out his thick hair without being too dramatic. I love using it to trim my bangs so they don&#x27;t get too long. Within just two bang trims, the cost of this cutter paid for itself! My brother ended up buying one for himself so he can easily thin his hair when it starts to look shaggy. It is really easy to use (my brother and dad were easily able to figure it out) and a great purchase. Definitely pays for itself! :)</li>
    <li> Mainly trimming hair. Works very good. Easy to use and keep clean. Useful. Recommended.Intend to buy a few more for gift giving.</li>
    <li> really works.  Starting trimming my own hair, and this makes it so much easier to do some soft layers around the face, and trim the bangs without that blocky scissors cut look.</li>
    <li> I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t be out anything if I bought this for just 3 bucks.  I got it and used it for my dog.  My little dog is terrified of scissors and clippers so this was my last hope.  First I started just combing him without cutting so he thought it was something fun...then he got used to the cutting.  I had to change blades several times but dog&#x27;s hair is very thick and dense so I knew that would happen.  Any double blade will work.  I got a pack of 10 at walmart for $1.70.  I will be buying a few more of these for sure.  After I got good at it I ended up giving my dog an amazing hair cut!  It trimmed him up so nicely and you kind of have to use interesting ways to tackle certain tough spots but I&#x27;m a pretty intuitive chic so I figured it out.  It trimmed up his snout beautifully but the shorter the hair gets you kind of have to hold it with your thumb and then pull through, kind of like using a paring knife when peeling an apple.  Love this cheap little thing!  Doggy is happy and not so hot.  And I was able to trim him up really really short just like if I were to have spent 60 bucks having him shaved at Petsmart.  It took a few hours, but he got a nice treat afterwards.</li>
    <li> It is simple in construction and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it in conjunction with a [[ASIN:B008GSY9IW Conair Battery Operated Trimmer]].&lt;br /&gt;At the end of it I got the result I wanted.</li>
    <li> This Tinkle Hair Cutter/Trimmer works exactly like it should.  I&#x27;ve had similar products but they never worked well.  In fact, they failed miserably. Don&#x27;t know what it is that makes this one work and the others not but for less than five bucks, you can have a hair trimmer that really works. Comes in handy when I just can&#x27;t make it to the Barber Shop.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected. only works if you want feathered hair. if you have thick hair, this won&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Great hair cutting tool - a time and $ saver!</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my hair. Not shape or style... I mean CUT my hair. This product is great because a) it&#x27;s cheap, b) it takes two standard double-edged razor blades (the kind you use in any common safety razor), c) it comes apart and goes together easy, d) it&#x27;s easy to clean (toss it in the dishwasher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I toss 2 blades into this, wet my hair in the shower, then go out on the patio to shave up the back &amp; sides of my hair. I then shape the hair around the crown. It takes a bit of doing, and the sharpness of your blades makes all the difference, but you can get a very good, even, 1/16&amp;#34; white-wall cut with this comb very quickly and easily. For the top I just pull the hair to the distance I want and cut through it with the comb. The top may take some practice, but doing the sides and back is so easy anyone could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done, the blades have enough sharpness that I can use them for the next 2 weeks of shaving. So, I cut my hair short &amp; tight and I have shaves ... for 2 weeks.... all with just 2 DE blades, a safety razor and this Tinkle Comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will note, I originally bought this to shave our long haired dacshund. He&#x27;s not a fan of loud trimmers, and he has very fine fur/hair. So, I figured a razor comb would do great, since I read other folks saying they used similar things on cats and worked out good. Well, it took fur off... but the way the razor comb works is it thins out the length of the hair so much to the part that it cuts it off at that his hair got frizzy-looking very easily. So, it didn&#x27;t work out so well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, worked great for my hair-cutting needs. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> thank you- this was a great buy- works great-does the job-i rated this a 5-i am very satified with this merchandise</li>
    <li> I cut my hair myself, and this product isn&#x27;t easy to use, hurts when you cut beacause pull the hair, it cut very well, I think is for professionals</li>
    <li> I actually bought it to use on my little dog to trim his hair down when it gets too long.  He seems to do much better with this than he does clippers because he just thinks I am brushing him and doesn&#x27;t have to hear the noise.  It takes a lot longer but it works well.  It would probably not work well on a dog with a long coat but does fine for what I bought it for.  Pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I really, really  love it. I was really worried that I bought the wrong thing but when I used it I love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Who needs scissors when you got this little fella!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously it&#x27;s amazing if you know how to use this you don&#x27;t need scissors and it&#x27;s sooooo cheap defiantly would buy again!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I love this little hair cutter! My hair is shoulder length and very thick, so it tends to look poofy and misshapen. After 15 minutes with this little blade, my hair is thin and much more manageable. Straightening and blow drying use to take 30 minutes to get all of my hair dry and straight. After using this cutter, I&#x27;ve cut that time in half. My only problem is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to stop using it. It&#x27;s amazing how well it \\&quot;shaves\\&quot; off hair and thinning it out makes it so much easier to style. I&#x27;ve gotten to a point where my ponytail is practically non-existent because I&#x27;ve removed so much hair. I suggest using it on dry hair only. I attempted to use it on my wet hair and it cut much more than I expected. It&#x27;s much easier to control the amount of hair you cut off if your hair is dry. Overall, a great buy at a terrific price!</li>
    <li> Works AMAZING after reading previous reviews I was a little iffy on buying this item.. things as &#x27;it broke&#x27; &#x27;pulls to much hair&#x27; &#x27;cheaply made&#x27; etc etc i wasn&#x27;t going to buy but took a chance and it works wonders!!!!!! I would recommend this product! But then again I might of just got lucky! Shipping was incredible!!! I ordered on a Saturday and got that Monday! I was VERY impressed!!</li>
    <li> best thing ive used for my hair!!! ive lived with super thick hair allll my life, this tool has thinned it out so well and made it look so pretty after i was done using it cuz i gave my self layers and side bangs with it. everyone compliments my hair asking me what hair stylist i go to , i show em the tool and they are all shocked! ive recommended it lots of times. thank u sooo much this tool has really changed my life, no more super thick uncontrollable hair!! woohoo :)</li>
    <li> That crazy one piece metal comb with super sharp cutting ability that my hairstylist uses is what I thought this would be.  It is not.  This comb uses replacable razors (unsnaps to replace as needed) but those are just not the same as the cutter I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, as I was chopping, I noticed that I was seeing little shaves of my hair strands in the cut portion along with the cut aways... and it pulled a little as I was cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best, but if you are only trimming your bangs as I do, then you can still use it.</li>
    <li> For almost 3$ not bad this is so amazing now I can even trimmed my own hair I don&#x27;t need to go to barber shop just to trim my hair,</li>
    <li> Awesome little comb; my dogs don&#x27;t even realize they are getting a haircut; they just love the grooming feeling.</li>
    <li> Purchased to use to groom my small dogs and I&#x27;m on the fence. It seems to work ok (but not great) but they do not like it. Perhaps if my dogs were better behaved during grooming this would work better.</li>
    <li> Only lasts about a month or so before the plastic pieces that hold the razor blades break. Other than that its a good product. Its very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is really a nice tool to have for haircutting.  I keep my hair short and do most of the cutting with an electric razor, then do some of the back and sides with the Tinkle Hair Cutter.  It really saves a lot of money, and I think it&#x27;s well made.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for trimming the hair on my pet dog, a pug maltise mix that has fine slightly curly fur. It might me the fine hare my dog has, but the blade quickly becomes jammed up with his fur, so using it for the purpose I had intended, hasen&#x27;t gone so well. I still use it for smoothing his coat, but actually &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; just isn&#x27;t practicle, to it&#x27;s back to my original sharp shear. I never tried it on my hair, and it might perform perfectly with human hair, but I preferr to have a trained stylist. I have no intention of returning it. It wasn&#x27;t that expensive, and as I mentioned, I&#x27;ll still use it for smoothig my dogs coat, after it&#x27;s been sissors cut. for leangth.</li>
    <li> it works ok - would work better if blade was sharper. don&#x27;t know where to get more or sharper blades!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and I needed something to trim my bangs. This is an excellent product for use at home for &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; project.This product was worth my $. My hairdresser is a lot more expensive &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get a new one and this one works wonders and great for my hair! I can do my choppy hairstyles now again and look great! I recommend this to anyone! :)</li>
    <li> not sharp enough and kind of hurts.  I would spend more $ to buy a better one.</li>
    <li> This thing pulls my kids hair, they hate it! I now use it to trim the hair on my arms!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about cutting my own hair, but this tool really is fool-proof. There really is no wrong way to use it and you can take as little or as much off as you&#x27;d like easily. I usually dry and style my hair as usual, then mist it a little bit and that makes the cutting a little easier starting at the ends and working the way up. Just be sure to go slowly and keep looking at your progress, you&#x27;d rather cut too little than too much.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for trimming my scruffy puppy&#x27;s hair. Does seem to pull or hurt her, in fact I think it must feel good. I recommend this product. It probably works great on people too</li>
    <li> I ordered this last week but I did not get it because of some foul up with USP/USPS but that is a different story. With that I would say Amazon needs to have better control over those who ship their products whether is it sold by them or not it still has their name on the package. anyway used the Tinkle the other night and it did great!! It was like just combing my hair!! Highly recommend especially for the price!!!</li>
    <li> I always cut my own hair using a razor and this takes so much of the guess work out of the process. Simply brush the comb gently through your hair for a perfect razor cut. The razor is very sharp but doesn&#x27;t take too much off, so you don&#x27;t end up with a choppy look. Perfect for layering or thinning thick hair. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this item trying to find something easy to use for trimming hair at back of head, around ears, and side burns.  Head is too large to easily use for my purpose.  If someone lived with me it might work, but with me trying to do the trimming, it DOES NOT WORK!!  I will not return it for refund because it is a personal hygiene item.  Need to re-think design or design a different product that one person can use to get a proper hair line trim.</li>
    <li> this hair cutter turned out to be the perfect tool&lt;br /&gt;for keeping my pixie in shape between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, the blades are replaceable and&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive.  Just make sure your hair is wet before&lt;br /&gt;using the cutter.  A nice shaping, thinning tool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s safe and so easy to use!Hold tip of your hair brush it down from where you want to lose some hair weight! My hair weighs much lighter now.</li>
    <li> I have a very short pixie-ish haircut, and even though it is super easy to style and a real time-saver every morning (shower, run my fingers through it, and go), it requires regular haircuts every 5 or 6 weeks. WIth the Tinkle Hair Cutter, I can stretch those visits to the hair salon by a couple of extra weeks or more. I decided to go with this particlular razor comb because it is inexpensive and the reviews were mostly positive. I was nervous to use it at first, so I only used the side with with the teeth more spaced out, and I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dig down&amp;#34; into my hair in order to avoid scalping myself. I lightly passed over my entire hair, combing only the outer part, then went back and cut a bit more deeply in the places that tend to grow faster- which is why I bought this product in the first place. After about a month or so, I always see a &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; of thick hair at the top left side of my head that desperately needs thinning. My hair was dry when I used the cutter so that I could stand in front of the bathroom mirror and examine exactly what I was doing (I would never use this with wet hair), and I loved the results. The ends of my hair did seem a bit &amp;#34;frizzed&amp;#34;, but I knew after a shower and some finger-stying it would look great, and it does. I love this product and just bought two more.  I think the next time though I will set up a mirror and do my cutting in the backyard- I have lots of thick hair, and I had a ton of little choppy hairs EVERYWHERE in my bathroom. I bought this product from Beauty 4 You and received this item quickly- maybe 4 or 5 days after ordering it- fantastic!</li>
    <li> Watch some YouTube videos before trying to put a razor to your hair. I started by taking too much off on one part of my hair. I got nervous and took a peek at some YouTube videos and it made a huge difference. I have very wavy thick hair. After using a flat iron and spray bottle of water, I was able to get a nice smooth razor cut. My hair looks much better when it is curly now.</li>
    <li> I bought 2... very happy with both.... Good price and fast shipping. Everything it says it is. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It&#x27;s very easy to use and does an effective job. The long handle is very helpful.</li>
    <li> It really isn&#x27;t bad! It isn&#x27;t a go-to for keeping your hair perfect, but it helps you get through those scruffy times between cuts. Make sure to use it with wet hair - using it on dry hair pulls/snags (ouch!).</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years gave it to my girlfriend to use she broke it I don&#x27;t how they&#x27;re not  fragile. they work real good in between haircuts.  I was going to get to that they only had one left.  I will check back from time to time i</li>
    <li> This is the perfect at home tool for maintaining my super short pixie cut! Easy to use and easy to replace the razor blades. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This item was essentially exactly as described. The use is very straightforward,  and it certainly cuts your hair. I think there is a tiny issue with consistency,  but that may just come with practice.  Regardless of that, it&#x27;s a great way to maintain when I can&#x27;t get to the salon.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these since I had never used it before and wasn&#x27;t sure how the blades would replace, but I only needed one.  No problem though, now I have one for me and one for my dogs.  I have Chinese Crested Hairless dogs with long, fine hair on their faces, legs and tail and this product works extremely well to trim them up.  They don&#x27;t mind the combing at all and it doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin like a shaver does.  I highly recommend this item for personal use and for trimming up the pups!</li>
    <li> I have been frustrated that my stylist never thins my thick hair to my liking.  This product allows me to do it on my own and reduces the number of visits to the hair salon. And they are so reasonably priced. I am happy I purchased several.</li>
    <li> I Damn near scalped my child.. this bad boy is a beast. At first, then it gets dull.&lt;br /&gt;  At first I was just trying to take a little of the length. As I was combing it I looked down and my child had large patches of hair missing..&lt;br /&gt;  I panicked.. holy s***, what is my husband going to say. I kept thinking he will definitely, divorce me after ruining our child&#x27;s hair. By the time I finished my child had the Vin Diesel hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T DO IT!!</li>
    <li> A great way to trim unwanted hair from your dog. Use the short side and hold the hair away from the body as you scrap the comb across it. You can cut off large chunks that way without it looking like you used a pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> It was on time,and while it wasn&#x27;t what i thought  it was ,it was ok for what i needed. and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Works well for my at home cuts. Very sharp and easy to use. I would recommend it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this once and it seems like it will work pretty good. I shouldn&#x27;t have used the short side because I took too much hair off and had to end up shaving my head. Can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product - it does work. Just be careful when you try this for the first time and don&#x27;t dive into it head first like I did.</li>
    <li> These are not always easy to find in your neighborhood pharmacy.  It is a very effective tool to keep my husbands hair under control and he can do it himself.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was priced great, and since I only need it for wig styling I thought it would be worth it. However, it&#x27;s super dull,  while technically it works, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price or worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also need to know that originally this product was made for a dollar store, so expect that kind of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 3 stars because it does cut, and I knew what I was getting into.</li>
    <li> We bought this to thin our cat&#x27;s hair. Her hair is very long and thick. She gets hot in the summer. Thought this would provide a better-looking haircut than when we chop at her coat with scissors. But this comb didn&#x27;t really work like we had hoped. It barely trims any hair at all, yet it fills with hair quickly. It was a waste of money for us.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is super cute, cheap and works great. I purchased this to use on my cosplay wigs, ((as well as to trim my own hair from time to time)) and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this a ton of times, but as professional hairstylist I think this is an incredibly useful tool for thinning out very thick hair. Simple to use and requires very lite pressure to cut.</li>
    <li> i ued this trimmer to thin out hair and it did a good job.very glad i bought it.will buy again when needed. :) happy !</li>
    <li> I use this hair cutter almost every time i want to give myself a trim. There are many hair cutting guides on YouTube and I see many gurus use this! It&#x27;s sharp and does its job! I would recommend this (:</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know something like this existed!&lt;br /&gt;Great for touch ups. Great for pet grooming. I can see so many uses!</li>
    <li> This little cutter helps me keep my pixie cut in perfect shape without having to put out money for a stylist more than a few times each year.</li>
    <li> This little guy does a professional type haircut.  On my first use, it was easy to work with and did a surprisingly good job.  Anyone can use this product. I highly recommend it to any one.  I love mine.</li>
    <li> It really does work to thin hair!</li>
    <li> Bought this to help keep my pixie cut trimmed and cleaned. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine and straight, and this just ended up taking out odd chunks. So I think it works mostly on thick hair. I have now graduated to an undercut and a heavy pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> It is very Easy to use and It works pretty well. Good price. No regret to buy. Thanks for this product.</li>
    <li> I got razor happy. Wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work, but saw a yt video. I have a short a-line bob that was growing, and my bangs were too long. I used the razor for my bangs. Pretty simple. I trimmed my hair with it as well, but I messed up my hair. So use this razor only after a few days of a cut for a trim. Great for bang cut.</li>
    <li> I use this periodically when my hair gets too bulky.  It is easy to use and stays sharp.  Keeps the weight off my head and my hair looking nice between salon appointments.</li>
    <li> This little thing works great! I read reviews of similar products, but took a chance on this one because it seemed the easiest to use. I was right. Out of the box, it&#x27;s good to go, and will take no time at all to master. The different length guards are fantastic and ensure that I don&#x27;t take off too much, which I&#x27;ve been known to do. I have extremely thick hair and an undercut hairstyle, so this is what I use to keep the sides and part of the back short without looking like I&#x27;ve been scalped. Oh, and it&#x27;s soooo much quicker and neater than scissors, it&#x27;s not even funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my next step is to get another one to use on my dogs, because this one works so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used this on my dogs and they looooooved it! One of them has very, very thick, shed prone hair and she&#x27;s skittish while being groomed. Well, not a problem anymore. This thinned out her bulky hair, made it look neat and she was relaxed the whole time (she&#x27;s a King Charles Spaniel/ Chihuahua mix, so long-ish, silky hair). I think it actually felt good, because I was able to groom her for a long time. This is not something that normally happens. So, for those with pets, give this a try!</li>
    <li> does what i wanted it for</li>
    <li> worked like a charm but the blade did go dull fast .. where can I order more blades..... besides that gave myself a hair cute have not been able to get in years...</li>
    <li> This is perfect for what it&#x27;s made for.  The blades work very well to cut hair exactly where I want to, and I love it.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a quick manner. Which is always good. This hair cutter actually works. I have a pixie cut and this hair cutter makes it so much easier to maintain. In three months I have saved so much $$$$ by not going to my hairdresser. This item cost me less than $5 bucks. It can&#x27;t get better than that. I definitely recommend this tinkle hair cutter to all those people out there, that want to save $ and time. Do it yourself is so much better. Thanks.</li>
    <li> With a pixie hair cut, I often have to get a professional trim/cut every 4-6 weeks. This hair cutter let me minimize those visits, saving time and money. Wet your hair and carefully pull the comb down through the back of your hair, from the crown down. Use either the thicker side or the thinner side depending on how much hair you want to cut. I found the trimming to be very even, both in length and thickness. It was so nice to be able to thin out my hair in the back, minimize the poof, something people with short hair/pixies will probably understand! :) I&#x27;d just recommend starting slow and being careful with it, cutting your own hair does not come without some risk.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily for my long-haired cat (to get dreds out and trim down his beard hair so he can take baths without choking on his beard haha). However, I have used it on my bangs and am thinking about buying another one for myself!</li>
    <li> I never knew these existed!  I stumbled across it when ordering stuff to complete my born again dolls.  And I&#x27;ve used it several times on my boys!</li>
    <li> this is a pretty good hair razor for the price. I have my hair all foreward in a fringe and use this to get a choppy look. razor combs do damage somewhat but not that badly. this one tugs a bit but works fine (:</li>
    <li> Works well. great price! Used this to create layers and thin out my hair</li>
    <li> Love this item, but be careful you can cut too much at once. I don&#x27;t have that problem because my hair is so thick, mistakes are hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have bought it to cut hear for two 2.5 years old, that are very energetic and hard to keep on the place. It worked well for us. The girls got a kind of stylish haircuts and I didn&#x27;t cut anybody not a once! And I did it for the second time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;However, kids said that it pull the hair somethimes</li>
    <li> I use it for small mats on my terriers. Works great. Replaceable blades. It is not a surgical steel precision instrument but works fine!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb to roach my horse&#x27;s scraggly mane. His hair is coarse and thick, this razor wasn&#x27;t up to task. I&#x27;m assuming it has something to do with the price point and cheap blades. I have sharp double blades for my the Merkur razor that I use on my legs. I&#x27;m going to try switching the blades out with something sharper. Hoping that will improve the cutting.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am unexperienced at dog grooming yet, I use it to trim around my dogs face. She is a long haired terrier &amp; this product does not pull or hurt her. She sits still &amp; allows me to trim her.</li>
    <li> I have very thick dry hair and when i got it cut a few months ago into a bob kind of style it grew out looking puffy and crazy this made it soooo much better. not to mention ll the bleach damage i had done to it has now been cut off with  great results!!!</li>
    <li> very easy way to trim hair it works a lot better than scissors when you are doing your own hair.</li>
    <li> Feels a little cheap, but for the price, works well enough.</li>
    <li> Blade went dull after ONE use... and it really damages your hair.  I will stick to using a very sharp straight razor for razoring hair.</li>
    <li> Although almost everyone who wrote a review didn&#x27;t really think about what they are asking you to do with this cutter, speaking as a Stylist razor cuts should be done on wet hair because of the pull on the scalp while thinning dry hair.  I cut my own hair and have for years I wouldn&#x27;t be caught without using a straight razor (single sided blade)  on my hair and I do it while my hair is wet.  I had spine surgery last summer and was not able to trim my hair and went to have it cut, the stylist used a razor on my hair to feather it when it was dry and it  pulled and hurt.  Remember that razor&#x27;s are sharp and you will cut off more hair than you realize while it is wet or dry.  Considering that cutting the hair when it is wet,  you can always go back and cut through more later. Less is always best when starting out using these for the first time. If you are going to use it on your pet consider that drag and pull on the dry fur while your cutting with these.  Although no noise as with a clipper cut for pets, the drag through their coat may be uncomfortable and your pet might not let you finish cutting.  I love straight razor cuts and excel at them it was my favorite tool to use when I was working in the salon before spine surgery took me out of the business  I would never recommend anyone use a razor of any type on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool. It&#x27;s super easy to use and my hair feels great!</li>
    <li> This product works great, these are more than satisfactory,very happy with them,this is a great buy,thank you very much. buy one!!!</li>
    <li> I like it very much. The price is very reasonable, the blades are sharp, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I use it about once every 2 weeks , to keep my hair at the length that I like.</li>
    <li> Use this for my chipoo dog... I had bought it with intentions to use it for my husband... but he&#x27;s losing his hair and I realized this is for thinning hair, not trimming. So I guess I was confused. But works great on my dog... I use it like a brush and it pulls out hair! She doesn&#x27;t shed much but also doesn&#x27;t go to a groomer, so her hair can be wild looking. Helped to make it feel softer because got rid of the knots and a whole lot easier than cutting chunks out with her squirming... and looks much more even since its all over thinning versus chunks missing!</li>
    <li> Works great for home haircut &amp; occasional use. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> it is sharp to be careful. does a wonderful job. i love using it. its easy to use. use it on dry, not wet or damp hair. not to hard brushing it threw your hair also. i got a bigger chunk out that i wanted not noticeable thou. i have thick, curly hair and i use the shorter side cause the blade is very sharp.</li>
    <li> does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a handy, no-nonsense tool which is priced right and will obviously pay for itself many time over. Blade replacement should be cheap and easy.</li>
    <li> Not at all as effective as the older, metal ones were, and it left me with horribly split ends. I might try it on husbands very short hair, but it think it&#x27;s heading for the trash.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair with these.  I also use one for lightly grooming my pets.  Why pay a salon?  These are perfect for me.  I always keep 2 or 3 of these handy.  Did I mention that I love this product?</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to use and well worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchase this product from my local Kim&#x27; Beauty Supply. The reason why I purchase it was because I have not had transportation since December 2013 and I was not about to rent a car just every time I needed my hair trimmed. I purchase 6 of these for $1.99 and Browshapers (3) per pack for $1.99 to trim my edges since I am not up to par on using an electric shaver right now. I tell you my hair looked so much better than the barber cut it. They never seems to cut my hair the way I want it no matter how blue print I tell them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought the platimum blades (10) per pack double edge for $1.00 whenever I need to replace them. If there is a Kim&#x27;s Beauty Supply or Asian Beauty Supply near you, they have the best cheapest prices. The one I go to is almost the size of a Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have fast growing hair, half empty pocketbook/wallets, this comb will solve your barber/salon problem if you feel safe cutting your own hair.</li>
    <li> Great for extra strands of hair that sticks out.</li>
    <li> When I dye my hair the very very tips of my hair is ruined so this helps me get those off with out ruining the layering of my hair</li>
    <li> It does work but I do not know if I was using it the right way.</li>
    <li> Worst product. Not for long hair. Disappointed!!</li>
    <li> They look like the same as we bought here for much more. We have not used them yet. I use them to comb the dogs.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. Tried it out myself (made an oops, but underneath where it doesn&#x27;t show) and I *LOVE* it, too! It gave me awesome layers.</li>
    <li> i give it a 5 star if there was a 6 i would of</li>
    <li> I cannot be more happier with my Hair Tinker!! Its of great quality, i know this hair tinker is going to last me manyyy years, its easy to use for both men and women. My husband has saved about $80 cutting his own hair with this product, and so have i, well alot more becasue my hair is longer!! Lol!! I HIGHLYYYY recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> The tool works very well for my wife&#x27;s pixie cut. Instead of paying $10 for a touch up this takes the place until the next hair cut.</li>
    <li> The Braun electric toothbrush is vastly improved over those of earlier years.  It&#x27;s speed has been increased substantially which offers much better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tinkle Hair Cutter is about as good as earlier miodels that we&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for our cat with long hair that mats.  It easily thins out the hair with no fuss from kitty.</li>
    <li> I wanted more of a choppy (&#x27;Shitty&#x27; to my parents, lol.) hair style and this did me wonders. I still use it for trims and it hasn&#x27;t proven to be a waste at all.</li>
    <li> Great tool for touch ups!</li>
    <li> I used the tinkle hair cutter just once so far and I think I will like it even more with practice. With any new tool the more you use it the better you get. I am glad I bought it. I save the money for 1 trim from a beautician so I  am ahead already.</li>
    <li> Cool blades and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me to cut mine and my daughters hair.  She uses it all the time (as her hair growth allows).  I have to go in-search of it when i want to use it.  Its a great product and easy to change blades and clean.</li>
    <li> It is ok for what I wanted it for.&lt;br /&gt;The one I was looking has four different sides on it.&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product is as described. When you use this, just don&#x27;t comb too much or too hard. Wet your hair so you wouldn&#x27;t feel the pulling of the razor. If this is your first time using this, I suggest combing lightly one day, and go again the next day if you think you need more shearing. I&#x27;m a male with short hair; I thought I&#x27;ll look like Elizabeth Taylor, then I was like gurl this isn&#x27;t working, so I did a wanabe Miley Cirus/mullet in the end.lol But it looked great.</li>
    <li> This really does work.  A good way to save on haircut costs altogether or by extending time between cuts with a quick trim.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the blade doesn&#x27;t get dull, very durable. Works the same like an expensive one in the market..</li>
    <li> Not for sure how to use it  but i will youtube it. Came pretty quick, will consider order another one when this one dulls.</li>
    <li> This is an unbelievable tool for those of us with thick and abundant hair - it thins out the heaviness and allows my hair to curl naturally not to mention feels so much lighter&lt;br /&gt;so easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it on my own hair so I can&#x27;t speak for thin haired folks</li>
    <li> Purchased to trim doll hair.  Do not know if it works better on human hair. So do not know if I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Thick hair is my blessing in the winter, and my nemesis in the summer. However, I can quickly thin out my hair whenever I need to with this amazing cutter. This thing is so fantastic for the price, It&#x27;s already saved me a lot of money in trips to the salon!</li>
    <li> I just recently started cutting my own hair and I found this product easy to use and aided in my ability to give myself a great looking haircut.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Worked so-so. Actually, not so bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Great tool. Be careful....you can over cut really easily</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. I personally use this to cut my side swept bangs and it looks nice. The blades are nice and sharp where I can easily cut/thin out my bangs. Also great price!</li>
    <li> I bought three of these. I cut my own hair and my pet&#x27;s hair, so one is to be used on them. It was so easy to use. I keep the hair in the  back of my head very short and so all I do is start from the nap at the neck and go up towards the crown. It does not pull and is so easy and effortless to use. I use this on dry hair only. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this too much but it comes in handy if you have short hair and can&#x27;tt tame a stray hair.</li>
    <li> I liked it until it was so cheap it broke in a week.</li>
    <li> Two blades dont stay even when using</li>
    <li> This cutter is amazing. It is sharp and it does exactly what it is suppose to. There is one side that cuts out a lot of hair which is the the more spacey side. The other side is what I used often. I was able to thin out my extensions to make it look more natural.</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected. Good value also</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use. Blades used in this cutter, are the regular ones so no need to order blades online, you can get them in any stores around.</li>
    <li> My wife enjoys using this on our dog an on me. I would recommend this my friends.</li>
    <li> It works fantastic. This helps me cut layers easily. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and I loved the individual packaging it had!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Gave my daughter a beautiful bang and I&#x27;ve never cut hair in my life. This was a good buy</li>
    <li> Use this cutter to trim my bangs, easy to use and perfect outcome.  Great price and a money saver, everyone should have one for inbetween haircuts.</li>
    <li> Just what it says it is. Gave myself a great trim. Friends thought I had gone to salon. It is plastic so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but great Gauls for the price.</li>
    <li> It is a must buy for anyone who hates spending so much money on haircuts. It worked on my synthetic wig, my natural hair, and even got a knot out of my long haired cat&#x27;s fur. It&#x27;s super easy to use and it&#x27;s NOT cheaply made. I&#x27;m very surprised that I didn&#x27;t cut myself because I&#x27;m so clumsy, however this product is completely safe to use. I am impressed with the outcome and cannot love it anymore than I do now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very convenient product for self hair cut. It&#x27;s very sharp and I don&#x27;t need to worry about I will feel ache when I&#x27;m cutting hair. After use this product I think I still need hair scissors to adjust some details.</li>
    <li> Have used this a few times already and I like it very much.  It does a great job.  I watched YouTube videos to see how to properly use the razor on hair (wet hair, at the proper angle, in various directions based on what you are trying to accomplish).  Together with straight shears to chunk out and thinning shears in places where you don&#x27;t want fluff, this is perfect.  Also, blade replacement is easy.  It takes two standard safety razors that you can buy anywhere.  I only use the side with the most teeth (less wide pieces of hair removed).  So when that side of the safety razor gets dull, I can flip them over and use them until I need to change them out (easy to remove for just cleaning too).  I have been cutting my hair for a couple years now but it&#x27;s very difficult to cut very short and see what you are doing with just scissors (although hanging a larger hand mirror from the top of the bathroom door that is opposite the big vanity mirror over the sink does help).  I have had no formal training, but thanks to YouTube I had lots of tutorials from very helpful stylists. I am very pleased with this purchase and would buy again.  This is a long review for something so inexpensive but something that is truly worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It was very disappointed,  very cheaply made, I could not use it. if I try to  use, it will probably  break  very 1st time I use.&lt;br /&gt;  very bad</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. It cuts exceptionally good either with wet or dry hair. The only thing I dislike is it does such a good job that if your aren&#x27;t careful, you will cut your hair too close.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this to groom my dogs with as they don&#x27;t like the sound of clippers and it can take awhile using scissors.  It works ok but it really is for human hair, it can&#x27;t handle all the dog hair.  I haven&#x27;t used it on myself but I&#x27;m sure it would work great on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for and the price was right. The package arrived right on time. This was a good addition to the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Handy home grooming item. Very simple and easy to use. Save on barber shop fees and trim your own hair.</li>
    <li> satisfied with everything!!</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower to extend the time between Hair cuts to save money now I go three to six months  instead of every two to three weeks at between $10 to $20so this saves a lot ,I also ordered extra blades 5 5packs so I save at least $600 over the next five years that I expect them to last.</li>
    <li> slices right through hair and great for layers. the only thing is sometimes some hair gets jammed in it, not that hard to clean out though.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting my yorkies hair!</li>
    <li> I use this to remove damaged end from my own hair and on all of my boyfriend&#x27;s hair when he needs a trim, and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Two regular, double-sided razor blades (for easy replacement!) fit into the plastic comb part that comes apart just easy enough to avoid frustration but not so easy that it opens when you don&#x27;t want it to.&lt;br /&gt;Lovelovelove.</li>
    <li> Works very well very easy to use</li>
    <li> The Hair Whiz that I used for years had four cutting lengths, this one has only two.  I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t trim as well as the hair whiz but I&#x27;ve adapted to it.</li>
    <li> Any time my hair starts getting a little out of shape and I don&#x27;t have time to get to the hair dresser, this tool does the trick. It magically trims just the right amount of hair so easily and w/o any harsh lines; the results look professional until you have time to get to a real hair dresser. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this to trim my hair. Works great. Have been using it for the last several months. Quite handy.</li>
    <li> Holy crap this thing really works. I trimmed my pom who is really nervous and she sat thru the whole trim on dry hair.  I am happy.</li>
    <li> Good prod...fast delivery :-)</li>
    <li> its a scam, wont work at all</li>
    <li> This was pretty useless- maybe I just never figured it out.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> I bought this to groom my &#x27;privates&#x27;.  It works well, does what I was hoping it would - it&#x27;s safe, no nicks or cuts in any areas that are of great concern to me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am not wanting to go hairless, just neatened up a bit - am trying to pick my wording well, without being tacky.  It&#x27;s simple, easy to keep clean, use it in the shower, low cost and low tech.</li>
    <li> It is okay when I can&#x27;t go to a beautician would not use regularly</li>
    <li> i use this on my husbands thick hair.  it keeps it trim in between hair cuts..no more of that scraggly look!</li>
    <li> Gave my wiggly 20 month old a very needed haircut with this the day it arrived in the mail. I just used it like a comb, and it ended up being a very respectable haircut, doesn&#x27;t look like I used a bowl, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about poking his eyes or cutting his ears. For less than $4 and free shipping, how could I lose? Several of my friends have bought their own now.</li>
    <li> The delivery was very fast. The estimated time was that it would take about a week, but I got it in 4 days. It comes in plastic packaging and has a removable cover on the razor if you needed to replace the blades. I tried it on my hair the night that I received it, and I got very good results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a cheap price for VERY good quality :)</li>
    <li> Works great, I use on my own fine hair to trim short cuts (pixies/bobs).  Great for trimming the back of the neck.</li>
    <li> I love how I can layer my hair with this and it flows much more smoothly than the choppy look you get when you do intense layering with scissors.  I cut my hair and then go over it with this.  My sister also has very thick but short hair and it makes it so much easier to cut her hair.</li>
    <li> Firstly, my sole use for this is to trim my kitty&#x27;s fur in the summer. I really like the design of this trimmer. The downfall of it is that it is made from a cheap plastic. However, I usually do manage to get at least two summers out of it. I just wish that it had heavier construction. It is a cheap price, but the quality is right along with the price. If you are looking for a trimmer that will last, spend the money and buy something that is made heavier.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting use to it but it works great to thin out thick hair or to just cut some ends.  Good little tool.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars because idk. it does the job but you have to learn to handle it well or it doesn&#x27;t cut anything lol</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. I cut my own hair and this made layers so easy to do! I am actually bummed I can&#x27;t use it more, lol... the blade is sharp, it stores well in its package. I&#x27;ve only been able to use it twice but my hair and layers look fantastic! Definitely helps keep my hair healthy also.</li>
    <li> This item works great! I was very nervous this would be hard to use, but it is very simple and easy to control how much hair you are cutting. Although I wouldn&#x27;t suggest cutting with wet hair as you could lose more than intended!</li>
    <li> Reasonable product and works OK , but overpriced as cheaper in Walmart and other places I have since seen it. ( plus no shipping charges !!!)</li>
    <li> As described.  Haven&#x27;t used much yet.  Handy to have on hand.  Be careful with your first use.  It can take off a bunch quickly.</li>
    <li> Tinkle hair cutter works better than the &amp;#34;New Hair Trimmer&amp;#34; ,but not as good as one I have had for almost 50 years which has two more hair length options and uses only one razor blade at a time. Time did not improve the quality or the efficiency of present razor combs..</li>
    <li> Bought this one in conjunction with the Seki Edge Styler and they both were disasters. Will never buy this or recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Works great. Inexpensive, uses standard blades that are easy to replace. I use it for between haircut trims. You need to be careful as it can take off a lot of hair in one swipe.</li>
    <li> This is a straight up, AWESOME, straight razor comb. I got this for my fiancee, and she loves it! I would highly suggest this to any up and coming stylist</li>
    <li> Works really well and perfect for a quick fixing up. Awesome product! I would recommend these to anyone who likes doing hair.</li>
    <li> pleasantly surprised with this product. cuts my hair like butter and doesnt tug on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy this again</li>
    <li> Product was shipped fast and arrived in perfect condition. I bought this to use for cutting the stray hair and removing matted hair on an elderly cat who is terrified of scissors and trimmers, and it worked pretty well. Could have used sharper razors, but I can replace those with better ones. The comb itself is good, and easy to use, once you figure out the angles you need for the cutting.</li>
    <li> did not work as expected.</li>
    <li> I have a pixie haircut and this takes the place of my hairdresser when it has grown out a little... I love the razor cut and this does the job. You can&#x27;t beat the price and it came super fast.</li>
    <li> Convenient way to trim my dogs between haircuts.</li>
    <li> Very good for a great price!</li>
    <li> Works as it should, I actually use it on my pet and it works well after I changed the blades in it that came with it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I hate paying to go to the salon when I can make fresh layers myself. I did watch a few Youtube videos first so I knew what I was doing.</li>
    <li> good cutter buy will snatch you bald if you are heavy handed</li>
    <li> I just got a pixie haircut and this cutter is great for keeping it Stylish.  I wish he came with extra blades</li>
    <li> This item is worth the asking price. Even though it&#x27;s only two razor blades and a comb, which can be assembled at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Has two different layering options.&lt;br /&gt;Size of an average type comb.&lt;br /&gt;Good for trimming or getting out split-ends.&lt;br /&gt;At home layering.&lt;br /&gt;Great for cutting friends/family hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;When blades or dull, you have to buy new ones. (Fairly cheap)&lt;br /&gt;Takes practice to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying this if you aren&#x27;t very proficient with cutting hair with scissors, makes cutting hair so much easier.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cutter and it can easily get rid of the unwanted hair on bulky wigs.</li>
    <li> I Love This! I was surprised how well it worked!</li>
    <li> Let me start with, holy crap the shipping was really fast. I got it in like two days. I tried it as soon as i got it and it cuts hair like butter. It works perfectly!!! Be really careful because its seriously super sharp and you might cut off more than you wanted, and I have really thick hair.</li>
    <li> 1. The 2 circular pictures describing thin vs thick hair could be replaced with pictures of how to A. hold the hair between your fingers, and  B. Show the angle the blades should be during the combing stroke (it&#x27;d better be like 5-10 degrees, almost a horizontal stroke, or it&#x27;s &amp;#34;chop-chop&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;2. The words &amp;#34;When cutting on lay partially, hold your hair with your index and middle fingers and cut it.&amp;#34; could be deleted and have this pictured as recommended in A. above. This sentence was essentially worthless.&lt;br /&gt;3. The thin hair vs thick hair sentences were pretty worthless also.&lt;br /&gt;4. Have a budget for a regular haircut after your 1st attempt. Use a shallow angle, proceed slowly and pay attention.</li>
    <li> Great little grooming tool</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to use for trimming and shaping hair.  I would recommend this product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> i have only had the item a couple days and used it 2 times , i hagve super thick hair and i got this to thin end out of my layers and bangs so they lay down better and look nice ... it does thew job, very sharp and easy to use. need to be angled a little to do right. good price too. we will see how long it last, ill update later if i come across problems</li>
    <li> Helps me keep my hair looking good all the time!</li>
    <li> This was my small investment to &#x27;shave&#x27; off some money on my hair budget. I am not rocking a simple and sweet haircut that is very easy to maintain with this tool</li>
    <li> IF you have a long hair cat this is the best way to get out knots.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my dad because the one he had broke after many years of use.  He actually like this style much better because it has a handle and he can use it like a comb, his old cutter is a square piece, he said it was difficult trying to reach behind and trim the hair around the neck, the comb handle makes it easier.</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to go to the hairdresser but once a year.  This haircutter is fantastic!  It helps with keeping the waves in my hair, too!</li>
    <li> This product is good, not to mention at a good price... just my hair doesnt react well to razor cuts of any kind. my hair just kinda frizzes everytime. at this tool and when i go to the salon.  so i think if you have somewhat frizzy hair like mine, this is not the product for you... and neither is razor cuts at all.. but if you have naturally straight hair, then i think this will work just fine :)</li>
    <li> kinda snags hair...not like a hot knife through butter</li>
    <li> Really like the effectiveness after learning how to use it.</li>
    <li> This hair blade is very nice! It helped me with cuttting my hair without cutting it all off or too much! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> the only problem i can not find new blades i love this it cut great if you are a do it your selfer</li>
    <li> I bought this to thin my three cats&#x27; hair. It does what it says. Nice inexpensive way to thin out hair.</li>
    <li> This hair razor works perfectly. The blade is nice and cuts very well. This does, however, causes split ends, so I recommend to only cut your bangs as you usually trim it every few weeks.</li>
    <li> This little tool does a great job. Having a handle such as this one has gives you a lot more control - especially trimming your hair at the back of your head. Great for giving your self a razor-cut hairstyle.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is amazing!  For a couple of bucks (less that that if I remember correctly), my husband routinely uses this to trim his hair when it starts getting shaggy.  Then I just trim up the back and sides and he looks fresh as ever.  He&#x27;s needing only about a third to one quarter of the number of expensive professional haircuts than he used to have to get in the course of a year.  When it gets dull you just replace the (very cheap) razor blades and you&#x27;re back in business.  We&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars in hair cuts and he looks professionally clean cut (and very handsome I might add)!</li>
    <li> This tool is just right for people who like to make frequent, small touch-ups. It&#x27;s forgiving, doesn&#x27;t cut too much at one time, and helps maintain a well-groomed appearance.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this device :) I have a pixie cut, which is actually a pretty high maintenance hairstyle. I have to get it trimmed every few weeks if I don&#x27;t want to end up with a mullet (which is about $30-$40 per trim). This is a far more cost efficient method of trimming my hair, and it is so easy. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to go to the salon for quite a while. I love this comb!</li>
    <li> Simply put it sucks.  Does not work, don&#x27;t get it.  I don&#x27;t know how someone could prevent a razor blade from working, but they managed to do it.</li>
    <li> Use it once a week for a couple of minuets to keep my crew cut looking great.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this product is pretty darn good for the price. It&#x27;s sturdy and the handle is easy to hold - not in any way awkward. One side has about a one centimeter comb outside of the blade, the other side has about 2 or 3. The blade is rather sharp, and cuts with ease. I&#x27;m not so great at cutting my own hair, but I managed to do just fine.</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace a razor comb that had 4 different cutting lengths.  this one only has 2 and appears to be more for thinning hair.  I use my 4 length comb for cutting the hair on the back of my neck.  I did find what I was looking for and will give this one away.</li>
    <li> EZ to use, clean, and replace blades.  Good to help extend time between cuts and help growing hair out.  Product is lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and simple to master.  The seller Maya Beauty was very helpful. Cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> Change the blades after each cut to prevent split ends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the purpose of trimming around my poodle&#x27;s eyes in between groomings. This works great for what I need it for. It does not remove a lot of hair at a time, but it does trim enough around his eyes so he can see well. This product is basically two razor blades encased in a plastic comb with one wide toothed end and one narrow toothed end. I suggest using the wide toothed end due to the narrow end getting tangled in long fur. The blades are easy to remove to clean or replace. I am ordering another one due to misplacing my first one.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome for the occasional trim, I am very happy with the choppy way they make my bangs look. I personally cut my own hair, but if you didn&#x27;t, they would be great for in-between haircuts. I highly recommend! They last FOREVER because you can change out the blades with any old average double sided razor.</li>
    <li> The product works. However be gentle using and storing it. Check before each use as a plastic part of the comb broke, exposing the blade and it cut my son&#x27;s ear as I was trimming his hair.</li>
    <li> Handy, using it for my long haired cat.</li>
    <li> I ordered out of curiosity. I figured I could afford a $3 mistake. WOW this thing really works. Save time/money by using this to extend the life of your hair cuts. Would be great for boys haircuts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and useful for cutting my own hair. It&#x27;s shred your hair unlike scissors so it&#x27;s the best if you like shaggy hair like me.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work. It pulls the hair rather than cutting it. It&#x27;s waste of money and does not even compare to other brands. Do yourself a favor and pay a few extra dollars for a better one.</li>
    <li> Works great for shaping my hair I use it every few weeks. It&#x27;s a great product for me, because I love getting my hair cut, but I don&#x27;t always have the means to go to the salon twice a month to get my hair trimmed or to get a new hair cut all together. With this, I can get my hair exactly as I want it without having to &#x27;bother&#x27; a hair dresser 2 more times after they think they&#x27;re done with my hair.</li>
    <li> i was shocked to find this product arrived 3days ahead of the estimated time of arrival.for the longest time i simply used a razor blade for my hair which left me with one result. with this tool i can create the chunky layers and whispy edges i enjoy. delighted by this product and the seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all. it&#x27;s cheap and chintzy and i don&#x27;t plan on getting another one. I got it for my house rabbit and it hardly removes any fur.</li>
    <li> This is really too flimsy for my use - I was looking for trimmer for small dog.  The plastic is just too thin and feels like it will break at any moment.  Also the blade cover refuses to stay on.  Sorry but this one&#x27;s a bust.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a hair comb.  I now have very messed up hair. Now I am sad :(. Well the hell with it. Looks like I will just be wearing my unicorn mask permenatly now.</li>
    <li> i recently bought this product to try it out. im asian and always does his asian hairstyles all the time. im always experimenting my hair and be creative. i admit i was scared to cut my hair for the first time but then i cut little by little and does the job. im very impress how this little product can do much effort! it may be cheap and plastic but its better then nothing. i recommend for the people who wants to try cutting their own hair without going to those expensive salons/barbers. one thing you should keep in mind is experiment your hair and visualize the shape of your hair. if your not sure of cutting your hair on your own then i recommend you to go to the salon and learn how they cut!! very satisfying product!!~ also dont listen to those poor reviews. 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Performs as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my bangs with scissors before but, it&#x27;s always been difficult to make them look more natural like when you get your hair cut at the salon. I bought these originally only for my bangs, but after I saw how easy they made it to make my hair look good, I ended up cutting all of my hair with it. It&#x27;s a really neat product and once you fool around with it, you could probably feel comfortable cutting your own hair, even in the back.</li>
    <li> The item purchased arrived on time and it was also as described. I am excited to use my new product!</li>
    <li> I use these to trim my side swept bangs and any hair that didn&#x27;t get cut properly at the salon. They work just fine!</li>
    <li> Wow! I am a woman with short hair and this is awesome! All that I have to do is comb it like i want it to look and then it does the magic. All these people that go in for a trim monthly or so try this!</li>
    <li> Tried twice to trim my Scottie&#x27;s coat.  Cheap worthless Chinese XXXX.  Threw it in trash.</li>
    <li> It works okay, but is more of a hassle for thinning out my dogs&#x27; coats that I thought it would be, because of how quickly and easily hair gets caught in every crevice of the comb.</li>
    <li> Not great for thick hair, I am able to trim in some areas, like the top layer but not evenly and it&#x27;s tough to get through the thickness. Also, be careful to take it apart between use, if it gets wet the blades will rust.</li>
    <li> Perfect for short hair</li>
    <li> Just used this today on my husband.  What a nice haircut!  You do get the hang of it very quickly.  The results are wonderful and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> handy little tool for fast and travel worthy fix ups!</li>
    <li> I like this handy tool.  Works and it&#x27;s sharp.  It&#x27;s hard to cut a section even.  It will cut a lot when you first start going down on the hair with them.  I&#x27;m not sure how to not cut so much off at the beginning before getting to the bottom of the section.  For the price, it&#x27;s a nice tool to have for layering and touching up between haircuts.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Helpful to use between professional hair cuts. A very useful tool for those with shorter hair. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Since I don&#x27;t have much of it, I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 50 years. I used hairwiz for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find the original blades for years. I tried conair and other products with poor results so I went to an electric cutter which works OK. I recently bought two types of razor cutters on Amazon. This one works better than any I&#x27;ve ever used and uses double edge blares, easily found. Save a lot of $$ and try it..</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe it&#x27;s better for thicker hair.</li>
    <li> this is def one of those things you just have to know how to use. not hard to do just dont go in hacking away. i use it to cut my hair and my husbands. quick, easy, great hair cut. i love it.</li>
    <li> im just a dude who hates getting haircuts. i hate the small talk, i hate the ichty neck. sometimes i get an overwieght barber who thinks they need to rest thier belly on my arm rest they dont even ask nicely they just shove that belly on to my forearm and expect me to move(some times i endure it just for spite) or  they show me a mile of  talcom powdered cleavage hoping for a huge tip. very uncomfortable. also, I have neck problems so i cant bend my head down very far which seems to piss off my beauty school drop out &amp;#34;hair-stylist&amp;#34;. I tryed more expensive salons hoping for better service, nope not unless i spring for the shampoo, shoudler massage hot wax and spot free rinse. but anyways i still have to get hair cuts even after buying this because its so difficult to tell how much hair you are cutting. its nice for trimming my neck 2 weeks after a haircut. the angle you hold it at decides close you shave so it takes some skill to swipe some hair off while looking in the mirror. i&#x27;ll get used to it. i think. and it hurts a little. not much.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone who has thick hair and/or split ends because it&#x27;s a great way to trim up your hair. Especially for those who like styling their own hair, like me, would love this because it&#x27;s so much easier than using scissors. It also gives the tips of your hair a fresh look. It&#x27;s very easy to use; all you have to do it run the comb through your hair. Quick and simple. You can also use this on hair extensions and animal fur as well. I have layered hair, and it&#x27;s growing really long, so I use this product to add more layers into my hair and to make parts of my hair thinner. I bought this for an amazing price, and it arrived in just five days!</li>
    <li> One of the things you might get caught off guard with is that it&#x27;s not as big as you may think it is. I thought it was at least the size of a full comb, but it&#x27;s about one and a half times smaller than a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it works. One side is for thick hair, and the other is for thin hair. I used it on an older wig and it took no effort to even apply much pressure to make it cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that you just have to remove the large chunks of hair on the blades to let it cut well again and the hair can entangle into the blades. Other than that and the size, it&#x27;s great to have around if you want a little emergency trim done.</li>
    <li> Woah, it works just like the one at the salon! Never knew I could have my very own better not screw up on any of my kids hair. Lol</li>
    <li> Works fine, easy to change blades. Cheap and easy. I prefer to use thinning shears for ~$9 (personal preference). Good for removing split ends/frizz on short hair. Will keep it around for a long time.</li>
    <li> My product came quickly, it&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to clean. And It works great! I love it (:</li>
    <li> It works well, as it&#x27;s supposed to, and it can be opened very easily when you need to replace blades.</li>
    <li> Great item at an even better price.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times.  It works fine.  Has two cutting edges so it can cut close or course.  Eash to clean and seems to stay sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still figuring out how to properly use this, but I&#x27;m definitely making this a part of my hair-trimming routine. Cute packaging.</li>
    <li> I did not think that this item would not be available on Amazon! This is the only way I can cut my 16 month old boy&#x27;s hair. It works exactly as the description</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands hair and my old pair that I have had for 27 years is wearing out on the hinges. This is a perfect replacement ♥</li>
    <li> Nice product for doggy head trims, and cheap!</li>
    <li> Neat.  Bought two, one for the clumps on my long haired cat.</li>
    <li> Great product great price.</li>
    <li> Nice Tool. Easy to use. Good price. Easy to change the blades.</li>
    <li> Great for my boys&#x27; haircuts, for keeping my bangs tidy, without unnecessary trips to the hairdresser. The double length of the blade provides smooth and unchopped results. Back to the basics, to the pre-electric era, simple, cordless, battery-less living :)</li>
    <li> I tried to use this to thin out my son&#x27;s hair...He did not like it. He says it pulls his hair too much. ha...I think it did an ok job, not great, but so so.</li>
    <li> Would order again if needed.. It did what I wanted. Would order again. Don&#x27;t like doing this&#x27;I needed this works well.</li>
    <li> I like it for keeping my bangs trimmed.  My hairs grows fast and I do not want to go to the salon each time I need a trim.  It creates a feathered look which is what I wanted.  Hopefully, I will become brave enough to use it, all over, to maintain my layered hairstyle.</li>
    <li> This was a neat tool to add  too my collection, but unnfoutunetly it was not as &amp;#34;Well Made as I had hope.  Not as impressed with this as I thought I would be.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I use this to maintain my pixie cut with the help of some online tutorials. By now it has saved me hundreds of dollars. So worth it and awesome!</li>
    <li> This is A great tool!  I bought it to trim my Maltese who is terrified of groomers. I can comb her pretty!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean up my pixie, primarily the back where it get too thick between trims.  It was hard to control and not precise in any way.  It would be more useful if it at least came to a point on the handle.</li>
    <li> I love it. Worth the price of it. I love how my hair looks with the result of this product. If you ask me, I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started cutting my own hair - which is VERY thick and did my best cut yet with this \\&quot;hair cutter\\&quot; (aka razor comb).  It glides easily over the hair without grabbing and pulling, and it thinned my hair out beautifully.  Can&#x27;t beat the price - my neice bought one similar at a local beauty supply for more than 2x the price.</li>
    <li> I had one of these (unknown brand) and this one is as good in quality construction as I was hoping for. It works great my wife trims my hair and I trim our 18 months old grandson, very pleased.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the old venerable &amp;#34;Hair-Wiz&amp;#34;, and stocked up with as many replacement blades as I could since it doesn&#x27;t take regular double edged blades. But alas...I recently used my last blade and knew I&#x27;d need to find an alternative. I didn&#x27;t think the Tinkle Hair Cutter could possibly be as good, but since it was so cheap I decided to give it a try. The fact is, it&#x27;s as good, or better, than the Hair-Wiz, because it&#x27;s twice as wide, and has a longer handle. The key, however, is to use the best possible blades. The ones that came with it only lasted a couple of uses. But Amazon sells high quality double edged razor blades for a reasonable price. You can buy Wilkinson Sword, Feather, or a few other brands. They all work in this product, and should deliver the results you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> This idea is ideal IF it did what it claimed to do... My dogs hair kept getting tangled in between the razor and the plastic comb!!! All it did was pull my dogs hair, not a happy camper! I wouldn&#x27;t give this any stars, but I had too in order to post this....</li>
    <li> You would swear I had a professional cut. I DID...NOT! This is my new best friend. I just started making my own wigs and this is perfect for layering and shagging out your style. Very easy to use, very easy to hold. Just be careful as this thing really will cut where you tell it to. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I would never have known about this cutter if it wasn&#x27;t for Youtube.  the DIY girls are out there touting where to get the beauty supplies and tools from and Amazon seems to the place to get what you need when you need it. So thank you too Amazon.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I use it on my sons for when i cant get them to the hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Got it today and used it today.  Works great and keeps my tapered hairstyle neat!  Very happy</li>
    <li> Wonderful! love it! Excelent! As I grew up my mother used to have a kind of trimmer like this for her hair,  also my brother used it to trim his hair. That&#x27;s why I desided to buy this product. My mothers didn&#x27;t have a handle so this one is much better. Is very easy to clean and has great results to help make a professional looking hair cut. When you  only use clippers sometimes you&#x27;ll notice the parts when you changed the number of the clipper. But this wonderful trimmer vanishes all of that. Don&#x27;t pay attention to the low star rattings. Get it! great price!</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget! I imagined it a lot bigger when I was ordering it, but the smaller size is easier to work with! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is not the original trimcomb, but it does a great job. I trally like the two different depths of the teeth which controls how much hair you take off. Plus, the angle you hold the cutter can let you cut from almost bare to however much you want to leave. I can blend the sides with the upper hair and make my haircuts last twice as long with this.</li>
    <li> I love using this to trim my dead ends and cut my bangs! It works great! The price is also a plus.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the hair cutter I was using previously.  The razor blades are locked into place and don&#x27;t move once the top is on.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic tool that I wish I knew about when I first started cutting hair. It is so easy to use and adds great texture.</li>
    <li> This is not exactly what I thought it was, I was expecting to be able to razor cut my bangs, this is more to thin out thick hair.</li>
    <li> A great little comb! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is NOT what I had expected. I looked and looked around to find what everyone recommended...and this is NOT it. Go to Sally Beauty Supply and get theirs - it&#x27;s a couple dollars more but a MUCH better quality.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to be choppy this is the tool for you.  I really wanted something to cut my kids bangs straight.  It does work well on legs though.......</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I am sure I will be saving money by not going to the barber shop!</li>
    <li> TINKLE HAIR CUTTER DID VERY GOOD JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR THE TRIM WAS GREAT LOOKED VERY GOOD EASY TO USE</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This razor comb actually opens so the blades can be replaced.  Some brands do not.  I use it to restyle wigs and it has help me breathe niew life into them and save money on new purchases.</li>
    <li> This is great for trimming bangs! I am so glad that this hair cutter was so cheap. It&#x27;s a good quality and if you know how to trim your bangs up yourself, this is really great for doing so.</li>
    <li> My husband is the one who really uses them,and he says he really likes them. I used to get these regularly from another catalog,but they started selling cheaper made ones ,that had a comb on both ends,which made them hard to use,and one broke on him when he was using it for the first time . So I started to hunt online for one like this one. I hope they keep selling them,and we will keep using them.</li>
    <li> This was a great product I really enjoyed it. The price was affordable. Thank you very much. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Handy little tool but it takes some practice to keep from yanking your hair out or cutting too much. This isn&#x27;t so much for cutting your hair as it is for layering or thinning.  Good to have alongside a good pair of shears.</li>
    <li> Works well, maybe too well! Make sure to go slowly so you don&#x27;t take off too much hair.</li>
    <li> Makes self hair trimming possible and easy. Only drawback is plastic being flimsy; breaks fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair amazing feather layers! It&#x27;s light and easy to handle too! The only downside is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to change the blades.</li>
    <li> They are okay...Pulled out my dogs hair alittle..Can&#x27;t use on long hair..&lt;br /&gt;Now I keep her hair short so I can use them..</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the many high ratings and am not disappointed, it&#x27;s a nifty little tool to help keep thick hair in check. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I just used this item this past weekend although I have had it for a few months. I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> Very useful for a fast trim.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, uses standard double edge razor blades, a great trimming device.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades. Does the job.</li>
    <li> Use as a comb then works great, if you use it wrong then it wont work.</li>
    <li> Excellent cutter , even length on both sides , with smooth round edged teeth , unlike the cheap 99 cent one</li>
    <li> It works well to cut my three-year-old&#x27;s curly hair. He doesn&#x27;t sit still for long, so I&#x27;m afraid of cutting him with the scissors.  This is much safer and easier.  The blades can be replaced with regular double-sided razors, and the price is good as well.</li>
    <li> This economically priced hair cutter enables me to keep my hair just like I want it between trips to the barber.</li>
    <li> Can shape up my own pixie cut in minutes for a fraction of  a salon visit!  LOVE this little cutter</li>
    <li> This product intrigued me when I saw it and from the reviews it received, I decided to order it. It &amp;#34;is&amp;#34; easy to use, but beware that it takes a skilled hand to use this. I thought it would be easy, but I messed up the right side of my hair by applying a little more pressure that I should have and it took out a nice chunk of hair that is obvious. It is easy to use but my suggestion is to ensure that you gently slide the Tinkle Hair Cutter over the hair slow and deliberately in order to avoid an obvious mistake. In terms of working well, the blades are very sharp and it does cut the hair easily.</li>
    <li> works well very satisfied been using one of these for many years, just make sure to stock up on double edged razor blades</li>
    <li> I loved this tool, but be cautious with the angle of the blade and comb gently. I&#x27;ve also found that it works well for men to thin out in the summer - just stay away from the side burns!</li>
    <li> Great.  Arrived on time, works fine</li>
    <li> I got this because I wanted to style my hair - when I started styling my hair, I found that it was really easy to use, and actually a lot of fun - I will definitely be cutting my hair again with it soon! :D</li>
    <li> It is really good. Works well when I cut my hair and does not make it choppy. I loved it!</li>
    <li> This does just what it say it should, the only thing is that it tends to remove a lot more hair than you would think.</li>
    <li> i like the color of the hair cutter. It does a very good job cutting hair! It&#x27;s nice for layering also.</li>
    <li> I love it. So easy to use. I try few hair cutter, so far I think this is the best. Shipping is past</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to cutting my own hair, which is wavy and very thick. I&#x27;ve tried other razor combs, but I think this one is best, because of the longer cutting edge, the two cutting sides, and the replaceable blades. The price is the best also. The main thing is to use a light stroke and angle the comb so it doesn&#x27;t take too much hair at once. Requires some getting used to and some caution. Blades are very sharp, so easy on the pressure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I either do a sort of a loose, soft wedge with lots of fringe, a short pixie, or something in between. I start with the Flowbee vacuum-design DIY haircutter to get the basic shape. While it&#x27;s still wet, I put in some conditioner and razor it carefully all over. Then I rinse and blow-dry my hair more-or-less straight with a paddle brush, put in a silky leave-in conditioner (lots), and flat iron the front. Once it&#x27;s dry and flat, I can create the detail with the razor comb (without the mistakes that curls would cause), smoothing behind the ears and around the neck, shaping the crown, smoothing from back to front, and framing the face. Once the cut is complete, I can let it curl or flat iron it, either way, because it&#x27;s a balanced cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the Flowbee alone will leave the hair too chunky and unnatural, at least for thick hair. It&#x27;s an essential for me, though. The Flowbee site charges less than Amazon for their product. They&#x27;re based in Houston and will ship by UPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve repaired my boyfriend&#x27;s inexpensive haircuts with this, and it works very well at taking out bumps and ridges that aren&#x27;t meant to be there. I just have to be sure to put in lots of slick leave-in conditioner, so that it doesn&#x27;t pull. Also need to be sure the blades are sharp. (Another good way to do this is with a comb and thinning shears--the way the barbers do it, except they use regular scissors for this. You hold the section horizontal with the comb and carefully snip at it with the shears; keep combing down and lifting/snipping until all the bumps are blended out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say it causes split ends and frizz for them. Doesn&#x27;t do this for me at all. The thinning shears will make my hair look frizzy and frazzled if I&#x27;m not careful (so I rarely use them on myself), but the razor combs never do that to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you, and I hope this helps. It sure saves money, once you&#x27;re used to it. Also, you&#x27;ll notice more easily the mistakes a hairdresser makes if you know how to cut your own. You&#x27;ll want to continue giving yourself that special attention that is so expensive at a salon.l the bumps are blended out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say it causes split ends and frizz for them.

    <li> I bought this for me to use it on my hair to cut or trim..I like it because this is my favorite color simple and sharp..</li>
    <li> positives: the blades are sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negatives: brought this for my wigs, however using thiscutter on the wigs made the hair appear tangles and frizzy</li>
    <li> great sharp and quick haircut I love it, I would buy another one better than any other one I have had</li>
    <li> Great for a man in need of a do it yourself trim.  Works good, inexpensive, and convenient.  Will be buying more when blades get dull.</li>
    <li> Cheap, easy to use, and easily cleanable...what more could you ask for?? I&#x27;ve used it several times and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to trim up my sons hair.  Pulls alot and chunks the hair up quite a bit.  Worked weill on my adult hair that is super long.  Would not recommend for a child</li>
    <li> I started cutting my own hair a few years ago, found one of these locally, &amp; never looked back.  Then, I found them at amazon.com, &amp; saved money on the tool I use to save money on haircuts.  A couple of points; 1. I&#x27;m an old man, I keep my hair pretty short, so its not like I&#x27;m doing extensive \\&quot;styling\\&quot; or anything, just a basic haircut. 2. You can only do so much w/ a tool like this, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect &#x27;miracles&#x27;, if you know what I mean.  I also have elec. clippers, &amp; an elec. razor, but this \\&quot;hair cutter\\&quot; is the tool I use the most.  For doing your own, or someone else&#x27;s hair cuts, it works great for simple cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Have a GREAT day, Neighbors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying a couple more of these, they&#x27;re pretty &#x27;inexpensive&#x27;, so I want to keep 1 or 2 on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a GREAT day, Neighbors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:16 PM 2/5/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to update this review, since Ive been using this product about a year &amp; 1/2.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got 2 of these, the one I got here, &amp; one I picked up locally.&lt;br /&gt;In general, my opinion is the same, w/ this additional thought.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic used is very cheap, somewhat brittle, &amp; not very durable.  I have a habit of knocking the hair trimmings out of the cutter by tapping it on the counter or sink.  A few of the teeth have broken, which doesn&#x27;t make much difference to me, one cutter became useless because both retaining tabs broke.  The \\&quot;quality control\\&quot; is obviously nonexistent, both for the material, &amp; the cutter&#x27;s dimensions.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think its still a &#x27;good&#x27; product, because it works well for its intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the manufacturer would have more &#x27;pride&#x27; in their product, &amp; use better materials &amp; &#x27;quality control&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Many products made in China seem to have this problem, so I think American consumers should try a page from the Oriental book.&lt;br /&gt;*IF* we can find contact info for the manufacturer/owner, I think we should try to shame them into doing the right thing.  Some Orientals feel that &#x27;saving face&#x27; is important.  If we can appeal to that idea, we may be able to &#x27;encourage&#x27; them to produce better products.&lt;br /&gt;Just a thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a GREAT day, Neighbors!idea, we may be able to &#x27;encourage&#x27; them to produce better products.  Just a thought.    Have a GREAT day, Neighbors!</li>
    <li> I use it for the back bottom of my hair and it works well.  It is simple to use and handy.</li>
    <li> Bought it to texturize my hair. The razor included could be a little sharper but it can be changed easily.</li>
    <li> I have a short haircut and this tool helps me keep it looking good between cuts.  Contrary to the instructions, for me, it works better with my hair dry.  I have used it several times and the original blades are still sharp.  The instructions on the package are not very helpful.  Suggestion: Experiment with the tool on the side of your head rather than around the face to get the hang of how it works, gently testing out how it cuts at different angles.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair very short. It grows really fast and I didn&#x27;t realize how tough the maintenance would be (or really how pricey it would be). So I bought this after watching a youtube video of a girl showing how to use it on her pixie cut. I absolutely love this tool and use it once a week! I have used it to add layers, to trim my hair and to thin it out - I have very thick hair. It allows me to only need a professional haircut every 3 months, if that. I did learn the hard way to be careful which side you use depending on your desired outcome... but that was my own fault :) I can&#x27;t believe the price for this tool, as it&#x27;s really fantastic. I have already recommended it to anyone else who has a short cut or needs to thin out their hair regularly.</li>
    <li> My son hates getting his hair cut even with scissors. He is autistic &amp; this trimmer worked like magic, he thought I was combing his hair. The slight noise when the hair was being cut startled him a little bit. But this was a breeze compared to the torture we go through every time I cut his hair! This also made life easier for my older son who is in a body cast for hip surgery &amp; can&#x27;t go to the saloon now. Would have liked little bit more instructions.</li>
    <li> I use this to stretch out the time between haircuts and when my barber does not shape things correctly.  It has to be cleaned with each use, but it is easy to disassemble.</li>
    <li> cheap...cheap...cheap....</li>
    <li> Tinkle Hair Cutter&lt;br /&gt;Basically helped &#x27;hide&#x27; the mistakes of the haircut i gave my 2yr old... after about 6 uses, blade was dull &amp; it was garbage</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time researching to find the perfect tool to help me take care of my own hair needs. This is by far the easiest for someone who has no hair cutting experience but does know what she likes.  I have watched my hair being but every 4 weeks or so for years and have a good idea when the cut was done not well or the wrong tools used. The Tinkle Hair cutter is perfect for those smaller jobs in between cuttings or to tame an area that wasn&#x27;t done well in the first place. Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this item to trim my dogs hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in his late 40s and I had an idea that maybe I could stretch out the time between visits to the barber by using some kind of a razor type cutting tool. It&#x27;s really not about the money, just the hassle of having to take an hour off in the middle of the day.  So, I bought 2 Tinkle combs (somebody in their marketing department needs to come up with a better name) and tried them out.  The first time around, I got a little carried away and my hair looked like maybe I&#x27;d been on chemo for awhile.  It grew back. The next time I was more careful, used the &#x27;deep&#x27; side of the comb and my hair looked fine. With a pair of scissors and Tinkle comb, I have gradually learned how to maintain my hair. It&#x27;s a year now and I haven&#x27;t needed to go for a haircut.  I only cut after I have had a shower and my hair is wet. The key to a good hair cut is to use the deep side and comb it back through your hair on primarily on the sides of your head above the ears and to the back. I hold a 2nd mirror with one hand so I can see as I comb the back of my head to trim hair. Practice holding the comb at different angles to your head as this will also vary the amount of hair being cut with each pass through. If the comb doesn&#x27;t seem to be cutting much, you need to snap it open and rinse hair that has lodged around the razors. Snap it shut, and it&#x27;ll work like new. I&#x27;ve used the comb for 12 months and razors remain sharp.  My only complaint is that as the hair catches in the blade, I tend to whack the comb on the sink to clear it -- and after 6 months of use the constant whacking caused the tabs, that hold the razors in place, to break.  The comb should be built a little more solidly, but for the price, you treat it like a disposable with a 6-12 month life. I&#x27;ve skipped 4 haircuts @$30-40 each, and these days, I actually get compliments on my \\&quot;haircut\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love love love , always wanted one so happy I purchased . Makes layering my extension super easy . This was a great buy :)</li>
    <li> hair gets pulled, does not cut very well</li>
    <li> I have now bought four of them and given them as presents to friends in nursing homes.  They are very easy to use and work much better than the other brand one I used to have many years ago.  I wanted to give one a try again but I was amazed that not only do they still make them, but that there are so many to choose from!  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s rating system as it can usually be trusted if you read the reviews carefully.  I choose this one on the strength of the reviews for it already and it has been wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a nice even cut I found it was best to go slowly and go over the same area several times with the comb held almost vertically from your head.  Held at an angle with it not actually touching the head at all, you can be much more creative with the styles you can get from it.  I don&#x27;t have the skill to do a proper style from the beginning with it, but we find it wonderful for neatening up and restoring a style when it is starting to grow out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to help keep a person out of the salon or barber shop so often. Never takes off too much and does a slow and great job of keeping hair neat a long time between professionals.  I have natural curly hair and do not have to worry about cutting against the grain of the curl.  It does an excellent job and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much but it really works great for the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Makes cutting hair so easy ! I use it to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair ever since got it. And it turned out to be much better than lots of barber&#x27;s job. ( I&#x27;m totally amateur)</li>
    <li> i guess you get what you paid for! i was not satisfied with this product ripping and pulling my hair out! i would definitely never recommend this particular item to family and friends!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the cheapest haircut ever, and everyone has been telling me how much they like my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;m female and have a pixie cut. They say it looks better than when I was getting it cut professionally. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my fluffy cat&#x27;s fur, especially around her booty. This is a lot easier than trying to use shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my cat sees this brush, she comes running!</li>
    <li> Makes hair too choppy -- hard to use without making hair uneven.</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this brush I cut my own hair so this works better than scissors......if you are on the edge you should definitely get it</li>
    <li> Best hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used yet. Works great, especially with dry hair.  Be careful using the close cut--I cut too much off but it&#x27;s growing back. GREAT PRICE! GREAT PRODUCT! GREAT SELLER!  SELLER&#x27;S REPORT CARD:  A++++</li>
    <li> This is a good little instrument for in between haircuts when you don&#x27;t have the time to get to the hairstylist.  Not meant for all types of haircuts, just those with a lot of layering. You also need to have some innate talent for cutting hair or you are going to be sorry.</li>
    <li> really useful for giving my dog a haircut in the summer. Give his coat a nice short even cut without any effort. Does not make a buzzing noise to scare him!</li>
    <li> No more than it cost, I could not believe how good it is. I paid about $25.00 for another one at a local store, before I found this one. Took that one back. Love this one.</li>
    <li> Amazing :) Works great and it cuts well. I really like it. Shipped fast too. I ended up cutting all my hair off and no scissors required :) Love my hair :)</li>
    <li> Cut chunks out of my hair, and snagged it</li>
    <li> bought it for my dad and its exactly what he was looking for and it was delivered on time. He was happy so I am happy.</li>
    <li> This cutter does exactly what it states it will do. Wet your hair, comb thru it and you have a mini haircut.</li>
    <li> I have done my haircut at home. This device really helps to make my haircut more neat and trim. It is very easy to use, and it is also safety for your fingers.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying a product like this. I am a African American female and used the hair cutter to trim my synthetic and human hair wig. I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, nor do I know how to trim hair, but the cutter was effective and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I actually got two in the shipment which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I got this for cutting my wigs and it works well.</li>
    <li> This works great for trimming and thinning hair.  Easy to use and easy to replace the standard blades. Recommended, Thanks.</li>
    <li> you should check this out before you by this, you know what. broke it my hand, does not work at alll.selling stuff like this is poor business on you part. Im not going to ship these things back because i dont have the time or money!</li>
    <li> As someone who spent a long time in Marketing, I can&#x27;t begin to tell you what a terrible name this is for the product. But it works and it works well. Medications that made me lose hair and I do not want to spend money to pay someone to cut what is left. This makes it easy to do it myself. I will probably buy a second one just in case something breaks because it is plastic. I would have liked to see a replacement blade included, but I understand the need to keep the cost down.</li>
    <li> You can use this cutter to take the weight out of your hair or to layer/cut your hair at an angle. Like some other reviewers said, it does pull on your hair as your cutting it, so it&#x27;s not terribly comfortable. I have coarse wavy hair, so that could make it harder. However, if you can overlook that, it seems to do what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly on my family member&#x27;s hair that I cut.  It works just as I had hoped it would, and I haven&#x27;t had to replace the blade yet - it&#x27;s still just as sharp as it was when I bought it.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as the one I picked up previously at Sally&#x27;s.  Would snag the hair and the kids did not like that either.</li>
    <li> This item probably would function better on short dense hair. But they shipped it fast so I gave it a 3 rating. Not advising it for fine long hair, did not cut at all on either side.</li>
    <li> I bought one for a trim and my mom and her friend wanted one so I purchased 2 more.  The price is good and so is the quality.</li>
    <li> this was a waste of money. I only cut two heads with it nd needed new blades. the blades were thin nd bendy. should of went to sallys</li>
    <li> My hair has grown out and was looking like a hot mess. I was way too lazy to get on the phone and find out when my stylist was working so I ordered this little gadget. WOW it works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I easily sliced through the dead ends of my hair, making everything appear thinner and whispy. It&#x27;s super easy to use so unless you just get carried away with the chopping I doubt you could mess it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought this because I have a long haired guinea pig that needs his ends trimmed occasionally. This will make it super quick and easy to do!</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim the hair on my ears (I know, yuch). Anyway I was happy for about 5 seconds until I realized it had given me quite a few cuts.</li>
    <li> I use this sucker every few weeks the trim my bangs and it works like a pro. It&#x27;s not very expensive and has two different sides for cutting volume. I usually start with the side that cuts a lot of hair and once and then use the other side to tidy up the trim and fine tune any pieces I missed.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive trimmer for those quick trims of fly-away hair until you can get to the beauty salon or barber shop.  I have very short hair and require a professional trim every two weeks.  Problem is that I travel often for work and either can&#x27;t find, or don&#x27;t trust a strange practitioner to do my hair.  This is when this little tool comes in handy:  I use the side for short hair to give myself quick trims until I can get to my regular hair handler.</li>
    <li> Better than my &amp;#34;Flobby&amp;#34;  Always liked the &amp;#34;razor cut look and this one works great.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and the back grows out faster than the top so this is great to trim the back in between haircuts.</li>
    <li> I use this on my shih tzu (which I recognize wasn&#x27;t the intended purpose) but the blades need constant changing and the hair gets stuck in it. It still works okay but it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to use.</li>
    <li> I recieved one of these when I bought somthing for my dog. I cut my own hair (being I do a really good job). I keep my hair short and at times real short and love it. I thought I would try this because it is similiar to some blade razors at salons. It does an absolutely wonderful job. I will switch back and forth from layering with sissors and using this Tinkle Hair Cutter...Love it</li>
    <li> I like this product because it does a good job and I can replace the blades. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Like the product, great for trims between cuts for both men and women.  Used it also for my cat.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The razor is sharp and certainly cuts well.  As a thinning tool, on me personally, it removed too much hair and took a chunk out of the top of may head.  That said, I am a not a professional but have been cutting my own hair for 10 years so do have some degree of knowledge.  I ended up purchasing thinning shears for true thinning capability.  I now use the Tinkle for doing razor cutting of the hair.  It leaves a blended cut line versus the exact line that using regular scissors create.</li>
    <li> Make sure you choose the correct side on this little gem- one side will scalp you and the other will just texturize the hair or thin it out.  Great tool for self stylers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this twice, the first one broke , I thought maybe it was just a bad one , so I ordered&lt;br /&gt;a second one and that broke the same way.  Very cheap plastic. still looking for a better&lt;br /&gt;made one</li>
    <li> This little cute Hair razor is just what I needed!  It is quick and easy to use and saves me money of going to the barber shop. I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and was put to use on my dog&#x27;s chest/belly area! He&#x27;s a Chow/Labrador mix and FULL of hair! It worked PERFECTLY! I&#x27;m 71 yrs. old and remember an item very much like this being used on me! It is so easy to clean and the razor can easily be replaced when needed. It was a bit of nostalgia being able to use an item remembered from my childhood! It&#x27;s a great product, great price and was delivered very quickly after placing my order. VERY PLEASED!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the A-line look. But I hate going to the salon because I don&#x27;t like when a stranger cuts my hair to their standards instead of mine. I usually do my own hair for this reason but find it difficult to do layers the way a professional would do. I am definitely a picky person when it comes to my hair to say the least. But I was able to cut my hair exactly the way I wanted and I also was able to do in in less than half the time. It looks so good! Much better than the way I had attempted to do layers before without it. It&#x27;s wispy and light. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> So i just got this in the mail and tried to trim the layers around my face.  It&#x27;s not an easy sliding razor.  It was kind of dull but I guess for $3 I can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;m guessing if I want a super sharp, smooth sliding razor I need to fork over some cash.  I could use this probably on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  It may work better on thin hair...not sure yet.</li>
    <li> does what every one says...easy, smooth, sleek cuts love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to get the hang of but IF you are careful you won&#x27;t do much damage the first time :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great thinner and for MY needs, trims off what I don&#x27;t want and saves me tons of money and inane conversation with the barber.</li>
    <li> If you start slow and trim a little bit at a time while learning what cutting style works for you, this cutter saves you the hassle and expense of going to the salon. I found that my bangs looked the best when cut from behind (to avoid frizzy ends on top) and barely damp.</li>
    <li> if you didn&#x27;t get any results, thats because you need to put it at an angle. ALSO THE BLADE IS NOT AS SHARP AS I WANTED IT PLEASE FIX THIS</li>
    <li> Purchase to replace a lost stainless steel one, and think I like this one better.  Great for touch ups around neckline, plus I use to thin out some heavier areas that need a little lift.  Perfect if you need to extend regular hair cut for another week or so.  Have not changed blade out yer, however, it looks like it will be easier.</li>
    <li> Great device for thinning your hair. Uses 2 standard razor blades, which can be changed out with ease.  The top part slides to unlock the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The plastic peg, that holds the top piece, broke off after about 20 uses.  I had to order a new one.  Not bad for price.</li>
    <li> Junk, don&#x27;t waste your money poor performance as a tool it does not work as you think at all so save your money.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s shaved side.</li>
    <li> If you like to tinker around with you hair and want something low tech that is easy to use -  this is it.  My hair is extremely thick (my sister is a hair dresser and told me so as I thought the thickness of my hair is fairly average but she told me otherwise).  As a result, I need to thin the crown every two to three weeks to keep the layer shape I like.  I always messed up my hair when I tried to do it with a pair of scissors and find that these work great.</li>
    <li> I bought it to trem up the south end of my dog .Works great if you got a furry dog.Its easy to use blades can be changed out easy.</li>
    <li> i use this tool to layer my side bangs and all my hair. i also use it to fade my husband&#x27;s hair for his weekly military haircut. i would recommend this because it works well and is very easy to use. I wouldnt use this if you are majorily concerned about split ends. although i have not noticed split ends in my hair after using this, people have said that it is worse than just using hair cutting scissors</li>
    <li> The product is plastic but sturdy enough for its intended purpose. I would recommend it for keeping those frizzy hairs trimmed down in your 360&#x27;s between haircuts.  Also works well with tapering when used correctly. Disassembly and clean up are a breeze. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> i always see youtube gurus using a product like this when I see them cut their hair and everytime I go to sally&#x27;s beauty supply store, i find it quite expensive. This is a great deal and love it&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> first I&#x27;ll tell you what type of hair i have. My hair is past shoulder length and very thick. When i go to the stylist i get layers so lighten the load i have on my head. nowadays i&#x27;ve been coloring my my own hair and would just go and get a trim. now i dont have to leave my house to get a great haircut. with how much hair i have its hard to mess up with this razor comb. i section my hair and my first layer starts at my chin. you just comb downwards and use light pressure. it makes your ends jagged and thins out hair amazingly. i also use this to trim and layer my side bang. if your have thin hair then you&#x27;d have to be more careful. i also use this on my 1 1/2 yo son just to take a lil off so his hair isn&#x27;t touching his nose. its safe too. you cant cut yourself and it&#x27;s easy to clean. when your need new razors you can buy a 50-100 ct for just 10$ to replace the blades. I&#x27;m so happy i stumbled upon this, i&#x27;m saving so much money by cutting my own hair. the shipping was very fast as well. if you&#x27;re not sure you want to purchase this or worried you won&#x27;t do use it correctly there are ton of videos on youtube so watch a few of those before you buy it of use it. but for the money you cant go wrong. if your hair is thick and needs thinning, this is for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for thinning hair, and is a good economical option. I used it on my toddler son and myself. It did an ok job on his hair, but I found it very awkward to use on my hair (I have a pixie cut with longer bangs), especially in the back. The back of my head ended up looking patchy in places, but that could very well be operator error. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but this didn&#x27;t blow me away. That being said, for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it and will come in handy when one of us needs a quick touch up.</li>
    <li> I like these combs, wish that they came in metal, for longer use. If you are running on a tight budget, this is the thing for you. You cut by combing, then you can trim with scissors if you have long hair, to even it out.</li>
    <li> This works well on one of my cats, but I wish that the teeth were a little longer to be able to comb through long hair (thick) cats coats.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
    <li> The Diane Tinkle is well constructed and is easy to find replacement blades. Not only does it work well for human hair, it also works well for grooming many breeds of dogs and cats. Our German Shepherd recently underwent spinal surgery, I was able to use the Diane Tinkle to blend in his hair so the previously shaved area was less noticeable as his thick coat grew once again covering his back. The Diane Tinkle was also helpful to thin down our other dogs coats this summer when we experienced almost a month of temperatures hovering near or above the 100 degree mark.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair, doesn&#x27;t cut</li>
    <li> This is actually pretty awesome. It is cheap and plastic. The blade is easy to replace, and it makes shaping my haircuts so easy to do.</li>
    <li> I love this product just a little too much. Soon, I won&#x27;t have any hair left to play with! ;)</li>
    <li> This worked great!  Made cutting my hair very easy. Works well for a close layered look.</li>
    <li> Used it to trim Yorkie&#x27;s hair. It worked, but I found myself having to clean hair out of it after each swipe. Only the &#x27;short&#x27; side seemed to actually trim hair.</li>
    <li> I had a razor blade hair cutter similar to this one when I was a kid.  It worked great so I was hoping this one would work well, too.  I was not disappointed. This cutter holds two double-edged razor blades.  I bought it to trim our small dog&#x27;s hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> Bought this product hoping to help with matting on my cat&#x27;s fur.  This is definitely not effective for this purpose.</li>
    <li> It was all it was supposed to do.</li>
    <li> this is great it&#x27;s really great to use, I used it to thin my hair it worked really great so great I had to hide it so I don&#x27;t keep thinning my hair lol. but it&#x27;s highly recommended just watch videos on how to use it..</li>
    <li> I love this tinkle hair cutter. It&#x27;s very easy to use and my friend love it and I love it as well. Cut off my split ends very great and my friend hair is soft when she use this. I would recommend it to anyone who want their split ends to be cut off.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair with these, that was a little hard.Maybe i should practice more. it is very good because when the blades get dull they are easy to replace yourself without having to order special blades</li>
    <li> The angle of the blades made it impossible to use with my left hand, and trying to use it with my right hand was difficult to say the least... even then, it took literal whacking at the hair to get it to cut. would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for trimming my pixie cut. I would recommend this for someone with short hair, but it does require a little patience. It can  miss a lot of hairs, which I mostly noticed in my bangs. You made need to do some light trimming with scissors (for me, if was my bangs and around my ears), but this product is a great alternative to paying for cuts every few weeks.</li>
    <li> The item is OK yet the price would be better had I purchased it at my local beauty supply store</li>
    <li> I bought these after getting tired of bad hair cuts and getting ripped off by the hair dresser. I love how well they work, they are simple and they got here quickly. I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> An easy way to cut my toddlers bangs.</li>
    <li> Odd use I know, but bought it to quickly and easily get rid of doggie-dingleberries where fur was involved, instead of scissors, which get dangerous with strong, reluctant dogs. Works okay on clean hair for schnauzer, but not well on dirty hair. Barely worked on coarse Australian Shepherd hair. Lots of hair pulling seems to happen, maybe I dulled the blade quickly. So, for it&#x27;s intended use on people, I cannot say. For dogs, it is mediocre, but better than scissors for my dogs and my safety.</li>
    <li> works - ok.  Not bad for the money</li>
    <li> I use these for trimming the hair around my Shitzu face. They work great on pets and also humans. It is a good idea to buy the razor at the same time also. They are very easy to change. They use the double egde safety razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this tool recently because with a short haircut, little touch-ups here and there are a necessity if you don&#x27;t want to be running to the salon every couple of weeks to get a trim. That can be expensive and time-consuming! The Tinkle Hair Cutter allows me to trim my short hair at home when it&#x27;s getting a little rough around the edges, making trips to the hairdresser fewer and the savings substantial. For the few dollars you&#x27;ll spend on this product, your savings will add up in a very short amount of time. I&#x27;m sure the tool will also be of benefit if I let my hair grow long again at some point. Honestly, I wish I had bought one of these years ago!</li>
    <li> ive gotten two of these one for my dog and one for me i have bangs and i like to style them to the side so i use this to style for me, i got one for my dog i have a schnauzer and i use it on her hair either thin it out or cut out matted hair. great for the price</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t cut any of our cat or our child&#x27;s hair, we tried it for both.  My child&#x27;s hair is very fine and thick, our cats hair is medium and thick, it didn&#x27;t work for either.  The comb kept pulling on the hair and tangling it.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Simple concept but very useful. Easy to use, too. Using it on my toddler in trimming his hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product. It was so inexpensive and I&#x27;ve bought some pretty expensive hair cutters before. It works very well! It&#x27;s got two different sets of blades. I love it!</li>
    <li> I cut my daughters hair yesterday, I am going to do mine later today, I plan to use this on mine as well.&lt;br /&gt;this worked great on her hair, I also used a pair of hair scissors I ordered (and reviewed if you want to find the same ones, check my reviews), and it didn&#x27;t take us very long at all to fix her hair right up (her cousin cut it, ugh, kids lol), and it looks GREAT now! I have never cut hair in my life, so I was very scared trying this, however I did not want to go pay a salon $20+ to :&amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; her hair, and it still have to grow out to be truly &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;, however, it looks great and unless you look very close you cant tell anything ever even happened to it, it looks like it was cut at a salon!&lt;br /&gt;I owe this look to this little tool, not anything else, it allowed me layer her hair and fix it so that it looked better, and let me do this easily with no knowledge of cutting and shaping, but it was so easy to do with this little cheap tool. this is a must have!&lt;br /&gt;can be used for children, adults, and recommend for everyone to have, you can save soo much money to give yourself a trim in between trips to the salon and make those trips not so often! plus great to have if your kids decide to give themselves a haircut, this will fix it right up in no time! love it!</li>
    <li> Rating: Does the job, but hurts a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like: It gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: It is not as sharp, so it hurts because it pulls your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it works smoooth, easy to take some volume off of your hair and also give it a frequent trim. Useful for hair that need frequent trims to get rid of split ends.</li>
    <li> Got here on time, package top was ripped slightly but no damage to the cutter. Can&#x27;t wait to use it to trim my hair so much better then paying at the salon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok,  I have really thick hair,  didn&#x27;t really seem to change.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this is a great item and I needed a good razor for school. Everyone at school loved it.</li>
    <li> This arrived quicker than anticipated and was packaged well and it was not expensive. It also didn&#x27;t work for me, not even a little. It pulled and snagged and hurt and did not in anyway, &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; or shape or cut my hair. It did not work for my cat either. I tried and she just got annoyed, it clearly hurt her as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! I use it to cut my hair and thin it out! :3 it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> Works great.Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite little hair gadget! I&#x27;ve always cut my bangs or given myself a trim or layers when needed. This little shaver/cutter makes it easy, precise, and kinda fun lol. I even used it to give my brother a hair cut. Worked perfectly! The blades come out so you can clean them or replace them as needed. Love it!</li>
    <li> its easy to use and came fast</li>
    <li> very sharp works great</li>
    <li> Functional. But it kinda looks like a ten year cut your hair.</li>
    <li> didnt work well for me.</li>
    <li> I have this one already , but i haven&#x27;t received them yet. But i love the one i had brought at a beauty supply store when i was on vacation in LAS VEGAS, NV. and i went on amazon to see if i could find it and i did. But i didn&#x27;t know until i bought them, i brought three that it was coming from CHINA. But it&#x27;s  great I loved it until it broke.</li>
    <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T USED IT YET ,BUT I&#x27;M SURE I&#x27;LL LIKE IT</li>
    <li> This cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just like mom said it would.&lt;br /&gt;Some people say men don&#x27;t get their hair cut,&lt;br /&gt;but I think a Tinkle is exactly what every man needs.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product, and when I need more I will order it in the future. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Trimmed my hair short, looks very natural. You have to unscrew it to clean it, but it is fairly easy. Great product, especially considering the price!</li>
    <li> I have a long-haired Chihuahua who get serious clumps of snow all over due to his fine long hair.  He would never sit still if I used an electric razon but he loves to be brushed.  I combed his hair with Tinkle while he was sitting on my lap over several evenings and this works perfectly.  I trimmed all the long hair off his sides, chest and legs.  Boy what a difference it has made.  No more trips to the bathroom to use the hair dryer to melt the clumps.  He&#x27;s now a happy boy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bangs to thin them out. I like it, it&#x27;s rough at first but it&#x27;s probably because the blade is new but once you make the first cut it works. I really like it, I just wanted something simple. If you thinking about your whole head, I would recommend a metal handle. This is kind of flimsy for doing my hair and I have a lot of hair. But if it&#x27;s just for your bangs it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great .Trim between haircuts . Take off grey ends</li>
    <li> Im a hairstylist so I bought this to use for work. It works really well and shipped very fast, although it is very cheaply made. Within two weeks or so, the two parts that are supposed to hold it together broke off. So now I have to use tape to hold it in place.</li>
    <li> Just as the title says, it does what it says it will do cut hair. The blades are also replaceable.</li>
    <li> Arrived 2 days earlier and it really works.Thanx.</li>
    <li> Great for guys who have long leg hair. Just comb it to a shorter length without losing masculine look like shaving does.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I can now maintain my first pixie cut, and not have to worry about frequent salon visits. Love the price, the build, everything except the name of it. I did manage to ... give myself a &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; in my hair, my left hand is not as steady as my right, and I guess I accidentally angled the comb toward my head, and it took out a massive chunk. I will now, for the first time in my life, rock a bandanna to cover up my mistake. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the dent in the photo I provided, sorry for the poor quality.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my husband and he says it works great and even for trimming our Golden Retrievers too.</li>
    <li> Hair gets caught. Flimsy.</li>
    <li> I use this to touch up my side bangs every now and then when they get too long. I&#x27;m too nervous to touch the back of my hair with it :P but for touching up what I can see it&#x27;s great. I love it. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Received this today, and I was very impressed with it&#x27;s quality &amp; packaging. This is quite a deal in regards to price &amp; free shipping. A plus is that it is not disposable, you can easily change the blade when needed. Includes a side for thick hair, and the other side for thinner hair. There are no detailed instructions for use included. However, simply go to YouTube. There are plenty of videos available on how to use a &amp;#34;Razor Comb&amp;#34; properly. If you have never used one, there IS a proper way to use it without taking a chunk out of your hair! So research first!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty cool gadget for touch-up&#x27;s and texturizing!</li>
    <li> This has been useless to me and does not work well at all.  It has been given to Goodwill in the hopes that someone may get good use of it.</li>
    <li> i like it it does the work for wat it is made ....like the way its wide side n narrow side</li>
    <li> Works well for a quick trim.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> these are great!!! Now I can maintain my own pixie cut!</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I trim my short hair myself. Save lots of money is good when your on a tight budget and still want to look good.</li>
    <li> Does the job very conveniently.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I love it. It does a great cut and I don&#x27;t have to go the salon to ask for the cut I want and never get it. I ask for one thing and then have to go home and either revise it myself if I can or wear a bag over my head. Not with this little device. My hair is short though but it is very thick and oh-la-la this little cutter is wonderful. I highly recommend it, and you can do it yourself.</li>
    <li> Hard to use, but does cut your hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I picked up this item to texturize my hair and to help thin it out some when it gets thick. It works great for that purpose and has nice sharp interchangeable blades. It does seem to take out big chunks of hair, although, it is very close to the look I was going for. I would recommend these for anyone wanting to thin out their hair.</li>
    <li> This came included with the razor and is pretty sturdy and easy to use. The razors are easily replaceable. These uses 2 razors, and sometimes the hair that&#x27;s been cut gets stuck inbetween the cracks but it&#x27;s overall easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest in the world, but does it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> wow, this really works! even if you bought a new one every time you cut your hair, it would be a savings!</li>
    <li> I was spending at least $150 on my hair every six weeks and never got the look I wanted.  I wanted punk rock.  After purchasing this for a few dollars, I love my look and I&#x27;m saving a boat load.  I get compliments all the time on my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great between regular haircuts.it is everything it advertises . Eliminates many haircuts and saves money.i recommend it very highly.</li>
    <li> Great simple brush that allowed me to fix up trimming of our Yorkie that is terrified of groomers. Easy simple solution with easily replaceable blades.</li>
    <li> I actually really enjoyed using this. I used it on my 3 year old son who is always on the move. It was so much easier than trying to use scissors. And he&#x27;s terrified of clippers. I even used it on my hair to trim up the ends. It&#x27;s easy to use and kind of fun.  I feel like it was a reasonable price. And it made trimming my sons hair a little less stressful for both of us. I did have to touch up a couple of times on spots I missed but that was no big deal.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked great on my hair only one little problem. I thought it would work like my old one so I tried to use it as a regular comb. You can&#x27;t do that. You have to start at the ends and work up. I started at the top and worked down, I have a spot now that is much shorter than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, wonderful product. Maybe once my hair grows back in all over and gets even I can use this product again but until then it shall remain in my hair care stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking for the price it&#x27;d be a piece of junk. Not so . It&#x27;s really a neat little cutter and sharp. It does so much better than a pair of scissor thinners that I paid 3 times the amount for.</li>
    <li> Works great to trim my dogs facial areas.</li>
    <li> This razor comb works great for my punk/emo style, plus I can use it on my father&#x27;s short hair. So versatile! I&#x27;ve had this comb since Feb and haven&#x27;t had to replace the razors yet; but when I do it just uses the standard double-sided razors you can pick up for cheap anywhere. I don&#x27;t even use scissors anymore! If you&#x27;re looking for a razor comb, this is the one to buy...just as good as the expensive ones and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor ever!!!!!!! One side thins the other side creates jagged styles. I&#x27;ve been cutting hair ten years and I think this is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. :)</li>
</ol>
