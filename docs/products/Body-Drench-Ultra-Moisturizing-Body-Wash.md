    <li> As much as I love Body Drench lotion and was super excited to try this, I am not impressed. It doesn&#x27;t lather up very much at all.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Have always used just the body drench lotion, but now #bodywash.</li>
    <li> We have always been body drench customers and when we found the wash we were thrilled.  Not only does it have the refreshing scent of body drench but the moisture is a definite plus.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing body wash.  I use this, and the the body drench lotion afterwards.  Amazing the difference in my skin!!</li>
    <li> first time using this product, so far it is doing the  job. I was using Dove sensitive BW but my skin is very dry and itched a lot. With this product the problem is no longer.</li>

    <li> Just tried this soap as I have used the corresponding lotion for many years. The lotion never leaves oily residue on skin like so many lotions do so I figured the body soap would be similar. Scent is very mild and subtle which appeals to men &amp; women alike.  So far I&#x27;m finding that it&#x27;s a great body soap.</li>

    <li> I love this body wash. The scent is similar to baby powder, not too obtrusive. It mixes well with whatever other scents I use. Lathers up great. I will definately order agin. However it isn&#x27;t that easy to find, thanks amazon.</li>
