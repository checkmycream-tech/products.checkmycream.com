<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This tanning lotion is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I have tried a lot of different kinds!  It made me soo unbelievably dark within days! I just recently bought Ed Hardy&#x27;s Body Shots Extreme tanning lotion so I&#x27;m going to try it because it too has great reviews :)</li>
    <li> My son ordered this lotion for me and I LOVE IT!! WILL BE ORDERING MORE.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, even after tanning.  Tingles just enough and bronzes well.  The first time trying this i was skeptical, thinking i was just buying the name, but it is actually a great product!  It is much more affordable on amazon than at a salon.  Because of the tingle, if you do have sensitive skin, or have never used a tingle I would suggest buying a small packet to try before buying a whole bottle</li>
    <li> The bronzer smells of cinnamon, a refreshing change from all the fakey floral smells out there. The lotion&#x27;s tingle is not as relaxing as other tingle lotions I have tried. It also irritates my skin a bit more than other tingle lotions. The bronzer is decent but I have had better luck with the &amp;#34;Black &amp; Tan&amp;#34; brand. I will be purchasing a different brand next time. This is my second time trying JWOWW and I have not been impressed.</li>
    <li> This stuff gave me a very bad allergic reaction. I ended up going to the hospital due to he lotion. I have used some JWOWW products before. But this one.. idk what went wrong..</li>
    <li> Oh my ... God THIS IS THE BEST TANNING LOTION I HAVE EVER USED !!!!! It gets you dark soo fast and the tingle feels soo good but burnt soo good! &amp;#60;3 I recommend this to EVERYONE !!!! BUY THIS NOW WHILE YOU CAN !!!! Worth .. Your ... Money</li>
    <li> I thought that with the name Mad Hot Tingle Bronzer it would be hot and tingle a lot when used but I did not find that it was all that hot and it does not tingle as much either.&lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s not a bad tanning bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use Hot Green Tea by Swedish Beauty, it gives me the tingle and the hot that I am looking for.</li>
    <li> NOT A REAL GOOD BRONZER BUT HAS AN AWESOME TINGLE.  THE SCENT OF IT IS VERY HORRIBLE-  MUST SHOWER QUICKLY AFTER I USE THIS FOR SURE!</li>
    <li> The bronzer in this lotion is ok but the tingle is almost non-existent It may just be me because I like HOT HOT lotion!</li>
    <li> JWOWW products are some of the best tanning products. Gives me better color then the other one I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have tan skin and this helped deepen my color. Also smells good . I would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Love it. Try other tanning products but this is the best one. gets a good tan everytime</li>
    <li> love love this so much! A little goes a long way because it is a tingle. so don&#x27;t over do it!  also when you tan apply right before going into book no time before that. Also wait a few hours to shower after tanning because water reactivates tingle products.Has a nice smell. It makes you tan darker because  the blood goes to surface of your skin. Overall i am happy with this product product it goes for $90 and up in tanning salons!! This was a steel!</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion,i had fast delivery,the lotion itself is great this is the only lotion I use.I have ordered several bottles now.The lotion smells great has a really good tingle to it.Finally it gives you great color,i love love this lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing - like Cinnamon Red Hot gum. Gives me good color and good tingle!</li>
    <li> I didnt really want a tingle lotion but you have to eventually to break your plateau..I chose this one after a sample packet.  This lotion does have alot of tingle but I could tolerate it, it does make you red but not too bad.  I have gotten a little darker but the brown color seems to fade if I dont go tan everyday. I wouldnt recommend putting on your face as others have said cause that will burn you.  So all in all this is a very good lotion and you will feel like you have been set on fire but its tolerable.</li>
    <li> i so love this stuff i have not been able to find a lotion that really tingles this does i love it for real</li>
    <li> Terrible my skin welped up and i had an allergic reaction to it</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. It has a nice amount of bronzer and tingle. I would not recommend using it as soon as you start tanning because it&#x27;s a fairly strong tingler, I would wait until you get your base tan and do not use for your face. This will definitely get you darker. Smells so good and makes my skin so soft !</li>
    <li> Works great every time!!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a &amp;quot;mad hot&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;   tanning lotion.  And  most of the color washed right off.</li>
    <li> This lotion is insane ! It&#x27;s super HOT! But yes , it does get you dark . Be carful .... The tingle can be overpowering at first ! Do NOT put any tingle lotion on your face ! Talk about getting burnt , if this comes in contact with your face you&#x27;ll be burnt for a week !</li>
    <li> If you love tanning lotions that are hot and tingle this is a great lotion for you! It does what the name says. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either, but you need to like cinnamon because that is the main scent I get from it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. It has just the right amount of tingle along with bronzers.I would recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great tingle with great results! The smell wasn&#x27;t all that wonderful (very cinnamon-y to the point of smelling burnt) but I would deal with it any day since it works so well.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it claims, and causes the tingling sensation bringing your red blood cells to the surface. I would recommend putting it on 10-15 minutes prior to tanning to all your skin to absorb it and react. But we warned, keep this away from your faces, and any sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave it four stars as opposed to five is because of the lack of bronzing ability. It may as well not have any bronzers added to the formula. Yes you will tan faster, but this is because of the tingling aspect, not because of the additional bronzers that the product claims it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell like your typical tanning lotion either. ( which I personally like) it has a cinnamonny scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would order it again, but if I am looking for immediate color, I would combine this tingle with a bronzer to enhance the results.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion. Not a tingle to it though, just makes my skin hot!</li>
    <li> Just the right tingle. I&#x27;ve used other tingle bronszers and they really hurt but not this one. love it</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion, smells great leaves your skin soft and no greasiness after feeling. I&#x27;ve been using for almost 2 months now and after only a few weeks was so dark. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is I don&#x27;t feel a tingle like most. Great lotion for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my bottle for 2years and I am still completely in love with this tanning lotion!!! I tan very easily so I seen results after about 2 sessions. I&#x27;ve tried others just to see if I would like them more and quite frankly I stopped the bed in the middle of my session because I felt as the other lotion wasn&#x27;t working and put this on... Completely in love with it!!!</li>
    <li> Iam a natural red head irish with Italian as well so you can imagine how hard it is for me to get a nice tan but I started using this product and it dosnt burn or tingle to bad but only days and I have beautiful color</li>
    <li> grand daughters loved it and half the price of local stores. Even used at the beach  in Florida and got beautiful tan in one day.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, as for the tingle in it,I do not find it to be as intense as I find Bombshell or Ruby, but the lotion itself is quality and leaves skin soft and it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I have tanned twice using this lotion once in a low pressure 20 minute bed and again in a level 5 ergoline high pressure , neither time did I find the redness and high heat that I find in other lotions,&lt;br /&gt;I do reccomend not leaving this lotion in a hot car as it is a yogurt based skin care and will break down in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to tingles you may find this hot, I do not get that sensation from it.</li>
    <li> Too much tingle for me, it was overly irritating. While I still use JWOWW, I went back to the One and Done bronzer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many tingle lotions before I think this one had gotten me the darkest the fastes. The smell is very tolerable compared to some others. I loved it!</li>
    <li> This product works and i would purchase it again . I have used this lotion in the past and it has produced a rich dark color.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and works great. You can really feel the tingle and darkens quick :) which I like cause I&#x27;m one of those that like to see fast results instantly. Great price too, fast shipping.  Thanks again, highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a super intense tingle. I knew this going into it and it was the reason that I bought it. It does give you good color, but the tingle can be really painful. I can feel the tingle kicking in within five minutes of applying it and it&#x27;s before I even get into the bed. Also do not put it on your face. You will be in a world of pain. The smell is very nice and you still smell pretty good after you tan unlike a lot of other tanning lotions. I will probably not be buying this again because I decided I&#x27;m just not a fan of the tingle lotion family. But if you know you like tingle then I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like tingle lotion but it didn&#x27;t give me the feeling I liked and my tan faded did not like</li>
    <li> Works okay and smells like cinnamon. It like it but not my favorire</li>
    <li> I had to trade this for one that wasn&#x27;t a hot tingle.  When I wore it I broke out in a rash and burned and itched like crazy.  It&#x27;s a great product, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion on November 4th, and I received it on the 8th. It was fast delivery and I love this lotion so much!!!! I&#x27;ve been tanning for a week now with this lotion and I have awesome results I&#x27;m so dark already! Definitely buy this!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, but it left my skin looking mottled. At first I thought maybe I just got red in a weird pattern where it is a tingle (the tingle part is legitimate), but even days later,  and after tanning with it several times, my skin had tanned in the strangest, most uneven, mottled way. I had to buy another lotion and go tanning another few times just to even things out. I&#x27;ve never had a tanning lotion that caused me to tan in blotches before, and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lotions over the years. I&#x27;m not at all happy with this and would definitely not recommend wasting your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this three times. I do not care for this lotion at all. It does NOT have the &amp;#34;mad hot tingle&amp;#34; factor like it claims. It&#x27;s moderate to low at best. The scent is not pleasant. It&#x27;s fairly strong and everyone can smell it. It has that icky greasy feel. I ended giving mine to the girl working the evening tanning salon hours. Huge disappointment. I&#x27;ve used 10+ different hot tingle lotions. This one is clearly false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with ROAR lotion at the same time on Amazon. I really like ROAR, although the first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t like it. Usually I shower before putting on tingle and bronzer lotion. I think on that day I didn&#x27;t have time to bath, helping the tingle stuff to react with my clean bare skin. ROAR has an excellent bronzer as well.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of hot and tingle tanning lotions and this one is the best I have used. I love it. It is hot hot and much you tingle like not other. LOL . I hope this help you out.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend, she loves it.I did try it, I like it, however I am hooked on ed hardy obnoxious,</li>
    <li> Works great... a little bronzer and some great &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; factor.  If you like tingle you should try this. The fragrance is nice as well--not to flowery or sweet..almost smells like &amp;#34;Christmas&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER!!!!!! Not a fan of the scent but the results are great!!! I would highly recommend to everyone that uses tingle</li>
    <li> JWOWW products are always excellent when it comes to skin care and color. Even though it&#x27;s not considered one, I honestly think it&#x27;s a very luxurious lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mad hot tingle lotion above is wonderful for color; unfortunately, the tingle does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say this, now, I don&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t get hot. Because it does. But if you consistently use this lotion, just a few times, the tingle wears off quickly, although other tingle lotions I&#x27;ve used do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this lotion, then great! I support that decision. But definitely make sure to get a second lotion, something that does not have tingle in it. See, whenever you use the same product consistently, your skin sometimes gets super comfortable with the product. So, to keep your skin confused, switching it up about every few visits will help you receive the best results possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer other tingles to this, but I own this one and still use it occasionally. 7 out of 10. :)</li>
    <li> Now this product is a little different than what I am used to. I like the tingle but first time using it with a bronzer. After I used it a few times, I decided I really like the way it tans me. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try Mad Hot for a while. I was low on, Bombshell and unsure if I wanted to buy a bottle of Mad Hot or Bombshell, so I purchased a sample of Mad Hot. Was not impressed w MH scent. Tingle seemed low compared to Bombshell. Bronzer of MH Seems good though, not streaky!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t tingle or get hot. I&#x27;m usually satisfied with Australian Gold products. Not with this one though. Will not be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Just as described, very pleased</li>
    <li> It works great, but I wish it smelled different. It reminds me of scented candles on Thanksgiving, or pumpkin bread or something. That would be ok for air freshener, but not exactly what I want to smell like. I will use all of the bottle I have because it gives me great skin color, but I&#x27;ll probably look for something that smells better next time.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin so red for hours that it hurts..that&#x27;s how HOT it is!!!! Only thing is..I don&#x27;t get that bronzed tan after... or not YET!!</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed, have used several times with no visable results.  Have used much better bronzers in the past.  Would NOT reccomend this product..</li>
    <li> I like it, it helps me tan faster and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, just a different one. May try something else.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant on buying this product but boy am I glad that I did!!! It sinks into the skin within minutes, doesn&#x27;t leave you greesy, has a great fresh cinnamon sent and the more you add the greater the tingle! Be careful though! One little layer does get your blood flowing to the surface of your skin very quickly so don&#x27;t over do it! I really enjoy this product and I will get it from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned for a few months before using this product. Before I was using Australian gold tingle lotion and it was okay. I read the warning label about having a base tan before using but, I went ahead and tried it anyways. The tingle is defiantly intense. My body was blouchy red after 5 mins of tanning. I was kind of embarrassed to walk out of the salon hoping no one would see how red my chest was. But, after about an hour it went away and the tingles were a little intense but, I have a high tolerance to things so, I didn&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;m on my second week using the lotion and I&#x27;m only up to ten minutes (max 15 minutes bed) and I already look tan! Aside of the redness and tingle sensation I think it&#x27;s worth it. The redness only last 30 mins and it&#x27;s gone. Which doesn&#x27;t matter because I&#x27;m covered up due to the cold weather. My skin complexion is medium fair. I do burn if I don&#x27;t put sunscreen on after two hours of being in the sun, if that gives you a better idea. I do recommend this product if you want to tan fast and don&#x27;t like using bronzers. Just beware of the redness. I would defiantly tan a few times before using, or just try it on your legs and see how well you can stand the tingle. Best of luck on getting tanned!!</li>
    <li> JWoww was not joking... Mad Hot is probably the best description, as in the only adequate description for this awesome tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best tingle product!  Before using this product, it&#x27;s best to work your tan up to this level.  Try JWOWW 50X bronxer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of times and it shows amazing results after your first tanning session.  I&#x27;m a frequent tanner as well, and I love this lotion!!</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail today.Just used it and it works great!Will buy again!!&#x27;👍</li>
    <li> When i first put this on its cimmanon overload! And the after smell doesnt smell good to me. The tingle works a little bit while your tanning but afterwards i dont feel hot or like its working at all. I was dissapointed cuz ive used pink diamonds (which is very low and mild in tingle) but yet that one seems alot stronger then this lotion, What the heck? I used this like 4 times and to be honest i didnt notice any difference in my color. I went on the strong beds with the maximum time and still didnt see any results. I think tingle lotions are great for getting a deeper and darker tan and this didnt really do much. Jwoww &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; seems to work A LOT better for me and its not even a tingle lotion!   I am dissapointed with this lotion, since jwoww has a lot of great lotions, this one seems like one of the worst ones.</li>
    <li> bought this off another seller, and it was hot tingle, this did not do anything</li>
    <li> i have been tanning for a long time and I by no means have sensitive skin, I have never reacted negative to a lotion before. I used this lotion once and while in the bed my skin felt like it was on fire, it was actually painful. Afterwards my skin was immediately burnt bright red and swollen to the touch. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an allergic reaction or just a cheap crappy lotion but do not buy it. My skin is swollen and even hours later is still very tender and raw.bworat lotion experience ever.</li>
    <li> works great for me, I don&#x27;t like using a tingler everytime I tan but I will use it at least every 3rd time</li>
    <li> This is an Austrailian Gold product and I have always had good results using them. MAD HOT TINGLE lives up to its name for sure! If you have sensitive skin I would NOT recommend using this...its HOT!  I love it, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Leaves my skin feeling great after tanning and the scent is nice also. Its kind of a gingerbread scent not that burnt smell so many lotions have. I will be purchasing more!!</li>
    <li> Good product. I would recommend this to anyone who likes tingle lotion. I wish it was a little cheaper but what can ya do.</li>
    <li> I love the intoxicating but was not available.  This is decent but doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Intoxicating.  Please bring it back.</li>
    <li> This lotion seemed to work fantastic, however I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  It probably just a personal thing.  Also, right after using this product, my skin was bright red.  Almost like a sunburn.  The redness went away after about an hour.</li>
    <li> Little did i realize this is meant for use after you have a base tan. I felt like i was burning in the tanning bed from using this.</li>
    <li> Had never tired a hot tingle until JWOWW. The 1st few times I couldn&#x27;t lay long as it does get HOT &amp; the tingle felt like tiny needles poking. At 1st was uncomfortable but after a week my body adjusted &amp; there weren&#x27;t any problems. I don&#x27;t recommend using this if you plan to hold small children EVEN a few hours AFTER tanning!! I held my daughter &amp; some lotion rubbed off on her leg &amp; caused a red tingling patch on her leg. Also don&#x27;t recommend using at night. A few min after tanning the tingle &amp; heat really kick in &amp; can be uncomfortable at night when trying to go to sleep. Over all I do recommend this lotion if you need a quick color AND don&#x27;t mind the heat/tingle!!</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning lotion!.  This is one of the best tanning lotions I have EVER purchased.  It also has a great fresh smell! The seller mailed very quickly and it was very securely packaged.  I recommend this product and as well the merchant I purchased this from. A++++</li>
    <li> Oh how I have fallen absolutely head over heels for this product! First, the smell is wonderful! I don&#x27;t feel the need to shower afterwards, and quite frankly I don&#x27;t want to. I find myself smelling my skin throughout the day because it just smells so good! Has just the right amount of tingle too. This would be good for anybody&#x27;s first tingle lotion. But it&#x27;s amazing for experienced tanners to push you past the tanning &amp;#34;plateau&amp;#34;. Everybody should try this lotion. It&#x27;s not a fake or phony, it&#x27;s an amazing product, and it will get you the results you want! For the price it&#x27;s a total steal!</li>
    <li> Broke out in red burning rash within minutes of applying. Waste of money!  Will not take my chances on a lotion this expensive again.</li>
    <li> Love the cinnamon smell and the results</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this..It&#x27;s just an all around better lotion for me.  Wish the scent was coconut though, instead of the cinnamon.</li>
    <li> My husband Loves this! We, as a family, Hate it! He loves the tingle, we hate the burn, after he tans we can&#x27;t touch him nor him us.  My 3 year old grandson gave his papa a hug, and within 10 minutes he had broken out in welts wherever he touched him! The welts didn&#x27;t go away either, even after a cool bath, oatmeal soap, AND aloe vera smeared all over his little body.  The burning pain went away, but had red marks for 3 days! On the other hand, my husband comes home beat red and hot! He has to sit in the ac for a while to cool down! It is what the label says, &amp;#34; Mad Hot Tingle&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I expected a lot of tingle. I have gotten very good tingle before. I don&#x27;t feel that any tanning is doing its job unless it has very high tingle factor. This lotion had very low tingle.</li>
    <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t have one bit of tingle. I&#x27;ve been using Ruby, which I love, ran out and decided to try JWOW mad hot tingle. If you want tingle get Ruby!!! I promise you will be on fire within seconds but it&#x27;s the best tan!!!!</li>
    <li> Received outdated bottle. Smells old.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeee this lotion. It smells amazing and gets you really really tan! Definitely will be my lotion from now on.</li>
    <li> please do not buy. waste of money. it burns so bad  and after your out of the tanning bed it made me itch really bad and I felt like I was on fire and I was Burnt. I was red all over itching and freaking out  so please do not buy this product...</li>
    <li> If you are new to using tingle. Then yes this is a great product to use. I have very sensitive skin when it comes to using tingle. So when I used Jwoww and Snookie(tingle) both were great to build me up, to get use to the tingling sensation that it gives while tanning. I loved the product especially since it is a great starter kit for people&#x27;s first time. Granted I am not that crazy about the smell that jwoww tanning lotion. But overall like i said, if you are just starting off and have sensitive skin. Then I highly recommend this product. But since I am starting to get darker and darker. I am ready to start working my way up to stronger tingles.</li>
    <li> LOOVVVEEEEE this!!! Tingle is extreme but I really like the tingle. Keeps my skin soft too. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to beginners but for a quick tan this is great!!! Just make sure to shake the bottle before applying.</li>
    <li> A perfect tan. Will purchase again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too happy with this product, honestly.  I was expecting a hot tingler.  I work at a tanning salon, and even in our hottest bed, I don&#x27;t get itchy or &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m disappointed, really...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the price is great, and it got here really fast... So I was happy with that! :)  It was still about $15 cheaper online then it is in the salon with my 50% discount!</li>
    <li> I could sum this review up in one word: WOW. Yes, this product is appropriately named!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an experienced tanner by any stretch, but I have been going regularly for about 3 or 4 months now, so have had the chance to try about as many lotions. This is the FIRST one that I really felt made a difference. In fact, it made so much of one, I would suggest cutting down on your tanning time about 25-30% to see how you react to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAT/TINGLE&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the feeling I got from the product as more of a heat or warmth as opposed to a tingle, but I will say that I have no frame of reference to other products that tingle so I can&#x27;t really compare this. I did like how it made me feel though, tingle or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL&lt;br /&gt;It smells a Red Hot (cinnamon). It smells perfectly good to me, considering what it&#x27;s use is. I always see people posting about \\&quot;bad smell\\&quot; and in this case, it would be ridiculous comment. It&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for a tanning solution. Now, would I want it to be the smell I wore out on a first date? Not really. But I&#x27;ve never met a tanning solution where that would be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR&lt;br /&gt;On the color, I was floored...I will caution you to say make sure you apply this lotion evenly and all over because you WILL see any spots that you missed when you&#x27;re done. I may have to ask someone to put in on my upper back before the next time I tan so I don&#x27;t end up with a half-tanned back. Immediately after tanning, I noticed redness on my skin. I was hoping I didn&#x27;t actually burn, as I spent the same amount of time I usually spend in the bed. It&#x27;s only been 3 hours since I tanned and all of the redness has gone away, so I&#x27;m happy about that. My color has also evened out (those areas I missed aren&#x27;t as noticeable) and, assuming it all stays, is also noticeably darker than ever before...and yes, this was my first day using it. I will be thrilled if this actually lets me cut down on the number of days I spend in thebed by providing me excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as necessary, but at this point, I have no issue giving it 5 stars...this coming from a VERY hard to tan girl who has seen limited results up to this point.</li>
    <li> Works great and came quickly</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve gone for 2 sessions with this stuff and have already gotten told how dark I look by my boyfriend. Just don&#x27;t make the mistake of putting it on your face because it is kind of painful if you do since the skin there is more sensitive. Overall leaves a nice, dark, golden tan :)</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion smells great, but did not redden me or cause any tingling effect on me. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product! Must give it a try at least once if your looking for a great dark looking tan. Smells good as well :)</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion....but I expected it to be hotter!  But overall it good and I felt shades darker! Satisfied! :)</li>
    <li> I am fairly pale. I have been tanning about 6 times in the last 2.5 weeks. I have been using the &#x27;black bronzer&#x27; with no problems... THIS one made my whole body look like I had a major burn, so I went home and showered. Put on aloe, and within an hour my skin was getting back to normal. But for quite a while my skin was extremely hot and the &#x27;tingle&#x27; was more like jalapeños rubbed all over my body. Not fun. Maybe I had a weird allergic reaction to it.</li>
    <li> Turns me beat red for like 3-4 hours. Have used it several times and it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;ve been tanning. Not really impressed. Gets so hot I can barely stay in tanning bed for 10 minutes. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I have been an avid tanner for about six years and have tried lots of lotions. Tingle lotions are definitely my favorite. Jwow Mad Hot Tingle goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave blotches and gets pretty hot the first few times; but nothing you can&#x27;t handle. I noticed a color change the first time after tanning using the lotion! I love this lotion but my husband...not so much, for the simple fact that if my body gets near him before I take a shower after I tan, he gets red blotches on him and he said he itches. Haha oops! But other than that I would definitely buy Jwow Mad Hot Tingle Bronzer again :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is terrible. No awesome colors boost and not a hot tingle at all. I always use a tingle lotion and was very excited about this product, I just ended up being very disappointed. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it to anybody. The only good thing about it, it goes on your skin very nicely, not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Great lotion love it!!!!♡ Tingles but not overwhelming, works great!</li>
    <li> I apparently did not research this product as well as I thought I did but threw it away after using it just ONE time.....it was a total waste of time and money for me.....</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Not quite the tingle I expected, but gave me awesome color with the first use!</li>
    <li> Before buying this product I was aware that it had mad tingle. I used it twice and was able to tell a difference but the tingle was just too extreme for my skin and I had a reaction to it.</li>
    <li> I went to the tanning bed for the first time in about 2 years and i went in to tan, i bought a jwoww mad hot tingle sample pack cause it was new and the woman told me it was selling like hot cakes. Well I went in white as paper and when I come out my husband could not believe it he looked at me and all he could say was wowww!!! I know I was at least 5 shades darker then when I went in. It was unbelievable results. I used to tan all the time 5 days a week and I have to say this one time of tanning was better results then ever before</li>
    <li> If you buy this lotion, DO NOT put it on before you get to the tanning salon. If you do.....OUCH!!!! Otherwise it smells great and works great!</li>
    <li> Received ahead of schedule! Awesome!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I guess. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I am a regular tanner, and I was looking for a new lotion to try because I was running out of mine. I ordered this, and it was awful. I&#x27;m not sure if this was a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product, but it didn&#x27;t smell at all like it said it would and it had an awful smell after I was done tanning. I got out of the bed and my entire body was completely fried and in pain. This has never happened to me before using any other lotions that I&#x27;ve tried. I am definitely returning this lotion and trying something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale, like natural ghost, and I&#x27;ve been to the tanning bed 4 times in the past week and the 4th time I used this lotion and got 3x more tan than the other times combined. Not much tingle but perfect color</li>
    <li> saw a more tanner me after the first time, however if you have sensitive skin the &#x27;tingle&#x27; that comes with the product almost hurts when tanning, and I became itchy afterwards. I might have gotten an slight allergic reaction, so I gave it to my sister snd she uses it and loves it. it didn&#x27;t affect her skin.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR OPTIMAL TANNING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion does make you dark. I would definitely buy it again. Absolutely love the tingle bronzing lotions. Thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I bought a sample of this at the tanning salon and knew I had to have a bottle. I purchased this at an amazing price. Lotion smells great with a hint of cinnamon and creates a quick bronzing tan. It does get hot but not as hot as a thought. I would compare this to the Bombshell lotion. This is for sure be a repeat buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I don&#x27;t even indoor tan anymore. And its super hard for me to tan in the sun due to my eczema. So I always purchase a tingle, so when I go in the sun, I get a deep tan super fast. I received it Monday, laid out on Wednesday for twenty minutes &amp; already see results. I didn&#x27;t have a base tan or anything yet. I always love jennis products, I&#x27;ve tried every single one and they&#x27;re amazing.. So I knew this one wouldn&#x27;t let me down. The only thing that kinda sucked, and I see multiple people saying it.. Is that it expired in March. But that just means it&#x27;s not as potent. But what can you expect when you&#x27;re not paying the full price? So I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining when it still works, and was cheaper lol. Overall, it&#x27;s awesome and amazing. Can&#x27;t go wrong with jwoww products!</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot except for the tingle. I got great color lots of complements, but the tingle made my tanning experience something not to look forward to. If you like tingle then go right ahead and get this its great for tingle and great color. But if you don&#x27;t like tingle i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was really hot but you get use to it and now the tingle isn&#x27;t so bad but it still does its job wonderfully! And my color last twice as long as it has before.</li>
    <li> I got this bc all the reviews said it worked great and heightened your tan... I&#x27;m still waiting and I have a quarter of the bottle left. I had a good base tan and I tan almost every other day. with that being said no matter how much I put on or wether I go in the 60 booth or the high pressure bed I got nothing!! No tingle no color change. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face with no results. the only good thing about this product is the smell. very upset at this product!!!</li>
    <li> this is by far the best tingle tanning lotion that i have ever purchased!! i will definately be buying this item again.. i highly reccomend this product to anyone who is trying to&lt;br /&gt;get more color , faster!</li>
    <li> This lotion spreads on evenly and easily. The tingle is more of a burn,every time I use it I feel like I&#x27;ve been in the sun.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is great and it gave me the tingle I wanted I probably will not buy again but it was good for a change of smell and is perfect for a mild tingle. The lotion was delivered quickly and had no issues, I did like it but I want more tingle! Bombshell is something that I keep going back to, The bronzer worked, ok but the smell was great!</li>
    <li> I think this is a good DHA Free Tingle Lotion. The tingle is not strong at all, in fact I can&#x27;t feel it much, but I find that with all tingle lotions. I can barely feel them, even the ones that are touted as extremely HOT, like Ed Hardy Body Shots or DC Trinity.  I&#x27;m just not sensitive to the tingle ingredients I guess. I was very happy to discover this was DHA free, as I hate DHA bronzers because they&#x27;re just a hassle, &amp; I like to know that the color I&#x27;m getting is all my own, not fake tanner. If I wanna use  DHA, I&#x27;ll get a spray tan. This does contain natural bronzers tho, which do give you immediate color, but without the crappy side effects of DHA. Anyway, this smells great, like cinnamon cookies, &amp; vanilla yogurt, &amp; it gives me an awesome color boost. The packaging is gorgeous too! It&#x27;s also very moisturizing. I love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion itself is great; however, the lotion I received, was over a year old! I can tell this two ways, number one, I work in a tanning salon and deal with brand new bottles of this lotion daily and the consistency and smell are completely different! Not to mention, my boss (the owner who has been in the tanning business for over 30 years) knee right away from the fading on the bottle and the smell/consistency. I refuse to buy tanning lotion from this amazon seller ever again!</li>
    <li> I just have to say this lotion was amazing. Not crazy about the smell, but the results are AMAZING!!! I highly recommend any of Jwoww&#x27;s tanning lotions, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Favorite is her very first one :)</li>
    <li> I know tanning is supposed to be taboo but i have to say when I do this lotion is excellent. I don&#x27;t burn I darken, and my skin stays soft.&lt;br /&gt;It is way over priced at my spa so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I thought for it being \\&quot;mad hot\\&quot; that i would feel the tingle in this lotion. It doesnt even give u the tingle number. Ive used a tingle factor of 47 and had.more results than this lotion.</li>
    <li> Got product early excellent experience</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as strong of a tingle lotion as I would have liked but it gets the job done and smells great!</li>
    <li> Good but it&#x27;s HOTTT my skin felt a little raw touch stuff after laying in the tanning bed....I have to mix it with my snooki bronzer</li>
    <li> i have been using various tanning lotions over the past 7 years and this is the first time that i have been entirely turned off by the scent. i have been using this lotion the past week and mad hot tingle works, but not as well as some other lotions i have used. my all time favorite is obsidian by designer skin and it is a warming lotion but not much for tingle factor. i bought this because i wanted to try a jwoww lotion and the tingle was just a bonus. obsidian works much better on me and i love the scent of obsidian.&lt;br /&gt;mad hot tingle is the perfect description because it does have a major tingle and i turn red every single time.&lt;br /&gt;the $25 price was not bad compared to my salons hefty price tag of $60. there is no mistaking the lotion because of its cinnamon scent. i gave 3 stars because even though i do not love it, it is ok. its not horrible but i wont be purchasing this ever again.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works! I usually can withstand the bed for a full 12 minutes, I could only go for 2 once I put this lotion on. You experience red sensitive skin for about an hour after leaving the bed. if you are originally a pasty person I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have used so many tanning lotions, I lost count. But I can say this one (jwoww mad hot tingle bronzer 2013) is great! It&#x27;s the perfect amount of bronzer and tingle alot of tanning lotions have bronzers that streak you around your feet and hands but this one doesn&#x27;t at all and the tingle isn&#x27;t as hot as other ones I&#x27;ve used but I&#x27;ve noticed that the tingle jump starts my base tan and with the bronzer makes my color very pretty!!!i LOVE  this lotion even better than my insanely black</li>
    <li> This product seems to work well so far.  I does have a slight tingle to it, although I have had products with more of a tingle.</li>
    <li> Very nice. It keeps your tan longer and works great and also has many ingredients that helps keeps your skins very moist ..and I see alot different I dont dry out as mush this is a must have....</li>
    <li> No tingle at all!! Will not be buying any Jwoww products again.The Black Bronzer is also a 1 star product.</li>
    <li> when i ordered and was told it wa mad tingle i expected a little more tingle then i got, but will keep trying</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this lotion,it is a medium level tingle for me. Do not let the name scare you.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion rubs in well, and does not have a heavy ATO.(actually I noticed zero)&lt;br /&gt;This should be in everyone&#x27;s lotion rotation.It does give a nice color boost.</li>
    <li> I am huge fan of tingles so I was expecting this lotion to be crazy hot, but it wasn&#x27;t that intense. Still left me with a deep tan though! I am not crazy about the scent, smells sorta like cinnamon. I was previously using Risque Ritual, which I think is wayyyy stronger than this lotion. Overall I like it because of the color it gave me, despite the lack of tingle!</li>
    <li> I just used this lotion for the first time AND just went tanning for the first time in months (I was pretty pale). I am amazed at how much tanner I look just from this one tan session. This lotion is absolutely amazing!!! The smell is great, it&#x27;s a cinnamon smell and the tingle feels great and isn&#x27;t overkill like some lotions I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;d relate it to when your foot falls asleep and then gets that tingle feeling. It&#x27;s like that. lol My legs are actually as tan as the rest of my body and they usually take FOREVER to tan! I also used a tiny amount on my face and the tingle was definitely bearable. PROPS TO YOU JWOWW!! I&#x27;m recommending this to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Was disappointed that the lotion was expired! Maybe post that the tanning lotion is expired so buyers will be aware before purchasing! Still gonna try it out and pray it works! o</li>
    <li> I had heard the tingle would make a better color.  I left after one session with a serious burn.  Yes, it did turn into a nice tan, but the smell was not very pleasant and I itched for hours after leaving the salon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin by any means, this product was horrible. My skin felt like it was on fire, going tanning shouldn&#x27;t not be painful. I was disappointed also returned the item. I only thing I enjoyed was the scent kind of a cinnamon smell</li>
    <li> Love all of jwoww tanning products. Nice deep color with just the right amount of tingle. Great soft feeling skin along with great color.</li>
    <li> Great. Love the tingle</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used, it is very smooth and creamy and really hydrates your skin. If you are an experienced tingle user you will love this lotion, the tingle is strong but not overbearing or uncomfortable, and it has great bronzers that produce great golden brown color. The smell is also incredible, it smells kind of like cinnamon cake frosting, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that after tan smell. I would definitely recommend this lotion to anyone looking to achieve a great looking tan.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes you so dark! The first time I used it, it tingled but not so much anymore but I really don&#x27;t mind because of the results after you tan! Will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Amazing product - with just the right amount of tingle - smalls yummy too! Highly recommend - thought I&#x27;d never like anything more than Bombshell - but this is IT.</li>
    <li> If you like a Tingle and bronzer, get this product!  I used first time and could instantly tell a difference!  Will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> Jwoww mad hot tingle bronzer is the best tanning lotion i used in a long time&lt;br /&gt;my first day using it i can out looking darking and i love the hot tingle feel i felt afterwards&lt;br /&gt;worth what i paid for it</li>
    <li> I first bought this product from my tanners and fell in love its the best tingle lotion with wonderfully color.I been tanning for a good 20plus year tried and spent alot of money on did.lotions untilled this year when I learned about amozon now I&#x27;m saving money so I can try lots of lotions so far this one is my favorite and I ordered it threw Market Solution it arrived four days early plus I got a free packet to try I will be looking. For my products. To see if Market Solution carriers any thing I order in future ty Market solution &amp;Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I bought this product from amazon because it was way cheaper then at the tanning salon. The smell is awesome and smells the same as the one at the tanning salon I just didnt feel any tingle. I&#x27;ve heard that when buying lotions off of here that they will mix the lotion with regular lotion. Idk if that&#x27;s what happened but the product didnt come with any kind of seal on it.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and did my research on this tanning lotion before I purchased it. This is by far the best lotion I have EVER used!! I have tanned for ever and I never buy tingle lotion, but from my research you get darker faster with tingle so I tried it and it is wonderful! I used it with my base tan and with one, yes one use of this lotion I was DARK! I am so glad I tried it. So if your wanting to try this I would! This does work. I also wouldn&#x27;t buy it at a tanning salon it sales for 80 at mine. I would highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I love the jwoww one and done so I thought I&#x27;d love this lotion because I love tingle but this lotion does not work!! I couldn&#x27;t feel the tingle at all and the bronzers don&#x27;t work either. I tanned a week with this lotion and didn&#x27;t get any results</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! I had no base tan what so ever. I bought this lotion for 40% off at my salon so it was 45$(you do the math at how expensive it is normally at my salon!) I went into the high pressure tanning bed using this lotion for the max of 10 minutes because my skin doesn&#x27;t burn easily for some reason. Within the first use I already had a noticeable&lt;br /&gt;base tan. Not to mention the smell is amazing. It&#x27;s not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out like most lotions so. The only downside is that I feel very hot after using this lotion and definitely feel the tingle! From the reviews on here, I would recommend spending  the extra money and getting it from your salon. I just went my second time however and I am already tan! This lotion is so amazing. I used to tan religiously a couple years ago and never had any lotion that is this good.</li>
    <li> I love it .. I started to see a difference after just 2 times using it ! And I also got a free sample for the kardashian bronzer ! Who doesn&#x27;t love free samples ! Lol and I also got it in 2 days , a day 7before I expected :)</li>
    <li> Love the color and smell of the product but i think i personally may have had an allergic reaction to it. Once out of the tanning bed my skin was bright red and burning all over(only on the parts of the lotion was on) an it stayed like that for hours. I had to literally lay in the bed and not let anything touch me at all!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best it works . It really really works I&#x27;m so dark already after three uses.  Skin feels so soft I love the smell</li>
    <li> I wish I could try it!  I ordered this product and it says it&#x27;s been delivered,  but I do not have the product....  Interesting</li>
    <li> *please read* Before I type my review i read some of the other ones and see &amp;#34;allergic reaction, hurt, stings, ect&amp;#34; please note tingle does not mean like a minty tingle, this tingle can sting the first few times you use it. The first time I used tingle I got the highest tingle available and I thought It felt like a bunch of bee stings, I suggest trying a lighter tingle sample so you know how it will feel at first. You will get very red, it will sting a little, and you will feel hot. Always wash your hands after using, and if you have little ones try to shower before holding them just because it can feel ultra sensitive to them. Just wanted to share that for people who misinterpret the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, after a few uses it should/will get better. :-) now to my review, i am a pretty regular tanner, and I always purchase high quality lotions. Am I am very impressed by this product, I have naturally tan skin but In the winter my skin gets a really yellow undertone so I go 2+ days a week to even out. This stuff smells amazing!! Perfectly even bronze skin, sometimes tingle and bronzer together make me look orange but this made me look perfectly tan! I only need to go once a week, it helps my tan last longer and my skin is SUPER soft! I am so happy to find it on here for cheaper, my salon sells it for 63$, I can&#x27;t wait to purchase off here:-) Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love! And super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The consistency was nice and creamy. Definitely a cinnamon bun scent to it which was nice. After the tingle and red wore off I noticed a nice color change. I was easily 2 shades darker. The tingle factor seems to be in the medium range. I&#x27;m keeping this one in my rotation for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I just bought a little package of JWOWW Mad Hot Tingle and this is the best stuff on the market ever!  I had a medium tan, but I got DARK with this stuff in one time.  I paid $9.99 for a little one  where I go to the tanning bed at and I am getting ready to order the big one.  I usually rotate tanning lotions, but I am going to stick with this one for a while.  I had three friends today ask me how I got so dark fast because I kind of lost my tan because I had the flu for a week and didn&#x27;t go to the tanning bed.  Finally I found my favorite!  I figured it would be so hot that I couldn&#x27;t bare it, but I would rate the tingle a medium.  It seems like a lot of tingle lotions don&#x27;t tingle that much anymore.  I achieve a better tan by getting red all over and after about 30 minutes to an hour, I get an awesome tan.  It says it shouldn&#x27;t be used on the face, but it got my face really dark, also.  Just don&#x27;t touch kids after using this for a while.  It even says it on the bottle!  lol</li>
    <li> Great stuff, wonderful smell and tingle.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 out of 5 stars because rhis product was expired when it arrived it has two numbers on the bottem one is the serial number and the other one that says 9-9-14 is the expiration date! The product does smell really good and still gives a little tingle but not like your other tanning lotions that have the tingle factor, i do believe that Amazon could have sent a bottle that was in date especially if im paying all this money to have it sent to my house, i also think if it was in date when it arrived that itd also would live up to the name on the bottle &amp;#34;mad hot tingle&amp;#34;  other than that this product is ok! I did however purchase another bottle from jwoww&#x27;s collection the ink drink tanning lotion since i have tattoos and that bottle came in and doesn&#x27;t expire til 2016 so i was impressed with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for people who deicde to buy this &amp;#34;mad hot tingle&amp;#34; lotion pay attention to the reviews, most of them said it was expired and than some said it was a serial number but theres two a serial number and expiration date!!!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for quit some time now, and have tried a numerous amount of tanning lotions.  But out of all of them I have never gotten as goo as results than I did with this product.  It got me dark really fast and it smells like snicker doodles even after I get done tanning indent smell like a tanning bed instill smell like snicker doodles. I love this product and will be purchasing anagin in the feature.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I miss Shrine so much, and when they discontinued it I thought I would never find something as good. This product lives up to its expectations.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a sample of this from my local tanning salon for $10 (I know, I cringed too) to see if I liked it after hearing good things about this lotion. I LOVE THIS LOTION. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who is just starting to tan or who is inexperienced with tanning. You&#x27;ll want to have a base tan first. Once you do, this lotion will take you to a very deep bronze. Delivers a great tingle that even as an experienced tanner, I found intense. The bronzers are top notch as well because they DO NOT make you orange. I&#x27;m Irish and have ditched tanning lotions left and right because they left me looking like I rolled around in a bag of cheetos. This lotion has a really pleasant scent that reminds me of cinnamon gum like Big Red. The odor neutralizers work wonders and never leave me with that burnt skin smell (actually caused by bacteria on your skin that forms during the tanning process). I highly recommend this lotion to anyone looking to step up their tanning game and darken their tan. A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed using this product. It&#x27;s my new favorite lotion and I don&#x27;t see anything matching it for a while. Delivery was quick and the package wasn&#x27;t damaged at all. Great product and great purchase.</li>
    <li> Gives me great color and smells good. Well worth it for this white girl. I am really tan but always felt really white.</li>
    <li> By far on of my favorite tanning lotions. It does have a tingle to it, but not terrible. i tan every other day and I used his for only about 3 sessions and people noticed I was a lot darker! I now only tan once a week because this got me dark so fast!! Love it and definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> Tingles are not my faves but I feel like I do get darker w/ tingles. The scent is not pleasant, very cinnamon, extremely hot. After tanning my heart rate was pretty high. One day of use, I was pretty dark, darker than with other lotions that I have used recently. I would def go for Bombshell again before this one. It was kind of thick and took awhile to rub in...</li>
    <li> I tan all the time, I buy monthly packages and have tried different samples of lotions and bottles. This product is absolutely horrible. I&#x27;d imagine it gave me an allergic reaction but I would see all other lotions giving me the same effect. When I got out of the tanning bed, I was bright red with bumps on me and was very itchy. I was also burning hot, I felt like I was on fire. I tried this out two times thinking it was just the bed or how long I went in for that caused this but the same exact thing happened the second time. I would not recommend buying this product. I wish I never did because now I have a bottle for no use.</li>
    <li> Maybe I need to tan more to see a big difference but I like it</li>
    <li> Ive tried so many tanning lotion but this one was horrible. The tingle sensation was too strong, it felt like my skin was on fire and then I broke out in hives.</li>
    <li> I am a big Tingle Fan. Usually when I use them I turn real red and then when the red goes away I start to tan.&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews I thought this stuff would really tingle in a hot bed. It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It has a little tingle but I have had way hotter. The one thing I can say I did not get red like I was expecting but I got the tan.&lt;br /&gt;I had good results after the first time I tried it. I did have a light base tan already but I still noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Tingles for years and this product has tanned me faster then any of the others without the Hot Tingle.&lt;br /&gt;After I tried it and found out how it worked I started using it on my face also. Great results.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a Hot Tingle this is not the stuff. If your looking for a fast dark Tan it is great.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Way to intense of a tingle lotion. My body felt like it was on fire after 5 mins of being in the bed. Does not recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> This did not have the tingle I thought it would have. I will buy the lotion I bought last year.</li>
    <li> Only tanning brand I&#x27;ll use. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I always seem to stop getting tanned after so long but this helped me go further. I recommend it to anyone.. I also received it FAST.. Was very pleased..</li>
    <li> This lotion is great and my only reason for not giving 5stars is I really don&#x27;t like the smell. I mean its not bad I still use the lotion because it gives me great color but if I&#x27;m going to tan before going out, I wont use this one because I smell like that cinnamon gum lol maybe just me some might like it. That&#x27;s the only flaw, wish it had a different scent. Other than that its an awesome lotion!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful! Goes on smoothly, makes your skin extra soft. I used this twice in sun tan citys faster bed (15 mins tan time)... I can tell a major difference. The tingle in it to me isnt bad at all.... the hottest lotion ive used is ed hardys body shots. That one; at first was almost unbearable... this isn&#x27;t anything like that to me. Also it hasnt turned me any orange cokor... my skin is olive tone (italian).... it just gives me a sun kissed brown glow:)</li>
    <li> It gives me good color and its got the mad tingle part right but if I&#x27;m not careful after tanning its almost like I scrape the bronzer and skin that its coated off :( I love the smell because it reminds me of a chi tea latte</li>
    <li> Jwoww products never disappoint! I have used several different lotions and Jwoww products are my favorite by far. Love the color I get and tan less often.</li>
    <li> This tingler works very well, I am an avid tingle lotion user and I really do like this lotion. I will have to say that it&#x27;s tanning factor and tingle is right at the same level as the original bomb shell tingle lotion. The smell of this lotion is of a cinnamon infused with vanilla. I would definitely recommend this lotion but only to expert tanners or to those whom already have a base tan. Otherwise, you will burn. I&#x27;m still very partial to the bombshell lotion but I tried this on a whim. Now I can&#x27;t decide if I want to stick with this one or go back! It&#x27;s a hard decision but I may just stay with this one or try JWOWW&#x27;s Wedding White bronzing lotion next.</li>
    <li> First time trying tingle ever, I love jwoww other products decided to try this one and wow! Definitely gives me a nice dark tan!! I love it ! Only have to tan aboutt 4 times a wk when i use this lotion. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I loved it, works great and gets you dark fast. You will be red for a day and brown the next. I think is smells yummy. It smells like vanilla yogurt. It does make me itch for several hours after, but ever tingle I&#x27;ve ever used makes me itch. I will defiantly be buying it again when I want a tingle lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the atomic fireball candies. It feels like it too. You will notice a deeper tan within only a few uses. Not for inexperienced tanners.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be like the other tanning lotions she sells. It smells amazing and it made me incredibly tan. The downfall was it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; whatsoever. It was a consistent burning sensation that felt a lot like a horrible sunburn. I tan for twelve minutes each session and after only five I had to get out. I was red and had a hard time getting dressed. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, extremely hot tingle and dark bronzer. Product came very fast, only took a few days to receive. Would definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> By far the BEST tanning lotion ever. I love tingles and my tanning salon rarely has tingles in-stock so I turned to this site. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Perfect! EXACTLY what i wanted!</li>
    <li> According to the description,  I was anticipating a much stronger tingle.  If you LOVE tingle, I would not recommend this product.  The scent is like cinnamon buns, which was not terrible.  The lotion is kind of thick, but not too filmy.  Again, I was not impressed with the strength of the tingle.  If you like a little tingle, than I would def recommend this to you.  I have only used it about 3 times so far, and I am still undecided about the bronzing power the product boasts as well.  I would buy from  this seller again though, very fast shipping and flawless transaction!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. all of JWOWW&#x27;s lotions are recommended but this one by far is the best. I can feel the tingling sensation a lot!! I have sensitive skin and this stuff just does amazing, doesn&#x27;t cause me to be red or anything, and def. made me so much DARKER! my husband def. noticed and he usually never notices after just one session... I couldn&#x27;t get any darker with just the base tan I had, and this worked!!!! best one on the market so far!!!</li>
    <li> I love tingle + bronzing tanning lotions, however usually when it&#x27;s both in the bottle the tingle is not as strong. The same goes for this one here. The lotion smells lovely, goes on nicely - a little thicker than most other lotions though- and gives you great color. However, the tingle with this lotion is very mild. I am an experienced tanner, and only like to use tingle lotions. I would rate this one as low on the scale for the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; effect. If you are looking for a strong tingle and bronzing lotion I would recommend designer skins Ruby- now that one is amazing. However overall this jwoww one was pleasant to use so I&#x27;ll probably keep it in my rotation.</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t use to tingle lotions, like myself, then it is pretty hot. I&#x27;ve used it once and already got really good color from it. I&#x27;ve only tanned about 6 times this year and I was using Designer Skin Luminary left over from last year. I wanted to try this lotion, because it has great reviews and I like it. When I came home my husband said, wow, you&#x27;re really getting dark.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this lotion if you are going to work or anything afterward, because it is pretty hot. I felt really warm and itchy until i showered, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. The smell is like cinnamon sugar cookies. A couple of hours after tanning and it still smelled decent, just a little bit of the burning tanning smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try her other lotions and keep this one in my rotation as well. I will definitely buy this again. I bought mine from the vendor, Fusion Hardware. Fast shipping and no fake products!</li>
    <li> fake tanning lotion. did not even make me tingle or get red. i love jwoww tanning lotion, just not the fake kind</li>
    <li> this stuff gets me super dark its not extremely hot smells like cinnamon when u put it when you get out it smells like vanilla this stuff is great</li>
    <li> This tingle hurts!!! but its suppose to. It smells like christmas- cinnamon y. I got great color! I guess im just a sissy!</li>
    <li> Got this for my trophy wife. She&#x27;s a avid sunbed user. After two uses, I could see the difference this product made to her skin tone. She was a darker golden brown. She said she loves the tingle sensation and that this product at the tanning salon is priced 3 times as high. A great find here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m French and Irish, so tanning does NOT come easy for a gal like me. Second of all, I had just a slight tan to begin with thanks to Fiesta Sun Peach Paradise and Supre Snooki Ultra Dark Tan Maximizer, which I alternate back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I LOVE the Jwoww Mad Hot Tingle Bronzer!&lt;br /&gt;It has a spicy cinnamon scent, which I thought smelled good before and after tanning (didn&#x27;t seem to have the awful after smell) to it and the consistency isn&#x27;t too watery or too thick, spread on easily and didn&#x27;t drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not all up to par with the tanning lingo, so I have no idea what kind of bed I use. I just know that I lie down in it and the maximum time I can go is 12 minutes. I&#x27;ve been going for 12 minutes for a while, including today...the first time I used this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I probably should have gone down to 10 minutes or fewer, especially since I&#x27;ve never used a tingle lotion before...So I turned a little neon. BUT the heat sensation wasn&#x27;t at all what I was expecting. You do feel a little more heat than usual, but I was totally expecting something close to unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews where people were saying that they felt a burning sensation up to 3 hours after tanning, while I do kind of feel that, I think it&#x27;s more because I burned than because of the lotion. But again, it wasn&#x27;t awful. I was still able to go work out at the gym shortly after using the lotion and had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely recommend Jwoww Mad Hot Tingle Bronzer!</li>
