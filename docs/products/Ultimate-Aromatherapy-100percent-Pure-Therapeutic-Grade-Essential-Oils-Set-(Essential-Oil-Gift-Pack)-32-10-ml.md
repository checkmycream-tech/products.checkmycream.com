<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with the quality and assortment of this package. Truly pure oils at a great price. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition.  They all smell VERY strong.  A great deal...can&#x27;t wait to start using them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to oils but oh so pleased!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic set for everything you get. HOWEVER, the dropper caps drop REALLY fast. It makes it almost impossible to follow a formula, plus I have already run out of some of the oils because of how fast the droppers go.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  She absolutely loves them.  She has made her own cleaning products and uses the oils in them.  I cannot wait to hear what she does next with them.  Thanks for a great product and great service.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this set!  I also love the quality, variety and value!.  It has been so much fun learning and using these oils, I am totally hooked.  My second order from Edens Gardens is on it way now :)  I highly recommend both Edens Gardens and this set!</li>
    <li> Look, the oils themselves certaintly seem to be of high quality, which is why it blows my mind that one could package them in bottles that are so poorly designed. The inside of the lid of each bottle I open is dripping oil. What this means is that it is practically impossible to open a bottle with out at least getting oil on your hands. My fingers are missing a layer of skin as a result. As a result there is oil everywhere except where it should be. I live at 5000 feet, so the difference in pressure may be a factor. None-the-less, the packaging of these oils seems to be extremely poorly designed! Spend the extra money and get your oils from a vendor that cares about it&#x27;s customers!</li>
    <li> This set is great.  Many oils to try my own combinations and premixed scents that are fantastic.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough for someone getting started.</li>
    <li> I love this Ultimate Essential Oil Set because economically speaking this is a wonderful collection; it would have cost me a great deal more money had I made several separate purchases of the same items included in this kit. I know this because I&#x27;ve been pricing these for quite a while. Factor in the price of shipping you&#x27;ll only  paying $3.50 per bottle. There are 32 bottles in the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now speaking of the bottles these are the perfect size; they&#x27;re not too much because it would suck to get stuck with a fragrance you don&#x27;t like, and they&#x27;re not too little because a few drops go a long way; the fragrance is very potent. The lemon smells like lemon and the lavender smells like lavender. I&#x27;m looking forward to mixing these oils with both of my favorite a carrier oils--Jojoba or Almond oil--to make my own perfumes and body sprays.[[ASIN:B002RXEMHU Ultimate Aromatherapy Essential Oil Set- 32/10 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4.5 stars [pretend it&#x27;s 4.5] instead of five because no booklet comes with this set at all. So buy one of the many books listed here on Amazon about essential oils [like I did], or get the information online for free if you have the time to do the research.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a less expensive alternative this is it!! I was a DoTerra user and this meets the same quality for way less expense. It arrived quickly and the variety is awesome. I will definitely order again. Bottles are 10ml with the same droppers as DoTerra. This is a super buy. I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and bought these.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, fast shippment and great service is my experience with Edens Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for All!</li>
    <li> Edens Garden claims that the product is of 100% PURE.  If this is true then why can one not digest the oils?  There are companies who make therapeutic grade oils that can be digested because they are 100% PURE.  Edens Garden are cheap and the aroma does not stand up to other brands.  Always at the fine print on the bottle.  If you cannot digest it then why would you want to put it on your skin or in a diffuser?</li>
    <li> Wonderful Christmas present . Nice blends . wonderful for a starter kit. Would have been nice to have a small leaflet with a few blends to get you going or maybe a link to a web site but all in all this is a wonderful gift form beginner to advanced . Cant wait to add it to candles soaps lightbulb rings . etc .</li>
    <li> I just started learning Aromatherapy. I intend to use these in treatment. I&#x27;m a Clinical Massage Therapist, and even though I know little about essential oils. I can tell these are some very pure and clean oils. One whiff is all it takes. These are so clean. I&#x27;m looking forward to using these. Included are a few bottles of blended oils. The price is great for so many quality essential oils. If using for the their best theraputic potential, you&#x27;ll need a book on Aromatherapy to learn how to blend oils for specific conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped very fast and packaged securely. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; After a year of studying Aromatherapy and working with essential oils.....these are pure. The best I&#x27;ve used. For example; Tea Tree oil is anti bacterial and anti viral.  It promotes healing, too.  I used this Tea Tree on a client with  bed sores..decubitis ulcers.  After blending with a carrier oil(30 drops to 1 ounce of almond oil), I used, oil soaked, cotton balls on the area. I let them remain on her skin for 1/2hr..twice a day. Her ulcer began noticeable healing within 2 days. We caught it early. She was healed in a week and the ulcers haven&#x27;t returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It may be a good idea to study the oils, if using in treatment. A lot of pure grade oils can be safely ingested, though ingestion isn&#x27;t generally recommended in the US. Actually, it&#x27;s discouraged, but it&#x27;s routinely done in Europe with good results; however, some oils can be toxic. Really learning about the oils is a good idea. I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> My wife enjoys these!!</li>
    <li> This was the best starter kit I could have ever bought. The price is phenomenal for the amount, types, and quality of oils you receive. The oils themselves are clean, pure, and very aromatic. The shipping was so quick that I had only looked that morning to see what the arrival date would be (3 days after ordering) and discovered it was on my postal route for delivery. I had it in my hands just a couple hours later. :) When it arrived, it was in a small box with a small pamphlet inside. Loved the pamphlet as it had great little tid bits inside but I would recommend anyone just starting out (like myself) to purchase an aromatherapy book for detailed information and recipes. I have \\&quot;The Aromatherapy Bible\\&quot; by Gill Farrer-Halls. I will also be buying some of the other recommended books to add to my library. I will continue to purchase from Eden&#x27;s Garden as I need more oils already!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my set of oils.  However, I am a little disappointed because the myrrh is thick and sticky and smells like burn tires.  Myrrh is a scent I use a lot, but not being able to use this one out of 32 is not bad, I guess.  It is more expensive to buy the individual oils, so this is a good value.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the opportunity! I was able to get these and an amazing price! These are perfect for my family for every situation in health, beauty and energy!</li>
    <li> absolutely fabulous.  Good quality and great price.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this excellent set.  All of the oils are 100% pure.  Each bottle has printed information as to how to use.  Excellent quality!  Buy them- you won&#x27;t regret it.  A good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition from shipper. Amazed at the quality and price of these very pure clean smelling essential oils! I look forward to ordering more oils of this brand (Edens Garden)</li>
    <li> I like Lemon essential oil so much since this really makes me refreshed. The oil is really pure and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;If the shipping is free I would like to buy more and more.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my gf, she loved it and uses it, its a great to find out what sent you really like.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002RXEMHU Ultimate Aromatherapy 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils Set (Essential Oil Gift Pack)- 32/ 10 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These oils are lovely. The package arrived quick sharp- a week from the US to Thailand is super quick! They were well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are really helpfully colour coded- when you&#x27;re going to order 32 bottles- it&#x27;s handy to have them easily identifiable at a glance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used a couple of the oils so far but they&#x27;re top quality and very clean- as other reviewers so rightly say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a guide included in here, just a little booklet with tips in- but I think if you&#x27;re ordering 32 bottles you either already know what you&#x27;re doing or you&#x27;ve ordered literature on essential oils separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order from Edens Garden again, very impressed. Thanks very much :)</li>
    <li> I am very new to using essential oils after year of candle burning. Let me just say that this set has everything you need! It also has some wonderful \\&quot;blends\\&quot; that are for relaxation, meditation etc.Personally, I used Lavender topically on my kids bumps, bruises, and scratches. I also like to diffuse the different scents (much more healthier than a paraffin candle)) I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great variety, really good gift for anyone that is just getting into natural oils.</li>
    <li> So very happy how quickly it arrived, and happy with the oils! I ordered these without realizing I already have the half from the beginners kit. So now I have duplicates. Which isn&#x27;t a problem, as they will be used quickly anyway. But next I will be ordering the &amp;#34;create your own&amp;#34; set. :) Can&#x27;t wait! I love EG oils!</li>
    <li> I ordered these oils having no familiarity with them but assured by the reviews I read here. They showed up much sooner than their estimated arrival date and when I opened their box, it was to find them all snugly packaged and in attractive bottles. Daring a headache, I opened each and every bottle and I am completely content and delighted with the quality that I found. I was dubious about the synergy blends but those too were lovely and I look forward to finding a multitude of ways to use them. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This set was priced very well and it is a quality product. I was shocked that it came in such a tiny package, but when i opened it up i realized that they just did a super job of packing it in there. The oils smell wonderful and I love using them. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these EOs. As some reviewers have stated the EOs are slightly thinner than some of the other more expensive brands. However, this does not make them any less effective and they are a great value without the outrageous markup that you pay with Young Living or Doterra.</li>
    <li> I love these oils!  I have used them for everything from aromatherapy &amp; medicinal purposes, to making my own bath salts &amp; body butters.  They arrived in just two days.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and will do business with them in the future!  Excellent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This is something else. From this gift set I went on a rampage ordering specific ones in larger bottles because of how potent these oils are, in addition to the medicinal benefits they offer. The ones that I ordered in larger bottles had specific uses, but all the others have other uses that you just might find handy. They are not just for burning in oil diffusers, but there are other means of applications as well. You need to get at least this to start, and from there you can find your favorites.</li>
    <li> Im a little disapointed with the packaging. The oils came all jumbled up in a box and smell as if something leaked. I will have to find a container that fits them nicely. The basic care kit, on the other hand, came in a flat box that holds the oils nicely. I give a four due to poor packaging.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to get started in Aromatherapy I found this kit a great start as it had mixtures to use right away and also fragrances I have not used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I studied this art in the late 70&#x27;s and was looking to get back into this practice and their products got me re-excited about this art once again.</li>
    <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT ALL YEAR LONG IT WAS A GREAT BARGIN AND IT GAVRE ME THE OPPURTUNITY TO SEE WHICH OF THE FRAGRANCES WERE MY FAVS THANKS ALOT.</li>
    <li> I received this set as a gift from my husband and children after leaving many hints.  I did my research.  While I&#x27;m sure that there are many quality essential oil products from which to choose, I prefer to steer clear of those companies who promote New Age practices and ideology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are therapeutic grade oils which I use in my diffuser, in my laundry, on my face and body, on my pets and in my food.  Some of them are a bit &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s a personal preference, and the ones that I love, I love a lot and use often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite in this bundle is the Purification synergy blend. It lifts my mood on these dreary winter days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set if you are new to essential oils. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this quality and level of customer service.</li>
    <li> These oils are NOT pure. These are the only oils that have EVER given me a headache from the smell. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I love this set. The oils are very good quality. The scents are true to expectations. I keep them in the fridge to prolong their life.</li>
    <li> Included a wide variety of both calming and alerting scents.  I use aromatherapy with my students with Autism and they have responded very well.</li>
    <li> I did have one bottle of oil leak in shipment, and was addressed and replaced by the company. They are courteous, attended to my concerns promptly, and the value received with this product is terrific. With the leaking bottle, while opening box, the smell was wonderful!! Thank goodness it was the lemongrass, and not something else less aromatic. I have done business with this company previously, and will be doing so again and look forward to a long association with them.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these oils. I own a few from Young Living and after hearing their claims I was worried about using any thing else. After much research I finally decided to order these because they are consistently in the top three brands of oils recommended. I LOVE THEM. My friend brought her Young Living oils over and there is no difference. She was a little disappointed I think because she&#x27;s a rep and wanted there to be a distinct difference. Nope. I&#x27;m so pleased with this kit. It has everything you could possibly need.</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic collection and I love it. great variety and they are quality oils.</li>
    <li> wow!  I  Am blown  away!  on  my list of orders it had the latest expected delivery date and  the oils got here first.  I&#x27;ve never worked with aromatherapy before so being a beginner and that it was such a good price I was kind of expecting cheap packaging and subpar  quality  boy was I wrong. I  could smell the oils at the mail box so I thought there was a leak....  nope!  no leak at all they are just that powerful.  really quality oils really quick shipment  careful quality packaging  I&#x27;m so happy  with the whole thing.  the only down side?  now I want to play with my new oils but I&#x27;m still waiting on my carrier oils,  diffuser,  and oil candle bowl thing from other sellers haha.  super excited though really happy  :-D</li>
    <li> Very nice set. I wish there was another set which included only what this one lacks.</li>
    <li> Essential Oils are wonderful.  There is something in this kit to fit every need from sore throat to house cleaning.  I use them all of the time in the house and in the car.</li>
    <li> Love the selection and have used in room diffuser and car diffuser as well as mixed with organic coconut oils on the skin.  Great smell and quality overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Have been using over a long period of time and I have to tell you I love it.  I use the four thieves mix, and adoration mixes the most in baths.  My twin girls are rarely sick since we have been using this and the Booklet that came with it is an awesome reference for when I need to figure out what to use for a particular ache, pain or ailment.  I use a lot more oils now that I had the kit at a reasonable price to be able to try them all.</li>
    <li> Not great, I use a handful of the oils, but an okay starter set. If I had it to do over, I would research exactly what oils I wanted (Peppermint) and why (to flavor my homemade toothpaste, and rub on soar muscles) and try to get just those instead. Many scents don&#x27;t smell great so I don&#x27;t put them in my diffuser, and I&#x27;m too lazy to see what else they might be good for.</li>
    <li> My first kit.  I love it.  I took a class and now I am using it in more ways than cleaning.  I love the smells and and energy of the different smells.  I plan on playing with creating new one together and buying more scents!</li>
    <li> shipped quickly and product quality was very good</li>
    <li> I keep buying edens garden, great product. I use in diffuser and during massage. Myself and client s love.</li>
    <li> Love these essential oils!!</li>
    <li> These were a gift from my husband and I must say, ONE OF THE BEST GIFTS EVER! (And that is saying something after 30 years.) I love them and they have opened a brand new world up for me. He got them for me to make my own bath salt, but I am making cleaning sprays, using them as aromatherapy in our home, and using them for sprains, strains, and other things. Even helped our son with his toothache until he could get into see a Dentist. Great!!!! I am now taking classes to learn how to make more cleaning products, better medicinal usages, and still making my own bath salts! Love them and this company. I have tried Tea Tree in the past from two other sources and didn&#x27;t like them. I love this one.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and have bought from them multiple times. The scents are beautiful. The packaging is very nice, too. I use these in my diffuser, and in all my cleaning supplies, soap scenting, etc.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the 32 gift pack of essential oils to help myself and family with good health and wellness.  Within the couple of weeks of having the oils I have been able to help my sister with a huge cat scratch scar on her face with using Frankincense and Palmarosa oils which now has the scar gone.  Then I burned my arm very badly while removing a hot cookie sheet from the oven so I used the Palmarosa oil and within 5 days my burn is completely healed and now I almost have no trace of a very bad burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have also used the relaxation oil combinations in baths and in a mist diffuser for a wonderful night sleep. For anyone that gets headaches I have also found that having a hot compress with basil oil will get rid of your headache faster then anything I have ever done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend the Eden Garden products sold from Amazonn and for the great prices, you get quality and quantity to make your own healing and wellness possible for you and everyone you love and care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased additional oils to add to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the oil carrier that Eden Garden carries which has been a great help to me in keeping the oils in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would suggest purchasing a book that describes the endless uses each oil can do for our body, mind and spirit.  It is worth the read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the scents and the healing Eden Garden can do for you!  I know we have.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sampler a little over a year ago from Edens Garden and was very pleased.  As other reviewers have noted, the product arrives QUICKLY and is packaged well.  When you price out the individual oils, you are getting a good deal.  In fact, my only complaint is that there are a few oils I really won&#x27;t use.  Of course this is based on personal taste, but the wintergreen is just too caustic for me. On the other hand, this set gave me an opportunity to sample a lot of different oils, so now I know which ones I would like to use more regularly.  For those such as lavender (for relaxation) and eucalyptus (for clearing the sinuses), I just look for these oils in bulk now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a second set for my daughter&#x27;s science project and they have changed a few of the oils, which is nice.  She is having her classmates smell the different oils to see if they can identify them by smell.  Some of the oils are obvious (lavender and vanilla), but others such as rosemary, basil, and even grapefruit are harder to identify (at least for me).  One note about essential oils that I didn&#x27;t know until I purchased this product--they have a wide range of viscosity.  Patchouli can last forever, while lighter oils, such as citrus, can be used up in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them in a diffuser from Diffuser World, which ran about $125.  It is a bit noisy and doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch (design flaws), but the diffuser works great and allows me to rotate 5 different oils at any given time.  It has been great for relaxing and studying over the past year and we frequently use it to help set the mood for parties.</li>
    <li> the quality of the oils seems very good.  my only complaint is that the built in droppers let it come out so quickly that it&#x27;s very hard to count the drops.  I&#x27;m probably going to have to take them off and use a glass dropper when making some things as the number of drops is very important.  the other oils I&#x27;ve bought from Whole Foods all work well (as far as controlling the number of drops) but are more expensive.  so these are a very good value, just be prepared for the quick moving drops!</li>
    <li> Great products, fast shipping.  I will order from this seller again!  The Breath Easy formula works great in a diffuser at night for coughs and colds.  The next oil I want is Spruce, as I think it will be nice during the Christmas season!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with several of these oils.  While I am still fairly new to essential oils, I have a decent collection.  In an attempt to make a serum I found online, I bought this suggested set.  I used these oils to make a batch of homemade deodorant using a recipe I&#x27;ve used for years.  After using these oils in my deodorant I learned they do not do what other oils do-cut the stink.  I used tea tree and lavender and with other oils that does the trick.  Not with these oils.  And the cedarwood has a bitter, off scent that is not pleasing.  I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Love these oils. will be back for more.</li>
    <li> ive bought from them before and was happy so went for the set really happy with it and whats nice it includes a book of all the oils and descriptions on how to use them</li>
    <li> EXACTLY what I was wanting in an essential oils set. Superb quality oils, fantastic variety, &amp; would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I am very satisified with this product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Got it for the wife for Christmas to make soaps with and she loves it. A very good beginner set with a nice assortment of oils.</li>
    <li> I was greatly pleased with the oils. The packaging is nice and the informative booklet was appreciated.</li>
    <li> I love this set. It has a good variety of oils. I am not a professional, but enjoy using these at home and experimenting with them. They do cost a bit, but last a long time if you do not overuse them.</li>
    <li> I received this set in mid-December 2014.  The product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged very well with no damage.  I appreciate the booklet and leaflet that accompanied the shipment and I am still studying and experimenting with various uses for the oils.  One of my favorite synergy blends is the Four Thieves.  The pleasant aroma of clove is very nice.  I began applying it to the soles of my feet only 5 days ago and it really helped minimize the effects of a very bad cold.  This will now be part of my daily regimen to assist with immunity health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very pleased with the Good Night blend.  My father has suffered with insomnia for over one year.  At my request my mother began applying 2 drops to the soles of each foot 3 nights ago.  He awoke having slept more consecutive hours than he had done in months.  He suffers with very low energy and I believe with continued use of the Good Night oil his energy level with increase due to more restful sleep.  Thanks Edens Garden for great products.  My family and I are very grateful for the positive results we are experiencing.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, amazing company amazing price</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the oils in my diffuser (which is brand new) and I really didn&#x27;t smell anything. Then I used the CVS brand expired tea tree oil and I could smell it. A bit confusing, because the oils smell strong in the bottle. If I get better results, when I use them in products, I will update with a better review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the product arrived quickly, no spills and the packaging is nice enough to use as a gift.</li>
    <li> Love the price and love the selection of oils!</li>
    <li> I have been following a few blogs about essential oils written by those who sell doTerra and Young Life. I know NOTHING about essential oils, but did know I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much. I understand quality is all over the map with different companies. I really hit the jackpot with Eden&#x27;s Garden. I ordered the beginners best and the ultimate sets just to try them out. The ultimate has 36 different oil for around $100. I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; touch that with any other company. THEY ARE AMAZING! After getting them, I decided to research how they compared to the big dogs in the essential oil world. They are every bit as good if not better! They are of an extremely high quality. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and am already ordering more!</li>
    <li> arrived packaged beautifuly. no breakage.learning the many uses for aromatherapy and trying to use them for overall well being.&lt;br /&gt;found the complete book of essential oils and aromatherapy intresting reading</li>
    <li> There are a wide selection of oils...I love it!!!!  it is great for combining different scents to achieve different results...</li>
    <li> totally loved this set</li>
    <li> Great product. I enjoy these essential oils.</li>
    <li> These essential oils are of good quality and the price is great.  Very nice mix if you are interested into aromatherapy.  It even includes some of the more precious oils such as frankincense.</li>
    <li> I got this particular package because it had most of what I wad looking for,I am fairly new to essential oils although I have had different blends they have been ones that others have made fir me, but since I have a sever spinal curd injury I have been wanting them to blend myself because they really do help with pain, there is only a few missing out if this one that I thought came in it, but its ok, its an amazing set and the Size is perfect! Yes the droppers don&#x27;t really put out just a few drops at a time and that kinda sucks, but I.already knew this was a problem from other review&#x27;s so I just ordered this little plastic droppers and they work great and perhaps even a better way. They can so fast to,I have done allot of research on oils to fun which were best and of all the ones my sister and I looked at Edens Garden were truly one of the top the that are really 100% pure essential oils.I have read some.complain about that you can&#x27;t ingest these bit all the things I&#x27;ve read is that your really not supposed to anyway. I love this set and will be  more from Edens Garden again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the oils themselves, but disappointed in the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The oils are definitely 100% pure and good quality. I compared them with a friend who is a Young Living distributor and has a big collection. Some oils were slightly different, but for the most part, they were every bit as strong as the YL, smelled the same, and had the same healing effects. For the price, that&#x27;s amazing! You get triple the oils for your money. The only thing that bummed me out was the packaging. My sister ordered this same set a few weeks before I did. Hers was in perfect condition. A couple of my bottles had leaked slightly. The corner of my box was split through all 3 layers and I had to tape them. My box also didn&#x27;t include the booklet that tells you about the different oils and their uses. I&#x27;m not one to complain, but for $100 price tag I think the packaging should be perfect.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as my Doterra products</li>
    <li> Cypress-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Ultimate Aromatherapy 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils Set (Essential Oil Gift Pack)- 32/ 10 ml for my wife who makes soaps and bath essentials as a hobby/ business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife- Thought the essential oil set was a wonderful product to use for herbal aroma-therapeutic shampoos and soaps. The oils are of a nice quality for a reasonable price. I was looking into buying sandalwood, ylang-ylang and neroli oils from them possibly at a later date. I also use these oils for my personal use for both cleaning and relaxation. My daughter also will be benefiting from the use of Essential oils in the form of baby massage oil. All in all it is a good product and worth waiting a couple days to receive.</li>
    <li> The package came rather quick and it great shape.  I was susprised at how small they are...but they hold a lot of drops.  I have tried several different things already and just working on more and more.....</li>
    <li> Excellent value, properly packaged, arrived on time and excellent customer service! I can&#x27;t wait to run out....so I can buy more! I had a have very positive experience with Eden&#x27;s Garden and I will recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> I have discovered that the use of essential oils is very complicated! Much research should be done before they are used. I tried to use them with a carrier oil on my skin but discovered that my skin is too sensitive and that I break out in a rash. Now I am using the oils in a diffuser necklace and am having some success with this method of delivery.</li>
    <li> Very nice set. They all smell great.</li>
    <li> I really love all of Edens Garden oils. I have done a lot of homework on essential oils and this company to me is by far one of the best. I got the Ultimate set and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I will stay with Edens Garden for all my essential oils.</li>
    <li> These are just amazing. I love the synergy blends they chose to send with this set. This is the end-all-be-all of a starter kit for those who are semi-seasoned in their craft and want an array of both the essentials (tea tree, lemon, lavender, peppermint...) and the less frequently used yet necessary (patchouli, grapefruit, frankincense, cedar wood...). Eden&#x27;s Garden obviously knows they&#x27;re stuff because the 32 oils they chose in this set are often used together and contain an array of options that any practitioner would swoon over. The labeling is tasteful and natural, and I love how the oils look on my altar. Out of the package they immediately waft a bouquet of scents that harmonize well together, so every time I walk by them I get a friendly whiff. I&#x27;ve used the oils in several applications and each one is impeccably crafted and pure. The aroma, medicine, and vibration of all the oils are of high-quality and care. I think they take their name seriously. ;) You will be so happy you got the Ultimate set.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Edens Garden.  I have all the EOs I need now, for a fraction of the cost.  Great quality, no issues there.</li>
    <li> I love these essential oils. They are true quality at a reasonable price and I have already ordered another smaller set and some more individual ones. My grown daughters already have this on their list for Christmas!</li>
    <li> These are great oils.  They were packaged well, and any contact with the company was almost immediate.  My only criticism would be that the droppers aren&#x27;t that great, the oils come out really fast.  But the great quality of the oils combined with the great prices makes me happy.  I will be a long time customer of Eden&#x27;s Garden!</li>
    <li> There is no way these are pure therapeutic-grade essential oils.  The price says it all!  Also, the company even admits these oils shouldn&#x27;t be used internally.  Verdict:  I would NEVER use these oils for medicinal uses.</li>
    <li> A huge variety of different scents. I would definitely buy again for my ultrasonic diffuser. I might buy some more of it today in fact!</li>
    <li> I use my oils every day!&lt;br /&gt;I love them.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my wife who is going through massage therapy school.  It is an outstanding deal for the number of bottles received.  From what I have seen, some of these bottles can be quite expensive.  If there is a need for a complete set of oils, this is where to turn.</li>
    <li> Nice set. Well presented. Also includes a handy product guide that gives you a brief description on the use of each oil.</li>
    <li> i am new to aromatherapy, so this set has almost all scents you need to start making your own blends.</li>
    <li> I love this collection!  I have just started to learn about essential oils and it contains a lot of basic oils.  It does not contain several of the more expensive oils that are called for in many recipes that deal with skin issues.  But as a basic set of oils, it is a great start.  No droppers needed.  The bottles can easily dispense a drop or two at a time.  No storage container is provided, but I had a nice wooden box to fit everything in.</li>
    <li> I researched many brands before purchasing this set. I am so happy that I chose Edens Garden EO&#x27;s over the other pricey brands. As an EO newbie, I was glad I did my homework! Reviews on them were helpful and so positive and since I have been using the oils on family for their aches, pains, cosmetic and aromatherapy needs, I am now known as the &amp;#34;oil lady&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;medicine mama&amp;#34; :) I believe that God created plant life for our benefit and well being and I&#x27;m all about tapping into those resources that are natural! I appreciate a company that also gives back to charity like Edens Garden does! The booklet I got with my purchase was handy too! I plan to add much more of their oils to my collection since they are more affordable than the other brands I&#x27;ve looked into. So glad to have found this company!!!! Huge blessing to me and my family!</li>
    <li> Good quality of essential oils.  I love that you receive a few synergy blends and pure oils. I put a couple drops of the Relaxation blend on a handkerchief and leave it on my desktop. It keeps me breathing deep all day long to relieve stress and anxiety. I plan on making my own synergy blends with this big collection to choose from. I have dealt with Edens Garden before and they exceeded my expectations in solving a small shipping error. I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with my essential oils! they smell amazing and are amazing quality. This kit is great and the oils are a great size. I am very happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joneymi</li>
    <li> This was my best buy ever! I honestly don&#x27;t think it matters if you are a pro or a beginner this kit offers EOs that anyone could possibly need or want. It also gives a good intro into the EO world so one can figure out the best mix of what with what, the viscosity of different EOs, and what you like. if you have any interest in natural scents for oil, soapmaking, lotions, etc this is a good start and good to have on hand for replacements. Price is also OUTSTANDING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on another note for those who are not educated in EO PLZ get educated. These oils have to be used the right way or without the correct dilution can be dangerous! research mon amis!</li>
    <li> These are great quality oils, they are natural and pure!!! Will be ordering the rest of them.</li>
    <li> This boxed set has everything under the sun!  We have enjoyed the oils in our vaporizor and by using them in lotions and sprays.  Very very pleased with the selection and quality!</li>
    <li> Great selection for someone like me who is just getting into aromatherapy - there are a few oils that I wanted that aren&#x27;t in here, but it&#x27;s definitely easier to just buy a handful to add to the collection.  I have been trying new ones every day and do like the synergy blends as well - in fact, I&#x27;m wearing Adoration blend right now and have been focused and productive all day!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, I really do love it, they really cheer me up when I&#x27;m feeling down, I will be buying more at a later date....</li>
    <li> Initially, I was slightly disappointed because I had ordered a bigger set and received doubles of an oils and was my first purchase of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I must say, Edens Garden customer service is amazing. I contacted them and they got back to me and fixed the problem right away. I love these essential oils and would recommend purchasing from Edens Garden. I have not been disappointed at all with the oils I have used so far. Good Night is AMAZING for sleep! I&#x27;m overall very satisfied with my purchase and the GREAT customer service!</li>
    <li> Love making my own aromatherapy, so many options with this package!</li>
    <li> I have been using Edens garden essential oils for a while now. I love their oils and their fast service. I am going to order this package for my daughter for her birthday. She is just getting into the oils and I think edens garden are the very best for her to use on my grandson&#x27;s who are 4 and 6. This company is always my first choice when it comes to essential oils. Very affordable and therapeutic quality.</li>
    <li> It came in perfect condition, on time and was exactly what I expected it to be. Great quality, beautiful oils. They also labeled my personally chosen sets so that I knew whose was whose; very thoughtful!!</li>
    <li> These are the best oils I have ever tried!! They helped me, and I highly recommend these to everyone!  They smell wonderful, and they make you instantly happy when you are sad!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery and the variety is great! The only problem that I had was a couple of the bottles leaked because there was no &amp;#34;Keep upright&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;this is TOP&amp;#34; on the shipping box. Other than that I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Great quality &amp; value. These oils are therapeutic grade and can be reordered directly from the manufacturer when you pick the oils you use the most.</li>
    <li> I got it for a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Worth the money! All fragrances were in good condition when arrived. Also, they all are great,strong scents. Dont smell diluted or tampered with. Every individual scent also has a small description on back of things it can do.. great little tips! I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this product so far, and this company also. All the products hold true to the company labels and are just as soothing as said to be! : ) I use these constantly.. just wish it came with a few diff oils, but otherwise..no complaints!</li>
    <li> Packed in pretty bottles. I like the dropper cap so much better for measuring! We live in a rural area and practice what my grandmother calls old knowledge mixing herbs, oils and salts to treat many different physical problems. Just a lovely group of oils, quality is very nice.</li>
    <li> The item&#x27;s has arrived as expected.  I have over 5 year experience on aromatherapy, and I have to be honest...this little oils are amazing.  The oils are worth way more than then the actual price. When I receive the pack, I quickly opened every bottle to check the quality of the oils, and I was totally delighted.  I ordered oils before from the manufacturer, but until now this is one of my best purchase! Highly Recommend this for professional&#x27;s or for ordinary home use. Brilliant!!!</li>
    <li> Love these oils!  I let my adult children pick what they wanted and still have plenty left to choose from.  These oils don&#x27;t seem to be any less effective than my Young Living oils, and I got a lot more for my money as the bottles are twice the size.</li>
    <li> Great set.  Has almost everything to get you started.  Eden Gardens is great..</li>
    <li> These oils are wonderful!!!  I am a newbie to aromatherapy but thanks to Eden&#x27;s Garden, I am learning a lot. After just a few days I can already notice my skin is softer and smoother. I am now experimenting with using them for weight loss...more on that later. The price was right. The service was outstanding and I won&#x27;t stop until I&#x27;ve tried them all...muahahahaha. I highly recommend these oils.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with all of the oils I have gotten from Eden&#x27;s Garden.  They shipping is prompt and the product is very good quality.</li>
    <li> You have to try these oils they are to help health, an skin, an aging, also to make sprays to help your house an other. So try it.</li>
    <li> Great set for this newbie to essential oils.  I like that I can sample a bunch of them and decide which ones I like most I can then reorder just those.  My only disappointment was that I would have liked more detailed information about the properties and use of each oil, but I supplemented this set by purchasing a guide.</li>
    <li> Arrived without any leaks and they all smell great! Very potent so only use a few drops at a time.</li>
</ol>
