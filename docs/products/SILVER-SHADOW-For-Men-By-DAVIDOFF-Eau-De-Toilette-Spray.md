      <li>Great price, Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;Shipped and received in a timely</li>
      <li>Fragrance is a bit underrated and Davidoff is actually a great bargain considering that it can easily compete with the Dolce and Gabana fragrance</li>
      <li>I do want to say, I am not a cologne snob, I honestly had never even heard of Givenchy until that fateful day years</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know trendy cologne if every person around me was wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great fragrance for men, Great gift or just to try something new</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is not oaky or musky (like Brut), nor is it \\&quot;light\\&quot; and \\&quot;botanical\\&quot; like most AXE body spray.  </li>
      <li>This is a sexy cologne.</li>
      <li>So glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>My husband will love the cologne.</li>
      <li>Love smelling it on my husband.</li>
      <li>Not over the top</li>
      <li>Probably any occasion is appropriate for Shadow.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing, please buy from a reputable shop.  </li>
      <li>Makes a perfect birthday present.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>

      <li>though I rate it a 4, I honestly don&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the changes each season brings (and in life)...</li>
      <li>Bottom line - the scent is fantastic</li>
      <li>would recommend this scent to anyone who likes light musk and also likes softer scents.</li>
      <li>While there are better (or cheaper) deals available, this cologne is worth taking a chance.  </li>
      <li>You may get lucky, monitoring the price for a reduction or maybe Free Shipping</li>
      <li>The bottle is an extremely cool design and is well packaged.  </li>
      <li>knew of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water, but didn&#x27;t know Silver Shadow.</li>
      <li>It is very reasonably priced too!</li>
      <li>Silver Shadow might fall outside my Top 10, but I do enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this perfume could perform....very surprised that it smells as advertised.</li>
      <li>cologne collection has now surpassed 300 bottles and growing - you have to spend your money on something, right?  </li>
      <li>It seemed like a good choice for me since I usually try to keep more a classic scent in my cologne use.</li>
      <li>I love the blind buys that turn out to be a great cologne...</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this scent is that the duration is very long!  </li>
      <li>All the woman in my life really like it including my wife.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it smell very vanilla-creamy for some reason.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is really good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very upset</li>
      <li>Right now I am big on the citrus based fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Silver Shadow falls into this category - pleasantly surprised..</li>
      <li>This is a soft and a bit spicy ..</li>
      <li>Not sure if it is a knock-off -- however, the price is justified for the product.</li>
      <li>Used to, I was known as the Givenchy PI review guy who told a story in his review about how Givenchy PI made some major changes in life.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, at least worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it has potential \\&quot;Wow</li>
      <li>Remember that different people produce slightly different chemicals through their pores, so always try out new scent in person!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fragrance is out of the gates with a soft cedar/woodsy base note then finishes with a clean smelling vanilla amber scent that is unique.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband will love the cologne.</li>
    <li> Amber, Oakmoss, Saffron, Patchouli, Orange, Coriander and Cedar. Makes for a perfect mixture with this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it last almost all day.Great price and was received in excellent condition and in a reasonable time frame.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I ordered this product for my husband. He loves it. It is very reasonably priced too! Makes a perfect birthday present.</li>
    <li> The perfume is not original&lt;br /&gt;Is not strong or stable&lt;br /&gt;I am very upset</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying it out at a local store.  I thought the smell mixes well with my body.  Remember that different people produce slightly different chemicals through their pores, so always try out new scent in person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not oaky or musky (like Brut), nor is it \\&quot;light\\&quot; and \\&quot;botanical\\&quot; like most AXE body spray.  Instead, it smell a lot like coconut-vanilla-almond-cream.  Yes, it smell very vanilla-creamy for some reason.  I occassionally go hungry.  My favorite thing about this scent is that the duration is very long!  12 hours is no problem.  I regulary spray once about arm-length away and aim at my clavicle/neck region, and that&#x27;s it.  One bottle should last me a LOOONG time.  Highly recommended, at least worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, please buy from a reputable shop.  I already had experience buying copycats and it is not pleasant.  Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> This is a sexy cologne. So glad I bought it. It&#x27;s one of those gifts that ends up benefiting him and her.</li>
    <li> Used to, I was known as the Givenchy PI review guy who told a story in his review about how Givenchy PI made some major changes in life. I&#x27;m a bit older now and was looking for something a little different. My wife used to work in fragrance department so I&#x27;ve smelled and tested quite a lot of colognes over the years. I do want to say, I am not a cologne snob, I honestly had never even heard of Givenchy until that fateful day years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water, but didn&#x27;t know Silver Shadow. It seemed like a good choice for me since I usually try to keep more a classic scent in my cologne use. I wouldn&#x27;t know trendy cologne if every person around me was wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got this Silver Shadow during a Amazon-Christmas spree of cologne buying and though I rate it a 4, I honestly don&#x27;t like it very much. Don&#x27;t take that wrong, I think it&#x27;s a nice scent, but it&#x27;s a little too close to musky for me. I didn&#x27;t even know a site exists that shows you all of the ingredients or I would have skipped this one since my problem with musk is that I&#x27;m allergic to it. Even having said that, this scent reminded me a bit of a powdery, lighter version of Obsession. It&#x27;s just not for me. The quality of the fragrance was good though as was the longevity as it. I initially sprayed this on at 9 AM and it was still lingering some 8 hours later and also irritating my musk allergy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this scent to anyone who likes light musk and also likes softer scents.</li>
    <li> All the woman in my life really like it including my wife.  I&#x27;ve had woman I&#x27;ve never meet before ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing!  I only get that question when I&#x27;m wearing Silver Shadow.</li>
    <li> I think this perfume is fake. It doesn&#x27;t have a lasting smell. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this perfume could perform....very surprised that it smells as advertised. Not sure if it is a knock-off -- however, the price is justified for the product.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite......and mine too!!  ;)</li>
    <li> Best fragrance for men. Love smelling it on my husband. Fragrance is a bit underrated and Davidoff is actually a great bargain considering that it can easily compete with the Dolce and Gabana fragrance</li>
    <li> Good value for price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price, Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;Shipped and received in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;No complains item as described. Great fragrance for men, Great gift or just to try something new</li>
    <li> Call me crazy - I love the blind buys that turn out to be a great cologne... Silver Shadow falls into this category - pleasantly surprised.. The fragrance is out of the gates with a soft cedar/woodsy base note then finishes with a clean smelling vanilla amber scent that is unique.  The smell is almost addictive.  It is truly a best kept secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is above average, lasting about 6+ hours on the skin and a little longer on my shirtsleeve.  While I have not received any unsolicited compliments, I did receive compliments when asked about the fragrance I was wearing.  Sweetie also gave me the thumbs up in the morning and, again, at night when I got home.  The projection, or silage, is average.  The fragrance is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the amber and woodsy notes, I would suggest the best time of year to wear would be Fall and/or Winter.  Probably any occasion is appropriate for Shadow.  The bottle is an extremely cool design and is well packaged.  I am especially fond of the logo etching on the glass bottle.  Davidoff, nice job..!!  The value on Amazon is just under $30.00 for a small bottle (and you pay shipping).  While there are better (or cheaper) deals available, this cologne is worth taking a chance.  You may get lucky, monitoring the price for a reduction or maybe Free Shipping included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cologne collection has now surpassed 300 bottles and growing - you have to spend your money on something, right?  Silver Shadow might fall outside my Top 10, but I do enjoy the fragrance.  Right now I am big on the citrus based fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Silver Shadow 4.3 stars out of 5.  Bottom line - the scent is fantastic, it has potential \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;, longevity is above average, and the deal is average.  I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  Enjoy the changes each season brings (and in life)...</li>
    <li> This is a soft and a bit spicy .. Just enough to make people want to snuggle with ya. Not a slap you in the face smell</li>
    <li> This in is my second order in a year. Loved the service and the product.</li>
    <li> Gets lots of compliments</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this cologne for years.  Not over the top and I always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Great scent great price for a hard to find product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
