      <li>the lighting is perfect, and it looks gtreat.</li>
      <li>great product will make my wife vey very very happy</li>
      <li>The product is great.</li>
      <li>Still, if close up is not an issue for you, this is a great purchase.  </li>
      <li>This mirror LOOKS fabulous!!!  </li>
      <li>Description says it gives a bright reflection, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>product looks good but is non-functional.</li>
      <li>Good size and gives close up views.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with my item.  </li>
      <li>Nice compliment to my victorian home.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a mirror with a bright light this is not the one for you.</li>
      <li>Of course, I had to wade through the myriad of product lines on Google, but the most inexpensive prices were at Amazon.</li>
      <li>i love it and it looks better than i know..</li>
      <li>I have a circular shaped face and my reflection of my face barely fit in the magnified side!</li>
      <li>Glad that I chose this one.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product for personal grooming.  </li>
      <li>When plucking eyebrows, chin hairs or applying make-up, you will not find a better lighted mirror out there.  </li>
      <li>This mirror goes beautifully with my new bathroom décor.</li>
      <li>The product came quickly, in good condition, and was exactly as advertised - just like the one I had seen at the resort.</li>
      <li>The cord is long and the mirror swivels so that you can position it perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The light isn&#x27;t very bright but it works well enough for checking teeth or make-up.</li>
      <li>It has an easy on/off switch.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finish was pretty but being able to see my face is more important.</li>
      <li>and it really did light the mirror nicely.</li>
      <li>I thought that maybe the people who wrote those reviews were expecting salon-level light</li>
      <li>I use another light along with this mirror.</li>
      <li>As the reviews mention, the light around the mirror is virtually non-existent -</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the mirror, except my old one, which I broke, made by the same company, had an adjustment to make it higher, which I liked.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying using it; however, I really do wish the halo light was brighter.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because of the 8 inch mirror but the light takes up a good inch so the surface area is much smaller.  </li>
      <li>beautiful design, but of no use if you need it to also provide light, because the 15 watt bulb provides minimal light -- and the manufacturer says you cannot replace with higher watts.</li>
      <li>Great little mirror my wife loves it</li>
      <li>I like the two sides being useful.</li>
      <li>Will look at other Jerdon mirrors as they seem to have good ratings and evaluations.</li>
      <li>This vanity light is a brushed brass, light in color.</li>
      <li>The light is very dim - dimmer than the mirror I was replacing.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty and was recieved very well.</li>
      <li>and I thought I&#x27;d be fine with just a reasonable amount of light, but this mirror is virtually no different from my old one, which did not have a light.    </li>
      <li>this product is exactly what i wanted.  </li>
      <li>perfect size, not to big or to small.  </li>
      <li>This one&#x27;s even better than mine since it&#x27;s two-sided, featuring 6x close-up and regular lighted mirror sides.  </li>
      <li>First you have to diusassemble the mirror to get to the bulb, then you have to FIND a replacement bulb.</li>
      <li>The light was so dim, I couldn&#x27;t see a thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the light is too dim to apply make-up with accurately.</li>
      <li>I expected better for the price.</li>
      <li>We appreciated your cooperative adjustment on our order.</li>
      <li>This mirror is very classy and pretty.</li>
      <li>You will never fail to pluck even the smallest, tiniest, least visible hair again because with the light and the powerful mirror, you&#x27;ll see them all.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>But the light is not bright enough to \\&quot;see\\&quot; by and the magnification is just ok.    </li>
      <li>Lighting is very dim</li>
      <li>The light is not bright (as other reviewers stated), so I switched the bulb out for a higher output LED light and its much brighter.</li>
      <li>in fact, you won&#x27;t notice the light is on unless the room is totally dark!</li>
      <li>It was delivered early.</li>
      <li>it is much closer to brushed nickel.</li>
      <li>Probably you will have to purchase a night light (which is usually only eight watts), making the light even worse.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tough to see up close as you get older :)    </li>
      <li>I had a similar mirror previously and the light was brighter</li>
      <li>The light provided can only be seen in the dark!</li>

    <li> I would recommend this product and I would buy it again. It is everything I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This mirror LOOKS fabulous!!!  But the light is not bright enough to \\&quot;see\\&quot; by and the magnification is just ok.    I had tried a 5x and it was not strong enough, apparently a 6x isn&#x27;t either.  It&#x27;s tough to see up close as you get older :)    I think, for those over forty with close-up vision problems, you&#x27;d be happier with a 10x mirror.    Still, if close up is not an issue for you, this is a great purchase.  You just might want to replace the bulb for something brighter.</li>
    <li> Great little mirror my wife loves it, just wish she&#x27;d keep it off my subwoofer!  We&#x27;ve had it over a year now and it still works.</li>
    <li> This vanity light is a brushed brass, light in color. The light is not bright (as other reviewers stated), so I switched the bulb out for a higher output LED light and its much brighter. Nice compliment to my victorian home.</li>
    <li> product looks good but is non-functional. The lighting is ridiculously low power. You may as well wait for the sun to come up.</li>
    <li> I had seen the product in our room of a resort/spa at which we stayed, but they did not have any for guest purchase. I wrote down the mfg and model number and did a Google search for the product once we got home. Of course, I had to wade through the myriad of product lines on Google, but the most inexpensive prices were at Amazon. The product came quickly, in good condition, and was exactly as advertised - just like the one I had seen at the resort.</li>
    <li> beautiful design, but of no use if you need it to also provide light, because the 15 watt bulb provides minimal light -- and the manufacturer says you cannot replace with higher watts.</li>
    <li> Good size and gives close up views.</li>
    <li> not enough magnifying</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the light on this mirror did not work and was returned to the seller who did not have a replacement.  It was a Christmas gift for our mother and I&#x27;m now shopping for another lighted mirror.  Will look at other Jerdon mirrors as they seem to have good ratings and evaluations.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the mirror, except my old one, which I broke, made by the same company, had an adjustment to make it higher, which I liked. I like the two sides being useful.</li>
    <li> I bought this lighted mirror as a gift for my sister since I already have an earlier model.  This one&#x27;s even better than mine since it&#x27;s two-sided, featuring 6x close-up and regular lighted mirror sides.  When plucking eyebrows, chin hairs or applying make-up, you will not find a better lighted mirror out there.  This one&#x27;s the best!  You will never fail to pluck even the smallest, tiniest, least visible hair again because with the light and the powerful mirror, you&#x27;ll see them all.  This is a wonderful product for personal grooming.  The cord is long and the mirror swivels so that you can position it perfectly.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Description says it gives a bright reflection, but it doesn&#x27;t. The light is very dim - dimmer than the mirror I was replacing. I expected better for the price. Am returning.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the 8 inch mirror but the light takes up a good inch so the surface area is much smaller.  I have a circular shaped face and my reflection of my face barely fit in the magnified side!</li>
    <li> The product is great. I am really enjoying using it; however, I really do wish the halo light was brighter. I had a similar mirror previously and the light was brighter and it really did light the mirror nicely.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the color it is much closer to brushed nickel. Lighting is very dim</li>
    <li> this product is exactly what i wanted.  perfect size, not to big or to small.  the lighting is perfect, and it looks gtreat.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very classy and pretty. There is a regular mirror on one side that flips over to the 6x magnification. It has an easy on/off switch. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the light is too dim to apply make-up with accurately. I use another light along with this mirror. If you&#x27;re looking for a mirror with a bright light this is not the one for you.</li>
    <li> I had read all the reviews before ordering this product, so maybe I should have thought about it twice. As the reviews mention, the light around the mirror is virtually non-existent - in fact, you won&#x27;t notice the light is on unless the room is totally dark! I thought that maybe the people who wrote those reviews were expecting salon-level light and I thought I&#x27;d be fine with just a reasonable amount of light, but this mirror is virtually no different from my old one, which did not have a light.    I should mention that it is sturdy and the magnification is quite good, so I&#x27;m torn between wanting to keep it and being so frustrated with the fact that it has no lighting to speak of.  In the end, I will have to return it as it does not serve the purpose of a lighted table mirror.  If lighting is not important to you, you will likely have no issues with this mirror.</li>
    <li> i love it and it looks better than i know.. great product will make my wife vey very very happy</li>
    <li> It was delivered early. This mirror goes beautifully with my new bathroom décor. The light isn&#x27;t very bright but it works well enough for checking teeth or make-up. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my item.  I had been looking everywhere for a gold tone mirror to go with my bathroom which has gold fixtures.  I was perfect.</li>
    <li> I gave this mirror as a birthday gift. It is very pretty and was recieved very well. Glad that I chose this one.</li>
    <li> Sent it back. The light was so dim, I couldn&#x27;t see a thing.&lt;br /&gt;Finish was pretty but being able to see my face is more important.</li>
    <li> The finish we wanted was to be polished  brass but it was a dull color and the material was not polished brass. We appreciated your cooperative adjustment on our order.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Lighted\\&quot; mirror is a joke. The single lamp inside is 15 watts, incandescent (short life span). The light provided can only be seen in the dark! Even if you have eyes like a bat (why then would you need a lighted mirror?), you will sooner or later have to replace the incandescent bulb. First you have to diusassemble the mirror to get to the bulb, then you have to FIND a replacement bulb. Probably you will have to purchase a night light (which is usually only eight watts), making the light even worse.</li>
