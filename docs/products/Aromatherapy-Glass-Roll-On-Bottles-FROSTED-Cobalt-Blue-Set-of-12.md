      <li>Thank you for a nice product and speedy delivery..</li>
      <li>The roller caps,  however,  fit great and roll just fine.</li>
      <li>The roll-on top is easy to insert and the balls don&#x27;t pop out during use!</li>
      <li>Bottles are great, but the caps don&#x27;t screw on totally straight.</li>
      <li>These are awesome for diluting essential oils in!</li>
      <li>But I just make sure they are stored upright because you can&#x27;t beat the price for these bottles.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the Blue Glass roll on Bottles.</li>
      <li>Recommended to a friend and will buy again if I need more.</li>
      <li>Seem more like painted then frosted, but that&#x27;s mostly what you find these days.</li>
      <li>Perfect for dispensing your essential oil blends!</li>
      <li>sure.</li>
      <li>and they roll on great, just like the ones that I buy direct that already have mixes in them.  </li>
      <li>The rollers do not slide easily at all once oil has been put into the containers.</li>
      <li>They are easy to fill and the roller ball goes in place without alot of effort, for which I was grateful.</li>
      <li>well, the bottles are fine.</li>
      <li>Needed these little glass bottles for my wonderful doTerra products.</li>
      <li>Fantastic price and value.</li>
      <li>The roll tops do not roll smoothly, if at all.</li>
      <li>Great product for making homemade essential oil blends.</li>
      <li>They roll great and work well with my essential oils.</li>
      <li>They are great for my essential oil mixes!</li>
      <li>No one seems to be able to beat the price, and yet these are very high quality and frosted colbalt.  </li>
      <li>Great little bottles.  </li>
      <li>I wished the ball was a better roller like my clear ones with a steel ball.</li>
      <li>Like the bottles, have only used one so far, roller ball doesnt seem to want to roll all that great</li>
      <li>I give away a lot to family, because I blend my own essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, its a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I love these for mixing my essential oil.  </li>
      <li>Love to use these I think I currently have over 50.</li>
      <li>This seller is very helpful.</li>
      <li>Very well made</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I liked that they are blue and not clear</li>
      <li>These are great roll on bottles and were actually a lot bigger than I expected!</li>
      <li>A couple of my roller balls require a little more effort to roll.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s happened on nearly all of them,  in two separate orders.  </li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any chipping or peeling with these.</li>
      <li>Have used 6 of them so far</li>
      <li>The plastic ball doesn&#x27;t rotate as much as I would like, I think in the future I will only use ones with metal roller balls</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is that if  you use the mix frequently the ball comes out!  </li>
      <li>Got them quickly, pretty decent price, not as thick and frosted as some others I have bought off of Amazon before.</li>
      <li>Its hard to see how full the bottle is and the roller balls take a while to work correctly.  </li>
      <li>The roller are a tight fit, but they all go in, and because they&#x27;re tight, I don&#x27;t worry about leaks.  </li>

<li> Total waste of my money!!</li>
<li> They are a dark navy close to black.</li>
<li> I will buy again, not a huge issue!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it was from me pushing down too hard when trying to get the roller locked in -- but it takes a lot of pressure to get the oil rolled out!</li>
<li> So small and portable!</li>
<li> They do not roll on at all :(</li>
<li> That  is very inconvenient.</li>
<li> The worst roller bottles I&#x27;ve bought.</li>

    <li> I am very happy with the Blue Glass roll on Bottles. They are easy to fill and the roller ball goes in place without alot of effort, for which I was grateful. My hands are not as strong as they used to be!! Thank you for a nice product and speedy delivery..</li>
    <li> No issues at all.  I have coconut oil and essential oils mixed in these and they roll on great, just like the ones that I buy direct that already have mixes in them.  Recommended to a friend and will buy again if I need more.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers! They are great for my essential oil mixes!</li>
    <li> I use these every day. After a couple months of use if the bottles are turned upside down (like when I have them in my purse) they might leak. I have a lot of these bottles and probably had the leak issue with about a third of them. But I just make sure they are stored upright because you can&#x27;t beat the price for these bottles.</li>
    <li> Great bottles, easy to fill and use</li>
    <li> The worst roller bottles I&#x27;ve bought. The roller balls never work!! Total waste of my money!!</li>
    <li> For the most part, I&#x27;m happy with these.  I only had an issue with one of my rollers....the ball would pop out everytime I rolled it onto my skin.  Other than that, its a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> Was what was expected.</li>
    <li> The plastic ball doesn&#x27;t rotate as much as I would like, I think in the future I will only use ones with metal roller balls</li>
    <li> The roll tops do not roll smoothly, if at all.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the tops go on crooked,  several of them are not flush with the bottles. It&#x27;s happened on nearly all of them,  in two separate orders.  The roller caps,  however,  fit great and roll just fine.</li>
    <li> Great little bottles.  Very well made</li>
    <li> Bottles are great, but the caps don&#x27;t screw on totally straight. I will buy again, not a huge issue!</li>
    <li> Great product for making homemade essential oil blends. Fantastic price and value.</li>
    <li> Love them!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dispensing your essential oil blends! The roll-on top is easy to insert and the balls don&#x27;t pop out during use!</li>
    <li> Good price for good-quality item.  I&#x27;m making homemade &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; roll-on concoctions for myself.</li>
    <li> I love these for mixing my essential oil.  no leaks and no problems with any rollers.</li>
    <li> Love to use these I think I currently have over 50.</li>
    <li> I like these bottles for essential oil mixes.  The only problem I have is that if  you use the mix frequently the ball comes out!  That  is very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Great price and shipping.</li>
    <li> Like the bottles, have only used one so far, roller ball doesnt seem to want to roll all that great</li>
    <li> The bottles arrived intact and are what I needed.  However, the color is not what I hoped for from the picture.  They are a dark navy close to black.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for diluting essential oils in! So small and portable!</li>
    <li> Quite a deal . Needed these little glass bottles for my wonderful doTerra products. Priced really good.</li>
    <li> like using the roller bottles to mix up my own combinations</li>
    <li> These are great roll on bottles and were actually a lot bigger than I expected! I expected them to be about the size of those sample perfume tubes but these are actually about 4 to 5 times bigger. They are great quality, great looking and a great size to carry your favorite oil around with you.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The roller-ball and casing are plastic so do not use any citrus-based oils in these bottles as they may melt the plastic!</li>
    <li> I bought unfrosted bottles prior to these ones. These bottles are harder to see through and the ball does not seem to roll well. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> The rollers do not slide easily at all once oil has been put into the containers. I don&#x27;t know if it was from me pushing down too hard when trying to get the roller locked in -- but it takes a lot of pressure to get the oil rolled out!</li>
    <li> These work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my essential oil blends. The roller ball does not roll and you have to work to get the oil out. I liked that they are blue and not clear but i will not be buying these again.. I wished the ball was a better roller like my clear ones with a steel ball.</li>
    <li> well, the bottles are fine. they hold oils in them, sure. however, a good portion of the plastic rollerball parts that i received just... don&#x27;t roll! kind of defeats the purpose of ordering this set!</li>
    <li> These bottles are not worth the money. They do not roll on at all :(</li>
    <li> The roller balls do not work! I will not be purchasing them again.</li>
    <li> I use these for aromatherapy blends.  Its hard to see how full the bottle is and the roller balls take a while to work correctly.  Will not order these again.</li>
    <li> Nice aromatherapy roll-on bottles.  Have used 6 of them so far and they all work just as expected.  All of the parts were included and the roller balls work.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Got them quickly, pretty decent price, not as thick and frosted as some others I have bought off of Amazon before. Those ones have not currently been available unfortunately.

    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with theses bottles. No one seems to be able to beat the price, and yet these are very high quality and frosted colbalt.  The roller are a tight fit, but they all go in, and because they&#x27;re tight, I don&#x27;t worry about leaks.  They roll nicely. I go through a lot of these bottles. I give away a lot to family, because I blend my own essential oils.  This seller is very helpful. I will definitely buy from Plant Guru again.</li>
    <li> A couple of my roller balls require a little more effort to roll. Good product.</li>
