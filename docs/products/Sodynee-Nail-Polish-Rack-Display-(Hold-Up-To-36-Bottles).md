<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!! Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This display rack is nothing special. Cheap clear plastic that arrived broken in 2 places when I received it.  Definitely does the job of holding up to 72 bottles of nail polish, but it looks like a cheap rack you would see in any nail salon and it takes up a lot more room than what I was hoping.  After finding this to be an eye sore for a month I ended up buying a sleek, beautiful metal wall rack that holds over 100 polishes that I absolutely love. So though this nail polish rack technically works fine, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I expected and more  It will work perfect holding my bottles that I plan to use it for&#x27;. If any one out there needs a holder for little bottles  to put their stickles in ,this it the one for you.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried if this would arrive all in one piece considering the reviews. It was packed OK, had Styrofoam in the box itself and bags of air around it but it still managed to have a small crack In the top. (picture below)The only thing I was really upset about was there was supposed to be 4 screws/ 4 washers to put it together and there were only 3 screws/4 washers, so not good! I mean really how hard is it to count out 4 screws! Besides that I am happy with the product and with the different bottles of nail polish I own I was able to put more than 72 bottles on it.</li>
    <li> This is a great organization tool.  I love doing my nails and I&#x27;m constantly looking at tutorials.  I had so many nail polishes and this tool helped me organize them.  It looks so pretty in my closet.  I like that I can easily see all my colors and that my polishes aren&#x27;t all over the place.  It fits different sizes of bottles.  It is made of sturdy material.  It was very easy to put together, I did it in under five minutes.  Great addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> This stand was a perfect way or me to keep all of my nail polishes organized and easy to access. I put mine on my desk and it dosnt make it look cluttered at all. I love the clear clean look to it and was very easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> purchased one and then another later for booth display of my handmade press on nail sets. they both arrived in excellent condition. the second one did have some minor scuffs on one of the legs but it wasn&#x27;t a problem. however, the second one seemed to have some faulty nuts and bolts. they were much more difficult to screw together  like there was some damage in the manufacturing process. i was eventually able to assemble it with some tools and elbow grease. the first one was a breeze to assemble in minutes using just my hands.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo16RQEHQBOJWAP]]A quick review :)</li>
    <li> Love this! Easy to assemble, great sturdy quality (doesn&#x27;t look cheap), and I love how I can see all my colors clearly now. Will probably have to buy another one as my collection grows. Very fast shipping as well! Ladies get this, you won&#x27;t regret it! :) Wish I didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping, but it is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect piece to help organize all my polish bottles. It cleared up so much room on my dresser and it&#x27;s wonderful to see all the colors I have without having to sort through boxes. The rack came in three pieces and the main step-piece had a small chip on the underside. It wasn&#x27;t enough to make me ask for a new one; I just used bonding glue on it and it&#x27;s barely noticeable now. It was incredibly easy to put together. No tools were necessary and I did it in less than five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rows are spacious. For bigger bottles, it holds 12 straight across. I was able to fit 12 China Glaze bottles in one row. For the smaller bottles like Zoya or Essie, I was able to fit 14 across so it will hold at least 72 but has the ability to hold more; it just depends on the size of the polish bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy another one of these if I had to.</li>
    <li> Works great for holding my wifes oil bottles</li>
    <li> This is perfect for essential oils.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble, awesome to keep all your polishes organized and is very light so you can move it easily around. I love how I can see all my polishes at once without anything covering it.</li>
    <li> Used it to display 1:6 doll accessories at a doll show and got lots of compliments and questions about it from other vendors.  Worked well for me and only one screw gave me a hard time when putting it together. Once assembled, they fit perfectly inside boxes that reams of copy paper come in.  Since they arrive flat, I was thinking I could transport them that way and assemble them once at the venue. The screws are actually a hassle and take a few minutes to put on so it&#x27;s easier to just keep them assembled.</li>
    <li> Great unit, I would not hesitate in getting another. But beware, the screws and not in a little baggie or taped to unit, they are just tossed loose in the box.  I heard the rattle when I got it and was worried it was broke but it was just the screws loose in the box.  :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this to organize and store my essential oils and they fit perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;It should hold about 90 of the 15 ml bottles.</li>
    <li> The nail polish displayer shipped the same day I ordered it and arrived quickly thereafter. It was packaged in a sturdy box and wrapped in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it might be difficult to put together because it does come with screws but I realized I could do it with my hands. The displayer went up quickly and it is very sturdy. I was able to display all my nail polish and it fit every bottle I have. It looks great on my dresser and I can see every color which is exactly what i wanted it for. It&#x27;s a little bigger than I thought it would be and I have plenty of room to expand my ever growing nail polish collection. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great rack! Easy to assemble, and hold all my polishes. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I sell/use essential oils and this is the perfect solution to keeping those little bottles all in one place. Plus there is room for my dram bottles, eye droppers and roller balls. For $23.00, this is a great bargain for a very ideal space saver/organizer and looks like I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and easy to put together. Done in 2 mins or less. No tools or instructions needed. Although it was in a good package there was still a chip on the side but not bad. That seem to me more like a manufacturing problem.</li>
    <li> Displays all my nail polishes very good!</li>
    <li> I’ve been looking for something to display my scent samples during home parties and events that would look professional without costing a fortune.  The trays are the perfect width for my samples.</li>
    <li> I like this! I made holes in the back so I could hang them on my wall. Good purchase in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually a pretty big size. 72 bottles doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot until you see this rack in front of you. It&#x27;s nice though. Be prepared to put it together. Definitely a nice gift for someone, or yourself, who loves nail polish!</li>
    <li> was easy to find it here and was just what i needed ,maybe it would be good if they make one with 2 more shelves ty</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and thankfully nothing broken  Easy to assemble and feels pretty well made. All I had to place were the sides and in under 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> works great for my Y/L essential oils.  Fits all size bottles, roller, etc.</li>
    <li> i love this nail polish table stand.it was very easy to put together and it hold up to 72 of my polishes</li>
    <li> I have purchased this to display my products.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the quality of the acrylic is excellent. It is ultra clear and clean looking.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving 5 stars ONLY because the edges of the shelf is very pointy and sharp. Please be careful handling the shelf if you do purchase it!</li>
    <li> Item was broken when it arrived. They need more protective packaging. Also, item just came with parts and multiple screws with no directions. Very disappointed considering item isn&#x27;t super cheap or anything. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> This looks incredible filled with nail polishes - it looks like your own personal nail salon. It was very easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> My rack arrived in excellent condition and was well packaged. Others have mentioned that the edges are sharp,which is true. I took some fine sandpaper and sanded the top edge of each row, being careful not to touch the sides as the acrylic will scratch easily. I like the result as it feels nice to touch, where the sharp edges were harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this to hold my 2 oz HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) bottles of homemade airbrush paints. The bottles are exactly 1.38\\&quot; in diameter. The depth of each tray is slightly larger, so they fit nicely. One problem I have in my rack is that the first edge (short one) is bowed in a bit, and the rear edge is bowed in a bit. This makes it very snug for the middle bottles in the 1st and 6th rows. The inside width of each row is 16 1/2\\&quot;, so I can easily fit 11 bottles, but that is about 1/8\\&quot; too short for the 12th bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect a high quality rack, but one that is functional. There is a YouTube video titled \\&quot;nail polish collection/ table rack\\&quot; that shows the rack and the assembly. I found it helpful to see what I would receive.</li>
    <li> I am a nail polish fanatic and I needed something to organize all my nail polishes. I mostly have Maybelline Color Show and Essie nail polishes and they fit perfectly. It says that it only holds 72 bottles, but I have a whole row left and I own about 80 polishes. I recommend this to anyone who has a lot of nail polishes and needs to get organized!</li>
    <li> While I like the product because my polishes look like artwork on display (lol), I was EXTREMELY disappointed with how the item was packaged.  Two of the pieces were cracked and one had a huge piece chipped off.  The stand was inside a box on the BOTTOM of a larger box with no bubble wrap or protection around it. There were air bags on top, but nothing on the sides or bottom. My box came caved in and the tape all mangled on top. It was poorly taped shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to just keep my item instead of returning because of what a huge hassle it would be. Not to mention, I&#x27;m sure the next one would come broken anyway.  A little gorilla glue and it was salvageable.</li>
    <li> This rack is perfect for storing my bottles of polish.</li>
    <li> Great way to store a large nail polish collection. It allows you too see all your colors and makes each nail polish easily accessible. Will buy another once this one is full!</li>
    <li> I purchased the nail polish table rack for 72 bottles back in July. When it arrived I was so excited to finally show case my polishes however upon opening the packaging I was very disappointed the rack was broken in two places and when I contacted the seller Beauticom. I was told to send pictures to either receive another one or that I could get a discount. Let&#x27;s just say they certainly don&#x27;t know how to conduct proper business they ignored my emails. I will never purchase anything from them again! Please save your money they do not properly package the product at all.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble.  It is a nice flawless acrylic polish rack.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, screws included, easy to assemble</li>
    <li> When I received this item all the pieces seemed to be there except the screws, now I am stuck with this rack and no way to put it together. Worst purchase ever.  A worthless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Nice quality and its durable .&lt;br /&gt;Arrived safely but unfortunately missing the screws :(((</li>
    <li> Love these! Makes me feel like a nail salon. They&#x27;re sturdy and nice looking.</li>
    <li> We use this in our studio for essential oil bottles rather than nail polish bottles.  The size is great and it functions very well.  My only complaint is the lip on the front of each step/shelf prevents us from placing some larger bottles on the rack.  I&#x27;d have preferred no lip.  However, it does help prevent the bottles from all falling over or off if you bump the whole thing accidentally.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I made this purchase. It fits perfectly on my vanity. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble!!</li>
    <li> Ladies, if you haven&#x27;t got one of these you should get one immediately!  I love this nail polish organizer.  My huge array of polishes look fabulous in this organizer and allow me to see all the beautiful colors I can use.  The price is slightly higher than would have liked to pay, however, the material the product is made of is very sturdy and will last.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the miniature hobbyist.  Citadel, P3, Minitaire, and all my Vallejo paints fit perfectly.  Larger Vallejo 60 ml bottles also fit.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! super easy to assemble. High quality plastic.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Was looking for a solution to organizing and storing my eliquid bottles and this fit the bill perfectly. Now I can have my 15, 30, and 50 ml eliquid bottles organized in a way that allows me to easily read each bottle&#x27;s label and grab them without having to shuffle bottles around  knocking them over. Also frees up space on my end table &amp; dresser. Price could be a little lower, but was worth every penny for my needs. Shipping was fast and item arrived undamaged &amp; without a scratch.</li>
    <li> http://backpackandapassport.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-colorful-world-of-nail-polish.html for my full review on this rack! Such a great price and it holds tons of polish! Would buy again in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. It holds all size bottles from OPI to Zoya. It is very sturdy and works well in my salon.</li>
    <li> Looks good, I like my wall racks better, tho.      UPDATE: I used to keep my OPI polishes in this rack, but i ended up getting the wall rack for OPI (display is better, and it holds more) so I WANTED to put some of my lesser used China Glaze in this rack. THEY DO NOT FIT! I was so upset!   Just be aware! Works OK for the OPI, but its hard to see what all of your colors are (thats why I went to the wall rack) and China Glaze does not fit.</li>
    <li> Bought for a display for fragrance oils. Mine arrived with a piece broken off right where you put the screw in to hold the side supports on.  Found the piece in the box and super glued it back on.  Otherwise looks pretty good.  Does not fit the 2oz bottle I have but plenty of room for the 1/2 oz bottles.</li>
    <li> This is what every girl/woman needs. I can see all of my polishes, its easy to assemble, and I think I may have more than 72 polishes on my rack. Very classy. I feel like I have my very own personal nail spa. :)</li>
    <li> but I think it was overpriced. Haven&#x27;t filled it up yet, so it will hold all I needed it to hold. Doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Plastic is very thin and one side cracked right after opening the package. Packaging was flimsy and not great. Overall quality. I would prefer buying a better product. I could literally make a polish table rack for less money using foam board and glue.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these because my collection grew much faster than expected.  Requires simple assembly, no pieces arrived broken.  So expensive, though!</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble. Looks great, holds many bottles and keeps them looking neat and organized. May even need another one soon</li>
    <li> I really like this rack, I will  buy another as demand arises. It is a classy way to display my color choices to my clients.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and holds ALL the various sizes of nail polish brands.  SO happy that I bought this!</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipping love this seller</li>
    <li> As advertised...........thank you*</li>
    <li> This is a great polish display and I want another one, but mine arrived damaged due to the poor manner that the seller packaged my shipment.  The rack itself is solidly made of plexiglass that has been glued together, but it is not unbreakable.  The rack, inside its original box, was wrapped in white paper and shipped as-is.  There was nothing protective inside or around the box to prevent it from breaking or coming apart in transit.  So, depending on how roughly it was handled by USPS, these racks can arrive damaged like mine did.  I have uploaded a pic of my damaged rack in the Customer Images gallery.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem very durable. But it arrived on time and not broken. It is a christmas gift, so we are yet to try it out and see if all nail polishes fit on it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for holding all my hobby paint bottles. And it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive to buy.</li>
    <li> Love it used it to hold my paint jars and paint tubes! Very easy to assemble, looks good and organized my art studio.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Good price. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted/needed! Now all my nail polishes are displayed beautifully! The only issue is I might need to get another one eventually because I have a nail polish addiction! But it fit my OPI and Essie bottles perfectly. Overall no complaints! :)</li>
    <li> I love this!  It did come with a slight crack on one of the pieces, but nothing that will structuraly harm the item.  It is holding over 72 bottles right now, and I LOVE that I can see what colors I have!</li>
    <li> I received this for christmass. It is very durable, easy to put together. I was a little worried that all my nail polishes wouldnt fit. BUt i fit 83 nail polishes in this. You are able to see all your nail polishes and can access them easily. Pveralll AWESOMe buy.</li>
    <li> My little girl is very satisfied with her nail organizer it&#x27;s big and it was better then we expected it</li>
    <li> PURCHASED FOR GIFT.  RECEPIENT JUST LOVES IT.  E ASY TO ASSEMBLE. HOLDS ALL 72 BOTTLES REALLY EASILY.  WOULD PURCHASE THIS AGAIN FOR ANOTHER GIFT</li>
    <li> This item came on time and is as expected.  This was to organize my wife&#x27;s nail polish and meets the needs to do just that very nicely.</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy, easy to ensemble. Took care of my mess in a heart beat. If you want to make it prettier, you can easily spray-paint it since pieces lay flat.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it is suppose to do. It fits very well on my shelf and saves my lots of space.</li>
    <li> received as we accepted</li>
    <li> Easy assembly and works well. Holds more than I thought it would! Guess I&#x27;ll get to buy more nail polish!</li>
    <li> Overall what I expected. Not quite as sturdy as the smaller one. Had to put pads on the bottom so it  wouldn&#x27;t scratch whatever I sat in down on. I wish now I had purchased 2 smaller ones instead one larger one.</li>
    <li> Looks great! Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> You can use these for all kinds of things. Currently, my wife is mostly using them to hold essential oils. The product is solid and easily put together. Great for displaying small items.</li>
    <li> Item came broken and when I tried to return it--it definitely was a process. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t have the time to do everything that you required since I travel extensively for my job.</li>
    <li> Truly holds up to 72 nail polishes.  Serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> perfect can hang or stand</li>
    <li> This display rack is perfect and exactly what I needed! It was easy to put together and very sturdy! I am a huge nail polish fan I love having a huge assortment of nail polish however the draw I used to keep my polishes in it was hard to see every color so you can image how many didn&#x27;t get used. I was able to fit 73 assorted nail polishes plus 17 10 ml essential oils. The display fits perfectly on my bookshelf. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Have ordered many times before.  Perfect packing and quick delivery. Love the item. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet buy I&#x27;m sure I will I love the idea of seeing my polishes at once &amp; out of the way. still looking for a room to set up my nail stuff. have alot.</li>
    <li> Works well as a storage rack for Young Living Essential Oils!</li>
    <li> This product is as expected and put together quickly and the fact that it&#x27;s clear means that it&#x27;s relatively unobtrusive.  I use it for my essential oils rather than polish - works great.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of those for my ejuice flavors. They easily hold 30ml bottle (as well as 15 and 10ml too). Mine  arrived in perfect condition and went together quickly. I am now able to see all my flavor in alphabetical order when I&#x27;m mixing my DIY ejuices. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 oz bottles are too big for this rack, so I ordered the Copco Non-Skid 3-Tier Cabinet Organizer for those.</li>
    <li> With 3 girls in the house we have so much nail polish. I purchased this to get more organized, and to be able to see what we have. It takes up less space then the tray I was using, sturdy, and easy to assemble. I wish I could purchase one with more shelves.</li>
    <li> Holds what is described and does not come put together you will have to do that with super glue or a hot glue gun, glue gun preferred</li>
    <li> The rack I received was in a ton of pieces not to be out together with screws but that had broken during shipping I&#x27;m assuming. After glueing said pieces together I screwed on the two sides only to discover THE TWO SIDES WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIZES. My rack is now crooked and wobbly and a total waste of time, money and space. I WOULD NOT recommend this product.</li>
