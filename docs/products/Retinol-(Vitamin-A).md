<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> An excellent product - very pleased with the outcome. My skin feels much smoother and looks brighter now. The results are really amazing.  The serum absorbs on my skin beautifully after massaging it in. This is one of the products that actually work for me. I am indeed very happy with my purchase and will continue using it. Would surly buy it again and again! Highly Recommended! Must try and I am sure you will fall in love with it just as I do!</li>
    <li> This product is NOT vegan as the advertising states.  It contains propolis, which is made by bees.  Propolis is the sticky substance that bees make which is better known as &amp;#34;bee glue&amp;#34;. A bee gathers resin from cone-producing evergreen trees or from the buds of trees. The bee gathers this sap, he blends the resin with wax flakes that he stores in the gland of his abdomen.  After the bee shapes it into a ball, he puts it into the pollen basket that is attached to his leg. The bee will continue until the basket is full, then take it back to the hive. The propolis is unloaded and used to patch up holes in the hive.</li>
    <li> My friend gifted me this bottle of facial serum.  After a couple of weeks of consistent use, my skin had a positive noticeable difference.  My skin was baby-soft, smoother, and the acne was gone which I take is a result of the Vitamin A, E, and Green Tea.  I will be buying another bottle for myself very soon.  Excellent product, I would give it ten stars if I could!</li>
    <li> I bought retinol 2.5% serum more so to deal with an acne problem that I heard Vitamin A and Green Tea concentrate was good at treating. I started shopping for this product when looking for a serum that contained the ingredients I needed, and  for the price, this was definitely one of the best deals on amazon.  I&#x27;ve been  I&#x27;ve been using this after showering 3 times a week and rub this into my face after drying myself, and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in how much moisture my skin is able to retain. Now that the summers here  and I&#x27;m out in the sun, I plan on using this to avoid permanent damage to my skin. I&#x27;m still in my late 20&#x27;s so I&#x27;m not too worried about aging, but so far I&#x27;m a big fan of this product and will probably use it in the future in the way it is advertised.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product very long so it is a little hard to say. But so far so good, I do notice some difference in my skin. So the longer I use it will hopefully make a significant difference. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Quick delivery...</li>
    <li> Dont care too much for this, but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Your skin will soak it up. Immediate results seen. Will buy again. Can&#x27;t say enough good things.  Price is right!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that works on all types of skins and ages. Even if you are younger and want to use this as a preventative, you will notice results and be glad you did. The big sell here is the 2.5% retinol, more than other creams that are double the price or more. Further, the 2 oz bottle gives you a better return on your money. Everyone wants to look a little bit better, and this product will help with that. I&#x27;m in my early twenties, but I use this product once or twice a day, usually after the shower, to help retain moisture. Sun and wind exposure do a lot of damage over the course of your life, and my city is particularly exposed. I also bought a bottle for a vegan friend because she frequently complains about not being able to find enough effective vegan body-products out there. I also like the fact that it contains green tea concentrate because I like to think it perks up my face a bit. Glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> So far so good...still need to use it for a while longer to find out full benefits...but so far, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> I thought I was aging gracefully at 35 until I noticed the crows feet and laugh lines vanity stepped in and said this isn&#x27;t you so I&#x27;ve decided to try the Retinol facial serum and it&#x27;s amazing helps with my acne and my enlarged pores has began to shrunk, until you see the difference then you think why didn&#x27;t I try this sooner my face looks brighter and smoother I&#x27;m loving it ;-) I luv it even more that it is enriched with natural vitamins the shipping was fast no hassle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed clearer and brighter skin after 2wks of regular use.  This product will definitely be part of my regular skin regimen from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product I got it 3 weeks ago and my stretch marks are less visible, will order a new one soon.</li>
    <li> One of the best vitamin A .I am happy with this . I am continue using that . SO no compeliment . Over all very good !</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin. Not oily or sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this!!  Left my complexion smoothe and firm.  I use this with the Vitamin C serum, and my moisturizer.  Does NOT CLOG PORES, even in high heat and humidity.  Also really shrinks pores.  My skin has never looked better.  Sounds cliched, but it&#x27;s true, and I&#x27;ve used everything.  I will be buying more very soon.  EXCELLENT!!!!  Thank you Eve Hansen!!</li>
    <li> What an amazing product! I have been using this to try to get rid of the fine lines that have develop around my eyes past the 30 year old mark. I have been applying this serum religiously and can&#x27;t complain with the results, it has almost completely removed the lines at the corner of my eyes. It like a new face for me, people at work noticed the difference and started asking what I was doing differently to look younger and healthier. I am telling you people you have to give this product a try. It works!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and customer service! A++++</li>
    <li> Excellent products at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I received this product on time and it was very quick. I have been using it approximately 1 week, morning and night and I love it! I can already see a difference to the texture of my skin and it is helping with some deep frown lines in my forehead. I will definitely continue use of this product. I will be 40 in a few day so I need to keep my skin looking as young as possible!</li>
    <li> Really amazing.skin looks totally renewed.tightened my pores and diminished some blemishes.love it.its gonna be a staple on my skin routine,that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work like any other Retinol I have ever used. Its not really prescription grade in my opinion. Its not nearly as strong as other 2.5% Rentinols. However it does make my skin soft in the morning and with continued use for about 3 days I saw some light flaking meaning I had new SKIN! My face is brighter and clearer. Take this review with optimism everyone&#x27;s skin will react differently. I get chem peels and facials on a monthly basis so my skin may react differently than others.</li>
    <li> I have been using for almost a month now and I haven&#x27;t seen the results I was hoping for. I read the prior reviews and I was so excited to try it out but it&#x27;s just ok. My goal in using the product was to help/ systic acne and scaring, it&#x27;s cleared up some acne but that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for some progress 😒</li>
    <li> This is labeled as a facelift in a bottle, and i honestly agree. since i&#x27;ve began using it, my skin feels so much tighter...but not like a dry tight, it&#x27;s still got a moisturized feel, with the texture of my actual skin feeling smoother!&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me at a reduced price to review and critique. I would never give anything other than my 100% honest opinion, and jeapordize my long-term beauty blog subscribers, or anyone else reading my reviews. peace &amp; love&lt;br /&gt;http://www.youtube.com/c/JenniferTireyLove</li>
    <li> This is great for my fair skin. I especially love that it contains Aloe Vera and is 100% vegan. Luckily I don’t have lines yet but I do have blemishes from spot outbreaks, this serum really helps to reduce these problem areas as it softens and heals. I am always quite sceptical about face products but as this offers a 100% satisfaction policy I knew I would be able to get my money back if it wasn’t for me. I think this is extremely great value as you only need to use a small amount each day to see results. I will be recommending this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I did not get any visible changes to my skin after using the 2 ounce bottle.  The first ingredient is aloe.  It felt like I was using plain aloe on my face for the past month.  I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> This review is about customer service and the product.  A lot of companies forget or devalue good customer service, but so far, I have been very pleased with the customer service and outreach by Eve Hansen. I loved the seller for contacting me via email to make sure I received the product along with a description and instructions for its use. I also enjoy this product and have been using it with no issues for 2 weeks.  I have been looking for a Retinol formula to replace an expensive product that I have been using, and this product seems just a good.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> So far this has shown amazing results in just a few days.I absolutely recommend this product to any one with skin texture issues or any other issues with your complexion. I love this product!! so very Happy with results!!!</li>
    <li> Being a vegan and all this is exactly what I was looking for. Retinol has so many benefits and I was convinced that I needed to try it. This serum was definitely worth the price. I have been using this serum on my face for about a month, and the difference is amazing. My face looks so much smoother and feels very clean. I also see that my small wrinkles have started to disappear and that my pores have also closed up since I started using it. My daughter also uses this to fight her acne and her skin is finally starting to clear up.  I definitely recommend this product it is one of the best out there.</li>
    <li> Getting the Lift without the lift. That was always the one thing I just couldn&#x27;t go thru with: actually having my face peeled off. Ugh- no. And with this it takes the danger and expense of surgery right out of the equation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is vegan, I usually look for veggie, but vega&#x27;s even better. It would defeat the purpose of this kind of applied serum treatment if it contained a lot of hazardous chemical compounds. May as well go under the knife at that point! Sheesh. But it&#x27;s 100% Veg. on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy on, easy off application. Do it morning and night; I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need a midday, but that may just be my skin. Depending on the time of year I don&#x27;t tend to dryness, but some may and feel the need to add another application. Experimenting around some will soon find you the right amounts, and times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost impossible to say enough good things about this. I would simply advise, from personal experience-- nothing more, that before you go for a more &#x27;drastic&#x27; age-refining procedure... give this a try first :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if this serum is doing much. It is in a very nice bottle with a pump, and it has a nice texture, but does it help with wrinkles? I&#x27;m not so sure.&lt;br /&gt;For others, it probably will work. Especially if you&#x27;re in your 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, it&#x27;ll be good. I have redness, larger pores, and fine lines. I need a different retinol formulation that Eve Hansen contains. My daughter is using it now, and she really likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> So far seems wonderful but i have only been using this product for 3 week,  I like the results so far.  No complications</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product and company. I have only been using the serum for about a week but already notice a more even skin tone. One recommendation I have is to plan a microdermabrasion treatment before starting the use of this retinol. It will accelerate the benefits of the retinol serum.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle! My mom gets brown spots from sun exposure, this removed them in one week! I was getting my first eye wrinkle and in 3 days it&#x27;s starting to smooth out, I only have had this product for a week, can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
    <li> Great value for money as this bottle is twice the size of the competitors bottles. I&#x27;ve purchase several different brands of 2.5% retinol serum and they seem to all be about the same as far as quality and efficacy, but this brand gives you a 2oz bottle vs a 1oz. I also like the pump feature of this bottle makes dispensing the correct amount easy. This 2.5% retinol serum works as well as the VERY expensive prescription Vitamin A cream I used to get from my dermatologist, and is easier on my skin, no more flakey dry patches on my face. Very happy with this brand, and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great serum. I used to use prescription vitamin A cream several years ago. Worked great, however it was harsh sometime (a lot of dryness and peeling). I have been using this serum for a few weeks now, and I can tell that it has the same effect without the side effects. I use it on the clean face sometime by itself and sometime with moisturizer.  I am glad I came cross this product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested I use Retinol for the age spots that I&#x27;m starting to get and to even out my skin.  Also to help with the acne that started when I was in my early 30&#x27;s and I STILL get at 45.  I have to say after 4 months now, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference.  I don&#x27;t break out as much and when I do, it&#x27;s only one blemish and it goes away a lot faster.  My skin is noticeably more even, I looked blotchy sometimes and that has gone away.  The age spots are still there, but I have read that it can take at least 6 months for the full effect of Retinol to work, so I still have hope for those fading more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried when I first started using it because my skin wasn&#x27;t getting dried out and I just assumed that would happen.  Sometimes my skin feels a little tight after applying it, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry or peeling skin.  I&#x27;ve tried to stay out of the sun this summer, but even when I did, I didn&#x27;t have any problems.  I should say that for the first month I used RoC Retinol Correction, but after searching and sending an email (and not getting a reply) to the company to find out just how much retinol is in their product, I discontinued using it, because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my time with something that wasn&#x27;t going to be strong enough.</li>
    <li> Stop the presses.. The world needs to know about this serum , I have been using this serum for a full 7 days morning and night and my skin is clearer brighter smoother more even toned.  I cannot say how it does on wrinkles since i do not have any yet. I&#x27;m over 40 and fortunate, but for the first time I went to the gym today with only moisturizer on not a tinted moisturizer plain moisturizer.  Thats how good and confident I felt about my skin.  I will continue to by this product.</li>
    <li> Really did what I hoped it would. I noticed some changes in my face recently now I look rested and have younger skin tone. Great try it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Lasts a long time compared to the other retinol serums I have tried. I use this morning and evening and have no dryness.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin. Snake oil I believe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results. It goes on easily, does not make my face greasy and gives me moisture without breakouts on my face</li>
    <li> I love this!  I am 35 and I&#x27;m starting to see my face sag and swell and all that wonderful stuff.  I saw a huge difference after a week.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I love it, reduce my fine lines, make my skin younger, acne disappeared. Dark spots gone.. I also use Eve Hansen Rosehip Oil and Vitamin C, they all work great for me. Much better than the expensive products that I used before. My friends said my skin looking younger day by day, I told them about Eve Hansen products.</li>
    <li> I got this product in the hope that it would fade the age spots on my face, since it has Retinol. Most of the reviews only deal with wrinkles, and the fine print on the bottle makes no mention of fading dark spots, though it is mentioned in some of the descriptions. The bottle also says it may take 3 months or more to see any improvement. However, since the Eve Hansen people keep wanting me to review it even though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, here goes. After using the product for two weeks, I can see no change in the dark spots on my face. If, after several months of use, I can tell a positive difference, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> Why buy high brand product when you can get the same thing is twice the size? Eve Hansen offers a nice variety of face serums and this is one of them.  I used been using Retinol and wanted to find the same product without spending an arm and a leg. I switch between different serums and I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum it does do what it says it will do!!  I love the texture of my face after using Retinol .Try it you won&#x27;t go wrong!!  Living on the islands that&#x27;s usually sunny all year around this is a good product to have.....Aloha!!  Yc</li>
    <li> Fast service and like the way it feels on my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised but it seems to work very well. My skin looks much better after just a few weeks and it doesn&#x27;t burn or itch.</li>
    <li> Works well.  My old tired eyes are rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> This product was received through Amazon trader. I&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff! Completely makes a huge difference! I think I need to get more for stocking stuffers!! I will be the office fave!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money all that is in this bottle is water</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the available drug store, big box store and Amazon available &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; type skin products to preserve and restore and I am pleased with this one with being very well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of real from the plant aloe on the skin, it can do wonders. This seems to be a nicely balanced formula that ups it a few notches without being heavy and greasy or irritating to sensitive skin. I did not see results in the first five minutes but I am seeing my skin having more of a general glow to it and texture is more refined. I used a control of applying to one hand and not the other, while not strictly scientific, there is a noted difference in overall appearance, texture and more polished youthful luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light pleasant fragrance that always makes me think of freshly picked raspberries and it absorbs quickly and is very easy to use. I found before bed seemed to be a good time to apply it and and used sunscreen the following morning. I can definitely see myself using this long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to review this product and provided a discount to give my unbiased and honest thoughts on it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use pump. Only gave it 3 stars because it irritated my skin, but then again, I am VERY sensitive to a lot of products. I passed it on to a friend and she reported that it seems to works to moisturize and smooth the skin area around the eyes and that she only needs to use a little with each application. She is a vegetarian and loved the fact that it is a vegan product!!!! NOTE:  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Thank you. This seems to work, have only used it for a week or so but I am satisfied, it is not greasy or sticky and dries in well.</li>
    <li> Love this product I got for review</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s effective.  I haven&#x27;t used it very long and I use it with other skin care items.  I do like the feel of it on my skin.  But then all these products are combined with a moisturizing sunscreen that makes the skin&#x27;s surface soft and smooth.  As for being a &amp;#34;facelift in a...&amp;#34; other products (such as hyaluronic acid serum) make the same claim.  Who knows?</li>
    <li> I did not contact them, but I did receive a very nice email with additional information about the product. Arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprise how my face is looking. At 53 , I like to look young like everybody else. So, I have to say the retinol from Eve Hanson after one month of use my wrinkle lines have been completely minimize or nearly gone. My deep furrow brow is still their but I assume it will take a long time for it to fade. Overall, I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I use Retinol Oil for my teenage son ance and ance scars.  The oil helps keep his skin moisturized and doesn&#x27;t leave his face greasy. I have him apply it after he works out and wash his face. I love that the oil is natural. The bottle is easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I see a noticeable difference after using retinol. very happy and will reorder!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days only so don&#x27;t notice any changes.  My neck skin feels very moist after the application. ; )</li>
    <li> It truely is the best i will alwasty order from you</li>
    <li> I would say give it about at least 5 days to really kick in, but you will notice it demolish any incoming blemishes or even damages from old ones. Ever since I got it my face has been&lt;br /&gt;completely smooth and clear. I haven&#x27;t broken out once. I remember to use this every single night though... I do not forget and I do not apply a moisturizer after.. But anyways... Love it I&#x27;m turning it on to my sisters, my mother, my whole family seriously.. And friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hate to keep going on and on and to sound corny, but I just went and looked in the mirror my face is very clear. I even forgot to wash my face lastnight ( was very tired) but still remembered to apply this and my face is still even more clearer than it was yesterday. I have an even skin tone and seriously best decision I&#x27;ve made. I do a lot of public work on and off camera, so I&#x27;m very thrilled for good skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also say, I notice that yes I still get some zits here or there, and I mean one or two of them and they&#x27;re small... But anyways.. TMI but when I pinch them they sting and bleed and then completely heel up immidiately.... There&#x27;s no waiting, bleeding or oozing for minutes after (sounds so gross... I&#x27;m never one to talk about this but it&#x27;s fascinating honestly) it instantly freezes! I know it&#x27;s because of the retinol because i haven&#x27;t been breaking out since I&#x27;ve been using this product first of all, second any zit I&#x27;ve ever had has never done that in the first place ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for all of that but, also my skin tone is finally becoming even...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Retinol 2.5% for over 2 weeks now and it seems like those tiny brown dots have somewhat faded. Will keep using together with Vitamin C and hope for more improvement. At 79 I have a pretty good skin, other than those ugly dots.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about purchasing this because the comments had a couple people who received a bottle in exchange for a review and I&#x27;m sad to say I think that they are not legit. Did absolutely nothing for me. Super disappointed.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 weeks ago and I have to admit that it&#x27;s a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve never used retinol before but I&#x27;m glad I started to. It has made my fine lines smother and my skin feels smoother too. Love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND SO FAR, IT&#x27;S BEEN OKAY I&#x27;VE NOTICED SOME CHANGE BUT NOTHING TO DRASTIC, I WILL KEEP POSTING THREW OUT THE PROCESS AND SEE IF I GET A BETTER RESULT.</li>
    <li> The display pic shows 3 bottles which is misleading&lt;br /&gt;also says #3 which again is misleading&lt;br /&gt;I just got one 2 oz bottle</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product.  It seems like it&#x27;s doing the trick!  Retinol is important to use for aging skin.  Eve Hansen emailed me before my shipment arrived.  Great vendor!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Received mine pretty quick. I had 3 orders &amp; this was the last one to ship but the first to arrive! Packaging was great-ordered 2 bottles of different serums and they wrapped each separately in bubble wrap. Very well protected. Also, the sellers send you an email after you order &amp; then again after you receive the order to check in and give you tips on using the products! Seller is just wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this nightly before bed, along with their vitamin c serum twice a day, and I can sure see and feel the improvement of my skin!! My face is smoother, softer, brighter and it has helped minimize the appearance of my pores better than anything else I&#x27;ve  ever tried(I have big pores so I&#x27;ve tried a lot). I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been seriously impressed with this serums it has given me great results. As a 30-year-old on chemotherapy, I&#x27;ve definitely seen some additional fine lines cropping up in the last year. My skin also just seems to feel a little duller. I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a week, but I have already noticed a dramatic difference in the fine lines around my mouth and at the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s my routine&lt;br /&gt;. I use a toner to open my pores and get me ready for a serum, apply the serum, brush my hair while I wait for it to dry, and then add moisturizer. I repeat the process in the morning and evening, using a night cream and an eye cream at bedtime, and I can tell I am seeing great results because I actually forgot and stopped doing anything besides cleansing and moisturizing for about a week and half around the holidays, and I looked much more tired. As soon as I picked up my routine again, and added this retinal serum for additional boost, the results came back and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the perks is that if you don’t see a difference then you get your money back. So either way it’s a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I think the older and more defined the lines are, the better your results will be **</li>
    <li> I just love this serum.After using this I feel something different on my face.Now my face is much smoother than before.I want to buy this product again.Really feel happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Retinol and Vitamin C is a winning combination. Before trying this product, I was having problem with hormonal acne around my chin area. Since trying this now for 2-3 weeks. I no longer have acne there. My skin loves this serum! I put on the Retinol and Vitamin C and Hyaluronic serum every night and in the morning I put on the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic before my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to be my beauty regimen from now on! Love this brand and product. Thanks for the reviews, I&#x27;m glad I tried this serum.</li>
    <li> It is new to me, but I like it.  I think it will make a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting positive comments after using Retinol 2.5%.  I am 69 years old and someone said I look 20 years younger.  I see the crow&#x27;s feet disappearing.  My skin is noticeably more radiant, fresher and healthier looking.  I even feel younger.  I keep looking in the mirror frequently and enjoying the new look.  I will continue using the Eve Hansen product.  Also want to mention that the product is nicely priced for my budget.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Excellent followup by Eve Hansen. Product arrived intact. Effectiveness too soon to tell. Believe most products take at least a month or two to show its effectiveness (or not). Started using 6/18, nightly. Product is non-irritating on me, odorless, and dries fast. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> It is OK for the price...</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for night face ,I will care about you ,and come back buy more ,thank you .</li>
    <li> Company was great. Product came on time and was exactly as described.  Hurry is still out as to weather or not it works.&lt;br /&gt;Was told 12 weeks for viable results</li>
    <li> A+ Transaction, very nice product!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I love the value!  I am 45 yrs old and have a few wrinkles and some hyper-pigmentation from the sun.  The dark spots have faded, and my complexion looks better without make-up since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  Score!!!  Very happy with this product and would most definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I read a ton of product reviews before choosing Eve Hansen Retinol 2.5%. I&#x27;ve used this daily for awhile now and haven&#x27;t seen one bit of difference. It goes on smoothly, is fragrance-free, and you only need a little bit so this bottle should last me a long time. But I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My sister in law uses this product and suggested I try it. I ordered using one click option and my Retinol was shipped right away. Sellar did everything they promised. Product is wonderful. Not too strong, skin looks and feels so soft! Love that this is a all natural product! Will continue to use this. Price is right too!!</li>
