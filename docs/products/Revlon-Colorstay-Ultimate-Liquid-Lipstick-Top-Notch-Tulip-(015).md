      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I am no longer able to purchase this product in my area</li>

      <li>Just know that once you put it on it&#x27;s there to stay unless you dring something hot.  </li>
      <li>I bought several colors and love them all.</li>
      <li>It was the exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Came quickly and was exactly what I wanted, new and sealed, also.&lt;br /&gt;Blah</li>
      <li>It really works even after eating a meal.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s impossible for me to choose a shade of lipstick even in a store without trying it on, so I did the best I could online.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I have dark hair and medium to light complexion, so this color gets a little lost on my face.  </li>

<li> I like and have had trouble finding.  </li>
<li> The Colorstay has gone through a few changes, but that just means it has improved over the years.  </li>
<li> I usually use another shade</li>
<li> This is also a very hard to find color.</li>
<li> sadly, this color was discontinued.</li>

    <li> It stays all day on me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible for me to choose a shade of lipstick even in a store without trying it on, so I did the best I could online.  I have dark hair and medium to light complexion, so this color gets a little lost on my face.  It was a bit lighter than I had hoped, but it&#x27;s a nice shade, so it will do.</li>
    <li> I love being able to get my favorite discontinued color at a price less than when it was available in the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a creature of habit. Once I find an item I like, I use forever or until they stop making it! This lipstick is one of those items. I apply it once in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go all day and night! The shipping from this seller was very fast. Great transaction~</li>
    <li> This lasts until next morning!!</li>
    <li> It works great. The color stays well and to add a little shine, I just apply lip gloss or lip balm over it later in the day.</li>

    <li> I am no longer able to purchase this product in my area so I was very excited to find it on Amazon.  It was the exactly what I was looking for.  It stays on for the entire day without having to reapply it.  Perfect for anyone.  I bought several colors and love them all.</li>
    <li> Use it in the morning and it lasts most of the day!&lt;br /&gt;The color was vibrant, but yet soft. Will purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> Best lipstick there is. Stays on all day. Light feeling and has no offensive taste. This is also a very hard to find color.</li>
    <li> I have used the Revlon Colorstay for years.  I&#x27;m not one who likes to be concerned about makeup once I&#x27;ve applied it in the morning.  The Colorstay has gone through a few changes, but that just means it has improved over the years.  Not as dry as it once was and the color choices are great.  Just know that once you put it on it&#x27;s there to stay unless you dring something hot.  I don&#x27;t drink coffee after my 2 cups in the morning so it works well for me.</li>
    <li> I adore this lipstick. It stays on and doesn&#x27;t get on my boyfriend or my cups. I love that I can put it on and kiss without it going away. This is a big plus!</li>
    <li> The product is great. I usually use another shade so I gave this one to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it. It wears beautifully without the double step of needing a glosser.</li>
    <li> It lasts well and doesn&#x27;t dry lips!  It&#x27;s the color I like and have had trouble finding.  I&#x27;ve used it for about two years.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The color stays on your lips all day.  And now I find the lipstick and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was exactly what I wanted, new and sealed, also.&lt;br /&gt;Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah.  There&#x27;s your 8 more words required.</li>
    <li> Decided to purchase 3 more lipsticks while my favorite color was still available.  This will just prolong my needing to switch to some other color when these are all depleted.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day - love the color - doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips - my favorite color and lipstick</li>
