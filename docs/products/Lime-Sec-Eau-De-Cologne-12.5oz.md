      <li>I got a nice size bottle at a really good price.</li>

      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face because of the alcohol, but a splash on my chest every morning does the trick nicely.</li>

      <li>Mellows out nice too.</li>
      <li>honestly do like this cologne, and would order it again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to be very honest and say that the scent of this reminds me of a mixture of Lemon Pledge, Citronella, and cheap motel soap.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this aftershave has very strong &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lemon cleaning product&amp;#34; overtones.</li>
      <li>nice and refreshing in the am</li>
      <li>Smells great - just like fresh cut limes.  </li>

      <li>I use this stuff after I mow the lawn take a quick shower and want to smell good for an hour....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FROM AMAZON...</li>
      <li>This is one of my all-time favorite smells.</li>
      <li>I am able to carry heavier scents well and tend to amplify most colognes, this could be part of the issue as musk sent will stick better to me then lime (not know for its staying power).</li>
      <li>My girlfriend and her friends love it.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry, my wife and I are going through counseling, and I think we will be OK.  </li>
      <li>Women love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>It does not have a overpowering scent and seems to be more subtile after an hour or so.</li>

      <li>I use it as an aftershave and get more compliments for it</li>
      <li>I love the smell...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a much more Lime scent compared to Royall Lyme.</li>

      <li>Love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>This would probably be okay if I had not had to drink lime-flavored &amp;#34;clear</li>
      <li>It will make you want to shave more often.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping, and great packaging.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Clubman makes way better stuff than this</li>
      <li>I was very excited to receive this today.</li>
      <li>Eventually that basically fades away, to a nice powdery cool scent.  </li>
      <li>If you like the scent of fresh limes, you&#x27;ll love this cologne!</li>
      <li>you first put it on, yes you are struck by the strong fragrence of lime popscicle but in a good way.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s far from great.</li>
      <li>I am sure I can find someone among my friends who will enjoy the scent.</li>
      <li>I have been paying an equivalent of twelve times as much for a lime cologne that is not as good.  </li>
      <li>Does not smell too spicy or strong.</li>
      <li>They do fade as the day progresses so that they are not overly strong.</li>
      <li>If the price were twice as high, it would still be a good bargain.</li>
      <li>I had no idea what to expect, but after purchasing the Pinaud Clubman Classic Aftershave, and absolutly loving the scent, I figured I would try more.  </li>
      <li>odor lasts longer than you want....  smells cheap</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the whole Pinaud line. So refreshing A+++++ don&#x27;t hesitate to buy, a little raw at first, but if you let it air put, it&#x27;s his is excellent!</li>
    <li> I love Pinaud Clubman and when compared to Pinaud Lime Sec the Lime Sec is a bit of a disappointment. I&#x27;m going to be very honest and say that the scent of this reminds me of a mixture of Lemon Pledge, Citronella, and cheap motel soap. Honestly, this aftershave has very strong &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lemon cleaning product&amp;#34; overtones. Personally, I would not use Lime Sec as my only scent for the day like I do with Clubman. Instead, I typically use aftershaves that are less than ideal as a base scent after showering and then add a (well) paired cologne afterwards (shoutout to YouTube&#x27;s &amp;#34;Shave The Man&amp;#34; channel). Any fruity or sporty cologne will mix well with this (the fruitier Adidas scents, Channel Blue, Nautica, etc). If you&#x27;re buying this and think that it will smell like Royal Lyme, you&#x27;re mistaken. Royal Lime has a much more clean and citrusy profile, while I can only describe this as soapy.</li>
    <li> Clubman products are great values. but i wont buy this again. Its labeled as lime, but i cant smell the lime. i can recommend the original Clubman aftershave as having the old time great barber smell that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this particular Pinaud product.  I like the smell of lime, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  Still, I like it.</li>
    <li> it arrived broken .I was supposed to get credit for the broken produt</li>
    <li> Like the old school scent. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Man, this a good deal. I have 30-something frags on the shelf--from fruit to wood, grass to floral, smoke to amber. The perfume houses run the field and include Creed. I truly enjoy the freshness of Lime Sec from time to time. Perfect for a splash after shaving, and lasts for hours. Expect a lime topnote (natch) with a slightly floral drydown and on to a musk-powder base. Well done.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I guess. I was using Royall Lyme and trying to be a cheap-ass about it. It&#x27;s a much more Lime scent compared to Royall Lyme. I like it well enough but when the bottle is done I will switch back to something that is lighter. This product is VERY lime.</li>
    <li> Brings me back to the old time barber shop</li>
    <li> My husband loves all pinaud products. He enjoys this scent; however, it reminds me of pledge. It does smell clean, but definately a pldge smell.</li>
    <li> Most best lime cologne for the price.  I&#x27;m guessing that one bottle will last me a year, plus,&lt;br /&gt;if you add cloves you get a thrifty mosquito repellent. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Has a nice lemon scent going on.  But, when the alcohol leaves what&#x27;s left is a very weak powder smell. Better off buying the Citrus Musk if you want a little lasting power.</li>
    <li> Awesome customer service and prompt delivery.  Item was as described. Ty</li>
    <li> My wife thinks it smells nice.  Not very much of a lime odor.  You should expect that, however.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the problem with this stuff.... It&#x27;s terrible as an aftershave and worse as a cologne.  It smells like like candy and the wife likes it as do I but it fleets fast and after a shave it makes the face feel dry and does not soothe.  I use this stuff after I mow the lawn take a quick shower and want to smell good for an hour.... Clubman makes way better stuff than this it&#x27;s not horrid but it&#x27;s far from great.</li>
    <li> Would have preferred to give 3 1/2 stars,, It&#x27;s definitely lime but there&#x27;s a floral undertone to it.  A bit too sweet for my liking but I&#x27;ll still use it in moderation.</li>
    <li> nice and refreshing in the am</li>
    <li> I think it smells, kinda, like windex. But my son liked it, so I gave it to him.</li>
    <li> For those of you who know, it&#x27;s a knock off of No. 4711: It&#x27;s colored the same, comes in kind of the same kind of bottle, and vaguely reminds you of the original Eau De Cologne. The scent is pleasant if you like Lime (I do). If you&#x27;re a fan of the increasingly hard to find 4711, This is and adequate substitute.</li>
    <li> Cut a lime in half, rub the lime on your face -- that&#x27;s what this smells like. I smell like 7Up.</li>
    <li> This product did not impress me at all. It smells wonderful in the bottle, but when you put it on your skin - it smells like bug repellant! I DO like the regular Clubman after shave, though. That&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and smell just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> A so-so citrus scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite smells. I could use this stuff every day for years and not get tired of it. It feels great after a nice traditional wet shave. My only complaint is that an hour or two after I put it on my girl can only smell it if she puts her nose on my face. I wish it wouldn&#x27;t fade so much. But I&#x27;d still recommend it.</li>
    <li> Now that there is a lime shortage going on in the US, you can no longer rub your face with fresh limes after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubman&#x27;s Lime Sec is the next best thing. I use it after shaving and it feels great on my face. The scent is fresh and clean but not too heavy. It will also not stay with you all day but thats a good thing in my book.</li>
    <li> its alright smells like lime then dries down to candy, does not last long on my skin as why to the three star review,but its good stuff order it and use it!</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT typical Pinaud quality. The scent smells GREAT. BUT it disappears in 10 minutes!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was maybe just me, but my stepson used it also and said the same thing. And NO it wasn&#x27;t I just&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t smell it myself, my wife asked why I wasn&#x27;t wearing after shave when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it is a unique and manly if not sweet scent.  Fades a little faster than I would like.</li>
    <li> I have purchased so far 3 Clubman Pinaud brand aftershaves and enjoy them all.  Each reminds me of the old fashion barbershop experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Lime Sec - light and fresh with a gentle nose of Lime that you&#x27;ll enjoy throughout the day.  They do fade as the day progresses so that they are not overly strong.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne, not over poweering would recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear aftershave or cologne, I am more of a body spray guy, but I was picking up some other aftershave (which I loved) by the same company and decided to get this, as I love citrus-scented things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it a couple of times, but I do not like it. The scent is less lime and more flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t have problems with scents, but after using this one time on my neck, I started getting headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle sits, unused. I am unlikely to use it, but aren&#x27;t going to throw it away, as that would be wasting money. Maybe I will find someone to give it to.</li>
    <li> Really like the lime. Does not smell too spicy or strong. Goes on with a good citrus fragrence and levels down to just a mere hint. Not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells like limes which is what I was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I can&#x27;t compare it against other more expensive/premium lime smelling colognes (I saw a few others on Amazon), but I&#x27;m on a budget so too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it isn&#x27;t the longest lasting stuff, but whatever, its inexpensive for the quantity you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaguely reminds me of lime skittles.. I kinda want to drink it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! This product is quite soothing to the skin. And it smells good to. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Must say I was skeptical for the price but I really enjoy the scent, as does my wife. It smell like a lime somewhat but it is a subtle, clean scent. I might not recommend this product for a 20 year old man to wear out on a date but it will work very well for me to wear daily to the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly from the vendor.</li>
    <li> I used to see this stuff in lots of men&#x27;s locker rooms at country clubs. Now I can have it at my house. A good product for a good price!</li>
    <li> Smells great - just like fresh cut limes.  Long lasting - all day.  Priced right - super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t overthink it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You like the way limes smell?  Get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the way limes smell?  Don&#x27;t get it.  But do get some help, because you&#x27;re crazy.  Limes smell awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll leave it:  Limes smell awesome.  This stuff smells like that.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lime-scented cologne because the citrus/herbal fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing for 25 years has more than doubled in price and is now ridiculously expensive.  I really like the way limes smell and, in the past, I&#x27;ve run into fairly affordable colognes that smell like limes.  If this one has any lime scent to it, it&#x27;s masked under a rather heavy scent of something else that is in the direction of Old Spice cologne -- not exactly like Old Space, mind you, but something like it.  I find it fairly unpleasant and I won&#x27;t be wearing it.  I put some on my hands when I got the bottle today to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; it and now, despite several hand washings, I can&#x27;t get the unpleasant spicy scent to go away.  Anything undertones of lime, if they were ever there at all, are long gone.  Call me unreasonable if you like, but when a cologne calls itself &amp;#34;lime&amp;#34;, I expect it to smell like limes, at least to some recognizable extent, so I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.  Thankfully, it only cost me ten bucks and change.</li>
    <li> This is a big bottle. The smell is beautiful. It will make you want to shave more often.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping, and great packaging. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come close to smelling like &amp;#34;Royall Lyme&amp;#34; as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Pinaud is one of the oldest names in men&#x27;s grooming products.  Lime Sec is a fresh, light citrusy scent which goes on light but lasts.</li>
    <li> Masculine, lime scented cologne is a perfect ending to your morning shave. Like all Pinaud/Clubman products, it&#x27;s a great value. If the price were twice as high, it would still be a good bargain. If you like the scent of fresh limes, you&#x27;ll love this cologne!</li>
    <li> This is a good summertime scent for men. It lasts about four hours but slight remnants stay on your body. I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face because of the alcohol, but a splash on my chest every morning does the trick nicely. It has a sweet, citrusy smell that works well with the sweatier times of the day.</li>
    <li> odor lasts longer than you want....  smells cheap</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh and invigorating scent at a very reasonable price (including shipping). I do not under the negative reviews this product receives. The author(s) may have problems with their olfactory senses. On-time delivery and well-packaged. If you prefer the scent of LIME, then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Good product but fragrance does not have much long term staying power. Seems to wear off in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good product given the favorable pricing.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  Crisp and clean.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Old school, feels manly.</li>
    <li> First started using Pinaud products in Danang back in 1969.  Their products didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;break down&amp;#34; like the popular stuff sold at the various B/P &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; outlets and back in &amp;#34;the world.&amp;#34;  Since I live in a desert biome, Pinaud still works.  Places like WallyWorld, Walgreens, and CVS have ceased caring much about men&#x27;s toileties of quality.  Most of us traditionals simply hit-up mail order for shaving needs... like REAL blades, safety razors, and skin care products.</li>
    <li> A great way to freshen up your undercarriage on a hot sticky day in which the luxury of a bath or shower will remain a remote possibility.</li>
    <li> I always liked the scent of citrusy smelling cologne and this is milder to some of the others out there. It does not have a overpowering scent and seems to be more subtile after an hour or so. But noticed when active and breaking a sweat I get a hint of not lime or perfumery but clean smell. Good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this today. I had recently purchased Col. Conk&#x27;s Lime shave soap and want this aftershave to compliment it. Unfortunately it does not have as strong a lime scent as I had hoped. Opening the bottle I catch hints of lime but more of the lime scent I associate with cleaning products (this is not surprising and partially due to the alcohol, which one should be expecting to smell at first). I dabbed some on my wrist and let is sit for a while to see what the true scent would be. The scent afterwards left mostly a powdery clean musk sent on me. I did not mind this but did not greatly care for it at the same time (My wife did not approve at all). Colognes smell different on everyone. I am able to carry heavier scents well and tend to amplify most colognes, this could be part of the issue as musk sent will stick better to me then lime (not know for its staying power). For only $6 it was well worth the test. I am sure I can find someone among my friends who will enjoy the scent. The search for a lime after shave/cologne goes on. :)</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE GREATEST. PRICED RIGHT AND VERY PLEASANT. FUN TO OVER USE....&lt;br /&gt;IT IS ALMOST A BARBER SHOP EXCLUSIVE, SO FUN TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FROM AMAZON...</li>
    <li> Mellow Lime fragrance, not sharp like some.  Perfect for Summer, masculine, enduring.  It&#x27;s a shame these  fragrances are now sold in plastic bottles when sparkling glass is more recyclable AND beautiful.  But I suppose in this case political correctness takes precedence over  quality of design.</li>
    <li> When I was a sailor, I spent months at sea. Granted, we stopped at port 3-4 times a week, and the women were fast an easy, but that&#x27;s besides the point. As you do when at sea, you get scurvy. Rubbed this on my face, scurvy cured in three applications. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice touch on this is the finger grooves in the bottle. Things tend to get wet &#x27;n&#x27; wild whilst applying said product, so you need all the control you can get! Splish splash, and mind the bight, coxswain.</li>
    <li> Lime sec!  Where have you been all my life?  I retired this and citrus musk by Clubman on a lark as I liked their other products.  My girlfriend and her friends love it.  I use it as an aftershave and get more compliments for it then I do for the expensive colognes I wear.  My brother tried it and bought it the same day.</li>
    <li> I buy it all the time I love it</li>
    <li> This would probably be okay if I had not had to drink lime-flavored &amp;#34;clear you out&amp;#34; medical solution for the ol&#x27; probe up the rear. Unfortunately, it smells exactly like the stuff they had me drink for it tasted. The end result, smelling this stuff makes me want to heave. So, fair warning for anyone who has had similar medical experiences.</li>
    <li> Smell like a movie star like Clark Gable or Rock Hudson. Smell like these wonderful guys and get the ladies wanting to do the no pants dance just in the knick of time when they go a smelling you. Smell kind of like an old Man, but with Money and that goes a long way with these dames. Put a little on your arms, neck, behind your ears and a dab under your nuts to get those 2 greasy hairy sweaty meatballs smelling just swell. Mmmmhmmm Ladies will want to go down and take a long sniff of your tally whacker for sure. Stuff has a nice lime scent that you just can&#x27;t get out of Lime (fruit) this stuff is insane how good it is. Put a dab on your neck before going into the titty bar and you&#x27;ll see these dancers wanting to tuck a buck down your pants and take you home. True story. You will smell classy and like you have money these dames panties will be soaking wet. Can you really not afford to buy this stuff? Especially if you&#x27;re a short fat old geezer who has been living a long time with some backed up blue balls. Do you the favor friend and get this stuff. No more admiring Women with your tongue half out and breathing hard and ready to rub the tip of your stick. Hecks no the tables will turn now.</li>
    <li> Tamper proof seal was pulled down below the cap. Not worth the hassle of sending back. Bad experience.</li>
    <li> One of my go-to tonics. I love the smell of this. I use it in combination with the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn lime shave soap and it&#x27;s just like a vacation for my face.</li>
    <li> i love all of clubman&#x27;s stuff, but this was used as a clean-up after the straight razor shave at my barber.&lt;br /&gt;the smell stuck with me so now I have it to freshn up.</li>
    <li> Refreshing lime scent one of Pinauds best</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud Lime Sec imparts a clean smell of a lime/citrus aftershave. It has a light and clean fragrance. Use it liberally after shower and shave. It will not linger for an extended time. Great value at this price.</li>
    <li> This product smells like lime in the bottle.  Very nice.  When applied, it has that &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; scent even when allowed to sit and air as barbers used to do back in the day.  It quickly turns, on both myself and a friend that tried it, from a fresh Island lime to insect repellent.  Next time, I&#x27;ll just rub Chrysanthemum cuttings on my neck and wrists.  It was absolutely awful.  The worst.  Check out &amp;#34;Royall Lime,&amp;#34; if you want authentic, vintage type scents that are high quality.  I will never use this again except on myself and my dog as a repellent!</li>
    <li> The smell is strong and fun.Women love the smell of it.I got a nice size bottle at a really good price.I like Clubman products.</li>
    <li> Too lemony and simple minded for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing else than lemony smell that is abot it. Perhaps it can combine well with other fragances.</li>
    <li> Want a great after shower wake up?  This is it.  I have been paying an equivalent of twelve times as much for a lime cologne that is not as good.  I now have three of the best aftershaves available for guys who appreciate classics.  They are all Pinaud Clubman products.</li>
    <li> Smells like sweet limes but dont last long like citrus musk does but am happy with it</li>
    <li> I love the smell... Fresh and light...</li>
    <li> You know what I&#x27;m talking about.  This is the stuff you find in men&#x27;s spas and private clubs.  Now you can have it at home.  Just wish it came in a glass bottle instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> That scent I remember from when my father took me to his barber. It starts off like a lime lollipop, but quickly mellows to a fresh cut lime. A crisp. clean fragrance for grown-ups.</li>
    <li> I am on a quest to find something close to Old Spice Lime like my father wore in the 1970&#x60;s.  I took a chance and purchased this Lime Sec.  It&#x60;s not close to Old Spice Lime but I do like this.  Smells like a green lollipop with notes of pine and lime. . My wife likes the smell of Lime Sec but nothing really helps when it comes to spicing up the love life.  We&#x60;re both nearly 50 and were more like brother and sister than husband and wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have any suggestions for an aftershave that is close to Old Spice Lime?</li>
    <li> So I have never tried a Lime cologne.  I had no idea what to expect, but after purchasing the Pinaud Clubman Classic Aftershave, and absolutly loving the scent, I figured I would try more.  I will say that this is not for everyone, I also have the Citrus Musk which is similar but a better one to start.  So I will say, if you have every had one of the fancy lime popscicles and loved the flavor and the smell of the lime, you will like this.&lt;br /&gt;When you first put it on, yes you are struck by the strong fragrence of lime popscicle but in a good way.  Eventually that basically fades away, to a nice powdery cool scent.  But if you start really moving around, heating up the cologne, you will smell the lime again.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly do like this cologne, and would order it again.  But because of the scent, I think it is really only fitting for the warmest of summer days.  When the cool lime scent would be best.</li>
    <li> I actually prefer to use this on my hair where I find I can smell it all day. The scent last a little longer than the musk colonge .</li>
    <li> It is known by some of the best that one the great places to meet women is in the produce section of the grocery store.  Women who know how to cook, and are health conscious will always visit that section, as opposed to the frozen food aisle, where...  well, the women don&#x27;t necessarily have to be fit or know how to cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where Pinaud Lime Sec Cologne comes into play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinaud Lime Sec Cologne smells like limes.  It has a wonderful scent.  Kinda sweet.  Subtle.  My wife (thirties, mother of three) finds the scent pleasant and appealing.  I find the scent to be something that does not get old and annoying through the day.  You know the colognes that by the end of the day that make you feel sick.  This is not one of them.  You forget it&#x27;s there, yet one of the kids asked me at night while cuddling why I smelled like lime, so the scent is still there, and I hardly put any on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that&#x27;s beside the point.  I apologize as I went away from the true point of the review, and why you&#x27;re even reading it.  How to meet women.  \\&quot;Who cares if it smells good?  I just want to meet women!\\&quot; is what you&#x27;re thinking.  Point taken.  I apologize.  Profusely.  But there&#x27;s one thing to note:  I feel an incredible amount of guilt about what I&#x27;m about to write as I have experienced all of this.  Don&#x27;t worry, my wife and I are going through counseling, and I think we will be OK.  I have stopped using Pinaud Lime Sec Cologne, except at home.  I shower before I go out, and use Axe cologne to drive away females.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to meet women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1.  Use a good amount of Pinaud Lime Sec Cologne.  The average female olfactory system should smell you from exactly 5 feet away.  No more, no less.  Your sister should be able to help you with this, but be careful.  If you don&#x27;t have a sister, use a friend, but make sure there isn&#x27;t some sort of sexual tension (if it&#x27;s possible to have a female friend without sexual tension).&lt;br /&gt;Step 2.  Go to the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3.  Go to the produce aisle.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4.  Hang out in front of the limes.&lt;br /&gt;Step 5.  Stand still.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6.  Wait.&lt;br /&gt;Step 7.  Analyze the woman checking you for freshness:&lt;br /&gt;- If you don&#x27;t like the woman who starts to check you for freshness, apologize and run away.&lt;br /&gt;- If you like the woman, stay still.  Hopefully she will put you in her sack and you will soon find youself on her kitchen countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3.

    <li> I am on a bit of tear, trying all the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop products. I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one. I think this is a great summer fragrance but if you are not going to work up a sweat, you might notice the &amp;#34;urinal cake,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; smell some others have mentioned. At first I liked it, but after a couple of days I noticed some of those undertones, and wondered what other people were smelling. I did find one good use for it, slather it on before you go to work in the yard. You will still smell great when you hit the shower. It might keep the bugs away too. I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh lime scent of this cologne, I just wished it lasted a little longer on your skin. But for that, I would have given it five stars. My everyday cologne/aftershave/splash-on.</li>
    <li> I would like to focus my review on specific features of the product: its price point/value, and my experience with these specific product features. While I appreciate most features of the product [among them, its scent], one particular feature, its price point [ I originally paid $11.00 w/FREE Shipping from &#x27;cosmeticbeautyplace&#x27;] has little value at any rate much higher than this [it can be purchased locally at a slightly higher, but still acceptable, rate for value]. The significance of this product&#x27;s price point is that when received with &#x27;&#x27;FREE Shipping&#x27;&#x27;, it&#x27;s a good value, but when received with unexpected &#x27;&#x27;Postage Due&#x27;&#x27; [$7.49 in my case], then not so much...  While your product experience may vary, in my overall experience with this product this can be a good product, but with potential downside in price point/value, it has essentially resulted in a disappointing product and Amazon experience!</li>
    <li> A clean feel and fragrance that has now replaced my proraso aftershave.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Girlfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> I love the lime.  Masculine and very tropical.  Mellows out nice too.</li>
    <li> It was a reorder at my husband&#x27;s request..  He likes the fragrance a lot and he&#x27;s very particular about wearing anything.</li>
    <li> This is that lime cologne you have been looking for. It smells great and you never have to worry about scurvy again!</li>
    <li> My barber uses this and I liked the smell, so I got some of my own.  A few fingertips worth after shaving or in the morning are all you need and it smells very fresh and light.  I&#x27;ve been using this a few weeks and you can&#x27;t even tell that any is missing from the bottle.  My wife loves it, and I use it in conjunction with my Pinaud powder to complete the barbershop feel.</li>
    <li> Smells great and will wake you up! I love all the Clubman products and this one is no exception.</li>
    <li> great product very happy,</li>
    <li> Smells like urinal cakes.  I&#x27;m going to use it in my black tank in my RV.  This is the only Clubman tonic I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
    <li> In the immortal words of the Italian Stallion-&amp;#34; It makes me smeel mainly!&amp;#34; Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this as a \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; daily aftershave. Whether it&#x27;s technically an aftershave or a cologne, I don&#x27;t really care, since it does what I need it to do: firm up the skin and provide a nice, subtle scent. It does NOT, however, contain the moisturizers that one might look for in aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the scent, it&#x27;s bright and citrus without being too sweet and fruity, a problem with other Pinaud products. And at this price, you can have an inexpensive daily aftershave and save the good stuff (*cough* Givenchy Gentleman *cough*) for big boy events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Lime Sec is a bargain and strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> This has a lighter scent than the Clubman after shave.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and you can leave it on all day.</li>
    <li> Forget all the Old Spice commercials, this product is the stuff of legend. Smells masculine with a hint of lime. Since I started wearing this my wife can&#x27;t keep her hands off me.  Half of how a cologne smells is how it reacts with your own body chemistry. Different people get different results.  Bottom line, good value for money and if your body chemistry is compatible then you&#x27;ll never be bored.  I would write a longer review but I am needed elsewhere....</li>
