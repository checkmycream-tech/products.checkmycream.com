<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love sublime beauty products but this day cream is not for me. It feels like sunscreen. It has a thicker consistency to it and I just didn&#x27;t like the feel of it.  Otherwise, the cream seems to work well as long as you don&#x27;t mind the consistency of it.</li>
    <li> Really love using this for summer time , helps with tone and texture if my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C day cream so much. A little goes a long way. I can use it by itself or under my makeup. It makes my skin feel and look smooth. As an added bonus it has 30 SPF to help protect my skin from all those sun rays. I was given this Vitamin C Day Cream at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> When the weather permits I am outside working in the yard.  It is important that I protect my skin from the weather, and especially from the sun.  An absolute must is the Sublime Beauty SPF 30 VITAMIN C DAY CREAM. After cleansing my face, I (1) pat gently the Sublime Beauty FACE WHISPERER ADVANCED EYE GEL around the eyes, without stretching or pulling the skin, just a gentle patting; (2) apply with upward strokes a &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; of the SUBLIME BEAUTY AGELESS LINE SMOOTHER; and, finally, again, with upward strokes, gently massage in the Sublime Beauty SPF 30 VITAMIN C DAY CREAM up the neck and face areas as the topper. I am a believer that use of the same line of skin products enhances the skin, whether one applies one at a time or uses a combination.  In my book, the Sublime Beauty SPF 30 VITAMIN DAY CREAM is essential for exposure to the elements, and eases my mind about spending 5- 6 hours gardening.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a good sun protective cream. The sublime beauty SPF 30 vitamin C day crem is the first one I really like. To begin with, the little jar looks very nice, the cream glides easily on your skin, and absorbs quickly. I travel a lot in hot, sunny climat and this cream literally saved my skin. Love it and recommend to everybody who wants to have gorges sun protected skin.</li>
    <li> I like this day cream it nice and thick, but not so thick that i cannot wear it throughout the Georgia summer. it has a nice fresh light scent and is not overpowering in any way. I like that it contains not only 30 spf but that it also has vitamin c which actually helps repair skin tissue with repeated use. I first cleanse my face then apply this on, I let it absorb to my skin for 20 mins before putting on any makeup and if its a no makeup type of day then I wait at least 30 mins before going outside to really let that spf kick in. I was sent this for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice smooth cream that makes my skin feel and look smoother.  I love it under my foundation.</li>
    <li> I have always love Sublime beauty products, none of them fail my expectation so far. They always come so well packed with nice bag. It can be a very nice gift if you plan to do so. Me, they are too good to give it out, I want to have them all. This day cream is creamy and rich, though it is rich, it goes on nicely and didn&#x27;t take long to absorb. It doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue or greasy feeling after. I have no problem laying another facial product after this cream. It keeps my face hydrated all day long. I especially love the SPF 30 feature. Living in South, sun block protection is so much needed. I am glad that it saves me another step to apply sun block scream. I have used it for about 3 weeks now, my skin never has any sensitive reaction, no break out. My face is really smooth and gets brighter. I like it and the scent is light and soothing. (I do also use other facial products and skin supplement, so I can&#x27;t really tell which one is contributing the smoothness of my skin. But none of them gives me problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it at discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I highly recommend this brand and this day cream is real nice.</li>
    <li> My first time with this product but I love Sublime Beauty products..I even have my sister in England hooked..</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Sublime Beauty products.  Every single product I&#x27;ve tried has been awesome and I&#x27;ve seen great results from using them.  I was very excited to try this new product and once again, I am pleased!!!  I have been trying to find a good moisturizer that has sunscreen, especially since we are going in to spring and summer.  My problem with moisturizers in the past is that they tend to leave my skin greasy and I am sometimes sensitive to the sunscreen.  I am really impressed by this day cream!  It contains vitamins A, C and E, which are wonderfully powerful anti-oxidants that fights aging.  Add to that the 30 SPF and I have my new favorite day cream.  (Plus even though it is a very thick day cream, it didn&#x27;t make me greasy at all.  It soaks in nice and wears great under my make-up.)  It smells great too!  One other thing I haven&#x27;t mentioned; the service that you get from Sublime is second to none.  When was the last time the owner of Chanel sent you a personal email and responded to your questions?  That is the personal service that, in addition to their awesome products, sets Sublime apart from the rest.  I highly recommend this product and this company.  If you have skin concerns, they will help you choose the right products for you.  Sample provided for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of day creams and this one is definitely my favorite. It has a nice smell and the product goes a long way. I have noticed a difference in the way my skin feels and looks since using it. Overall my skin seems brighter and dark spots lighter, not gone but definitely lighter. I would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> The scent is light and fresh.  Great protection against the sun and it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Sublime Day Cream is just O.K. I feel it is heavy when applied to the face and it has this weird odor. My face does not feel or look hydrated after application. In fact all my wrinkles seem to stand out even more. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a great day cream. It smells refreshing and citrusy and most importantly the SPF is 30. If you apply too much it will become lumpy on your face. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it as a finishing product. It makes a good base to apply other products onto my skin. It gives me a finished look. I’m so happy with this product. I can use it regularly without having an oily look into my skin. It smells natural and feels like a premium. I received this product to try and I am sharing my honest opinion.</li>

The best thing for me though, is that this day cream did not make my face break out at all. I am so happy to finally find a product that protects my face from the sun without having to worry about breaking out. I have to mention that I have received an e-mail from the founder of Sublime Beauty with every product that I ordered. She gives me a detailed explanation of the product and wants to make sure that I am fully satisfied. I feel like she goes above and beyond for her customers and that makes me feel appreciated and makes me want to continue using her products.</li>
    <li> As with other Sublime Beauty products I&#x27;ve tried, this goes on wonderfully and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;m notorious for not using any sunscreen, so having a day cream that has the SPF 30 in it is a good thing for me.</li>
    <li> too oily ! and makes me Breakout . probably will work in winter.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream! It&#x27;s perfect for summer! It&#x27;s a good thick face cream yet it isn&#x27;t greasy.  Great spf protection from the sun!</li>
    <li> This product is great for summers by the pool! Thick but not greasy. I like that it has spf 30.</li>
    <li> This cream is very good fir the skin.</li>
