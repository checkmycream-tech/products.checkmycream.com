    <li> This product has really helped when I feel an anxiety attack coming on.  I keep one in my purse and one on the counter in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> This little bottle lasts a long time. We use it every night to unwind. We put it on our temples and wrists. My husband puts a little under his nose for the smell, which is also fabulous. We love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The oil is used after yoga and the scent just helps you relax.  I would order of gallon of this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Love this product - arrived as promised!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s perfect for helping relieve stress.  I put it on the inside of my wrists and start to relax.</li>
    <li> This oil is ideal if you need to de-stress.  Rub this on the back of your neck, inside of your wrists.  It is a really calming and soothing scent that is not too strong and includes vanilla and cinnamon, so it&#x27;s a soft and comfy smell.  It mixes well with the citrus notes and really does help calm you down.  I have purchased this twice now and will purchase again.  I have also had co-workers compliment me on how lovely I smell (bonus as a pleasant perfume!) Highly recommend. Easy to carry with you, just be sure to screw the cap on tight or keep in a plastic zip bag.</li>
    <li> Nothing but smelly oil...did nothing. I think this stuff is like a TV evangels.....if you believe a smack in the head will cure you...then it will</li>
    <li> I have used Young Living products before and I ordered this on Amazon because I did not want to wait to get the order from a local rep. That is how much I love this product. I use it after a stressful day. I rub just a little on my palms and then I massage onto my forehead, sinus area and face and just breathe in with both hands over my entire face. It is very helpful right before going to bed.</li>
    <li> Stress-Away really relaxed me when I am feeling stress out and also I like the smell of it.  I would recommended it.</li>
    <li> Yet Another awesome oil I carry always in my handbag😊</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews &amp; am very upset!  It does NOT smell like citrus-total harsh cedar!  I got a horrible migraine after just 1 application to both wrists!  And when I tried to request a return, I was informed that I could not receive one because the product was opened &amp; that was upsetting because nothing on this page indicates that no refunds can be issued.  I will never buy from this seller again nor will I trust buying oils again.  I am a very dissatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I have purchased or used &#x27;stress away&#x27;. I personally use it before yoga, meditation, or bed to ease the mind and body.</li>
    <li> The quality is the best and the roller ball container makes it great for keeping it with you. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it leaking. I will buy this product for other essential oil blends as needed. It appears their is a little leakage around the cap upon receipt, but the bottle is still full.</li>
    <li> The scent is intoxicating and relaxes me. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> seems very relaxing....a truly natural blend of essential oils in a most convenient method of application...this is a good price for it, too</li>
