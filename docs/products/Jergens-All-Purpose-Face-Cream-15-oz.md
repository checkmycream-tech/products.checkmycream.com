### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It is a bit on the greasy side, so if you have oily skin, this is probably not the best thing.</li>
      <li>afterwards for the best results.  </li>
      <li>Plus it is a wonderful moisturizer for your face.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good cream.  </li>
      <li>This old-fashioned cream is inexpensive, but works great.  </li>
      <li>It makes my makeup go on great, and the moisture helps keep my lashes great, and I swear it helps them grow.</li>
      <li>This product is a great all-purpose face cream to remove makeup, moisturize, cleanse, etc.</li>

      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Nothing works better!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an excellent cream, it smells great (somewhat old fashioned) and there is a lot more in the container than the Ponds.      </li>
      <li>I find a product like soap or a body spray mist that is popular and works, it somehow vanishes from the market.  </li>
      <li>Glad someone is still selling this good product.</li>
      <li>The smell however, is very strong.</li>
      <li>Rinse your face with warm water and then use your favorite night time firming cream or vitamin e cream before you go to bed.  </li>
      <li>Amazon had exactly what she wanted at a great price, so...</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are large jars and great value for the money.  </li>
      <li>She loves the creaminess and coverage; I remember that it does an outstanding job removing makeup.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, hope they won&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
      <li>Would love to see it continue.</li>
      <li>Since we lived in the US many years ago, my wife insists this face cream or none.</li>
      <li>This has been around for many years and it is multipurpose.  </li>
      <li>After using this for months, I am only about 1/4 or 1/5 of the way through the jar which is awesome!</li>
      <li>and I love Jergens products</li>
      <li>This is recommended more as a cleanser/ make up remover.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this must cut into the business of our neighborhood drugstores.</li>
      <li>but this is awesome as a moisturizer for dry elbows and knees too.</li>
      <li>Lucky!  </li>
      <li>( most applied the night befors is absorbed)</li>
      <li>I did find it available online.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is great for dry skin and eczema.  </li>
      <li>Great for dry skin or problem areas.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remove it with a tissue but leave it on over night and it absorbs into the dry patches of my face and it looks amazing!</li>
      <li>kind of greasy and well just different.</li>
      <li>Overall though, it is effective and does moisturize your face once you wash it off.</li>
      <li>so it all depends whether it is the right one for you or not.</li>
      <li>I pat my face dry, and my face still feels nice and dewy, but doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
      <li>I love it more than any other high end moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My skin is clear smooth and even toned now.</li>
      <li>I tried it and low and behold, it is absolutely fabulous!  </li>
      <li>and this is exactly what she&#x27;s been using forever (it seems to me).</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessarily better, but it is definitely a bit thicker</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it, now, for a week and had no problems with break outs or anything, just super soft, glowing skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Walgreens quit selling it and it was had to fine across the Mexican border where I use to get it, also.</li>
      <li>, I had some wrinkles start on my forehead and even those are much smoother looking, just from this alone.  </li>
      <li>It also has that timeless nostalgia smell and in lovely pink packaging.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I stopped by a corner market a few days ago to see if they had the Aloe Vera cream that I liked to use at night and under my makeup.  </li>
      <li>works great for taking off my false eyelashes.</li>
      <li>and then just gently rub off the make up, which is pretty easy to do and to clean off with wet tissue just as long as there isn&#x27;t too much of it.</li>
      <li>my whole body was so soft, I didn&#x27;t need to lotion up, from what cream got into the bath water.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rarely see the Jergens Face Cream available at the store (usually Walmart) and if it is, I buy it.  </li>
      <li>I love this face cream, I normally use it everyday</li>
      <li>So I have recently developed even drier skin than I had in high school and heard some older women raving about this.</li>
      <li>This is the best cold cream on the market and a 15 oz jar costs only $3.99.  </li>
      <li>It is light, fluffy and very efficient for removing makeup, even eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 42, and I&#x27;m continuely mistaken in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years and have found that it makes removing make-up so much easier, especially mascaras.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable in which I purchased mine for about $3 and still have a lot left over.</li>
      <li>I almost left the market and noticed the my Aloe Vera cream was right next to it.  </li>
      <li>My friends would tease me because it looked as though it&#x27;s for \\&quot;old people\\&quot; apparently.</li>
      <li>I live in a very high dry climate and because I&#x27;m from the east coast, I&#x27;m not used to trying out products to replenish moisture instead of products that I normally use to eliminate excessive moisture because of high humidity cities.  </li>
      <li>At first the cream seems odd-</li>
      <li>I was worried I was going to get some generic or old thing of face cream because of the different/weird product picture that is shown but the one I received looks exactly like the other pictures for this product!!!</li>
      <li>it gets soaked into your dry skin completely over night.</li>

<li> I have really dry skin, but when I use this it&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
<li> But I have sinced learned over the past three months to only apply about a nickle size amount over my entire face at night.</li>
<li> I use it to remove makup and as a cream for my feet and dry rough patches.  </li>
<li> I then only follow up with small applications in the morning after I shower and pat my face dry on the really dry areas of my face.</li>
<li> Tired of paying very high prices for make-up remover at your cosmetics counter?  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin, and usually after I apply my moisture cream and make up, it doesn&#x27;t take long, before my skin feels all dry, again....</li>
<li> half way around the globe is routine.</li>
<li> I am not really sure if it is giving me wrinkle reducing benefits because I use other products for that...</li>
<li> I applied it all over my face and neck, let it soak in a few minutes and then washed it off, with a damp cloth.</li>
<li> I suggest putting very little on since I find it greasy</li>
<li> I use the crsam at night to remove make up, then wash with Jergens soap, then I apply a small amount of the cream all over my face.</li>
<li> Seriously...</li>
<li> It is a bit heavy and oily; so maybe not best for oily skin.</li>
<li> Usually I use the Ponds Cold Cream, or a homemade cold cream.  </li>
<li> My mother used to use cold cream to remove make-up decades ago</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am not really sure if it is giving me wrinkle reducing benefits because I use other products for that...but it definitely moisturized&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I stopped by a corner market a few days ago to see if they had the Aloe Vera cream that I liked to use at night and under my makeup.  I saw the Jergens cream and read it, and said \\&quot;hmmm\\&quot;, I do need a makeup cleansing cream and I love Jergens products so I picked it up.  I almost left the market and noticed the my Aloe Vera cream was right next to it.  Lucky!  I tried it and low and behold, it is absolutely fabulous!  I live in a very high dry climate and because I&#x27;m from the east coast, I&#x27;m not used to trying out products to replenish moisture instead of products that I normally use to eliminate excessive moisture because of high humidity cities.  I love it!  I ask that Jergens NOT take this off the market.  It seems like everytime I find a product like soap or a body spray mist that is popular and works, it somehow vanishes from the market.  I know that this product is a definite winner!  I love it and it definitely moisturizes your face.  I do suggest that if you use it to remove makeup to also use a cotton swab and go over any excess moisture with a hydrating toner (i.e., L&#x27;Oreal hyrating toner, etc.) afterwards for the best results.  Rinse your face with warm water and then use your favorite night time firming cream or vitamin e cream before you go to bed.  Your skin will be radiant!</li>
    <li> Why does everything now days have to have  ALUMINUM included in the ingredients?? (Aluminum thought to cause brain disorders). I wont use it! Don&#x27;t buy!  db</li>
    <li> This old-fashioned cream is inexpensive, but works great.  I use it to wash my face and also take off my eye makeup.  It is a bit heavy and oily; so maybe not best for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ! I have very dry skin, and usually after I apply my moisture cream and make up, it doesn&#x27;t take long, before my skin feels all dry, again.... I saw this at walmart.com actually and thought I would give it a try. I applied it all over my face and neck, let it soak in a few minutes and then washed it off, with a damp cloth. I also use it at night, now, just massaging some in and leaving it on, all night. it gets soaked into your dry skin completely over night. My face looks so radiant, I&#x27;m amazed, I had some wrinkles start on my forehead and even those are much smoother looking, just from this alone.  I used it in the tub, on my face and then washed it off, when I got out of the bath my whole body was so soft, I didn&#x27;t need to lotion up, from what cream got into the bath water.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit on the greasy side, so if you have oily skin, this is probably not the best thing. I have been using it, now, for a week and had no problems with break outs or anything, just super soft, glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes off waterproof mascara, too!. I love this stuff, hope they won&#x27;t stop making it. FYI I got a 2 pack at walmart for 6 bucks, so cheaper than this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years. Walgreens quit selling it and it was had to fine across the Mexican border where I use to get it, also. Glad someone is still selling this good product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable in which I purchased mine for about $3 and still have a lot left over. This is recommended more as a cleanser/ make up remover. I suggest putting very little on since I find it greasy and then just gently rub off the make up, which is pretty easy to do and to clean off with wet tissue just as long as there isn&#x27;t too much of it. The smell however, is very strong. Some people may like it so it all depends whether it is the right one for you or not. Overall though, it is effective and does moisturize your face once you wash it off.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for removing stubborn waterproof eye makeup for 40 years.  Nothing works better!  Great for dry skin or problem areas.  Oh-oh!  Jergen&#x27;s no longer makes this product.  I just went to their website and this product is no longer listed.  What a shame!!</li>
    <li> This has been around for many years and it is multipurpose.  It is great for dry skin and eczema.  I use it to remove makup and as a cream for my feet and dry rough patches.  It also has that timeless nostalgia smell and in lovely pink packaging.  According to Jergens, this is on the sales decline and no longer excist on their website.  Would love to see it continue.</li>
    <li> Usually I use the Ponds Cold Cream, or a homemade cold cream.  I rarely see the Jergens Face Cream available at the store (usually Walmart) and if it is, I buy it.  It&#x27;s a very good cream.  It&#x27;s very similar to the Ponds CC and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessarily better, but it is definitely a bit thicker and it&#x27;s an excellent cream, it smells great (somewhat old fashioned) and there is a lot more in the container than the Ponds.      I just wish they would update the packaging.  Seriously...</li>
    <li> I got this face cream for about three bucks at Walmart for the same size. I love this face cream, I normally use it everyday and I love it!</li>
    <li> To ALL the peopls saying that Jergens no longer makes this, yes they do. It has not been listed on their site for quite awhile. They still sell it at Wal-Mart. I have been buying it there for years. I have combination skin, and this works wonders on my skin. I use the crsam at night to remove make up, then wash with Jergens soap, then I apply a small amount of the cream all over my face. My skin is clear smooth and even toned now. I apply the cream again in the morning ( most applied the night befors is absorbed) tissue off, then wash with Jergens soap. No moisturizer required during the day except eye cream. I&#x27;m 42, and I&#x27;m continuely mistaken in my early 30&#x27;s. I still get carded. Jergens Rocks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and have found that it makes removing make-up so much easier, especially mascaras.</li>
    <li> So I have recently developed even drier skin than I had in high school and heard some older women raving about this. So I gave it a try and I&#x27;m in love!!! I was worried I was going to get some generic or old thing of face cream because of the different/weird product picture that is shown but the one I received looks exactly like the other pictures for this product!!! My routine is to wash my face at night with the japanese clay bar soap [[ASIN:B000YBZIAC Deitanseki Soap (Clay and Charcoal Facial Cleansing Bar)]] by lathering it in a washcloth and moving it in a circular motion then rinsing. I then moisturize with this amazing cream! I don&#x27;t remove it with a tissue but leave it on over night and it absorbs into the dry patches of my face and it looks amazing! At first the cream seems odd- kind of greasy and well just different. But I have sinced learned over the past three months to only apply about a nickle size amount over my entire face at night. I then only follow up with small applications in the morning after I shower and pat my face dry on the really dry areas of my face. After using this for months, I am only about 1/4 or 1/5 of the way through the jar which is awesome! I haven&#x27;t used this as a remedy for anything else but this is awesome as a moisturizer for dry elbows and knees too.</li>
    <li> This is the best cold cream on the market and a 15 oz jar costs only $3.99.  It is light, fluffy and very efficient for removing makeup, even eye makeup.  It leaves your skin soft and clean.  I&#x27;ve used this cream for years and panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local variety stores and was told that Jergens no longer makes this product.  While the local stores such as Rite-Aid, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s and the like don&#x27;t carry this product any longer, you can find it on Amazon--thank goodness.</li>
    <li> My mom could no longer get this at her local pharmacy, so she asked me to order online. Amazon had exactly what she wanted at a great price, so... I checked with her and this is exactly what she&#x27;s been using forever (it seems to me). She loves the creaminess and coverage; I remember that it does an outstanding job removing makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have been using this for years. My friends would tease me because it looked as though it&#x27;s for \\&quot;old people\\&quot; apparently. No way. I have really dry skin, but when I use this it&#x27;s not a problem at all. My friends that teased me now swear by it as well. I always use it after I wash my face. I put it on as though it&#x27;s a soap and rinse afterwards. I pat my face dry, and my face still feels nice and dewy, but doesn&#x27;t look greasy. It makes my makeup go on great, and the moisture helps keep my lashes great, and I swear it helps them grow. BUY THIS!  I love it more than any other high end moisturizer. I always go back to this.</li>
    <li> Since we lived in the US many years ago, my wife insists this face cream or none. Now ordering and receiving a shipment half way around the globe is routine. I&#x27;m sure this must cut into the business of our neighborhood drugstores.</li>
    <li> Tired of paying very high prices for make-up remover at your cosmetics counter?  My mother used to use cold cream to remove make-up decades ago but when I went on a search for it at my drug store, I couldn&#x27;t find it.  I did find it available online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are large jars and great value for the money.  Plus it is a wonderful moisturizer for your face.</li>
    <li> This product is a great all-purpose face cream to remove makeup, moisturize, cleanse, etc. I don&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
    <li> My grandmother and mother swear by this stuff and I&#x27;ve been using it since I started wearing makeup.  works great for taking off my false eyelashes.</li>
