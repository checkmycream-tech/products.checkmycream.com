    <li> Great conditioner!  Leaves my hair soft and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Great everyday conditioner, keeps my hair in super healthy condition.</li>

    <li> Buyer beware of Amazon and eBay counterfeits!&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Penetraitt conditioner is used by many cosmetology schools and salons. It&#x27;s one of the best conditioners and conditioning treatments (massage in hair, put on cap, put under salon bonnet heat dryer). I strongly suggest going online to Sally Beauty and spending $90 for the &amp;#34;Modern Elements 1875W Ionic Pro Rollabout Tourmaline Dryer&amp;#34;. Your hair will be so amazingly soft. Just five minutes, up to fifteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About counterfeits. I have bought from eBay sellers and Amazon sellers who are authorized Amazon Prime dealers. There will be about 1/6th left that will not come out of the bottle. I get lazy. Put six of those in a closet and was going to use a box cutter to get the rest out. One day I opened a new bottle from a cosmetology school that sold me one. I had used other bottles, but those didn&#x27;t work as well. I thought these other bottles might be counterfeit. A friend of mine gets calls from a customer who makes custom shampoos, conditioners, soaps for some big name product lines when they need more capacity or if a customer wants a custom made solution and bottling. This customer told my friend that he can counterfeit any brand shampoo or conditioner. These guys are chemists. So I did some digging online to find out if there was a way to check if mine were real or not. Nothing. Not even the hair care manufacturer will help you out! Sebastian people said I should only by from an authorized reseller off their website. The website I found,  checkcosmetic-dot-net checks the tiny print on the side and bottom of your bottles for &amp;#34;manufactured on&amp;#34; dates so you can figure out the shelf life. So one recent bottle I bought on eBay FROM AMAZON said it was expired by eleven months. On these bottles, look at the bottom of the bottle. Two lines of numbers. Only input the first top row. I returned this bad bottle and my replacement ended up being good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Code: 4267030200&lt;br /&gt;Date of manufacture: 25 of September, 2014&lt;br /&gt;General shelf life: 36 months&lt;br /&gt;OK Valid at least for the next 30 monthsacture: 25 of September, 2014&lt;br /&gt;General shelf life: 36 months&lt;br /&gt;OK Valid at least for the next 30 months</li>
    <li> sebastian penetraitt is the miracle for my hair.my hair are lovely shining ,i love it and i recommend the protein Sebastian also</li>
    <li> A must after you wash your hair with sebastian strengthening and repair shampoo.It leaves the hair soft,silky,shiny and smooth.Especially for chemically starightened and colored hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I have thick curly hair that gets pretty snarly but when I use this conditioner it&#x27;s so much easier to brush through and leaves my hair feeling silky soft.</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever worked on my hair as well.  It was used on my hair in a salon and I made a point to buy some of my own.  I have not been disappointed.</li>

However,  this last time I purchased from Hair beauty world and broke it in hives for days!  Product smelled insanely different,  yet I was completely out so I thought... ah what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try.  Huge mistake!</li>
