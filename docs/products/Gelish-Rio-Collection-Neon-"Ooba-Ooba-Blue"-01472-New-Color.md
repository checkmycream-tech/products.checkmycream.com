      <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Happy color hunting!</li>
      <li>but it is still a beautiful color.</li>
      <li>It came packaged great.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>For me it looks best on tips with glitter on rest of my nail, but still a cute summer/fall color.</li>
      <li>Not as bright as the picture.</li>
      <li>So pretty and perfect to use all the time.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Gelish!</li>
      <li>My favorite is Go Girl!</li>
      <li>I used to spend alot of time doing my own nails.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product and I really liked it.</li>
      <li>I love this color</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the color but the bottle leaks all over the place.</li>
      <li>My girls and I Love the Color and it came quickly!  </li>
      <li>Its a bright blue, goes on nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>It is really easy to do it yourself, although i highly recommend getting a good LED light to cure it instead of the mini lights.</li>
      <li>Gelish is a must buy if you enjoy having polished nails.  </li>
      <li>It is a beautiful true blue color, however, I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as neon.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to try out this neon color, but when I received it, the polish was leaking.</li>
      <li>But the color wasn&#x27;t as bright as I was hoping for, Its more of a dark color rather than a neon.</li>
      <li>The color in the picture looks like a bright true blue.</li>
      <li>it glows bright blue.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that i can put a coat of regular polish over the top if i want to change it up for a night out, and i can just take it off the next day and my Gelish is good as new underneath still.</li>
      <li>I own a martial arts school</li>
      <li>but this one was right on.</li>
      <li>Add daily hot tub visits after classes and forget having a nice manicure that lasts.</li>
      <li>but u need to apply more to the actual nail.</li>
      <li>The color was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Regular acetone nail polish remover works fine though for the last step, cleaning the top coat.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the gelish system, have over a dozen of their colors and generally like all of them...</li>
      <li>The first coat goes on very streaky nd dries up leaving you to apply another coat(which</li>
      <li>There is a reason people order certain colors because it goes with their skin tone.</li>
      <li>I wore it on the fourth of july, it wouldve lasted more than 1 week if i didnt change it to a new color.</li>
      <li>It looks just as good 2 weeks later as it did the first day, other than the fact that it grows out with your nails, like acrylics do.</li>
      <li>Not as bright and the polish is really different from the other gelish ones.</li>
      <li>The Gelish withstands my workouts, my hot tub, my 2 year old, and everything else!</li>
      <li>it is so vibrant and it reacts to black-light</li>
      <li>The color is also not quite what&#x27;s shown here, it&#x27;s a much more sedate blue than the nearly neon it shows, but overall I don&#x27;t mind that..</li>
      <li>Although I love the Gelish products, sometime the colors are not exactly true and this one is not the pretty blue shown, it&#x27;s a darker uglier color.</li>
      <li>For an idea of what the color really looks like (when opaque) - think of the blue in the Superman logo.  </li>
      <li>so my hands and nails really take a beating (literally) on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>Took me forever to finish giving myself this manicure, because on top of having to cure after every nail it takes at least 4 coats to stop looking streaked and 6 to be fully opaque (which is what I prefer).  </li>
      <li>It is much closer to teal than 4th of July blue, so dont buy if you are expecting very blue.</li>
      <li>This color is a bit thin, and requires a more coats for opaque coverage.</li>

    <li> It is much closer to teal than 4th of July blue, so dont buy if you are expecting very blue.</li>
    <li> This color is a bit thin, and requires a more coats for opaque coverage. It is a beautiful true blue color, however, I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as neon.  Gelish is a must buy if you enjoy having polished nails.  Mine always last-no chipping for two weeks! (I hear it can go longer, but I grow bored with the same color after two weeks.)</li>
    <li> For me it looks best on tips with glitter on rest of my nail, but still a cute summer/fall color.</li>
    <li> But the color wasn&#x27;t as bright as I was hoping for, Its more of a dark color rather than a neon.</li>
    <li> Not as bright as the picture. Might be darker by a 1/2 shade. For me that was a bit disappointing b/c it made a difference for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try out this neon color, but when I received it, the polish was leaking. I figured it was just from transit and used it anyway. I put the polish on and it was so diluted, it ran into the cracks between my finger nail and skin! I painted my nails and just a day later, it started to peel. Not to mention the smell! It smelled awful! Extremely disappointed in this seller.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Gelish! I used to spend alot of time doing my own nails. I have a job that is really hard on nail polish and it was almost impossible to get it to last more than 48 hours. I started using the Gelish about 9 months ago and i&#x27;ll never go back to regular nail polish! This stuff stays on no matter what! I own a martial arts school so my hands and nails really take a beating (literally) on a daily basis. Add daily hot tub visits after classes and forget having a nice manicure that lasts. The Gelish withstands my workouts, my hot tub, my 2 year old, and everything else! It looks just as good 2 weeks later as it did the first day, other than the fact that it grows out with your nails, like acrylics do. I love the fact that i can put a coat of regular polish over the top if i want to change it up for a night out, and i can just take it off the next day and my Gelish is good as new underneath still. It is really easy to do it yourself, although i highly recommend getting a good LED light to cure it instead of the mini lights. It cuts alot of time off doing it yourself. Also, use all 4 steps to apply it. Ive read people on here saying to just skip the ph bond before the foundation coat or just use alcohol but i&#x27;ve found the alcohol to be way too drying. The ph bond preps the nail for the foundation without drying excessively. I forgot to use it one time and i definitely saw a difference in staying power of my manicure. Regular acetone nail polish remover works fine though for the last step, cleaning the top coat. I think im going to end up giving away all my regular nail polish though, i haven&#x27;t touched it in months! lol</li>
    <li> I love this color it is so vibrant and it reacts to black-light it glows bright blue. I also received it in one day!!</li>
    <li> lighter color than appears</li>
    <li> This was exactly as I expected!  My girls and I Love the Color and it came quickly!  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is actually just like the color shown. I wore it on the fourth of july, it wouldve lasted more than 1 week if i didnt change it to a new color. It came packaged great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its a bright blue, goes on nice and smooth. Didn&#x27;t chip or anything. Only need one or two coats.</li>
    <li> The color in the picture looks like a bright true blue. The actual color is a darker blue/green color. Not at all what the picture shows..... There is a reason people order certain colors because it goes with their skin tone. When you get a different color/tone it doesn&#x27;t even work with your skin tone! There&#x27;s no point in using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and I really liked it. The color is a little off from what you see in the swatch but it is still a beautiful color. It dried nicely but comes on a little thin, you may need to apply 3 coats.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the gelish system, have over a dozen of their colors and generally like all of them... but this polish is horrid!  If I don&#x27;t cure after every single nail the polish starts to creep away from my cuticle and nail edge, leaving color only in the center of my nail.  Took me forever to finish giving myself this manicure, because on top of having to cure after every nail it takes at least 4 coats to stop looking streaked and 6 to be fully opaque (which is what I prefer).  The color is also not quite what&#x27;s shown here, it&#x27;s a much more sedate blue than the nearly neon it shows, but overall I don&#x27;t mind that.. and I&#x27;m used to gelish&#x27;s colors not matching the pictures.  For an idea of what the color really looks like (when opaque) - think of the blue in the Superman logo.  In fact, I ran out and picked up a bottle of yellow polish and did the superman logo on my ring finger because I just couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
    <li> I love the color but the bottle leaks all over the place. It got to me in a mess and still is.</li>
    <li> The color that goes on the nail is very different from what is picture. Not as bright and the polish is really different from the other gelish ones. The first coat goes on very streaky nd dries up leaving you to apply another coat(which I always do anyways) but u need to apply more to the actual nail. I would not recommend this color. My favorite is Go Girl! So pretty and perfect to use all the time. Happy color hunting!</li>
    <li> The color was exactly what I was hoping for. Sometimes its hard to know what color you are getting but this one was right on.</li>
    <li> Although I love the Gelish products, sometime the colors are not exactly true and this one is not the pretty blue shown, it&#x27;s a darker uglier color.</li>
