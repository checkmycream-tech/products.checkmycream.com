      <li>the coverage is great</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>

      <li>I love the after scent of the roses, and as someone else commented, my clothes smell good!</li>
      <li>It smells nice going on and does a great job keeping me smelling nice - no matter what the weather or what I had for dinner the night before.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love rose scents, Joy being my favorite perfume, so this is just complementary for me.   </li>
      <li>nice smell</li>
      <li>It would either smell nice and flowery or it would smell like bug spray.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly effective in a Florida summer.  </li>
      <li>Nice scent</li>
      <li>but it is a nice flowery</li>
      <li>It is effective and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>Very strong and overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>I use one spray per armpit, then dip my fingers in baking soda and rub it in pretty well - good to go!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I have to agree that the scent is overwhelmingly &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; at first, but it fades quickly to a really pleasant rose scent.  </li>
      <li>its OKAY.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>So what I love the most about this as a deodorant is that it actually makes my shirts smell GREAT over time!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are healthy.</li>
      <li>love the smell, and works well for preventing odor, but not for sweating.</li>
      <li>so I can easily carry with me.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong, almost putrid smell of alcohol.</li>
      <li>Now I can feel comfortable when I sweat.</li>
      <li>It has a very crisp authentic rose fragrance that largely fades from your skin over the first hour or two, though it lingers on your clothes, so it is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I love the scent (and i´m not a fan of roses aroma) and it really works!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>The Weleda Wild Rose Deoderant WORKS.  </li>
      <li>feel like this works better than using straight lavender oil</li>
      <li>And if Its much sweating I can wipw with a baby wipe and reapply and am as good as new</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure that makes the most difference in having a lasting effect.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to find a non-aluminum, more natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>The Sage is more masculine.</li>
      <li>I use Sage &amp; Rose because they&#x27;re the only two scents I can find on Amazon under prime.  </li>
      <li>maybe try the citrus next time : )</li>
      <li>Keeps me fresh most of the day, I usually spray a mid afternoon spray to refresh and make sure I am still smelling fresh</li>
      <li>The rose smell is a little &#x27;old-lady&#x27; for me.  </li>
      <li>The upside of being sweaty though is that my metabolism is freakin&#x27; crazy awesome.  </li>
      <li>They need different scents that the three they have available.</li>
      <li>and I have also tried many different all natural deodorants.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t usually like rose scents.  </li>
      <li>There can be a slight burn or warming sensation putting this on, mostly after shaving.  </li>
      <li>priced way too high in return of what you get.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly and am purchasing it again.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin (I&#x27;m allergic to kinds of things)</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this, as I&#x27;ve tried about every natural deodorant to no avail.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m as fresh at night as I am when I first put it on, without a heavy perfume smell.</li>
      <li>I live in south Texas where the summers are long and hot.</li>
      <li>Great substitute for heavy thick deodorants.</li>
      <li>No matter that complaint, it&#x27;s still much better covering B.O than the homemade coconut oil, baking soda, cornstarch deodorant, EO deodorant.</li>
      <li>worth it to me and stings less with every use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a half a dozen \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; type deoderants with very, very limited success.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> its OKAY. nice smell but doesn&#x27;t last long. priced way too high in return of what you get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a half a dozen \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; type deoderants with very, very limited success.  The best before I tried this one was from Burt&#x27;s Bees with Sage oil.  I live in south Louisiana and if I don&#x27;t want to offend myself or anyone else around me in the summer months in the past I usually just gave in and used standard deoderant/anti-perspirants.  The Weleda Wild Rose Deoderant WORKS.  It smells nice going on and does a great job keeping me smelling nice - no matter what the weather or what I had for dinner the night before.</li>
    <li> I knew ordering this I would have one of two options based on the reviews. It would either smell nice and flowery or it would smell like bug spray. I took a chance, ordering the smaller size just in case. It does smell like bug spray, with a weird hint of sour candy. Usually it would be a scent that hurts my head, however it didn&#x27;t, strangely. I still used it and masked the scent with some body spray. It actually blended well and after a few hours the bug spray-sour candy smell faded. No matter that complaint, it&#x27;s still much better covering B.O than the homemade coconut oil, baking soda, cornstarch deodorant, EO deodorant. Because it works well, the scent wont keep me away. Perhaps I&#x27;ll test another, but as a deodorant, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Used it once. Very strong and overpowering smell. Wont use it again. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I have very sensitive skin (I&#x27;m allergic to kinds of things) and I have also tried many different all natural deodorants.  This is by far the best.  Nice scent and I don&#x27;t usually like rose scents.  Buy this product!</li>
    <li> The rose smell is a little &#x27;old-lady&#x27; for me.  It also doesn&#x27;t have any lasting effect, only helping immediately after it was sprayed on.  The one plus is it isn&#x27;t greasy, and won&#x27;t stain clothing, or leave a residue.  They need different scents that the three they have available.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective in a Florida summer.  Only down side is that 1 oz does not last that long.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The ingredients are healthy. I use Sage &amp; Rose because they&#x27;re the only two scents I can find on Amazon under prime.  I buy both sizes and refill the small one so I can easily carry with me.  I&#x27;m  hoping someone will offer other scents as well.  The Sage is more masculine.</li>
    <li> There can be a slight burn or warming sensation putting this on, mostly after shaving.  But 3 sprays under each arm will last me all day - mowing the lawn, running errands, playing with the kids or sitting on the couch.  I&#x27;m as fresh at night as I am when I first put it on, without a heavy perfume smell.</li>
    <li> Just some smell good alcohol. Does what it is.... smells like it should and only lasts a short while. Great substitute for heavy thick deodorants.</li>
    <li> I love the scent (and i´m not a fan of roses aroma) and it really works! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a non-aluminum, more natural deodorant.  This is not it.  I live in south Texas where the summers are long and hot. I tested this out in the spring, and was very disappointed.  By the end of the day, I knew it wasn&#x27;t working.  Everybody around me knew it wasn&#x27;t working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this company&#x27;s other products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I loved it! I&#x27;ve been struggling with excessive sweating and an odor that was so hard to tame. Now I can feel comfortable when I sweat. And if Its much sweating I can wipw with a baby wipe and reapply and am as good as new</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has a very crisp authentic rose fragrance that largely fades from your skin over the first hour or two, though it lingers on your clothes, so it is not overpowering. I love rose scents, Joy being my favorite perfume, so this is just complementary for me.   It is effective and long-lasting. It does not just cover up odor, it actually stops it and prevents it. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I do with it were less expensive, as it can add up. So, I don&#x27;t always use it around the house, sometimes I will just use a cheaper brand on days I am not going anywhere, to save this for when it matters!</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I searched for a deodorant that had no aluminum in it and this is it. I love the after scent of the roses, and as someone else commented, my clothes smell good! I recommend it highly and am purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, as I&#x27;ve tried about every natural deodorant to no avail. This hardly smells like roses. It has a strong, almost putrid smell of alcohol. I tried to return it, but they do not allow returns due to it being liquid. Well, that&#x27;s stupid. I send liquid things through the mail all the time and if so, how did they ship it to me? Very disappointed. Do not order this if you think you may not like it because you&#x27;ll be stuck with it.</li>
    <li> love the smell, and works well for preventing odor, but not for sweating. If you have problems with moisture, I would put this on before regular deodorant</li>
    <li> Great product!! Keeps me fresh most of the day, I usually spray a mid afternoon spray to refresh and make sure I am still smelling fresh</li>
    <li> I usually use straight lavender oil with baking soda, but this was on sale so I tried it.  I have to agree that the scent is overwhelmingly &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; at first, but it fades quickly to a really pleasant rose scent.  I am one sweaty individual, and for whatever reason commercial deodorants and antiperspirants combine with my sweat to form really, REALLY unpleasant odors - I can basically wear a t-shirt three or four times before having to throw it away because that horrible odor lingers in it!  So what I love the most about this as a deodorant is that it actually makes my shirts smell GREAT over time!  Which means I can now buy nicer shirts because I won&#x27;t have to throw them out after a couple of wears.  (I know, it&#x27;s nasty.  The upside of being sweaty though is that my metabolism is freakin&#x27; crazy awesome.  So I&#x27;ll take it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this works better than using straight lavender oil - maybe it&#x27;s the alcohol or some other ingredient, however, I use this product with baking soda and I&#x27;m pretty sure that makes the most difference in having a lasting effect.  I live in the desert and I can work all day - doing fieldwork in the sun  - and I still don&#x27;t stink at the end of the day, no reapplication needed.  I use one spray per armpit, then dip my fingers in baking soda and rub it in pretty well - good to go!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Does burn a little but well worth it to me and stings less with every use.</li>
    <li> I think it may be a little to flowery for me but it is a nice flowery and I will buy again the coverage is great maybe try the citrus next time : )</li>
