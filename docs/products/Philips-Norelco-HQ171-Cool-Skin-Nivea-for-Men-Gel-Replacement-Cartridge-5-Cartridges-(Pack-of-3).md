      <li>It is a great smelling aroma, and it is smooth on the face.</li>
      <li>so when I shave it doesn&#x27;t irritates my face and to be honest, this has been my all time problem.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice that Amazon \\&quot;offers\\</li>
      <li>The gel cartridge is very easy to install and remove.</li>
      <li>and this gel makes mine very smooth</li>
      <li>but he sure noticed a difference with the gel.</li>
      <li>At times, we&#x27;ve been able to find the lotion replacement cartridges, but he prefers the gel.</li>
      <li>This product is preferred more than the lotion for the recipient of this gift</li>
      <li>The gel seemed to work better out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>I will use this product until I either change razors or they make something better.</li>
      <li>I for one love the gel 171.  </li>
      <li>Good price, convenient Free Shipping when ordering more than $25 worth of product, Quick shipping!  </li>
      <li>HQ170 moisturizing shaving lotion is much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>He feels it is a closer, more comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The shaving gel works great on my beard providing a clean, clear cut in and out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that you can go on-line and order replacement accessories for older electric razor models!</li>
      <li>It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is.</li>
      <li>... and the alternative lotion (HQ170) is far more soothing on the skin providing an excellent shave with no facial discomfort.</li>
      <li>This product makes using the Norelco HQ171 electric razor much more comfortable and allows a far more comfortable shave without skin irritation.</li>
      <li>It works better for me as I have a heavy beard and it greatly reduces irritation.</li>
      <li>I bought him a large supply of these replacements, and I know he&#x27;s glad to have them.</li>
      <li>As I get older, I need more moisturizing and the gel helps provide it.</li>
      <li>somehow this is very hard to find in the stores, I ordered it with my prime shipping and am very happy !</li>
      <li>Products works fine and makes it much easier to shave on a hot day.</li>
      <li>my hubby - price was very reasonable, and he prefers the gel to the lotion...smell is not overpowerful either.</li>
      <li>some reason I don&#x27;t seem able to find either in a local store.  </li>
      <li>The razor&#x27;s heads pivot very well, and it doesn&#x27;t miss a spot!  </li>
      <li>it never fails me when I have to shave.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>&quot; this product itself: five packages is enough to get free Super Saver shipping.</li>
      <li>Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t see a point in using it.</li>
      <li>3 years now as I much prefer it to the lotion.</li>
      <li>Plue the shaver seems to drag on the face much more with the lotion 170.  </li>
      <li>He has a lot of trouble finding good razors that don&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin, but he has had no troubles with this at all.  </li>
      <li>The lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and is quite soothing.</li>
      <li>Normally he would get a rash after shaving with an electric razor but this time he didn&#x27;t so he is hooked!</li>
      <li>The year before last I was given a Philips Norelco Cool Skin Shaver.  </li>
      <li>I use regular shaving gel with my Cool Skin shaver and have never had a problem in the two years I have used it.  </li>
      <li>The gel is easily disolved in water and its effects are minimal.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s very convenient to have to gel right inside the razor, but it can get expensive to constantly have to buy more of these packs.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this electric razor as well.</li>
      <li>months ago, however, I had to replace my shaver, and the new one came with samples of both gel and lotion.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I used to use the lotion (HQ 170) because the package says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin--and because I&#x27;ve never seen the gel in a store.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin is quite sensitive.</li>
      <li>A few days ago, I inadvertently replaced a gel cartridge with a lotion cartridge, and I felt the difference right away.</li>
      <li>only down I found on this product is that it doesn&#x27;t last to much shaves.</li>

    <li> ... and the alternative lotion (HQ170) is far more soothing on the skin providing an excellent shave with no facial discomfort. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Norelco shaver came with two samples of each cartridge and I only used one of the Gel cartridges... I really can&#x27;t see a point in using it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered boxes of the lotion!</li>
    <li> Only place I could find this for my hubby - price was very reasonable, and he prefers the gel to the lotion...smell is not overpowerful either.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Gel to the lotion - it feels cooler on the skin and without the greasines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I don&#x27;t seem able to find either in a local store.  Yay for the internet...</li>
    <li> This is the only shaver that I use, so the gel is a necessity.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is preferred more than the lotion for the recipient of this gift</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approx. 3 years now as I much prefer it to the lotion. It works better for me as I have a heavy beard and it greatly reduces irritation. I will use this product until I either change razors or they make something better.</li>
    <li> The gel seems to go a lot faster than the lotion and does not lubricate the same. The gel is easily disolved in water and its effects are minimal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband in hopes that he would be able to use an electric razor rather than a Mock 3 which was getting expensive. The Razor came with lotion and the gel. The lotion didn&#x27;t do anything for him but he sure noticed a difference with the gel. Normally he would get a rash after shaving with an electric razor but this time he didn&#x27;t so he is hooked! Too bad it is so difficult to find in the stores!</li>
    <li> The gel works great and allows you to moisturize the face for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Who needs shaving cream!  This gel glides over my face and prevents the razor burn.</li>
    <li> I for one love the gel 171.  I&#x27;ve tried both the lotion and gel but cannot get as close a shave with the lotion.  Plue the shaver seems to drag on the face much more with the lotion 170.  The gel is the way to go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would like to buy the gel at the local stores but it is not sold there. The lotion is on all the shelves but no gel. The only way I could get the gel was through on-line delivery.  Why is this?  Confused on that marketing.</li>
    <li> Everytime I purchase this product it never fails me when I have to shave. It is a great smelling aroma, and it is smooth on the face.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and then bought 3 packages more, because I felt it was an great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this as an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Products works fine and makes it much easier to shave on a hot day.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and makes my husband&#x27;s face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s you know.............................</li>
    <li> This product combines perfect with my Norelco advantega razor.  I have very sensitive skin and this gel makes mine very smooth so when I shave it doesn&#x27;t irritates my face and to be honest, this has been my all time problem.  With the Norelco advantage and this gel, my problems are gone.  I trully recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The only down I found on this product is that it doesn&#x27;t last to much shaves.</li>
    <li> somehow this is very hard to find in the stores, I ordered it with my prime shipping and am very happy !</li>
    <li> My skin is quite sensitive. That&#x27;s why I go to the trouble and expense of the Advantage/Cool Skin system. I used to use the lotion (HQ 170) because the package says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin--and because I&#x27;ve never seen the gel in a store.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two months ago, however, I had to replace my shaver, and the new one came with samples of both gel and lotion. I found that the gel lubricates a little better, and the decreased friction seems to result in decreased irritation. A few days ago, I inadvertently replaced a gel cartridge with a lotion cartridge, and I felt the difference right away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found that my face really likes either the gel or the lotion, but shaving goes slightly quicker with the gel, which is a small added benefit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that Amazon \\&quot;offers\\&quot; this product itself: five packages is enough to get free Super Saver shipping.</li>
    <li> The year before last I was given a Philips Norelco Cool Skin Shaver.  I tried both the Nivea cream and gel cartridges.  The gel seemed to work better out of the shower.  If your like me and need a mirror so you can see what your doing use the gel. This is a great product and I haven&#x27;t found it anywhere cheaper than on amazon.</li>
    <li> :(  I have sensitive skin.  This lotion has a irritating \\&quot;cold burning\\&quot; sensation.  Yay menthol.  I didn&#x27;t get a close shave and i didn&#x27;t want to shave with it because it felt like the razor was dragging across my irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return my shaver until I tried the HQ170.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HQ170 moisturizing shaving lotion is much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought my boyfriend the razor that uses these cartridges for Christmas.  However, it&#x27;s impossible to find the replacements near our home.  At times, we&#x27;ve been able to find the lotion replacement cartridges, but he prefers the gel. He feels it is a closer, more comfortable shave.  He has a lot of trouble finding good razors that don&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin, but he has had no troubles with this at all.  The razor&#x27;s heads pivot very well, and it doesn&#x27;t miss a spot!  I bought him a large supply of these replacements, and I know he&#x27;s glad to have them.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco razor that uses either shaving lotion or shaving gel.  My personal preference is the gel. As I get older, I need more moisturizing and the gel helps provide it.</li>
    <li> This product makes using the Norelco HQ171 electric razor much more comfortable and allows a far more comfortable shave without skin irritation. I would highly recommend this electric razor as well. The gel cartridge is very easy to install and remove.</li>
    <li> The razor was a perfect buy, worked perfectly! Would suggest as a great gift during the holidays!!!!!</li>
    <li> The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion.  Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol.  The gel has menthol, so that&#x27;s why it can be irritating.  I read a review of shaving basics online, and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol.  The lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and is quite soothing.</li>
    <li> Sure, it&#x27;s very convenient to have to gel right inside the razor, but it can get expensive to constantly have to buy more of these packs.  I use regular shaving gel with my Cool Skin shaver and have never had a problem in the two years I have used it.  I still use the packs when traveling, just for the space savings.</li>
    <li> The shaving gel works great on my beard providing a clean, clear cut in and out of the shower.  I have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Good price, convenient Free Shipping when ordering more than $25 worth of product, Quick shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product works great with my Philips Norelco 7810XL and helps to give a very smooth shave.  I would recomend this product to any users of the Norelco.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that you can go on-line and order replacement accessories for older electric razor models! I still use this electric to this day, after 16 years.</li>
