<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a good product and service was excellent!</li>
    <li> Previous review was incorrect.   I did receive both sponges.  There were two in one box.</li>
    <li> I have received my Earth Konjac Facial Sponges and decided to try them out, I was impressed how they exfoliate your skin I felt like I was getting a deep cleanse. Konjac sponges remove toxins and residue from your face ridding all  dead skin cells and helping new one to grow.this pack was nice because I had to sponges to try. They have no harsh chemicals in them and you just wet them in warm water and they are ready to use.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my order - tried this product out as the recommendation of a friend and is better than I expected.  Shipping was faster than expected too.  A+!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. They work really well for my sensitive skin and never break me out but have actually helped clear up my skin. I use them every morning and night they are better than a wash cloth! I used to use my clarisonic everyday but now I use it once a week because these give me that same result and are less harsh. Will re- purchase for sure! They arrived on time and packaging was very neat :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the konjac sponge for over a year now.  Bottom line wherever you buy the sponge the quality is about the same, however if you want the product quickly and at the very best price possible you should purchase from Beauty by Earth.  I will never purchase my konjac sponges from any other source.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a good product.</li>
    <li> They make my face feel amazingly smooth without being rough or harsh at all. I recommend sponges for sure. Shipping was ridiculous though that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Really good exfoliating sponge.  So far it has worked well on a few ingrown hairs that I have always found difficult to get rid of.</li>
    <li> Good natural product that doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate your skin.  Charcoal sponge is good for people with mild and occasional skin problems.  Natural sponge is good for normal skin.  Both sponges leave your skin softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> Love the sponge. I have already seen improvement in my complexion just after a week.</li>
    <li> These work great with my oily skin, reduces notably the breakouts and blackheads. Great product overall!</li>
    <li> When I started using this product, it was a little weird because there are 2 rock hard sponges in sealed plastic bags in a badly packaged box. After you take one out, it takes a couple minutes for the sponges to really soak in the water so that you can use it. When I finally used it, it lathered well, bit it was a little awkward to use, especially around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;The kicker is that after I used it for a week, I had breakouts all over my face. I imagine this is because it is impossible to keep this product sanitized unless you are going to sanitize it every single time you use it. I thought the charcoal would have antibacterial properties, but it doesn&#x27;t. This product is just poorly designed.</li>
    <li> These are really soft sponges. I like the clean feeling after use.</li>
    <li> Package came intact. I received both sponges and they feel great! I am testing out various konjac sponges and I am glad I made the purchase with these.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and every time I&#x27;m gonna use something new on my face I get more acne, so it happened as usual with the first use of the sponges but the difference with the sponges is that after a week it&#x27;s actually starting to clear up my skin and it definitely didn&#x27;t irritate my skin,I can also see how it exfoliates. I like the price for two sponges and the fast service.</li>
    <li> I would say I simply love it as I have oily and acne prone skin but after just 2 use I have seen blast difference. Whoever have dull acne skin should try black one and white for alkaline and ph balance.</li>
    <li> These sponges are AMAZING! Prior to using these sponges, I used washcloths for face-washing which was a PAIN because my nose ring would ALWAYS get hooked on it. It&#x27;s been so nice to wash my face without having to worry about my nose ring getting ripped out. These sponges also make my skin ridiculously soft, and less oily. I would recommend these to anyone! I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying them again! :)</li>
    <li> Konjac facial sponges are a new concept to me, with this product being my first. After a little research I found that this is a 100% natural facial cleansing sponge made from vegetable fibers of Konjac (Konnyaku). It comes sealed, and is almost rock hard when packed. After following the instructions, I was surprised to find the texture change. It becomes very soft, which means it will not scratch while washing away dirt and oil from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that you get two for the price of one! One normal one, and the other infused with activated charcoal, which is used for cleansing, detoxification, and as an anti-acne measure. Everything about these sponges are awesome, even down to how they are made.</li>
    <li> AS expected works great</li>
    <li> I like this sponge. It arrives in a package and looks like a rock, you put it in warm water and it turns into a sponge. It feels awesome on your skin yet gentle and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin. I put some facial wash on sponge and lather up my face. It&#x27;s a great sponge would buy another.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.They lather up pretty good</li>
    <li> This is my second order of these wonderful sponges. I love them (as does my sensitive/acne prone skin)!</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without these little scrubbies! The leave my face feeling so smooth and refreshed. Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I found these sponges while I was looking for a face exfoliator that was safe for sensitive skin. I constantly have dry skin (specifically on my forehead) and hadn&#x27;t found a product that would keep it clear for long. These sponges arrived quick and I used the white one immediately. My skin has truly never felt softer. I have clear skin outside of it being incredibly dry and sensitive, so I used the white sponge. I can&#x27;t speak to the black one yet but I&#x27;m incredibly happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I really love these sponges...I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to use anything remotely abrasive...even my Mia Clarisonic can irritate my face and leave me slightly red. But these are so gently yet I feel like I&#x27;m getting rid of impurities. They also have a sort of natural lubrication.I&#x27;ve only used the white sponge and have already bought another pack and a couple other products that I also love.</li>
    <li> Great product, I loved it.</li>
    <li> This product is sooooo amazing will be buying again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these facial sponges! They are very soft on my skin and leave my face feeling very fresh and clean with or without cleanser. I definitely recommend these very unique cleansing sponges.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened the white one yet, but I&#x27;ve been using the charcoal sponge for about a week, and it seems to be improving my skin already. I&#x27;ve been dealing with moderate acne since I was for the past five years, and it&#x27;s been difficult to find things that actually work. I&#x27;ve been using the charcoal brush along with the Acne Free sensitive skin kit (which I&#x27;d been using for awhile before getting the sponges) and so far I&#x27;ve only had one new zit (where before it was normal for me to get for or five a week) and my existing blemishes have cleared up. The sponge is about the size of my palm when it&#x27;s fully expanded, and it has a handy string that makes it easy to hang it to dry. All-in-all a good product, and two sponges for this price is a great deal compared to other products I&#x27;ve viewed.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something fantastic with this product. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I think I&#x27;ll go back to using the less promoted, but better for cleaning, Buffpuff</li>
    <li> Very nice sponges.  Purchased to use on my toddler, but I think I will use the charcoal one for me!</li>
    <li> It just felt like rubbing dimpled plastic on my face and the result wasn&#x27;t much different. It didn&#x27;t exfoliate worth jack. In fact, all it did was rub in all the dirt and residue on my face. Face did not feel clean whatsoever, with or without cleanser. This SPONGE IS OVERRATED!!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! My face feels so clean but not dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one before, but it&#x27;s awesome! I would highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Wow!  What a great product and more than I expected.  The sponge left my skin clean, soft and feeling refreshed.  It has also helped to clear up my acne.  And to get two sponges for the price of one is awesome.  The white one for every day use and the black on to really work those acne prone times.</li>
    <li> Just tried this neat sponge. Wow. My face feels so smooth. I used it without any cleanser since I didn&#x27;t have makeup on. I will try a cleanser with it when I take off my makeup.  The sponge is hard at first but it was amazingly soft after it was saturated in warm water. This will become a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for the perfect konjac sponge for a while now. This is the best one by far. It lasts at least 6 weeks (others looked pitiful 2 weeks into usage), its generously sized and you get two different kinds in one box.</li>
    <li> This is very useful sponge, and its quality is awesome.</li>
    <li> I just purchased those since I was breaking out a lot and needed something to use to exfoliate. I started using the white one daily, and the black one weekly. My face feels smoother and looks more clear and clean. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I like these a lot , and they last awhile.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying these facial sponges. I have combination skin and tried both of the sponges and it left my face feeling clean and softer. The sponges work well with cleanser or only water depending on your preference.</li>
    <li> I love the konjac sponges, they are gentle on my skin (even the charcoal) and they don&#x27;t dry me out.  I don&#x27;t even use soap with it.  The strings are nice for hanging them up to dry too.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Gently exfoliates. I use less cleanser and have seen fewer breakouts (my skin has been terrible, and I&#x27;ve only broken out once in almost two month since using it). You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have only used the white sponge due to the fact I&#x27;m not experiencing any break out at this time. I use my facial soap along with the sponge it deep clean my face without any harsh affects. I have very senative skin no redness or rash after use. Love the way my face feels after applying moisturizer. Not much exfoliating noted sponge is too smooth I think but still like it.</li>
    <li> I love my sponges. I have been using  them for a week now. My complexion has a healthy radiant glow. Awesome product.&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
    <li> I was so surprise ( thought I was wasting my money) but the facial sponges are awesome. My skin looked smoother after the first  time but now I can really see a differences, my makeup goes on smoother . They are very gentle to your skin but removes all the dead skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, since using this, I swear I Haven&#x27;t had a bad skin day</li>
    <li> I was not blessed with beautiful skin so I have tried every product out there. And I can&#x27;t believe I found something so simple but very effective. It gently exfoliates my skin and makes my skin feel smooth without over drying it or bring too harsh. And I have less breakouts. My husband is also obsessed with this sponge and is now telling all his friends about it! Can you imagine a bunch of grown men sitting around talking about a Konjac sponge??Lol! Definitely give this a try, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good product. They work well to clean the face. They feel very natural.</li>
    <li> Yet another amazing product by Beauty by Earth!!! I&#x27;ve been searching for products that Are Not Toxic And Work!!! And man, so these work!!&lt;br /&gt;Love how these sponges leave my skin.. Totally clean and it really feels toned after using them.  I&#x27;m actually looking forward to take my make up off, which can be a drag sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend these!!</li>
    <li> Love these!!  I am so happy to have found them! I have problematic skin and to add injury to insult I am over 40 so I have all kinds of skin situations happening. These sponges feel super soft and have helped in clearing up my skin. A fun little bonus with them is that my 5 year old daughter loves to was her face with them so she uses them every day in the bath. This has been super helpful to my face routine.</li>
    <li> Not sure if they deserve ALL the hyped benefits, but definitely a good facial sponge.  Still use my own separate exfoliating scrub once a week, though.</li>
    <li> They are gentle yet effective. I was worried about them being harsh, but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> Great sponges, great value, I love these and will order again 😁</li>
    <li> There is no 2.5 star rating so I rather give it 2 stars instead of 3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont see any benefit in using these sponges over any other sponge or rag youd use for washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They IMO are a gimmick type of item and probably cost 3 to 10 cents to manufacture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is rock hard until you first soak it and then expands some and gets much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating is so/so its gentle yet subtly exfoliates the skin without being rough (some people might not like this) but it ISNT \\&quot;slimey\\&quot; as I read an other reviewers review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST WAY (IMO) to compare this sponge to (when its wet and absorbed water) is like a memory foam kind of sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this sponge with nubian heritage soaps and sometimes I have used it by it self without any soap or wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said I dont see ANY benefit in this item (not even for $5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing some people might be able to find these types of sponges in Dollar stores and if not now they soon will!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not a horrible product, but when taken in to consideration price (not just this brand ANY brand) its clearly not worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And though the white and black sponges are supposed to be different I dont see any difference (other than the color) in texture or effect though I WILL SAY (for what they are) they are constructed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In end some people might not agree with me,but this is just my experience in buying a TINY sponge (ok 2) for $10+ which I now dont feel justified in purchasing.</li>
    <li> These facial scrubbers are AWESOME! I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying more than just one ;/ I use it for washing my face in the shower and it&#x27;s gentle yet VERY effective! Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; about buying this... DO IT!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased &amp; will buy again!</li>
    <li> My face skin is sensitive so I usually wash my face with only hands. This item fits for me. I like it very much. It&#x27;s very soft. Also, this is natural product so I love it. goodgood!</li>
    <li> I really like it . Thank you.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with the sponges. I have only used the while one, I will try the black one soon. I think the sponge is doing a good job cleaning. I have noticed that my face doesn&#x27;t seem stripped of all its oil and mostiure, I am using less lotion on my face. I love the idea of a natural approach with no soaps ect. If they work I am so going to reorder and get a body sponge too.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! They really clean my face! I really advice you to try it!</li>
    <li> love these. Will definetly be buying more of these in the future. They help my face and skin immensely.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and leave my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I use the white sponge and I really like it.  It makes my skin feel noticeably soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have acne or skin problems particularly but I like it because it helps the skin naturally regenerate so am using it to keep my skin younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love these konjac sponges!  I use them every evening, and they have actually improved my skin!  It&#x27;s healthier and less oily!  Super happy about that.</li>
    <li> I got these for free to try and give my honest opinion. I love these face sponges, having 2 different sponges to choose from depending on my facial needs. My face is so smooth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it bc it was few dollars cheaper than other product but they were sooo small~~~ maybe for babies u can use it...</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin and the natural sponge exfoliates my skin without over drying it. I did try the charcoal sponge and believe that it definitely will help with oily skin, as it dried out mine. The sponge is extremely soft on your skin, unlike most face scrubs. Definitely will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I like this sponge in the shower, though I think it irritated my cheek at first use.  I&#x27;m have been satisfied to use a poof and do not feel this sponge has an advantage over it, but there isn&#x27;t anything wrong with it, it cleans fine.</li>
    <li> I love the charcoal sponge leaves my face nice smooth, and most of all very clean.thought it would be rough but once it is soaked in water becomes soft😊</li>
    <li> It feels so nice on the skin! since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my breakouts have decreased significantly. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Gr8 product</li>
    <li> Received the order promptly as promised and decided to use the black sponge the same day (figured I could use the more intense cleaning the first time). Also used the white sponge the following day. Easy to use and I&#x27;ll have to say that I do see a subtle change already...skin seems brighter! Will continue to use, hopefully will see more pronounced result soon.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Also great customer service!</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing, Im so glad I purchased. It really does work. My skin looks amazing and Im in my lower 40&#x27;s. I was just complemented the other day by a guy who could not believe my age. I do use a facial retinol serum and sun screen everyday after I use the sponge. I no longer wash my face with soap. So glad I found this</li>
    <li> Misleading, ihad purchased this on sale at rite - aide, and loved it. The shape was oval though. These were very tiny, round, and didn&#x27;t feel like the same properties. Disappointed</li>
    <li> I really like my Konjac Facial Sponges.  I use them in the shower every day.  They are small so I use them on my face.  Nice feature is that they have a string attached for easy hanging.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Helped keep my skin softer, longer. Lasted about 2 1/2 months, with regular use, 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! They are not too smooth and have just the right amount of texture to get my face really clean and smooth feeling.  The attached string makes it very convenient to hang in the shower.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin feels so clean.  I would love to have a larger one for my entire body.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works, but it DOES!  Face feels really clean when I&#x27;ve finished using it. Following up with Beauty By Earth toner...PERFECT :-)</li>
    <li> good item. good price.</li>
    <li> Love it love it. My face felt so good after using i felt as i was in a professional spa!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
    <li> my daughter hates using cleansers and does not want a complicated beauty routine. She loves these sponges. It is easy, no chemicals and she says her skin even feels softer. She has only been using them for for 4 days now but she IS using them.</li>
    <li> I received the sponges quickly &amp; liked the simple eco-friendly packaging.  I have so far only used the natural (white) sponge so can only comment on that one.  With how hard the sponges are out of the box, I was worried they&#x27;d be very abrasive.  But reading the instructions, you need to soak them in warm water for about 15 minutes to get them softened up for first time before using. For subsequent uses, I find I just need to run under warm water for a minute &amp; it&#x27;s soft enough to use.  It feels very gentle on my sensitive skin &amp; I even use it under my delicate eye area.  I&#x27;m amazed this is made from a vegetable!  I enjoy using it &amp; keep it hanging in my shower to dry after each use.  I&#x27;ve been only using for a week, and have no complaints.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product - I&#x27;ve been trying to rid the skin on my nose from evidence of an old nose ring...for months! A few days of gentle scrubbing with the sponge and you would almost never know that I had a nose ring for years. Pores are shrinking, too. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It seems to really clean you&#x27;re face.&lt;br /&gt;You have to dampen it first, then apply a foam or cream and go for it!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this made things worse. It also spreads acne to other areas of skin.</li>
    <li> Takes some time to get used to the small surface area and the texture, but all in all I think it works great. Slight suggestion for exfoliating with it (use a foaming cleanser and use cleansers sparingly)</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. I got it for her after she liked so many other of the Beauty by Earth products like the Morrocan Oil and Toner.  This has been her favorite so far. She really enjoys how gentle they are on her skin. To the point where she literally had me come and feel her skin after using them. Need to make a gift basket of their items for valentines and give it to her and I&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
    <li> Awsome  great product</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.  So far I wash my face with my cleanser, rinse then massage my face with this sponge and it leaves my face feeling very soft and refreshed.  I plan to use these from here on out</li>
    <li> Too hard. Never enlarged after running it under warm water. I&#x27;m using it but I don&#x27;t really care for this particular sponge . There are others that are bigger and better</li>
    <li> I really did not expect much, but this product has surprized me!  I have had extremely oily skin all my life, and I am almost 50.  Nothing has ever put a dent into my oil problem or dealt with my large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this sponge for a week now and decided that it was safe to review it accurately.  Now, I am only speaking for myself, but altho I wish this would make my oily skin go away and I could be &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; like everyone else I know, I don&#x27;t expect that; however, I am very pleased at how well it does to giving me the next best thing - decent skin for the first time EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I soaked it and used it with a moderate amount of Ivory Soap recommended to me by a dermatologist I noticed a difference in my skin.  As others have already stated, the sponge is very soft-feeling and I did not feel that I was really getting a good &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; feeling.  But I just let that go and only gently washed my face per suggestions here.  My skin felt less bumpy and the oiliness which usually returns within a hour of washing...didn&#x27;t!  I had at least 4 hours of good-feeling skin and when the oil began to return it was not as thick and itchy as it usually is.  It was much less thick-feeling and for the first time ever, bearable.  When I dabbed at the returned oil with a gentle tissue it was not nearly as thick as it usually is.  What a pleasant surprize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this sponge twice a day for a week now (first thing in the morning and just before bedtime) and I am still very happy!  I don&#x27;t expect that my skin will ever be perfect, but this is the next best thing.  It feels pretty good most of the time, is noticeably smoother, and the oil is reduced.  In fact, I think I need to buy a sensitive skin moisturizer for my forehead because I feel tiny bumps from overusing the sponge one time.  I am using it gently now and in small and gentle circular motions and my skin is still feeling good and the bumps are reducing.  I think my pores are feeling a bit smaller due to the gentle &amp;#34;dermabrasion&amp;#34; effect (I don&#x27;t know what else to call it) because my nose is smoother and significantly less oily.  I don&#x27;t have the awful greasy itching anymore that I always had a mere hour or so after washing my face and it is wonderful beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never over-washed my face and had tried everything under the sun for decades to help my oil problem. This is the first thing that has ever actually given me a significant enough improvement to gain my loyalty to buy again and also recommend to other to try.  It may not work for everyone, but I feel that if you have the type of skin I do, at least give it a try!  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I really hope that if you are considering trying this that you will give it a chance.</li>
    <li> It does nothing for my skin - it is too soft, small and not comfortable for facial cleaning.</li>
    <li> Nice complexion sponge for daily cleansing. The white sponge has a gentle texture and is great for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m planning on giving the black sponge to my sister who has occasional acne outbreaks.</li>
    <li> enjoyed it! highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very effective, great product</li>
    <li> I love the sponge. It feels so good on my skin! It was so soft and soothing but my skin felt smoother afterwards.</li>
    <li> I very seldom write any reviews on the products that I purchase; however, I must give credit when credit is do. That being said, this product has met my exception. I am a 40 year old black woman who has always had challenges with acne. So, I decide used the charcoal facial sponge coupled with &amp;#34;cure natural gel&amp;#34; for my face and it left my skin feeling silky smooth!!  Great buy and I plan on purchasing more in the near future!!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!! I ordered some for my daughter&#x27;s too!</li>
    <li> You get two for the price of one, arrived quickly and even send you to your email information on how to use them, I just used charcoal sponge and so far everything well leave my skin cleaner.</li>
    <li> Amazing sponges, loves how it made my skin so smooth.  It was not too rough like some exfoliating products, I enjoy using it and my skin loves it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed after using this sponge for several days that my forehead is not as oily as before! :D</li>
    <li> They really made a difference on my skin ! , thank you .</li>
    <li> I used the sponge and im really satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;i got quick result my face shining every body asked my what i have done to my face and what type of cleaning that i made&lt;br /&gt;nothing only the konjac sponge this is the answer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was wored when i bought 10 pieces but now i feel good that i order all these quantity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you will ask me why , becuse im living on the other side of the world and the dhippmint will cost me alot so i order 10&lt;br /&gt;i recomended this sponge for every body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much for producing this type of thing&lt;br /&gt;best regards</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, but once I started using this amazing product, I will never use another sponge again.  I even gave one to my boyfriend to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of these before but my friend said they were great. She really underestimated them, they are amazing! My skin feels amazing and clean after using the sponge and it&#x27;s also really easy. I&#x27;ve always hated washing my face as water goes everywhere and it&#x27;s somewhat messy, but this makes it so easy and water is not dripping and flying everywhere. I know that&#x27;s a silly reason, but it&#x27;s one of the reasons I love them as they are so easy to use.</li>
    <li> They are soft and a great buy for both of them</li>
    <li> I decided to try these sponges because of the money saving value pack, but I ended up being disappointed. I have tried other konjac sponges before and these were much rougher on my skin and it seemed that no matter how many times I rinsed it, the soap never rinsed out fully. I also saw little to no improvement in my acne. Although they are a great alternative because they are environmentally friendly, I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a different konjac sponge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really write reviews but this product is amazing. It&#x27;s soft on my skin and nice. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting facial massage. I like it because I only used it for three days andy skin is glowing and healthy.</li>
    <li> My first time using facial sponges, and I love them! The charcoal sponge cleared up some blemishes by the next day! Great product.</li>
    <li> It is really nice. Thank you for the good product</li>
    <li> This two-pack of sponges arrived on time and beautifully packaged. These sponges are well worth the price. They leave my skin feeling incredibly soft and clean and the softness remains all day. I will never go back to the synthetic facial sponges I&#x27;ve been using for the past couple of years. I plan to buy more of these for myself and as gifts for my friends.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this little thing! My first reaction was &amp;#34;boy it&#x27;s tiny!&amp;#34; but that was before I soaked it in warm water before using it which allows it to expand. The sponge is extremely gentle. I probably shouldn&#x27;t say this but I love it better than my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re decent quality. They&#x27;ve lasted a good time.</li>
    <li> I keep the white one in my shower and use my normal shower gel on it for my face then use the black one once i get out for blackhead removal.</li>
    <li> The sponges are soft and the skin feels clean, but I have yet to see any drastic difference from not using it. I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times as I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the light-colored sponge in this set so far, but I think it&#x27;s a well-made product and my skin feels great afterward.</li>
    <li> Excellent product made my face look radiant</li>
    <li> This works incredibly well for skin. I have not had a break out in a couple months. A coworker asked what I was doing to make my skin glow. The sponge is gentle but very effective.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it works, cause i have not seen anything different/improving on my complexion.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works great for your face!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.  I like both of them, but I admit I use the charcoal a bit more than the natural white one, just because my skin tends to be troublesome.  I have a hard time with using anything that&#x27;s chemically treated because of my sensitive skin, so I was really intrigued by these sponges.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the sponges, my skin has been noticably clearer, less irritated, and definitely softer.  I have and will continue to recommend these sponges.</li>
    <li> I personally believe that skin care goes a long way that involves something more than skin care products. Food, exercise etc etc all count towards better complexion and healthier skin. That being said, skin care products does help with certain aspects of the improvement. One of them I think is stopping your skin pores from being blocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product definitely helped getting my skin better with all the other products I&#x27;ve been using. It really did help with washing the nose and the areas that my hands  cannot clean properly. Only problem I have with the product is, I think it&#x27;s little bit too hard to keep it clean. Other than that, this is definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing if you are having second thoughts of buying you should definitely buy it. It has worked for me so well with removing my make up. It leaves your face amazingly soft. Would buy this again :)</li>
    <li> This product is natural, Eco-friendly, biodegradable and chemical free.&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this I was weary to try it due to my sensitive skin. When I took it out of the box it was hard as a rock. I followed the directions and soaked it in water within minutes it was completely soft. I was amazed it just how soft it was. So I applied my cleanser to my face and began to use this - moving it in a circular motion across my face. It was super gentle on my face. my skin feeling much softer and cleaner than normal. I don’t even really understand how it works, but it does!</li>
    <li> Love the product easy to use easy to clean gives your skin a good scrub without feeling stripped or itchy</li>
    <li> These things are awesome!  So interesting, too! I&#x27;ve been using them in place of my usual facial cleanser and wash cloth, and even to remove my makeup!  My skin feels great!  You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
    <li> My skin feels nice and clean after using the Konjac Facial Sponge. I had eyelash extensions, by using this sponge, it helped me to clean my eyelids without pulling my eyelash extensions off! I think I&#x27;ll keep coming back to buy it~</li>
    <li> Love this product. The songes are gentle yet very effective. This is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> This sponge felt really nice on my skin. It just has the right amount of toughness to make it feel like your face is being massaged.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can think of to make this product better is if it would dry faster after using it.</li>
    <li> Super neat product! Love it and makes my skin feel amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also used it on my arms for the little bumps and it&#x27;s dramatically reduced them!</li>
    <li> I use it every night when I wash my face. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived at no time. I&#x27;m happy with everything.</li>
    <li> great quality/service</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Used other sponges before, but this is amazing. After first use I could feel and see the difference.  My skin was so soft and it also did kind of very soft peeling. I&#x27;m going buy it again.</li>
    <li> I liked these for about a month until they started smelling like wet towel.  No surprise because sponges in general are kind of gross like that.  I thought these would be better because they are made from natural fibers but they&#x27;re still smelly and nasty, even after cleaning with hot water and peroxide.  Unless you can use a new week very regularly, I would skip these.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and no issues. Really like the charcoal sponge. Recommend seller selling multipacks of the charcoal sponge!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, mine didn&#x27;t come with suction cups. And I had to soak them for nearly 15 minutes the first time I used them in order to soften up. Otherwise, so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I loved it and its soft to use it in the face</li>
    <li> Hmmm, they are not as tought as the look, and I dont feel difference between the white and black one.&lt;br /&gt;They take a lot of time to dry up, so they can get too soft for the purpose, but they do the job if you have really soft skin. My skin if rought and they dont work that well.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell, but it feels very tech savvy.v ,,c,,c,,c,,c,,c,,c, b</li>
    <li> Great sponges, way better than a face cloth!  They clean you face well and your skin feels great after!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! I have used another konjac sponge, a sensitive skin one made by ecotools. These sponges are much better. First of all, they have a string that lets you hang it up so it can dry better. This pack of two is a good value, I use the charcoal one for my face because I am prone to acne, and I use the white sponge to gently exfoliate my sensitive eczema prone skin on my body. My skin feels so smooth after I use them! They do seem to take a little longer to expand and soften up than the ecotools sponge did, but it&#x27;s still a short time. I did break out a bit after I had used the charcoal sponge for a few days, but I think that is just due to the exfoliation bringing acne to the surface. I contacted the seller to see if that was common, and the woman who responded to me gave me some good recommendations that I feel like are already helping. I haven&#x27;t been using these for very long yet, but I do feel like my skin is improving and I expect to see good results with my continued use.</li>
    <li> Packaged great and followed up with an email for directions of use.  Great product and quality.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My co-worker bought me my first as a gift and I have been buying them ever since. They make your skin so smooth without being harsh or drying. This is the only sponge I use now and I won&#x27;t go back to anything else!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Konjac sponge, my skin looks cleaner and softer after only one week using it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, so I&#x27;ve been looking into stuff to better my skin. I gotta say, I LOVE the Konjac sponge! It looks small and is hard when it is dry, but once you get it wet with warm water, it will expand. It cleans my skin super well, and also massages the skin on my face. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week so far, but love the results already. It is SUCH a great and inexpensive way to exfoliate my skin. My skin feels amazing, looks refreashed .. and after just a week it does look more even toned to me. I will no longer be spending tons of money on scrubs and washes. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I got turned onto the Konjac Sponge a few months back and grabbed this pack of sponges from Beauty by Earth on Amazon and I am very pleased. I love that the pack came with two, I use the Charcoal one once a week for my oily acne prone skin. I love the feel of my skin with these sponges. I installed a command hook in my bathroom to hang them to dry after each use which made it so much easier. Love that they are vegan as well, great product!</li>
    <li> Great pack! I use the black one and it is very gental! I&#x27;m 30 and have a blackhead problem, this is wonderful I do use my cleanser with it but it is holding up great I use to use a wash cloth this is so much nicer!!! I use it every night with no issues, my 6yr old daughter uses the white one by itself she loves it it makes her feel special and helps her start caring for her skin the right way love these!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of or used Konjac sponges before until coming across this. I must say my face feels incredibly clean after I used the white one, I haven&#x27;t used the charcoal one yet because I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts but the reviews say it&#x27;s helpful for that. My skin just feels lighter and cleaner I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but I notice a major difference after using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company itself has amazing customer service. As soon as I ordered it Beauty By Earth emailed me thanking me for my purchase and told me if I needed anything as in questions about the product or any other products to contact them and included their information. After I received the product they emailed me again making sure the delivery was right and I received everything I ordered. They then thanked me again for my purchase. It makes the experience 10x better when the company has great customer service and nice people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is great for my skin, it&#x27;s really working for me. I love this company and I will be buying this again as well as products from them! Thank you Beauty By Earth.</li>
    <li> Great seller and product. Will order again soon!!</li>
    <li> This is a super cool, useful sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I could tell it very lightly exfoliated and made my face look more alive.&lt;br /&gt;Immediate difference where I could see it did some much needed deep cleaning, without being harsh at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I like it when I remove the makeup !</li>
    <li> Great little sponges, but very difficult to dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these little sponges do anything. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Left my skin exfoiliated, soft and very clean.  would buy again.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I like this product better than the other sponges, because the size of the sponge is slightly bigger. It&#x27;s more comfortable to hold the sponge.</li>
    <li> I love these. I find that using the attached string to hang them to dry and cleaning then as per instructions keeps them dry and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing. Most exfoliants make my face bright red and irritate my skin. This sponge becomes soft, almost a gel like feeling when wet, and leaves your skin so soft and radiant. I can&#x27;t stop telling everyone about them, ordered 2 more sets this week: one for my mom, one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. Leaves my skin smooth. Glad I found them!!</li>
    <li> I have used Konjac products before this purchase and really wished they had been around when I was a teenager. Especially the charcoal type which does a number on oily sweat. Although these sponges are smaller than the typical sponge, they appear to be denser. These are used more than once a day every day as I ride horses and can shower at least 2X per day, so they get a real work-out. This MFR&#x27;s product are going strong after several months and I would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time and very nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a difference in my skin but I like the sponge... Its easy to hold and feels nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> White sponge is excellent ... once hydrated the sponge is soft on the skin and moves easily.  A good addition to cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think it help anything</li>
    <li> These are basically the best beauty sponges in the world.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice sponge.  Cannot be compared to clarisonic or any brush.  It&#x27;s a sponge.  It&#x27;s nice especially if you use soap or a cleanser that foams up.  I use oil mostly so it less effective for me.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it does anything...</li>
    <li> LOVE this sponge!!! I&#x27;ve been using the black one on myself and the white one on my 20 month old. I have blackheads on my nose and chin that leave my skin a little rough and these sponges have smoothed it out after just a couple uses...literally!!! I wag my face, rinse and then use the sponge. I didn&#x27;t want to get the soap residue stuck in the sponge so hopefully they will last a little longer...??!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My youngest son has some exzema on his belly that I&#x27;ve tried essential oils and different treatments to help clear up. I used the sponge once so far and it&#x27;s starting to clear up! Who knew?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these sponges exceeded my expectations!!! They will be a beauty necessity from now on in my household</li>
    <li> Got them!! Thanks!! Love the sponges.  First time using!!</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool.  I am still getting used to using them, and I can&#x27;t say that they clean better that what I have been doing.  But I like how they feel on my face, and that they are biodegradable.  They are good for the planet, so they are good with me.  I must admit that I need to have better time management skills when using it though because waiting for it to soak up the water and become spongy takes a few minutes. :)</li>
    <li> Great product !!!! My face feels smoother and my dark marks are disappearing !!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried a few different konjac sponges and these were the best quality. They seemed to hold more water and they got the biggest in size after getting wet and expanding. They left my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> these sponges are amazing. Better than I expected. Their customer service was amazing as well. I am very happy and will definitely order from them again!</li>
    <li> My &#x27;teardrop&#x27; shaped sponge gave up the ghost recently and I love the way it feels and makes my face feel so I got this pack of two.  I like the round shape better.  Better to grip.  Hope these are always available because this is a  part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> The postal service delivered to wrong address but after the short delay I was so happy to receive!  Already used and loved the way my skin felt!  I know I&#x27;m going to love these.  Bought extra for my daughter and she will be getting shortly!  Price was excellent!</li>
    <li> I truly enjoy this product and I am very glad I ordered it. I will be purchasing more when necessary.</li>
    <li> Love the Konjac facial sponge.  Excellent exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the two-pack Konjac sponges for a few weeks now. Being that it&#x27;s winter in Chicago, my skin is incredibly dry and sensitive. I&#x27;ve found that using the charcoal one every day was helping. I&#x27;ve since been alternating between the two of them and the dryness has cleared up. I have some cystic, hormonal acne, which hasn&#x27;t improved much, but the overall appearance of my skin is much better - less small breakouts, brighter, more even skin tone. I think it might even be lightening my scars and sun spots! Easy to use and the exfoliation feels great.</li>
    <li> Wow! Talk about smooth skin! I was skeptical when I first got them because they were so hard and kinda odd looking. After soaking them for a few minutes in warm water, they became nice and spongy. I use them to exfoliate after I wash my face. So nice to get smooth skin without having to use any chemicals!</li>
    <li> Loved these little exfoliates! Really gentle but made my face glow with no make up on afterwards. I noticed it also felt way smoother and I was v happy about it.</li>
    <li> I can only write a review for the black Konica sponge as I haven&#x27;t used the second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge gives me a deep down clean and really gets in the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an oily T zone and I tend to only break out pre-menstrual but I use this every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with Cetaphil twice a day, my skin feels refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a general but through cleansing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know.... Seems like just an overpriced SMALL sponge.</li>
    <li> This was the first konjac sponge I tried and it is the best!!!! I tried a cheaper brand where I got 2  sponges for what I paid for one beauty by earth konjac..believe me get what you paid for! Those cheaper sponges did not even last for a week!  I&#x27;ve been usimg beauty by earth&#x27;s sponge for more than 5 months and it has not deteriorated a bit and is still effective! I put my mind at ease by sanitizing it in a bowl of water in the microwave every month. (manufacturer recommends changing the spong every 2-3 months)  I use this sponge along with shea moisture african black soap or shea moisture hibiscus shea soap. I then follow it with palmers cocoa butter facial lotion with spf 15. I had been on a quest to find products that would tone my skin colour without bleaching it (Afirican with chocolate skin colour) This combination of tools ( beauty by earth konjac sponge) and products have finally helped me achieve my goal!  Please spread the word! Everyone should own one of these sponges! Kudos and thank you to the company for making such an outstanding product. I hope y&#x27;all can make a body sponge like this with more textures to slough off dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> Who knew a sponge could replace all that scrub stuff I used to buy and do a better job. 20 seconds in the microwave once a week keeps it fresh.</li>
    <li> Very small. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> The shape of this sponge makes it easier to hold and guide, for me, than was the teardrop shaped one from another maker.  That said, the latter hydrates quicker than this one.  I&#x27;d guess it becomes a matter of preference for the user, but having used both what I didn&#x27;t find useful in the teardrop shaped konjac sponge I found in this one and to which I have preference.</li>
    <li> Use these and they really work great. I use these all the time and they make my skin feel really smooth. They also help clean out my pores like no other sponge I have tried.</li>
    <li> I used one tonight and it&#x27;s great! It made my skin feel very polished and smooth. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Great service. The sponges are easy to use, so far so good</li>
    <li> It feels so good on my skin. I actually feel that my skin pores are breathing again.</li>
    <li> I like these!  They make your face really, really smooth.  I was going to buy a facial brush but then saw a recommendation for this instead, and I&#x27;m glad I tried them!  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Great sponges, use with or without cleanser, for smooth rejuvenated skin! Feel fresh in the morning or relaxed at night - great use anytime of day. Easy to maintain for weeks of use! Highly recommend these over any other facial sponge.</li>
    <li> I heard this sponge worked wonders so I decided to give it a try. Well people, it is reeeaaaally good! The texture feels velvety soft on my skin yet it still scrubs and cleans somehow! I have been using it for a few weeks and not even every day and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dry skin or breakouts since! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Good product, but I&#x27;ve been only using it for one week and haven&#x27;t seen anything out of the ordinary, so I think I&#x27;ll have to wait to see more results. But my face feels more clean</li>
    <li> When it arrived, I was excited to use it. My skin is oily so I try to use the black one. I soften it like instructed and pretty amazed how soft it is. I notice the different after using it.  It cleaned all the makeup and dirt off of my face. This is a really great way to exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wonder it will collect bacteria after using it or not and if it is, how to remove it or have to buy a new one???</li>
    <li> Great product. I like to use it in the morning with my exfoliator face wash, especially when my eyes are all puffy. Very gentle in texture, so it&#x27;s fine to use on/around your eyes. The 2 for 1 is good deal because my last konjac sponge was $10 for one (and it was smaller than these ones).</li>
    <li> The sponges are easy to use and I can feel and see the difference on my skin.  Please follow the instructions for hanging it dry and boiling it in water once a week to sanitize.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing deal! I noticed my awkward pregnancy hormonal acne clear up immediately! This was recommended to me by my sister and I am beyond greatful, because I was just about to drop some serious cash on expensive cleansers and lotion out of desperation. Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;ve tried everything else!</li>
    <li> Exfoliates well but is not harsh on the skin and feels quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like how these clean my face. I have yet to see if they provide all of the extras that others have mentioned. I am hopeful!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value. My daughter and I love these sponges. Make sure you soak them in water for several hours.</li>
    <li> This is great product and i think i am going to be hooked to these for long. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;ve tried and seen it all, as far as skin care goes. It&#x27;s always been a passion of mine..... Let me say.... I love these little guys!.. Unique to me... ! No soapy taught feeling.., there&#x27;s no suds and yet skin is lovely after washing.. U don&#x27;t even rinse after u gently scrub with these babies, there are two. White for most skin care, black Konjac sponge to really clean pores, and blemishes. They are difficult to explain, totally reusable, they arrive hard as rock, after soaking... Lovely little cleansing sponges,one uses JUST the sponges. I know! Luv &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery, Great Packaging, Great Product, will order again and again!</li>
    <li> It works great but it broke quickly after like two weeks.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery and product just as it is represented, appears to be of good quality.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wow! What a great product and more than I expected. The sponge left my skin clean, soft and feeling refreshed. It has also helped to clear up my acne. And to get two sponges for the price of one is awesome. The white one for every day use and the black on to really work those acne prone times.</li>
    <li> These were weird but def. does work .. will purchase more</li>
    <li> This set has two sponges, one with charcoal (black sponge) and the other without it (white sponge).  When you first open the package, the sponges are hard; however, when you are ready to use it, soak the sponge in warm water for a few minutes so it expands and becomes soft and bigger.  I like that they come with a little thread to hang once you’re done using them.  I used the white sponge first and was very happy with the results.  I applied my face cleanser as I normally do and used the sponge in a circular motion as recommended in the package.  I immediately noticed that there is no need to use as much cleanser as before because the sponge is very soft, hence it creates more lather.  The sponges are soft and gentle on the skin but at the same time they exfoliate and clean deeply.&lt;br /&gt;Once you use it, hang it to dry.  The sponge will again become hard; however, once you want to use again, soak in warm water.  I would recommend soaking a few minutes before you plan to use it so that you don’t have to wait for it to expand.  It does take about five minutes to fully expand.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review once I try the sponge with charcoal.  So far, I am extremely satisfied with the results of the white sponge.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My daughter suffers from bad acne, especaily black heads on her face. She has been using the black sponge for a few days now and her skin already looks a lot better. Im going to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the facial &amp; body Konjac sponges, and I must say these are the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, and this is really saying something, because I&#x27;m not a sponge person.  In using the facial Konjac sponge, I noticed how smooth my face is, and the fact that it really removes the dead skin not only just from your face, but your body as well.  This one is definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I am so happy this product. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> 2 perfectly good konjac sponges for 11$ is an absolute steal for how awesome they are! I&#x27;ve used the black sponge for 2 days now and I can already see a difference, no acne and my skin is glowing! I have a pretty strict skincare regimen as it is and the sponges are just the cherry on top.</li>
    <li> I love this konjac sponge, I gave the charcoal sponge to a friend of mine who has acne and that person uses it daily! I think I found a must have beauty product!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love!! These were the first Konjac sponges I ordered. After one day I could see a difference in my skin with the white one. I gave the charcoal one to my teenager for her acne and she too after just one use saw a remarkable improvement.</li>
    <li> One word. Obsessed! I had heard about these sponges from a couple friends and they raved about them. My skin is SUPER sensitive so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything amazing on my skin. But once I got the white sponge soaked and ready - I fell in love......with a facial sponge. :) It&#x27;s SO soft and gentle but really cleans. I don&#x27;t feel raw or red or overly tight and uncomfortable like I do with anything else I&#x27;ve used, including wash clothes. I&#x27;m totally hooked. I follow up with their Argan oil as well for anti aging.</li>
    <li> I love these facial sponge, pack of two. Gave my daughter one, and I kept the other one. I just put water on it, in a circular motion, pat my&lt;br /&gt;face dry. Then rinse sponge, and hang it up to dry. After you use the sponge, you notice how soft your face is. My daughter, can&#x27;t believe how&lt;br /&gt;soft her face is, and loves her sponge.  I&#x27;m sure we will order more, from this seller!</li>
    <li> I use it twice daily, it makes my sensitive skin smoother, never breaks me out..  actually it clears the pimples.. The bad thing about it that it still wet after use it for almost 10 hr then start to dry! And that&#x27;s worry me.. I&#x27;m fraid that it may collect the germs into it..</li>
    <li> This sponge has to be one of the best buys I have ever made. My skin feels totally incredible.  I would definitely buy this sponge again.</li>
    <li> Great for the face but you better let it air out somewhere other than the shower. Could see the mildew on the white one within days. Assuming the other is ruined also.</li>
    <li> I really love using these sponges. They leave my skin feeling clean and soft. I have noticed that my skin is clearer since I started using the sponges and they are very gentle on my sensitive skin. It is really nice to have the two different sponges because I tend to break out more during that time of the month and so I use the charcoal sponge around that time to minimize my breakouts and keep my skin clear. So far, its working great!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, best price I&#x27;ve found for this must have beauty sponge!!!</li>
    <li> Very Nice! Really exfoliated my skin well. Only problem is starts tearing apart after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> The Konjac sponges are amazing!  I never would have expected charcoal to be soft and exfoliating, but they are both. Great communication from seller and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Works great and at a great price too. My skin looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> Love love love these sponges. Just soak &#x27;em for a lil bit and use with your favorite cleanser and voila! Beautiful bright skin! I&#x27;ve been having issues with dull skin lately and I was pretty bummed. I wasn&#x27;t sure how these were going to turn out but the first time I used them I fell in love. Well worth every penny and you get 2 for the price of one. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again when I finish using these.</li>
    <li> My husband is using the black one for his acne prone skin and I&#x27;m using the white one for my sensitive skin. It says it can be used without cleanser, but it feels ineffective. I used it at night and in the morning for two days. My face was left feeling grimy. I tested it by washing with the sponge  and rinsing my face. I have a gentle toner that I use occasionally before applying makeup and applied with a cotton pad. The pad came out dingy. I mean dirty looking. It looked like i was emanating dust. So it&#x27;s nice and gentle, but don&#x27;t expect any cleaning without added detergent. Husband&#x27;s experience is worse. His face has a lot of tiny whiteheads. Not good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really see much of a difference, maybe I need to use it more than three times to see a change.</li>
    <li> These are nice gentle exfoliating sponges and they helped clear up my skin in a week. Definitely recommended for all skin types. Will buy again/</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; Arrived Earlier Than What Was Estimated :-)</li>
    <li> Very nice sponge. It seems thicker and denser the the Puff brand I purchased before. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! It feels great on my skin and left me feeling refreshed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are a bit too small. But they work nicely.</li>
    <li> A very cute little sponge that is very natural and easy to use.  I like it because now my face has it&#x27;s own little natural sponge!  I just used my hands for all of my facial scrubs before, but this helps get down to the pores and really helps rejuvenate my face!  I haven&#x27;t used the black sponge as I don&#x27;t have oily skin..</li>
    <li> I have only used this sponge 2 nights at this point but so far I love it. My skin feels soft and smooth without using a harsh product.</li>
    <li> I really like being able to use a product that does not require other facial cleansers just the sponge.  I&#x27;ve only used the white sponge so far (one week) I plan on using the black one this weekend.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and I keep my white one in the shower for daily use.  It&#x27;s just so convenient.</li>
    <li> I loved the sponges! I use the white one for everyday cleaning and exfoliation and the black one around my noes and chin and it help tremendously with my pores! Would highly recommend these!!!</li>
    <li> I thought we would give it a try.  The price was less than many acne treatments at the drugstore, and I like to give natural a chance.  I have been using the white one and have noticed soft skin, smaller pores, and it is easy to use.  My 12 year old daughter who is beginning to have typical teenage skin has used the black sponge and is really pleased with the decrease in acne.  It is simple enough that she is sticking to the routine.  I just have to figure out some way to make it travel friendly.</li>
    <li> Work on my face very well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s best used with your own cleanser, as by itself it won&#x27;t remove all your makeup. You&#x27;ll only need about 1/3 of the cleanser you usually use because the sponge multiplies the bubbles. Would purchase again, and recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to plump up, but super soft and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This was a PERFECT buy for me! Two amazing sponges for the price of one! I use the Charcol Sponge for my acne prone face and the regular sponge on my sensitive skin in the shower! It&#x27;s a WIN-WIN! Fast service, high quality products and a FANTASTIC PRICE! I will be a repeat customer for sure:) I absolutely LOVE BOTH sponges!!!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges.  The white one is softer, but the dark one definitely helps to exfoliated your skin.  My skin feels really clean after using.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love these Konjac Sponges!  They work so well on my skin.  My skin feels soft and clean without a stripped feeling I get from other exfoliating treatments.</li>
    <li> Love these konjac sponges.  I&#x27;ve used the regular (white one) and my face feels really nice and soft after using it.  This sponge is not abrasive at all, but it exfoliates wonderfully.  I haven&#x27;t had to use any soap or face wash with it - just water.  I use Beauty By Earth&#x27;s Argan oil to moisturize after cleansing with the sponge and it is a wonderful combination for a skin care routine.</li>
    <li> These are great! Originally I bought one from Sephora for $15. These are just as good and a much better value!</li>
    <li> Good deal getting two for the price of one. They are larger than I expected which was great. People say konjac sponges have a smell, which wasn&#x27;t really the case with these. I have seen a marked improvement in my acne and pore size. They also help stretch your soap. I also used them on my hands and they make them really smooth. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love these so much! I noticed a difference in my skin within a week. I use nightly when I wash my face &amp; love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the konjac sponge for about 3-4 month now it had helped improved my face complexion a lot ( looking brighter and healthier) , reduced my pores dramatically, and i haven&#x27;t gotten any acne after my first two weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> Good for the price I paid ($10 for 2). They are too small to pay more, and I thought the product image of the woman holding the sponge a bit misleading. Size when expanded is about 3 inches diameter.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love Konjac sponges. I saw these on sale on amazon (a friend had posted the link of her blog) and I jumped on it! I feel like I can never have too many...especially these little ones. They make cleaning my face a breeze. I know they look like scary and rock hard like a pumice at first but a little water softens them right up into the sponges. I love how clean they make my face feel - with or without cleanser!</li>
    <li> So far so good....just received product in a timely manner.....instructions are as is...easy to follow...gentle to use on my face, happy thus far....no 5 star rating as of yet, time will tell for that</li>
    <li> It is very practice and it really cleans my skin and I feel more fresh but it needs to be more soapy!</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing! I&#x27;ve been using the black charcoal one for about a week now, and the skin on my face feels much smoother and clean. The sponge cleans gently but deeply. The quality is very substantial, and they say it will last for about 6 weeks. I&#x27;m glad I got two for the price of one. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> These facial sponges are gentle but very effective.</li>
    <li> It has a different texture but it feels like a smooth clean and I like that!</li>
    <li> exactly as described!</li>
    <li> This has been part of my face washing since it arrived.  The first few days I tried it without the face cleanser.  My face felt like satin.  I tried it a few more times without the cleanser and same effect.  I started using the cleanser with the sponge and it works wonders for me!  I will be buying more when they need replacing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty surprised that I like this product. My skin is super sensitive and on the dryer side. I am constantly flakey, so I thought hey let&#x27;s get something for daily exfoliation. These sponges are gentle, doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re actually doing anything, but they are! I tried them on my dry elbows and they were smoother too. Since I&#x27;ve been using the sponges on my face I&#x27;m a lot less flakey and my skin tone overall seems better. The charcoal one seems a pinch more intense than the white, which I like because I&#x27;m acne prone. For clarity, I use this with my cleanser, and I do not wear foundation, so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s removal of makeup. I&#x27;m not sure how well they will hold up over a few months, and I think they are wayyy overpriced, hence my 4 stars. Good product, but seriously probably should be priced about $3.</li>
    <li> these sponges are the best that I have ever tried, I love them and will continue to buy them... they arrived before the estimated date, and the are great, I will recommend to friends and family and will buy them again, very happy with this product..... Thank You....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a self proclaimed beauty junkie and I bought these on a whim.  I washed my makeup off like normal but used the sponge afterward, brushing in a circular motion as indicated on the instructions.  After the first time, it didn&#x27;t feel like anything was happening as I was doing it,but afterward, my skin felt smoother and softer.  I&#x27;ve been using the charcoal one at night after washing off my makeup and the white one in the morning.  It&#x27;s a great buy at 2 for 1!</li>
    <li> These are so gentle which is important to me because I have sensitive skin.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved these and I&#x27;ve only used them 3 times but each time has left my skin feeling soft and renewed! I would highly recommend them to anyone who is curious as I was. They are gentle and yet get the job done.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple, non toxic way to exfoliate and cleanse my face and this sponge fits the bill. I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use. Great product and the customer service was outstanding. I plan to recommend it on nontoxicforhealth.com.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges.  I have very problematic skin and psoriasis issues.  I&#x27;m always looking for something that can exfoliate vigorously but not hurt my face.  These are great.  I do not use them with any cleansers.  I love the way my skin feels after using them.  Definitely going to purchase again and maybe the ones for dogs to remove tear stains!</li>
    <li> Love this sponge. Make your skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Great product for cleaning your face. Leaves a great clean face feeling after. It is a bit small to wash your body with, but other than that no complains. Make sure to wash it in boiling water every week and it will be as good as new for a while.</li>
    <li> The quality is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest advantage is mild to the skin.</li>
    <li> i am never going to wash my face without these again! I love them! leaves your face smooth, clean and you dont have to rub hard! these soften once you put water on them and you can just put them up to dry. no ugly smells after. I use a natural soap too. they are a great value , cheaper than any beauty store would sell them at, amazon has amazing deals on the alot of beauty products!</li>
    <li> Great product and I strongly recommend.  My face loves them!!!!</li>
    <li> When I opened the product I was a not skeptical. So I opened it up, the initial scent is a little weird but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I put it in warm water and it took about 1 1/2 minutes to soften up. I initially tried it without soap and it&#x27;s very soft on the face. I then tried it with my clarasonic face wash and it was awesome. It made my face feel really clean. I loved the slight exfoliation feeling without it being harsh on the skin. I will be recommending this product!</li>
    <li> Great little sponges.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this in! I received it &amp; went to use it immediately. If I&#x27;m not mistaken it says you can use it without soap. I tried that &amp; all it did was glide around my face. My sister tried the other one &amp; was not impressed with it either. It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any type of texture to actually clean my face. I&#x27;m not sure if that makes any spence. It&#x27;s nice to use a massage bar for your face, but to clean? Not for me.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased the Dew Puff by Kojac and really loved it. Not knowing that there are several different materials to the Kojac puffs. I bought this because I really liked the two in one deal. I&#x27;ve been using the white sponge for a week now and I have to say I like the Dew puff a lot better. In terms of changes to skin quality it does the job just as well as the dew puff, but what I didn&#x27;t like is the roughness and the size of the sponge. This sponge is a lot more dense and harder to squeeze clean. With the Dew Puff I usually like to use it once a day to really exfoliate, most of the time I use it to lather up a nice foam for gentle cleansing in the morning, but with this sponge it is near impossible because of how tiny it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I think it is still a nice product, I just happen to like the Dew Puff a lot better for personal reasons. I actually think the size of these sponges are good for people that travel frequently.</li>
    <li> My previous review was written when I hadn&#x27;t had the sponges for very long. I have now been using them for a few weeks and upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. I absolutely love how smooth my face feels after using them. I do have adult acne and, although I can&#x27;t say it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up (not sure any product would do so) my complexion looks much better. Highly recommend this product!!    I&#x27;ve only had the sponges for a week but so far I like them a lot~I use the dark one (for problem skin) in the evening shower and the light one (for regular skin) at the sink in the morning. I like the way is makes my skin feel~clean and a bit tight (in a good way : )</li>
    <li> after run under tap water its soft but not smooth. it hurts when i use it, not for everyday use for sure.</li>
    <li> Ok, these are awesome. I love that you don&#x27;t have to use soap and that they do a great job of exfoliating without feeling like you just scrubbed off half your skin cells. Really happy with these and will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This sponge makes my facial skin feel so smooth afterwards. I use it in the shower with my favorite facial soap. Which before i would just use my hands to clean. But after cleaning my face with this sponge there was a noticeable difference. My skin felt smooth and cleaner. Before using the sponge I could still feel some rough spots around my face. This was especially true around my nose area. That is not the case now with this product. I will continue to use this in my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> To understand how well this product worked for me, I have to take you on my very bumpy, and often frustrating skincare journey (feel free to skip the boring parts):&lt;br /&gt; I had decent skin up until I turned 21- which was when I suddenly developed cystic acne on every part of my face. I was working in high-end skincare throughout college, so I tried everything from the cheapest drugstore brands to the most expensive (read: overpriced) products on the market, and nothing really helped, until I was put on a course of topical antibiotics. That, of course, isn&#x27;t the best long-term solution for your skin, so as soon as the cystic acne cleared up, I went off of it. Since then, my skin has never been totally clear, and I have tried every new product on the market, as well as all of the most-recommended favorites.&lt;br /&gt;That is, until I ordered these sponges. I have only tried the charcoal, but so far- O.M.G....unbelievable!! I can skip salicylic and benzoyl for a week without ANY breakouts or even a single pimple- something I have not been able to do since high school. My skin has a glow I have not gotten from any other product (a &amp;#34;lit-from-within&amp;#34; kind of glow I have coveted for ages), and when I perform a post-shower run of a cottonball with toner (which is also a favorite of mine- Skinfood Peach Sake Toner) over my skin, there is no makeup or residue left behind, which is pretty amazing, seeing as I don&#x27;t add cleanser to my sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that even though I tend to breakout, the surface of my skin is very dry and often peels in the winter (thanks to harsh acne topicals), and I have not seen any of that yucky activity either, so all skin types should benefit from this sponge. They&#x27;re the fabulous do-all I have been looking for all of my life (Ok, that&#x27;s a little over dramatic).  I have become a life-long customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a generic exfoliating facial sponge for almost a year and thought to give these Konjac facial sponges a try after reading so many positive review.  After using this for a week, it really cleans my skin and leaves my skin feeling smoother after every use.</li>
    <li> I have used this sponge for a couple weeks now and I am loving how my skin looks and feels! I have very sensitive skin, large pores, and oily skin. I&#x27;ve been using the black one with no facial cleanser, just warm water in the shower, and my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend their Argan Oil and Lip Balm - the best natural products I&#x27;ve tried! I literally have thrown away all my facial cleansers and moisturizers that took up so much space in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to suggest maybe selling a body size Konjac Sponge if possible... takes a while to exfoliate the body with the little facial sponge, but worth it!</li>
    <li> I just received my facial sponges two days ago and so far I love them. They are a lot better than using my hands to try and clean my face. I use them with face wash to help get a better clean. They also leave you face really soft.</li>
    <li> Love it! Just used the white sponge followed by the facial toner &amp; my skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> What are these supposed to actually do.  All they do is glide across your skin.  NO exfoliation takes place.  WHAT a gimmick!</li>
    <li> These work well, but take forever to dry.</li>
    <li> Great quality at an affordable price! It gently exfoliates and cleans off any dirt and makeup. Perfect for every day use since its all natural!</li>
    <li> Very gentle on skin. My skin is quite sensitive, and this product works fine on my face. I used it to clean make up cleaning cream. The sponge is not very big, smaller than your fist. So far I am happy about this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was a little sceptical when I first saw it and when I first used it.  It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like it was doing anything when I used it for the first time but it really works.  This is why I love the thing so much- it is not abrasive and feels gentle, but it must be removing dead skin because I can really see and feel a  diferrence after using for a week. I am not sure how long this will last before I need another one but I&#x27;ve been rinsing well after each use.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time.  Excellent little sponges- a 2 for 1 price deal!  I like the choice of using either the white or dark sponge.  Makes my face feel fresh after each use.  Even if you have sensitive skin, these facial sponges seem to be gentle (an not over using/exfoliating).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these sponges! My fave feels so soft and fresh after using them, and I like that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals ir beads on my face or down the drain.</li>
    <li> I never heard of konjac sponge before, and now i&#x27;m a convert. I have a clarisonic, but i find myself using konjac everyday, twice a day even, instead of using my clarisonic. The sponge is soooo gentle, and soft, and squishy. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face every night. The best part is  my face doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s just been assaulted and dry and irritated afterward. Has not tried the black one yet, but I anticipate nothing but good from it. And the deal from beauty by earth is the best, very affordable.</li>
    <li> I love these! They are soft enough that they aren&#x27;t painful to use but they are still effective. It feels really nice and my skin looks so much better afterwards. I have been using them for a few weeks and they are holding up very nicely and will definitely become a permanent part of by morning routine.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! They get off make better than a washcloth &amp; my skin feel nice all the time.</li>
    <li> I have read a lot on these sponges and I figured I would give them a try. I have had troubled skin my entire life. I have tried everything, I even do skincare for a living. These sponges have made my face flawless. I use it 2x a day. Love it so much I&#x27;ve recommended my clients to buy them as well!</li>
    <li> These sponges are softer than I expected. I used the black sponge on my feet and it did was very good job of smoothing out the rough spots. Used the white one on my face. It is too early to tell what the results are. It is also soft.</li>
    <li> As soon as i got the product i used it... I love they way my face feels so soft and clean.. I bought the 2 pack so im give the other one to my daughter .. Im loving it and my face too!!:)</li>
    <li> Love! Easy to use and can tell a little difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> This sponge was very small, it did not expand much when soaked in water. It does exfoliate with soap not very abrasive.</li>
    <li> I have now used both sponges and find them to be softer than I had thought!  The company does a great job explaining how to use them, and how to keep them clean &amp; dry.  When I took them out of the package, they were very stiff, and I thought they would be harsh on my skin, but they are not.  If you are looking for a soft/easy way to exfoliate, these are great!  If you are looking for something that will &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; your face, this might not be stiff enough for you.  I will continue using them in the morning before I moisturize and keep using my brush at night to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; my face.</li>
    <li> I love Konjac sponges. I tend to just buy them based on deals, which led me to these, and they haven&#x27;t disappointed! They&#x27;re very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. And you don&#x27;t have to use more than a pea size amount of cleanser--this sponge lathers it up very well!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not entirely impressed, it does the job of removing dirt and minimizing pores. It does indeed leave my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Amazing little sponge. I had read on different sites and various beauty blogs how great these sponges are for helping with skin complexion. And they are correct. I removed my makeup first and then used this afterwards as the directions state and my skin felt smoother.  This sponge is not abrasive but makes my skin feel smooth and look brighter.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sponge I&#x27;ve ever used for my face. And I&#x27;ve tried many. Started using it soon as I got it and my skin has never felt cleaner and clearer. Being all natural material, it&#x27;s got some amazing energy to it. Really love it and really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was sent this as a gift and i&#x27;ve gone out of my way to review them and order more. Its exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for in washing my face. I&#x27;m excited to be able to get that deep clean feeling without scratching up my skin and creating red marks. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Its a little too early to tell but so far I am delighted with my purchase. I like the way these sponges feel against my aging skin. Hopefully all the wonderful benefits I have read about will follow the more I use it. Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural and gentle way to take care of their face. I would love to try a bigger one for my body in the shower. Hope these last as long as the box claimed they would. If they do I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> These are great sponges - very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ts ok, I think after it wears out I&#x27;ll go back to my buff puff and Clinique foaming cleanser. The key is to either cleanse first or use a tiny but of cleasner with the sponge, rise thoroughly to remove all soap and squeeze dry.</li>
    <li> I am inlove with these sponges!!! Gets the job done with a soft feel to my face! It&#x27;s a perfect match with my vitamin c serum and shea butter!!!! Definitely purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> Noticed slight improvement at the beginning. Afterward, back to the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I use it in the morning after I wash my face in the shower, it helps exfoliate my skin and gets rid of any residual makeup my face cleanser did not get rid of.  I am not always good at washing my face at night and this helps to make it look fresh and clean.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again!  I have oily skin and the black sponge helps with my oiliness throughout the day.    Update:  Since starting this product, my pores are smaller and I have less oily skin and less breakouts.  I am seriously super happy I started using this product.  I have always had large pores and nothing has worked to shrink them except this.  I am excited to keep using it to help my skin look younger and fresher!</li>
    <li> I will be buying as gifts! I don&#x27;t know exactly what makes these so special, but after reading about them on yahoo.com, I was intrigued to try them. I had skin that was post-baby, and needed refreshing. Even after one week of use, simply adding a little cleanser as cleaning my face with the sponge, my skin is brighter, softer, and it feels so gentle but really cleanses! I&#x27;m impressed and its only one week in!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges, and a great deal to have 2: one for by the sink and one for the shower. I love that they work with just water and no need for extra cleanser/chemicals. The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t do very well with taking mascara off...I need to remember to use eye makeup remover in addition. Otherwise, though, love these for my very sensitive, combination skin.</li>
    <li> I love konjac sponges especially even they come  at such a great price for a 2 pack! I let a friend have the white one and will be definitely be ordering some more. I look forward to adding these to my daily beauty routine :)</li>
    <li> I have found these sponges to be a great facial sponge.  I use to feel I couldn&#x27;t get my face clean enough after wearing make-up.  Now with this sponge I definitely feel I able to get my face truly clean.  I use the sponges daily and feel they have also helped control some acne I have been experiencing.  It says the sponge is good for a baby/child.  I have very sensitive skin and feel the sponges do not irritate my skin.  So, I think they would be great for babies and children as well.</li>
    <li> Great product with an affordable price. great size and texture, very gentle to my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved konjac this pack for the price is bril!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great.  I noticed that I didn&#x27;t break out around my chin area as much.  Also my face has been softer and less dry.  Fun and easy product to use.  I have to say, I love the packaging.</li>
    <li> I normally use wash cloths to clean my face, but this sponge is something different! It feels nice on my skin and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Konjac sponge after my friend got me one from Japan. I enjoyed it so much that I looked for a replacement on Amazon. I came across &amp;#34;Best Konjac Sponge&amp;#34; and bought it because of the amazing price (two for the price of one!) and the good reviews. I am totally happy with my purchase. The quality of the product is very good. It exfoliates my skin gently and makes it smooth. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase this product:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it but I love it already, it leaves the skin very smooth and soft and it&#x27;s so delicate that you wouldn&#x27;t expect those results. And I really appreciate the 100% natural origin of the product. Let&#x27;s see in a few more days!  Also, the item arrived in a nice box and wrapped in a little and hygienic bag.  So very good purchase for me..</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! They are the best. I&#x27;m pretty picky with what I use on my skin, but these sponges are awesome. Perfect for washing off makeup and really getting a clean feel. Just fabulous.</li>
    <li> These sponges are so perfect for removing my foundation makeup.  I love that I can wash them, hang to dry and reuse them over and over.  They work fantastic on my sensitive  skin, and my daughter wants a set for he self, so another one is already in my cart.</li>
    <li> These little sponges do amazing work. I use the charcoal one to help with acne/blackheads and have seen a decrease in both since using this sponge. I like the natural one for general cleansing of the dead skin on my face before I use my mask. It leaves my skin soft and clean feeling. I will buy these in a couple of months when mine start to break apart.</li>
    <li> Good sponges and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> First let me say I never write reviews. This product doesn&#x27;t need any more good things said about it.&lt;br /&gt;If you like your face buy this now!&lt;br /&gt;-Stephanie Aronson</li>
    <li> I used konjac twice in a row since I received them...first time I used it on my without soap then second night with my cleansing foam.  After rinsing my face feel soft and clean.  So far I like it.</li>
    <li> Great sponges, very gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> I decided to go for the sponge because I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about the product, and was looking for a natural way to wash my face more deeply, without harshness. This sponge duo works perfectly! For the quality and value (2 sponges for basically the price of one) I love my sponges from Beauty by Earth, and hope to pick up some more all natural products from them again soon.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  Terrific and considerate communications and follow-up, and provided very useful instructions and information as well.</li>
    <li> these are OK, but the picture is deceiving...the sponges are very small and wasn&#x27;t quite what my daughter wanted..they worked, but will pay more attention next time we order</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use a konjac sponge. It&#x27;s convenient and my skin feels nice afterwards. In particular, it allows to use a smaller amount of cleanser than I normally would and, therfore, it&#x27;s faster to rinse - really appreciate it in the evening when I&#x27;m dead tired and evening beauty routine seems like a burden. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product, since it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate like a scrub, but it&#x27;s good for everyday use. The edge is good to remove the stubborn leftovers of eye liner and mascara under my eyes, and it&#x27;s gentle enough for that area. Won&#x27;t travel with it though.</li>
    <li> These sponges are quite amazing.  My face has never felt this clean after washing it.  I use a little face wash with it (a little goes a long way) and my face feels refreshed and ready to take on my moisturizer.  Well worth my money and really glad I went ahead and got them!</li>
    <li> I tried these out for the first time and I absolutely love them. They feel great on my face and the gentle exfoliation seems to be just what I needed. I use them in the am when I wake up. I really recommend these sponges!</li>
    <li> Nice product! I have sensitive skin and it feels smooth when I use the sponge.</li>
    <li> I have 4 teenagers 2 of them with problem skin, this was a perfect easy way for them to help clear up their skin without causing irritation as they are so gentle. It is easy so they use it....Love it</li>
    <li> Had a little mix up with shipping, which amazon went above and beyond to compensate me for. Received my products in a timely manner once problem was fixed, and have been more than pleased with both the Konjac facial sponges and the lip balm from Beauty by Earth!! I am in love, just as they said I would be in the product description. The sponges have made my face noticeably smoother after just a couple uses. The lip balm is moisturizing and the flavor of it is just amazing, and literally freshens your breath. I orders the fam back of mint lip balm and the 2 pack of the sponges (1original, 1 charcoal). Happy to say, I will be a regular customer of this family owned company! -Danielle</li>
    <li> I love how the konjac sponge feels so gentle on my skin. This pack has 2 so I gave one to my mom and she loves using it, too. This particular brand&#x27;s sponge is a tad smaller than boscia but it is still good if you&#x27;re just using it for the face. There&#x27;s a big chance I&#x27;m ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I do the oil cleansing method and was looking for something to help gently remove the oil after washing my face.  These sponges have been working really nicely.  I like how gentle they are.  I have really sensitive skin and these have not been irritating my skin at all.  My skin is clearer and feels great.  This is a definitely something I will continue to purchase and use.</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing!  Highly recommend them!!!  I cannot believe how soft my skin feels.  I will never be without one!  I have already recommended them to coworkers and one has already gotten hers and likes it so much she ordered two more as gifts!!!  Speaking of gifts. I will definitely be ordering more as Christmas gifts abd stocking stuffers! Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Cute little sponges.  I&#x27;ve had them a week, and they&#x27;re pretty good.  I think I expected it to be a little rougher - I&#x27;m not sure if my skin is exfoliated, but I guess that&#x27;ll be seen over time.  I love that it&#x27;s vegan, and I hope that it lasts!  Seller is responsive, and seems to really care about getting the product to the customer.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. Soft enough to be used by my young child, but useful as an exfoliant for my grown-up skin too.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with random dry, flakey patches that pop up unexpectedly.  In the past I have purchased very rough exfoliating products that didn&#x27;t always buff away the dryness but definitely enhanced my skin&#x27;s irritation and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have used both of these sponges it does take a bit of time for them to absorb water and become pliable but when I have used them I have noticed how soft and gentle they are.  They gently buff and polish the skin without causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would pick such a gentle product but I am pleased that I did and would recommend it to others as well.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works like a charm and great for the environment! I will definetly buy more in the near future and i am thinking of making them Christmas gifts as well!!! Highly recomend it!</li>
    <li> Very nice for their price :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this little thing for my wife, knowing the affinity charcoal has for attracting toxins to itself and removing them from the body.  I have also started using it and I must say it&#x27;s become my face&#x27;s best friend.  Now I think I have a solid and manly beauty regimen - use this in the shower to cleanse my face, and a little botanical lotion to keep it hydrated during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge sold by this company is of high quality and I&#x27;ll be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> The product arrive on time and the packaging design looks very natural.  I like how it is GMO free.  After using the sponge my skin feels very soft.  The instructions to use is very clear also.  As I&#x27;ve only used it twice, I will update this review when I see more change!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges, they really are great and they dry perfect.  Add a little bit of a glow to my face, love them.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges - so soft yet they clean so well!</li>
    <li> These sponges are awesome. I used them both on my face and they are the perfect amount for exfoliation, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel rubbed raw. My skin felt soft after I used them. I really like the black sponge as my face is prone to be oily and this sponge exfoliated, but didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Packaging is great. I have really liked all of the Beauty by Earth products. Their customer service is also great. They make sure I am happy with the product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple. The sponges are good. Finding a quality product is nice. Especially when there is a lot of mediocre products out there.  These are quality!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. The konjac was dry and needs to be wetted thoroughly before use. The charcoal one made my skin glow. One star off bc they are pretty small in size. Depending on how long they last, may purchase again. Tnx!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these sponges on my face for about a week and a half now. I love how gentle yet effective they are. My skin feels so soft and clean afterwards and my pores are viably smaller. They&#x27;re as natural as you can get! I highly recommend for those of you who enjoy exfoliating often. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend using Beauty By Earth&#x27;s Argan Oil afterwards. Double the magic! My skin is so happy. :)</li>
    <li> Love this product for myself and it makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my sponges! They are perfect for cleaning your skin on any busy morning, sooo fast you have no excuse to cleanse. Love them!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying konjac sponge and I really like it. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I like that its all natural and easy to use. I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a fantastic price.  Was exactly as described and shipping was incredibly fast.  My skin feels soft and silky smooth and I swear I look 5 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are also working miracles on the skin of my 2 teenage boys.  They love how gentle they are and how easy they are to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product!  Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge for about four days now. I have acne prone skin and my face is oily. Ever since using the black sponge, I have noticed a slight reduction in the oiliness of my face. The acne is also starting to clear up. My face feels softer and looks brighter after using the sponge. I have not used the white sponge yet, just the black one because it is more for my type of skin. I like that I don&#x27;t have to use soap or acne cleansers. I just use the sponge by itself.</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference with one use of the charcoal sponge- my skin felt baby soft and my makeup applied so smoothly. I will definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
    <li> I just opened and used the charcoal one last night.  You can tell the difference in quality and product of the sponge and it is better than many out there!!!</li>
    <li> Being my skin is very oily, I have used this for several days now with my facewash.  Definitely feels like my pores are being &amp;#34;emptied&amp;#34; as I scrub.  Thank you...:)</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, its a horrible thing to live with. Makes you anti social because you just do not want to go out in public with a super red inflamed face with what appears to be acne all over it. Its embarrassing!! When I was given the chance to try the Konjac sponge at a reduced price I jumped as I had heard good things about it. AM I EVER SO GLAD I DID. I knew what to expect when they arrived, hard little balls but I read in the instructions and on my first use I only used the sponge. I now use it with my branded exfoliating cream and the combo has already made a huge impact on my facial skin in a week. Cannot remember the last time it felt as soft as it does. I follow up with coconut oil, let that soak in, blot the excess and then use my daily moisturizer. I just cannot say enough good things about the Konjac Facial Sponge....you have a new customer! P.S. I gave the white one to my son and I already notice a reduction in his acne!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Great products. They really work as described. I am very happy with the sponges and I will be using more products from this company.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great ! After using Konjac my skin of face  very smooth!</li>
    <li> Works well. Good for exfoliation. My skin feels very soft. The charcoal one has helped tremendously with my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d only recently read about konjac sponges, and my interest was piqued by an article that says they can help with problem skin.  I live in a dry climate and struggle with adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the black charcoal sponge first.&lt;br /&gt;I removed my makeup with a separate makeup wipe before using the sponge,which I soaked in purified water.&lt;br /&gt;I gently moved the konjac sponge around my entire face in a circular buffing motion, with a little facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result?&lt;br /&gt; I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was afterwards!  None of that rough texture or gunk stuck in my pores that washcloths leave behind.  It left my face and neck very smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I gave these sponges a try, and I&#x27;ve been using them daily with great results.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Face feels refreshed. Not abrasive at all. Only tried the black one so far.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sponge because I wanted something that would exfoliate my face softly, unlike my other brand sponge that was too rough(forgot the brand name). When I use this sponge I notice that im left with a beautiful glow &amp; soft skin PLUS my face doesn&#x27;t dry out after a wash like it did before. I&#x27;ve been using the black sponge because im &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; prone with oily skin and dark spots but im going to start using the white sponge for every day use rather than the black saving that one for weekly use instead. Ill update you guess if there&#x27;s any change</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective way to exfoliating and cleaning my face without using harsh chemicals. And these sponges do the trick. I personally do not feel difference between white and black sponges as both work equally well for me.</li>
    <li> Very good product...highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that there is a string attached to hang dry the sponges, however, it never really dries.  It is tough to squeeze out the water after using is because the sponge is thick.  I have been using the black sponge because it is supposed to be better for acne prone skin and lately my face has been breaking out.  I am not sure what difference I am supposed to see in my face but I have only been using it for a week.  Other reviews raved about how different your skin feels after using it but I honestly can&#x27;t say I see a difference.  With that said, I do like using a sponge rather than a wash cloth.  My main concern was making sure my face was truly makeup free when I went to bed so I have been happy with them.</li>
    <li> These are the best exfoliating sponges I have tried yet!  They are like heaven on your face.  My daughter wants to use them too... but I won&#x27;t let her!  She needs to get her own!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past week and I love it a lot. I use it everyday, keep one by the sink and the other in the shower. I am going to buy more of these when mine wear out.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the sponges!</li>
    <li> I have only been using for one week but they do seem to keep your skin exfoliated. They are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used the charcoal sponge and after 3-4 uses, my pores are visibly smaller! I&#x27;m not sure yet how well the sponges will hold up or if I&#x27;ll break out, but so far so good with these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what this sponge is doing. It is very mild on the face. I can&#x27;t tell if dead skin cells are coming off.  I am having my pre-teen son who is starting to get those acne bumps to use it to see if it cleans his face properly. He seems to like it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product to exfoliate for my sensitive, acne prone skin. The sponge is gentle, which is exactly what I was looking for, and I was happy with how my skin felt after I used it.</li>
    <li> Received the product and used it. I am very happy as it is doing its  job very well! My face felt very clean and soft after use. (it gentely took off the dead skin from my face). I will recommend it to anyone who likes natural face cleaning product!</li>
    <li> These sponges are terrific!  I used to use a Clarisonic, but I lost  the charger and did not want to have to buy a new one.  I&#x27;m glad I didnt, because the Konjac sponge does the job of deep cleaning my face as well or better, more gently, and with more control on my part.  I absolutely love it!  It feels wonderful and I know my face is getting a good, deep healthy clean.</li>
    <li> Love washing my face with this!  My skin is smoother and I actually feel clean.</li>
    <li> I used the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sponge the day it arrived. That day, my face was so soft already! The next day, I used the &amp;#34;charcoal&amp;#34; sponge with the same results. I didn&#x27;t expect to experience a change so soon and I look forward to using Konjac sponges forever. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent for exfoliating, gentle enough to use all the time.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. I recently purchases them after hearing great things about them. I was in the market for a new exfoliator and this fit the bill perfectly. These sponges make my skin soft and clean, plus you get two basically for the price of one.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin was so soft and smooth after the first use.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the charcoal sponge but I absolutely love this product. It lathers up my face soap amazingly well so I don&#x27;t have to use as much soap as I typically do. It&#x27;s not rough at all like some exfoliating products and feels soft and smooth. The best part was after using the sponge, my face moisturizer feels completely different. It quickly absorbs into my skin rather than feeling a little thick and cake-like on my face. I love that!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I learned about these from a friend and figured I would give them a shot. I have a naturally oily face and usually have issues finding the right product for it. However I was surprised by these sponges, they do an amazing job without being harsh or abrasive against my face... And after using them my skin feels amazing! I would highly recommend this product, and with such a fair price I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Great customer service &amp; great products!!!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! Make my face feel really soft</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally try my first konjac sponge! I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about them and I have to say that they really are as good as people claim. It really feels as if the makeup is truly removed and the skin is actually being cleansed instead of how it is with just a face wash and your hands. I highly recommend these natural sponges if you like having clean and clear skin!</li>
    <li> Good!!&lt;br /&gt;Promotion is good. Quality is good. Very good.</li>
    <li> I have seen these sponges in all the magazines so I thought I would give this two pack a try.  I am blown away at how soft and clean my face is.  If you have not ever used  a konjac sponge, you have to give them a try.  So far I have used the white one because I have aging skin.  I like the fact they last a few months.</li>
    <li> Thanks for your fast services. It is really helpful to all of my family.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it so much.</li>
    <li> I really like these!  Very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I was having some breakout issues prior to using the black sponge, and now, my skin is clear and bright!  I have a Clairsonic that I thought would be good for exfoliating, but it made my skin break out like crazy.  I guess I just need a more gentle approach, and this seems to do the trick!  I will definitely be buying these again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with skin reactions with cleansers that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  These sponges work great with just water!!!  I noticed a difference in just 3 days and after a week my troublesome spots (no pun intended) are nearly healed!</li>
    <li> I keep one in the shower and the  other by my bathtub.  I wash my face first, then apply more soap and use the sponge.  WOW!  love the way my face feels after using these.  I do not use every day, but like twice a week.  Will buy again!!!!!</li>
    <li> Like this, not strong on exfoliating but it&#x27;s good and easy to reuse.</li>
    <li> Hard and nasty. Not something you really want to rub on your face. Come with a weird string through like a tampon for no apparent reason.  Weird. Just plain weird  and strange. Good marketing but just weird.they asked me to rewrite my review. Ok. Don&#x27;t but these that are hokey.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if they work differently than any other konjac sponge but I do like these. You&#x27;ll want to replace them after a little while as with any sponge but I feel like they do a good job of getting my face cleaner than with soap while still being quite gentle.</li>
    <li> These are amazing I love them. Have been using them daily for past month with no issues.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Awesome ! Awesome!</li>
    <li> Wow, very impressed! Both sponges are fantastic, especially the charcoal one (I have oily skin). They make my skin so smooth but without dryness or irritation. And a HUGE plus: The string that goes through the sponges to hang them when you are done! Makes air drying a lot faster!</li>
    <li> I only used the white one so far but my skin feels smoother after each use. I like it!</li>
    <li> Wow, Your Skin Will Feel Softer, Smoother, and Have a More Radiant, Youthful Appearance With Just One Use!</li>
    <li> Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
    <li> AWESOME sponges! My cousin just became a licensed esthetician and she told me to get these. I have such combo skin and these are great. It really feels like it gets a deep down cleaning!</li>
    <li> Oh answer came in a small box&lt;br /&gt; There are white and black two.&lt;br /&gt; Konjac good to believe.&lt;br /&gt; Kids and wife love the quality.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you for letting me offer a good product at a lower price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of these but am so glad I stumbled upon the product. I use the white sponge with my face wash and love how soft my face feels after. It is not abrasive in any way but you can feel that the dead skin is gone and fresh skin is revealed daily. I highly recommend these sponges. I am Vegan so it does mean a lot to me to find companies that care about providing high quality products without harming the environment and animals.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin due to a hereditary skin disease that I have. Most other facial sponges I have tried have been too rough and most other brands have some type of plastic in them, making them too rough for my skin. I really enjoyed the Konjac sponges, after soaking them in water and using them for the past week, my skin has started to improve, from cleaning pores to gently removing dry skin from the winter air. I would definitely recommend these sponges to anyone who has sensitive skin or suffers from dry skin, as they don&#x27;t cause irritation. Thanks Earth Konjac!</li>
    <li> I have now been using the Charcoal sponge for a week and I am very happy. I bought the pack of two with the intent of using the Charcoal sponge when I am battling breakouts and the Natural sponge when my complexion is free of any acne. I have had several pimples that have been very stubborn. I tend to pick (I know I know) and I decided to purchase these sponges to get a deep clean that was gentle. I can say that the progress in how they are healing is amazing. I was battling with these ugly spots for months and now within a week they are healing and clearing. One week is all it took. I would absolutely purchase again. The only negative (which isn&#x27;t a reason not to use) is that it is very hard to feel I have gotten all of the product out of the sponge when I am done washing my face. I do feel like I am spending a little longer than I would like making sure I have properly cleaned out any remaining cleanser in the sponge.</li>
    <li> Have used both sponges and really like how soft my face feels after,  I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the two sponges.  You do have to completely saturate the sponges to get them to soften up before use.</li>
    <li> This is another one of those over-hyped products for me unfortunately.  I had high hopes.  I have combination, sensitive skin and every single time I use either the white or the black sponge, I come out of the shower with red spots on my forehead.  I tried using them every other day, every 3 days and once a week with and without cleanser with the same results.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so especially in the winter its hard to use exfoliating sponges because they are just to rough. these sponges are fabulous, they aren&#x27;t rough when you use them so at first it doesn&#x27;t feel like its working, but then you rinse your face and your like &amp;#34;oh, nice&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great to clean my skin. I work out a lot and it helps to remove excess oils left on my face.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered these.  They work great.  I have very dry sensitive skin (not oily at all).  Both the white and charcoal are very gentle but exfoliate well with no irritation.  I rinse them well after each use and they lasted a good amount of time until they started to disintegrate.</li>
    <li> Got this as an incentive for a review and was grwatly surprised at the quality. I gave on to my grand daughter who suffers form acne and she wont use anything else.. works on my skin as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a week and use them several times a day! They feel so good on my skin. I have pretty clear skin and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I cant imagine it irritating sensitive or acne skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any different after months of using it...waste of money.</li>
    <li> We used these to bathe our newborn with solely for the first 2 months.  Very very soft and gentle</li>
    <li> Good product! I have sensitive skin so I only use once a week.</li>
    <li> This was a last minute find and I impulsed bought due to the great reviews. I received them yesterday, and I&#x27;m already reviewing them.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I tend to easily break out. I just started a Korean skin care routine, but was looking for a pore brush to use. I came across these instead, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I don&#x27;t use products with anything unnatural in them either, so the fact their all natural is a plus too.&lt;br /&gt;First things first, I washed my face regularly. Then, I used my sponge and continued with my routine. I thought the sponge was going to be a bit rough, but it&#x27;s the softest thing in the world. You would think its not doing anything because it feels like your just rubbing your face with your fingers. Instantly after, my face felt soft. The next morning (today), all my acne scars are basically gone and my face still feels as good as ever. This does a really good job at cleansing your face. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a week, three weeks, a month, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who needs a good, gentle deep cleansing.</li>
    <li> These sponges were great! I love how much smoother my skin is feeling and the fact that I am breaking out a lot less! My daughter has been trying them as well. She has always had rough skin on her legs and it has made such an improvement!</li>
    <li> 💖💖happy with my konjac .thank you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can make a legitimate judgement of this product considering the fact that I only used it once, but that one time was not fantastic. It took way more than a minute (closer to 10) to soften the sponge for use. When I could finally use it, the texture was soft and squishy, which peaked my curiosity to how well it would work. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t seem like it was doing much of anything but wetting my face. I&#x27;m used to exfoliating, scrubber-like sponges (which may seem too harsh for some) because I want my face to actually be cleaned and dirt to come off; I like to be able to see and feel the difference after a wash. I&#x27;ve got dry skin and oil builds up after leaving moisturizer on for a couple of days. This didn&#x27;t quite deliver and I was a bit disappointed, but I might give it another go so the purchase wasn&#x27;t a complete waste, but as a supplemental cleaner to a sponge that is more obvious with its exfoliating capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a few more uses, no real change in my opinion. I do like that theyre vegan and I do appreciate that they are naturally-derived but, in all honesty, these don&#x27;t do much of anything. I still have to wash my face afterwards to get whatever dirt and oil to come off. I really don&#x27;t mean to deter anyone and a lot of people are raving about these, but I can&#x27;t say I agree with those people. Feel free to formulate your own opinion</li>
    <li> I got a discount to try these, but I really didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like them much. I do like them! They take a little getting used to, but even with no cleansers, it makes your skin feel clean and soft. You do need to soak them for a few minutes to make them soft. After the first time, the soften up quickly.</li>
    <li> These are great. First, it&#x27;s pretty amazing to watch the rock hard sponge soften. And then it feels just wonderful on your face. The attached string makes it easy to hang up to dry. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> It works great!! It leaves the skin very soft and it&#x27;s great to use it with a cleanser cream or foam.</li>
    <li> Really like these sponges and use them often. I have very dry skin that is irritated by most cleansers. I use these sponges almost daily and have had no irritation. They do tend to dry out between uses and the edges have to be re-softened each time, which takes 30-60 seconds of holding them under warm water.</li>
    <li> So I really tried to like this... I&#x27;m a skin therapist and try a lot of different products at home and in my treatment room.  I&#x27;m big on exfoliating.  I don&#x27;t over do it, but I enjoy a smooth face.  I get a lot of dead skin buildup due to having oily skin and figured this would be a great everyday product I can use without having to use a facial scrub as often, but I would have had better results with the soft side of a dish sponge. Honestly, this raggedy facial sponge is not worth the price or the hype it is getting on Amazon reviews.  I have been using the charcoal sponge for the past 2 days morning and night, it&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t feel any cleaner and smoother and feel like my face has a ton of buildup still.  Luckily I do work in a spa... I&#x27;m gonna give it a couple more days to see if I notice any results worth it to continue using these... if not then I&#x27;m gonna have to give myself a nice Microdermabrasion treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too, I read the back of the box and it says that these sponges are alkaline to balance our acidic PH levels.  Now that should have been the first thing I read before buying these.  Our skin is naturally acidic, between 4-6 ph, which fights off pollution and bacteria in the air.  An alkaline enviornment raises our ph levels and opens our pores up and makes us more susceptible to break outs on our face and bacteria.  I&#x27;m experiencing a mild breakout on my face currently and noticed this morning it was starting to get worse. ALL IN THE NAME OF BEAUTY! Save your money... I actually bought these and did not get them free or discounted for writing this review, which is probably why I&#x27;m the only one writing an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review.  Disappointed Skin Therapist.  Don&#x27;t buy into this gimmick.</li>
    <li> Ok, after using these for a couple of weeks now... I LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> These are perfect. They smooth your skin and make your face brighter . They even seem to gently remive this small skin tag I have on my cheek. I am no spring chicken do I really need help looking fresh and bright. Wuth this you do not need all the extra lotions and stuff. But at night a good vitamin c oil or overnight mask ought to make you shine.</li>
    <li> I love these things. Although I&#x27;m not sure if they are doing anything special, I do know that they do a great job of exfoliating without leaving your face feeling like it has been ripped apart. I use it with a facial cleanser and it lathers amazingly.</li>
    <li> I use the charcoal one quite often for my facials and keep the white one in a dry spot in my shower. The sponges are really durable and yet soft enough to use daily. I have really been enjoying them</li>
    <li> I chose to try out the charcoal sponge due to my oily complexion and am really loving it! It&#x27;s not rough on my face but seems to have enough texture to exfoliate, leaving my face feeling smoother, clean and fresh. The first try took a minute to get the sponge saturated with water to get soft but now it gets soft very quickly under warm water. I personally leave my sponge on my shower window sill to dry out thoroughly under the sun after each use and it seems to work just fine. Additionally I like that there is a string attached to it to hang the sponge to dry. I have been breaking out less since using the sponge as well which makes me a happy camper!</li>
    <li> Omg yes! I wish i would have learned about these sponges a long time ago... I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days and i love it... My skin is glowing and silky smooth when i use it... I will absolutely keep this as a part of my skincare routine from now on.... Must buy and try!!!</li>
    <li> Rather expensive for what&#x27;s in the box in my opinion. I thought a hanger was supposed to be included but there wasn&#x27;t one.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Nice experience, didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like a facial sponge but have enjoyed trying these, I believe i have been spoiled for a anything else, thanks BBE. These are great in the shower but if you want to take off makeup, this will not do it.  So have been using coconut oil with these and then a washcloth for the final takeoff.  They are nice and soft and I love having the string for hanging to dry.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and these have worked great for me. I feel like my face is clean and it isn&#x27;t too harsh. They are great for travel and I hang the sponge off of my liquid soap bottle. The string is just the right length so that it can dry and stays off the counter.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. Works well on KP that&#x27;s on the face.</li>
    <li> Really great sponge.  I love the fact it is natural and vegan.</li>
    <li> They work very well and are not to harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 2 pack sponge with charcoal and natural for two reasons. I have rosacea and my son has acne. He uses the charcoal and I use the natural. I love the gentleness of this sponge. My skin is very sensative so I am careful what I use. It gently exfoliates without the roughness you get with other sponges. The redness is slowing disappearing and my skin is so soft. My hope with the charcoal sponge is that it will exfoliate the skin so that my son has less scaring. I would definately recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> These work great!  I&#x27;ve used only a few times but my skin feels amazing. I did not need customer service, but they contacted me with instructions for use and to let me know the product was on the way.  Great customer care</li>
    <li> These Konjac Facial Sponges are wonderful for deep cleaning and exfoliating your skin.  I currently use the natural Konjac sponge (white one) and it really does a good job of getting all the make up off of my face.  My face feels clean and refreshed after using the sponge and I&#x27;m thrilled with how long the product lasts.  I&#x27;ve been using my Konjac sponge for 5 weeks now and it&#x27;s still good as new.  The price is excellent for the quality and use of this product.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely great! I love them, they are all natural and exactly what I wanted. What a great purchase and quick shipping by the seller!</li>
    <li> Just tried it out and works great. You have to soak the sponges in warm water for a few minutes and then they expand and get soft. Rubbing against the face was better than I thought, it&#x27;s not harsh on your face at all like other sponges where you feel like it&#x27;s taking off a whole layer of your skin, but on the other hand it&#x27;s not so soft that it feels like it&#x27;s doing nothing. I thought I&#x27;d have to still use a facial cleaner but with just water it kind of suds up and does it work by itself. Interested to see what happens once I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have used both sponges now and have had positive results! The sponges are not too rough but exfoliate nicely, which leaves skin silky smooth and feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> Really did not do much for my face I was really kind of disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> Even after soaking for 10 minutes they still barely expanded. And maybe I just have insanely sensitive skin but they were too rough for me :( Sounds like others enjoy them though so maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with cleaning my face. I normally use 7-day scrub every single day (supposed to be used once a week), I wash with soap after that, then I scratch with my nails and I still feel that my skin is dirty. In fact there is dirt / oil (?) under my nails normally even after obsessively scrubbing and scratching my face. I get microdermabrasions whenever I can afford it. Sooo, I waited for this product very excitedly. Sure enough, after my usual, very thorough regimen, the sponge still got immediately oily and dirty from my skin. I washed and rinsed the sponge about five times, scrubbed my face some more, and ta-daaam, FINALLY, the sponge remained clean. That&#x27;s when I knew my face was finally clean. Really clean. It felt great!!! It still does! For someone like me, with very oily and NOT sensitive skin, some more roughness would be even more satisfying, and would probably allow the same cleanness in a shorter time. But no complaints. It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m happy I have found it.</li>
    <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve been using them for a week, once a day, without any other soap. I have pretty good skin -- I get a few zits here and there if I don&#x27;t use some type of face wash, but my skin is super dry in the winter. After a week of using just the white sponge, my skin is smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as dry. I haven&#x27;t tried the black one, because the instructions said it&#x27;s better for oily skin. But that will be perfect in the summer. If I could just buy the white ones, I probably would do that. But I&#x27;m loving them so far.</li>
    <li> I liked the sponges. They did a good job of exfoliating my face. But I didn&#x27;t notice any big differences in acne or redness.</li>
    <li> Very nice product - had never used one of these before and am very pleased with how my skin feels!</li>
    <li> deteriorates faster then expected</li>
    <li> These are fun! I&#x27;ve used the white one for my face and the charcoal one for my arms in the shower. Both work great and my face doesnt feel dried out or over exfoliated like it has with other sponges I&#x27;ve tried. This would also be a great gift for any age so ill definitely be ordering more to have on hand.</li>
    <li> So these were cool when I used them but I keep forgetting  to hydrate them so I haven&#x27;t  used it twice. They are ok. Nothing wow about them.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face, and it&#x27;s winter so my skin is dry and peeling on my nose. I was hoping these sponges would help with that, and they did! I used the white one, which is gentler. It comes with two sponges, the black one is for more oily skin. They come individually sealed up in plastic and they are hard because they are dry. You just soak them in a bit of warm water and the sponge expands a little and gets, well, spongy. What I did was wash my face and rinse, then massaged it with the wet sponge. When I was done I did a cool water rinse. My skin feels so soft on my face! The sponge wasn&#x27;t scratchy in the least so I wasn&#x27;t worried about it irritating my skin. There isn&#x27;t any peeling skin on my nose anymore. The sponges also have a small string running through them so you can hang them up to dry, which is convenient. I recommend them to anyone who wants to exfoliate in a natural, gentle way.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a relaxing feeling to run these sponges over my face.  I love the white one because it is gentler.  My flaking skin between my eyebrows and above my eyebrows is removed and my whole face is massaged.  My skin looks smoother and well kept.  The charcoal one worked fine too - I did not notice that it was significantly more abrasive, but I still reserve it for a deeper exfoliant.  For future consideration, it would be nice to be able to choose to have 2 white sponges.</li>
    <li> Face Feels refreshed after use</li>
    <li> GREAT SPONGES!&lt;br /&gt;The sponges really do work.  Not only do I use them, so does my family.  The charcoal sponge is great for my teenager who is prone to occasional breakouts; whereas, the white sponge is great for sensitive skin which is used by my younger child. The sponges exfoliates the skin and cleanses the pores; thus, leaving your skin smooth. Would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Boscia konjac facial sponges, so I was excited when I found a company that offered two for less than I was paying for the price of one.  Sadly these just weren&#x27;t as soft and gentle on my sensitive skin as the one I&#x27;m used to.  They work well for the body though!</li>
    <li> great! use with foam cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! It is very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft even without using a cleanser with it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am to add cleanser or not? Directions unclear, or I misunderstood?  But the sponge itself is nice, doesn&#x27;t scratch my face.</li>
    <li> Face feels soft and smoooth after one use.  still have blackheads, but expect good results in this  regard!</li>
    <li> Honestly did not believe they would work. But this is honestly the best thing I have ever used on my face. I love how my face feels after I use it. Cleans and removes excess oil all without chemicals.</li>
    <li> After reading lots of positive reviews about konjac sponges, I thought I would give these a try. I&#x27;ve only had these for a week and have only tried the white sponge but after using everyday for the last week, I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. The sponge does not feel rough against your skin but my skin feels smoother. I think these sponges are great value - I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin that is rough and flaky at times, so I thought this would be ideal for exfoliating. It didn&#x27;t do anything. The sponge is pretty smooth, so it didn&#x27;t really exfoliate and I didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was any different after using it. I don&#x27;t know why this is so highly reviewed when there are better and cheaper options out there.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin soft and silky, I really like these they will make nice gifts.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly and so far I really like sponge. Feels great on my face. I have only started using so will have to review later as to if it works like it should.</li>
    <li> I love my konjac facial sponge that i received it wonderful. It is so simple to use. All you do is wet it really well, and give it a squeeze and it&#x27;s ready to go. The first time you use it, you may need to let it soak a little more to get it ready to use. All you do it rub it on your face wash and  rinse your face off well, and you are done. When you are finished you just hang it up to dry and it is ready for the next use. If you want us can also use a cleanser with the sponge, but you don&#x27;t have too.I love it and look forward to buying more of them soon.</li>
    <li> Works great but the sponge becomes a different texture after several uses. In the beginning it feels great in skin. But it does make my skin squeaky clean and removes every bit of my makeup.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that these sponges are organic and free of any harsh artificial chemicals! They give you two sponges, one white for all Skin types, which is nice you can even use for a baby. The other black, which is a bit rougher and for oily skin. The only complaint is the string that&#x27;s put on the sponge to allow to hang it, it&#x27;s flimsy and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would hold up over repeated use. Overall nice Product well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I think these are a wonderful addition to my cleansing routine , they are a superior made product . They gently remove the dead skin from your face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving it feeling rejuvenated ad refreshed , you get a two pack, one charcoal black &amp; natural white they are perfect for sensitive to oily &amp; acne prone skin. They are 100% natural which is an awesome thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for your daily cleansing routine .</li>
    <li> These little sponges are great for morning and evening cleanings of my face, they leave a clean feeling that makes my skin more radiant and less dull. So far I am impressed with their quality and how they are holding up with frequent everyday use.</li>
    <li> I have used many products before that says it will help my bad skin. To my surprise it actually over the last few days has been helping reduce my little breakouts and made my skin smoother. With acne and bad skin it is very good to exfoliate and this product has done better then ever expected so far. I also don&#x27;t like putting harsh chemicals on my face and this product uses none of them. I am excited to look forward to better skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the sponges my face is never been softer! They really deep clean your whole face.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  This is a must have for your skin care routine.  My skin was left really clean and exceptionally soft and smooth.  I bought 2 sets, one for me and one for my acne prone son.  He swears by the charcoal sponge especially.</li>
    <li> Sponges work great. I was amazed that they actually grew so much, makes skin feel so soft and clean. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with Konjac facial sponges! So easy to use. I really like the fact you can use without soap.  Soaps can be very drying sometimes &amp; this product really seems to clean my face just as well without soaps. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so not using soap for this who do maybe different. Either way, I think anyone would benefit from use of this product!</li>
    <li> This package deal is awesome because it contains the charcoal sponge for oily skin, and the white sponge for regular or sensitive skin. I have combination skin, and some days my skin feels oily while other days it feels dry.  I feel it&#x27;s best to use the white sponge in the morning as part of my routine. And then I use the charcoal sponge for later in the day, when my skin feels oily. Both exfoliate well, and my face definitely feels clean, without feeling excessively dry. Neither sponge feels rough on the skin. I like to hang both sponges on a suction cup hanger on my bathroom mirror for easy access.</li>
    <li> I decided to try these based on so many good reviews.  I have found these are nothing special.  I get more out of a &amp;#34;buf puf&amp;#34; type sponge.  I would not buy these, again.</li>
    <li> Love these facial sponges.  My skin is breakout prone and the black sponge is wonderful.  The sponge comes dry allowing it absorb water allows it to expand.  My skin feels great after using it.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> I really liked these sponges. I use them with my facial soap. I like knowing that they are a real sponge and organic. I would definitely recommend these to everyone to use. Go ahead and purchase them. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great exfoliator and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges!  They are gentle and do as they say they will.  I do clean my face first and then use them...the white one in the a.m. and the black one in the p.m.  Gentle but most effective!!!!  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit. My face is a combination of oily, sensitive, and acne prone, so I undergo a rigorous process to clean my face. My typical remedy for a facial treatment involves creams, moisturizers, toners, etc. with a small soft cotton face towel which I would pack a long. I found that particular method was not as ideal for my face, especially after a week from my destination. My facial cotton towel would smell, and to do laundry at a hotel is like getting an appetizer at a restaurant.    I am always looking for eco-friendly, animal-cruelty/testing free, and harsh chemical free products for my body. I stumbled on konjac sponges when I was looking for Eco-Tools stuff for possible Christmas presents for my friends. I have never heard of konjac sponges before. Once I stumbled on VEGAN sponges, I was sold. I did bought a few varieties for my friends, but I grabbed one for myself to try. The only sponges I am familiar with are sea sponges. Since sea sponges absorb, last and exfoliate well; I figured to give it a try.    I am guilty of buying sea sponges, now that I have these konjac sponges to purchase. My inner-animal loving side of me can be a bit guilt-free. I really love these sponges. Why? No animal ingredients and testing, good for the environment because they biodegrade naturally, no synthetic and harsh chemicals, and packaging is well thought through. Thus, the price is actually a good bargain if you consider these factors. Additionally, you get 2 sponges for a price of 1. Come on! That&#x27;s like a steal!    Now, I do have one or two concerns with these konjac sponges. I use the white konjac when I am in the shower, and the charcoal one when I am doing my daily facial routine. I was kind of expecting these konjac sponges to be similar textures as a loofah or sea sponge. The texture of these konjacs are not as rough. It&#x27;s rather gentle with a mild exfoliating effect. I was hoping for more of like grounded apricot seeds texture, just enough to feel like these sponges are working. I do hope they come out with a body-friendly version of this; in addition to the gentle exfoliation.    All in all, the environmentally-friendly components of these vegan konjac sponges make a perfect gift or addition to your facial routine with its price, environmental benefits, uniqueness, and face-friendly size, are a great compliment for any occasion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the sponge for two weeks but so far I like it.  I&#x27;ve owned a clarisonic mia which died on me recently and didn&#x27;t want to repurchase another one due to cost.  I also own a foreo Luna mini.  I don&#x27;t like it as much as the clarisonic but I like it more than the foreo.  What I like about it is that it&#x27;s a lot more gentle on the face than the mia and it feels nice to use.  It also gets points for being environmentally friendly!  Would probably repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I have not had this product long but so far I really like it.  I just recently heard of the konjac sponge and wanted to try it.  I feel like it deeply cleans my skin.  I also feel it for the price this is a great deal because you get 2 sponges.</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my niece.  I cannot rate it other than the delivery was quick and accurate.  I am sure she will love them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tour guide in NYC and my pores get clogged from all the stuff that&#x27;s flying around in the air--not to mention all the sun screen I use. After just using the Konjac sponge (the charcoal) once, I could already see a huge improvement. Blackheads disappeared completely! Flaky, summer-skin gone! And my skin felt soft and smooth, but not tight and dried out. The sponge is now a part of my daily beauty routine. I&#x27;m super pleased!</li>
    <li> These sponges are really great and have helped my skin tremendously! Helps to get all the pores clear!</li>
    <li> I love the way this sponge has been improving my complexion so much that I convinced my husband that he needed one. The bamboo charcoal infused sponge works best for my blemish prone skin. This will definitely be a repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> These really do seem to make my skin smoother. I feel very clean after using them and they&#x27;re soft enough not to irritate but just rough enough to exfoliate my skin a little. Really like them!</li>
    <li> Exfoliate without irritation. Leaves my skin smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> The white sponge has a great soft texture. Easy to grip, easy to hold on to, and easy to quickly wash my face. After two weeks of 2x a day use, the white sponge is as good as new. I notice improvement in my skin with fewer breakouts, reduced black heads/clogged pores, fewer ingrown hairs. I feel like I haven&#x27;t had a severe pimple since I started using the sponges.  I seem to use less of my face cleanser (Simply Balanced, Coconut cleanser) with this sponge too! So much quicker and cleaner than a regular wash cloth too!   UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now been using the white and black sponges for almost 5 months (the white 2x day and the black 2-4x week) AND they feel brand new. Terrific product. I will be adding these to my bridesmaid gift bags.</li>
    <li> I like these sponges a lot!  Use the black one about 3 times a week and it helps clear up my skin...no cleanser needed!  Pretty cool for something so simple.  This one is also the best value since you get 2 sponges.  I have and will be buying more!</li>
    <li> These are great. I love to use it with my cleanser. Very nice to have on hand. Works great on any skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge only a few days. Already, I can see a noticeable improvement in the softness of my skin. Thus far, I have used the natural sponge in the set. I have fair, sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate my face. I have used it both with plain water and with a gentle soap-free cleanser. At this point, I am using it once each day. I hope that, as time passes, I will see even more results. I love that it is natural and that it is not too abrasive. It is just right. What a great product!</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and well packaged. Great quality product for a great price. Very happy and will be ordering more of these, I found this based off s recommendation from a dermatologist for my large pores on my nose and I am happy so far.</li>
    <li> These sponges are really cool. They make your skin feel very soft and fresh. I use it with the oil as well.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like these, but unfortunately they haven&#x27;t worked out for me. I need something that exfoliates more - these are very, very gentle. However, they&#x27;re great for the little one&#x27;s bathtime... three stars because I bought them for me, not my kiddo.</li>
    <li> Just used this today and my face felt so clean an soft just from one time .❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> So far so good, been using the black sponge and my face looks smoother and it feels great.</li>
    <li> good size to hold and does the job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am in love. Really good, makes your skin glow, soft, and smooth</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Konjac sponges and I&#x27;ve quickly become hooked. They remove a lot more make up than when I use cleanser alone. I&#x27;m using the black sponge on my nose and chin and my blackheads are reducing. They feel fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great to use. I had a little trouble reading the directions on the packaging because they had rubbed off a little. However, my face is smoother and feels softer after using the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this company.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the charcoal sponge. I like it. I have noticed my pores are smaller. And I love that you don&#x27;t have to use soap with the sponge. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Like all the Beauty by Earth products, these sponges are not only as advertised, but better!  The Beauty by Earth products have revamped my evening routine, with great results.  These small sponges work to exfoliate and clean, and are fun to use.  And, of course, they are natural, which is so important to me. I have followed with the Beauty by Earth toner, then use drops of the company&#x27;s Argan Oil along with my nighttime moisturizer. My skin has been glowing.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this..my skin is so much softer after one use. Maybe sell the sponges  separately?</li>
    <li> I love this Konjac sponge. It is thick compare to other konjacs i have used so far.</li>
    <li> These sponges are like my new best friends!  I am NOT kidding!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been this excited about such a cheap purchase in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out using the black sponge because as of now, I&#x27;m pretty pregnant and my skin is being challenged with some breaking out.  The black sponge is sooo gentle and yet when I was done with it, I could tell it really exfoliated because my face was really soft!  I felt it could finally soak up some good moisturizer and that it was cleaned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve used the white sponge in the morning and the black at night.  I know I don&#x27;t need to use them so often but they make my face so happy, and not a lot of things make my body happy these days since it&#x27;s being overtaken by two babies at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying again.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I like both sponges. After washing my face with them, it felt much cleaner. The sponge does a good job exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Was as expected</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works really well and my face has never looked so good at my age!</li>
    <li> Great facial sponge. The packaging is really nice. I like that it is all organic and safe and I feel comfortable using it on my face. I have liked all the Beauty by Earth products that I have tried so far. They are very refreshing and I love pampering myself with them</li>
    <li> As a licensed aesthetician and Panchakarma therapist, I can honestly say these konjac sponges are by far the best. I used to purchase the Boscia sponges (1/$15) for my clients, they are twice as expensive, shorter lifespan and results are just &amp;#34;mediocre&amp;#34;, via client feedback (clients take their sponges home, as part of their treatment). Since purchasing the Beauty by Earth Konjac Sponge, myself and my clients have had nothing but the the absolute best results!!&lt;br /&gt;First, that &amp;#34; ultimate deep clean&amp;#34; feel that everyone desires??....ACHIEVED!! For myself, I only have to use a cream/foam cleanser with this konjac sponge. An exfoliant cleanser isn&#x27;t necessary, as this particular sponge does all the work, and is in no way &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34;. This is a huge plus, as most exfoliant cleansing liquids are actually too over-drying, thus robbing your skin of much needed natural oil. This can actually make the initial problem worse and cause breakouts. The Beauty by Earth Kojac Sponges are gentle enough to be used daily and effective enough to to be used AS the exfoliant. I sent a client home two days ago with this sponge two days ago, who called me today with the best update about the brightness and smoother texture of her neck and face. And I couldn&#x27;t be happier myself, I will never go back to any other brand. I pinned* this product to my &amp;#34;Must Try&amp;#34; products blog of 2015 in hopes others will follow the link and not miss out on this amazing and inexpensive natural sponge.</li>
    <li> these are my new favorite little sponges. I wanted to get something natural because I got tired of those plastic feeling loofas. These are AWESOME, i have had them a month and about to order another 2. they lightly exfoliate and I have definitely seen my skin get better after using these! visible decrease in backne and facial acne. I do recommend using them on their own with no soap to exfoliate then soap up after. I do tend to break out a bit when I use them with soap.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was baffled that it was hard as a rock. I took it in the shower with me and after getting throughly wet it went nice and soft. It has a nice feel on my skin. Buf puf beats the hell out of my skin. This sponge makes me feel like im doing something good for my skin. I use it with one squirt of my organic Desert Essense face cleanser with green tea and sea kelp. Its gentle like the sponge but a thorough clean. Its only 9.00 and you can get it on Amaxon.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to give these a try and since Beauty by Earth had them it was time! Exfoliating my skin has never been more gentle. My skin looks and feels so much better. This is something that will stay in my daily routine because I can see the results.</li>
    <li> I love them so much....already planning on ordering more!</li>
    <li> This is the second order I&#x27;ve placed for the Konjac facial sponges. My daughter uses the black charcoal sponge and I use the white sponge. We have both been very happy with the quality and exfoliating properties of the sponges.</li>
    <li> Wonderful sponge I love it! I had a terrible case of cystic acne my face just went crazy so I decided to go all natural on my skincare. My face was silky soft after the First use and by the 4th day my face was almost completely clear. I got the sponge for the horrible acne but I also noticed that I have zero blackheads now, after only 2 or 3 times of using it. I have Never had that happen Ever my blackheads are Always there no matter what I do! And I seriously cannot even find one. I&#x27;m a true believer lol I know I will never use anything on my face other than the konjac now that I see what it can do!</li>
    <li> These were either too squishy to be effective at exfoliating, or too stiff to actually wash with, depending on the level of saturation. Perhaps there&#x27;s a middle ground, but I didn&#x27;t have the patience to find it.</li>
    <li> LOVE these sponges!!!!</li>
