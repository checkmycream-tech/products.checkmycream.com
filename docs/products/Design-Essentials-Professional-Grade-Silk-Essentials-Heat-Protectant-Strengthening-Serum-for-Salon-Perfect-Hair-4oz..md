    <li> This product smells nice but that&#x27;s it. It has SD Alcohol 40 as the 3rd ingredient. Very drying for relaxed hair which I found out the hard way! Very disappointed. Don&#x27;t use if you have relaxed hair. Would not have purchased had I seen the ingredients list first.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hard to find product for my wife to atone for wasting the original bottle she received from her old hair stylist.  The product was just what I needed to get out of the dog-house.  Now that I know where to find the product I will make sure that future orders are placed with this vendor.</li>
    <li> I love Design Essentials oil products, as well as their Daily Moisturizing lotion. I use them wiith African Pride Olive Oil leave in conditioner. All the products moisturize and helps elongate the hair without perms!</li>

    <li> I ordered this product for my wife, the review are her words.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve found in a long time that actually works on my hair. My only regret was that I should have ordered are larger quantity.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff! In my opinion it works better on freshly washed, dry hair. It&#x27;s a silky smooth liquid that glides on to your hair; I use it prior to flat ironing in addition with a heat protectant. My hair comes out silky and bouncy every time. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Alcohol base product.... The alcohol over powers the serum. Very watery and thin base. It does make the hair feel soft but only for a short period of time</li>
    <li> Love this! Its smells really good and all you need is three drops...rub your hands together and viola!! Its light and adds a nice sheen to your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great for anyone that does not want to weight their hair down with alot of products for a signature look. It is lightweight and gives your hair a great finishing shine.</li>

    <li> This is a great product for one&#x27;s hair. Just a few drops softens as well as silkens the hair, I enjoy using Design Essential products.</li>
    <li> Works great, just rub a drop or two on the palms of your hands and run your hands through your hair and your hair has a shiney sheen to it.  Also if you are playing a gig and want to put some on youe GUITAR neck and it makes the fingers slid across the strings and helps you pick up speed when you are playing your guitar. Just don&#x27;t put any on your hand that holds the pick or you may drop your pick. A great product with two great uses.  Thanks Bill</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for my naturally curly/wavy hair. I use it before I curl my hair on dry hair. Keeps the frizz and puff away.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...it makes a huge difference. It gives your hair a little extra...&amp;#34;uhnnnn&amp;#34;! Brings it back to life....Not greasy at all...it does wonders. I put it on at night...wrap my hair in a finish net scarf and wake up to bouncy hair! I need to add that I have natural hair that I get flat ironed straight...no perm here...best thing I EVER did. This product helps me maintain...I &amp;#34;look like I have a perm&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This is way cheaper than buying it off the actual website. There&#x27;s run for $20. I love this oil. Light and smells good. Nice for course or brittle hair. I can even add some to water in a water bottle to spray on my wet n wavy weave. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
    <li> This is liquid gold!  I let a friend of mine try some and she asked me for a little more just the other day until her order came in.  Just a little goes quite a long way!</li>
    <li> I have soft, dense natural hair and this product enhances the shine and wonderful properties. It can do no wrong! I have used it on relaxed hair as well and still the same result: soft, shiny, hair. I can&#x27;t wait to straighten my hair with this product! I typically use only shea butter but this did wonders!</li>
