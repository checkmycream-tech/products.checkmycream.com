      <li>As a hairstylist and color specialist, I can say this product  along with the other Wen Products are the best ever!</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine hair</li>
      <li>Makes it smooth &amp; shiny &amp; hides any damage.</li>
      <li>Also, great with my granddaughters extra curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product very much, makes my curls in my hair are  nice and bouncy and soft, more body, my hair seems thicker too.</li>
      <li>I like to original WEN product, so I guess I will be ordering it soon.  </li>
      <li>natural - smells lovely and holds a style nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair shiny and healthy looking</li>
      <li>I like the the styling creme, however my hair does not stay full.  </li>
      <li>I have curls and it holds then all day, hair is soft to the touch and easy to care for</li>
      <li>If you color your hair you will love how this helps retain your color-even red which is known for fading DOES NOT FADE!</li>
      <li>This is my first try with Wen products.  </li>
      <li>I have been using WEN products for over a year and my hair is so healthy and less breakage with my baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this now for about a year and really like how it feels and looks!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>and it truly leaves my hair smooth, soft and gives some volume.</li>
      <li>so I could figure out how much is the right amount for my hair</li>
      <li>Also, probably most important, our water ways aren&#x27;t continuing to be polluted, at least I hope they&#x27;re not with WEN Hair Care products.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for about 6 months and really like the way it makes my hair look and feel.  </li>
      <li>the lavender seems to work better than other Wen formulas.  </li>
      <li>Works great on fine thin hair, gives fullness and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
      <li>As long as you only use a dime size amount to massage in your hair , you are  okay.  </li>
      <li>Finally someone, created a product that has natural ingredients (one can pronounce most of the ingredients), doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and you don&#x27;t need 3 extra bottles of stuff</li>
      <li>It made my hair too soft.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair that is color-treated and</li>
      <li>Not the real thing it is different from the regular wen jell I use</li>
      <li>I have used the original formula in the past, but after reading the descriptions of the different formulas, I decided to try this one.  </li>
      <li>that is way too much and weighs down our hair.</li>
      <li>It left my wavy, dry hair soft and touchable.</li>

<li> It left my wavy, dry hair soft and touchable.</li>
<li> Smells fantastic, but didn&#x27;t do much to tame my hair - no more than a cheaper product</li>
<li> After sleeping one night my hair is flat.</li>
<li> I continue to have a problem with a dry itchy scalp yet</li>
<li> I use it before I blow dry my hair</li>
<li> I have really dry hair</li>
<li> You only need a little bit so it lasts me almost a year before I need to buy another nother.</li>
<li> - I use about 2 small pumps ( I have short hair)</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t give me volume, looked flat and dull.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday and it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
<li> so it does give it a little body.</li>
<li> It does take a little while to get used to the lack of lather.</li>
<li> Makes my hair feel heavy...</li>
<li> It has a definate lavender smell, but not overwhelming.</li>
<li> never used this before ,however I do like it, small dollop goes along way too</li>
<li> and I started slowly adding a pump</li>
<li> Even if I use a very small amount ...</li>
<li> , sorry my bad in not reading the entire script on this product.</li>
<li> can&#x27;t go wrong with wen...</li>
<li> My hair looked dirty and oily.  </li>
<li> I like the tingling when shampooing,  but disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the result that the infomercial promises.</li>

    <li> As long as you only use a dime size amount to massage in your hair , you are  okay.  More than that is way too much and weighs down our hair.</li>

    <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with wen...</li>

    <li> My mother loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m not using the shampoo since my hair is chemically straightened but figured I would just try the styling creme. My hair comes out so much better when I use it!! Makes it smooth &amp; shiny &amp; hides any damage.</li>
    <li> I have curls and it holds then all day, hair is soft to the touch and easy to care for</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN products for over a year and my hair is so healthy and less breakage with my baby fine hair.  Turned it on to my sisters and the love it.  Also, great with my granddaughters extra curly hair.  Using it while cleansing their hair made their hair manageable and easier to comb out.  Just love it!!</li>
    <li> WEN IS ALL I HAVE USED FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND MY HAIR IS SILKY AND HAS STOPPED BREAKING AND I AM 65 AND DYE IT REGULARLY...........AMAZING PRODUCT TO USE EXCLUSIVELY FOR ANY HAIR</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years now and love it!! I use it before I blow dry my hair and it truly leaves my hair smooth, soft and gives some volume. You only need a little bit so it lasts me almost a year before I need to buy another nother.</li>

    <li> Its my favorite shampoo.  Works great on fine thin hair, gives fullness and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> This is my first try with Wen products.  It has a definate lavender smell, but not overwhelming. It left my wavy, dry hair soft and touchable. I still had to use a root lifter for volume though.</li>
    <li> Love the smell...does what it says it should do....I have extremely fine hair so it does give it a little body.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I have really dry hair and since I have been using this I can tell a big difference. I use it everyday and it does not weigh my hair down. My curls look nice and not frizzy anymore.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel heavy... Even if I use a very small amount ...</li>
    <li> I have used the original formula in the past, but after reading the descriptions of the different formulas, I decided to try this one.  My hair looked dirty and oily.  I could even feel it in my hair.  Didn&#x27;t give me volume, looked flat and dull.  I like to original WEN product, so I guess I will be ordering it soon.  But I regret wasting my money on this one.</li>
    <li> It made my hair too soft.  I love the cleansing conditioner, but not this styling creme.  Too bad--I had hoped it would work out.</li>
    <li> I use Wen for my hair and I like that this styling product keeps it all natural - smells lovely and holds a style nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair shiny and healthy looking - I use about 2 small pumps ( I have short hair) and I started slowly adding a pump so I could figure out how much is the right amount for my hair - everyone will use a different amount according to hair length.</li>
    <li> I will never use shampoo again!</li>
    <li> I Thought I was buying the shampoo, I don&#x27;t use styling crème on my hair, sorry my bad in not reading the entire script on this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product very much, makes my curls in my hair are  nice and bouncy and soft, more body, my hair seems thicker too.Just try it,it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, but didn&#x27;t do much to tame my hair - no more than a cheaper product does anyway. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love it my hair was dryi gave me morebody</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen Hair Care products now for 4 years; for the most part I am very happy with each product I have used.  I continue to have a problem with a dry itchy scalp yet when using Wen Oil treatment several times a week, it does help alleviate the problem. Finally someone, created a product that has natural ingredients (one can pronounce most of the ingredients), doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and you don&#x27;t need 3 extra bottles of stuff to do obtain basically the same results when the one bottle of WEN Cleansing Conditioner will do the trick. Also, probably most important, our water ways aren&#x27;t continuing to be polluted, at least I hope they&#x27;re not with WEN Hair Care products.</li>
