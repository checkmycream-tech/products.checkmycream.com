### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am happy that the spot is fading</li>
      <li>However I purchased it from Amazon knowing that they are usually great about returns.</li>
      <li>, I have NEVER had great skin.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel I got good customer service.</li>
      <li>The light itself is VERY bright, it took me by surprise.</li>
      <li>This was the first beauty device I&#x27;ve ever used, and one of the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked what the Tanda Luxe did for my skin</li>
      <li>I think the technology is effective.  </li>
      <li>She liked it for the four days it worked before the power supply broke.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the Tanda and will be buying one for my mom this Xmas.</li>
      <li>You can use it once a day, and the results are even more noticeable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that it is a localized reaction.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not.</li>
      <li>You can use it once a day, and the results are even more noticeable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The LightStim device costs much more ($250)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, I think it works, too soon to tell, but I wish I had known upfront that it turns off in three minutes and needs a five minute rest in-between running cycles.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this more than 4 years ago and never had to replace the head yet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK  </li>
      <li>, I would have dropped the rating to 1.  : )</li>
      <li>The LightStim device costs much more ($250)</li>
      <li>I broke the first one I bought ,  which I found effective and reliable .  </li>
      <li>My skin is smoother and the fine wrinkles are diminished.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive fair skin which burns easy</li>
      <li>The light wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
      <li>This one is cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>I have found the warmth from the light to be soothing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;2 years after using my Tanda, I had to buy a replacement head--the lights in the original head had died--and the device won&#x27;t charge anymore</li>
      <li>and I was really excited.  </li>
      <li>I had used red light therapy at a spa and LOVED</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t want to invest too much right away, the Tanda is a fine one to start out with.  </li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t want to invest too much right away, the Tanda is a fine one to start out with.  </li>
      <li>Cool product that&#x27;s neat to use...</li>
      <li>Any time a product wasn&#x27;t tested on pregnant or nursing women they tell you not to use it.</li>
      <li>It also says that you cannot use it if you are pregnant or nursing.</li>
      <li>my skin just looks more healthy overall.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I have been very pleased with the Tanda Luxe &amp; feel it has improved my appearance.</li>
      <li>The device is easy to use and very soothing on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Great little gadget</li>
      <li>am guessing the strength of the light in the Tanda is much lower than the one at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I read the reviews prior to purchase and when the device worked, people liked it.</li>
      <li>Worth the money assuming it does what it says.</li>
      <li>To have total strangers interrupt their conversation and say this was unprecedented for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You have to use it regularly to see results, but it&#x27;s easy to do so, because you can use it while reading or watching TV, just make sure you don&#x27;t come near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But now that I have been using this product on and off for the last couple of years, I can say I love it.</li>
      <li>The first two weeks it work</li>
      <li>I will be upfront and say I wasn&#x27;t consistent in using it, but even without consistency, I did see some benefits and my skin did seem more supple with less fine lines.  </li>
      <li>The instructions mention that if you do too many treatments in a row it can overheat, resulting in beeping, starting and stopping.</li>
      <li>At the first month I used it 2-3 times a week.</li>
      <li>Better than the cheaper brands out there, considering buying the blue one for zit zapping, waaay cheaper than a derm doctor.</li>
      <li>After using this device for one year, I can say unequivocally that it makes a positive difference in my skin quality.  </li>
      <li>Tanda is pricey but it is worth it: such great result for so much less than what a spa would charge for red light therapy treatment.</li>

      <li>In my experience BOTH the Tanda and the LightStim are the real thing and will produce positive results.  </li>
      <li>Together, they seem to increased circulation, soften skin, fine lines, and in my case, even helped with the occasional monthly hormonal blemish/ zit.</li>
      <li>In all, a big waste of a great deal of money.</li>
      <li>I told them I credited the Tanda red light (for wrinkles and skin quality) and the Tanda blue light (which prevents breakouts resulting from moisturizer</li>

      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>I really like this device</li>
      <li>I bought the device for the red light attachment and that has never worked.</li>
      <li>Last month it stopped beeping as it used to as the warning sound every 15 seconds.  </li>
      <li>On rare occasions, the unit has not fully charged and I have had to recharge it, but this is by far the exception and has happened infrequently.</li>
      <li>Light usage only.  </li>
      <li>My whole life I have been fighting breakouts, wrinkles or both.  </li>
      <li>I am VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Rita</li>
      <li>With the Tanda red light therapy, my skin looks more plump, I look like I gained a little weight in my face which is exactly the result I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I use the Tanda more than any other device (I also have a micro-current device and a micro-needling roller).</li>
      <li>Have to fit it flat on any patt you want to do or it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Regardless of the reported efficacy of this device, there are many drawbacks, including malfunction, as I have seen in other reviews.</li>
      <li>Frequently the device did exactly what mine did.</li>
      <li>For example, a few months ago when I was waiting at a department store makeup counter, the customer who was currently being assisted interrupted her conversation with the clerk and said she noticed I had good skin, what did I use?  </li>
      <li>It also states that you shouldn&#x27;t use if you are pregnant, nursing or have had migraines in the last two years.</li>

      <li>If you can only afford the Tanda, or if this is your first time using a red light device</li>
      <li>Given the high price tag, I would not recommend this device.</li>
      <li>choosing a red light device, one of my concerns was selecting one that contained the right kind/wavelength of lights and not just a cheap imitation with red Christmas tree lights, you know?  </li>
      <li>choosing a red light device, one of my concerns was selecting one that contained the right kind/wavelength of lights and not just a cheap imitation with red Christmas tree lights, you know?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am genuinely surprised at the reviews of 3 stars or less and thought that I needed to put in my 2 cents :)</li>
      <li>What this cool little device does is utilize red led light combined with a warming massage feature.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this to anybody wanting to give their aging skin a nice little boost.</li>
      <li>But I believe that you always have to try new things in life..</li>
      <li>The fact that the only thing that changed in my beauty regimen was to stop the red light proved to me</li>
      <li>(Previously I was able to use it for multiple areas and for a couple days without charging it).  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, the Tanda Clear (blue light device) which I got around the same time is still going strong, and I&#x27;ve used it twice daily for the same time frame.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and so far the Tanda has not triggered any.</li>
      <li>This was actually one of the things I disliked most in the Tanda.  </li>

      <li>First I wash my face, dry it, and then use the machine all over my face.</li>
      <li>If you feel that light therapy is still for you, there are other brands out there that cost considerably less, and come with three different color light heads (red for wrinkles, blue for acne, and green for discoloration), which are a much, much better bargain.</li>
      <li>treatment sessions, one right after the other and have had no problems.</li>
      <li>I sent the device back to Tanda and supposedly got a new one but</li>
      <li>I bought this in another country at a pharmacy for about $125 at the time and the currency is worth less than usd.</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;new\\&quot; one has the same problem as the old.</li>
      <li>Make sure its firmly in base and the light is on for charging.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had used red light therapy at a spa and LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;It healed wounds and reduced wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;The Tanda has done nothing to help me.&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing the strength of the light in the Tanda is much lower than the one at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
    <li> One Tanda Luxe does not work despite having carried out the instructions for proper use (charge 24 hours before use)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK  But it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations...I&#x27;ll continue using it ...But I believe that you always have to try new things in life..</li>
    <li> works very well for me  I can already see a difference on my skin  it is healthier and softner since I use the Tanda Luxe.</li>
    <li> Cool product that&#x27;s neat to use... I can&#x27;t say anything about results yet... Stand by. Worth the money assuming it does what it says.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I think it works, too soon to tell, but I wish I had known upfront that it turns off in three minutes and needs a five minute rest in-between running cycles.  I may have gone for a different hand held unit.</li>
    <li> I broke the first one I bought ,  which I found effective and reliable .  This is the second and the same, but it fell apart the second time I used it.  No qjality control here.  I think the technology is effective.  I would like to find another manufacturer  This one is cheaply made.  Poo!</li>
    <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
    <li> My device did not light up when recharging, and I could not tell if it was functioning correctly. They also don&#x27;t advertise that you cannot use this device if you have had a migraine in the last two years. That is something I found out AFTER opening the package. It also says that you cannot use it if you are pregnant or nursing. Regardless of the reported efficacy of this device, there are many drawbacks, including malfunction, as I have seen in other reviews. Given the high price tag, I would not recommend this device. If you feel that light therapy is still for you, there are other brands out there that cost considerably less, and come with three different color light heads (red for wrinkles, blue for acne, and green for discoloration), which are a much, much better bargain.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have only used it a couple of weeks but I think it is fading an age spot that I have had on my forehead that has been bothering me. I put it on it everyday. It turns off after 3 minutes like it says it will in the instructions. I usually just treat for the 3 minutes twice a day when I have my makeup off. Lately I have just turned it back on and continued to treat. I read some reviews where people said it burnt out but maybe they are trying to keep it on too long, I don&#x27;t know. It can take 12 weeks for a person&#x27;s collagen to start to grow so I am just trying to be patient. I am happy that the spot is fading and I think my skin is improving too. I use it around the eyes, underneath. I will continue to use it and see my results at 12 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was skeptical at first, thinking I had spent way too much money on this device. But now that I have been using this product on and off for the last couple of years, I can say I love it. I am in my late 30&#x27;s, and the skin on my face tends to be thin and is now getting fine lines. With the Tanda red light therapy, my skin looks more plump, I look like I gained a little weight in my face which is exactly the result I was looking for. My skin is also smoother and a bit firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it regularly to see results, but it&#x27;s easy to do so, because you can use it while reading or watching TV, just make sure you don&#x27;t come near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 years after using my Tanda, I had to buy a replacement head--the lights in the original head had died--and the device won&#x27;t charge anymore so I have to keep it plugged to keep it working. But, that&#x27;s after a couple of years of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tanda is pricey but it is worth it: such great result for so much less than what a spa would charge for red light therapy treatment. I definitely recommend this to anybody wanting to give their aging skin a nice little boost.</li>
    <li> I purchased a tanda kuxe previously to this one, it lasted a long time, when it burned out I purchased another one in March.  Needless to say I used it 12 to 18 times and it didn&#x27;t work anymore. I contacted their customer service and never received a reply back, totally ignored me. I would not purchase their product again. Their customer service department should be replaced with people who care about how their company is represented.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
    <li> I bought the Tanda Luxe Skin Rejuv device 7 months ago.  I will be upfront and say I wasn&#x27;t consistent in using it, but even without consistency, I did see some benefits and my skin did seem more supple with less fine lines.  I would give it 4-5 stars for it&#x27;s effectiveness.  I am giving it 3 stars instead for it&#x27;s bad battery life.  I moved cross country and didn&#x27;t use it for about 3 months.  When I plugged it in and used it I noticed it no longer held a charge.  It would work for one cycle and then turn off, beeping that it needed charging.  (Previously I was able to use it for multiple areas and for a couple days without charging it).  I have not yet tried to contact the customer service department, but from what I have read it sounds like it would be a fruitless endeavor anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 3 stars since it DID seem to work, but the battery life is pretty poor.  Also, I DIDN\\&quot;T call customer service and so I didn&#x27;t get an extremely disappointing/rude response.  Had I had a negative interaction with them, like others have, I would have dropped the rating to 1.  : )</li>
    <li> When I bought the Tanda the blue LED attachment worked and continues to do so. But I don&#x27;t need it and don&#x27;t use it. I bought the device for the red light attachment and that has never worked. I sent the device back to Tanda and supposedly got a new one but the \\&quot;new\\&quot; one has the same problem as the old. I didn&#x27;t feel I got good customer service. In all, a big waste of a great deal of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this device about 2 months ago and have been using it on a regular basis since.  It really works.  I have noticed a definite reduction in wrinkles and my skin just looks more healthy overall.  The device is easy to use and very soothing on your skin.  Its like a spa treatment at home!</li>
    <li> It does not work half the time. I push the on button, it turns green, put it to my face, and nothing. So I have to turn it off and start over two or three times before it works. Have used it for a couple of months and haven&#x27;t noticed any change whatsoever</li>
    <li> After using this device for one year, I can say unequivocally that it makes a positive difference in my skin quality.  My skin is smoother and the fine wrinkles are diminished.  I have gotten feedback from strangers.  For example, a few months ago when I was waiting at a department store makeup counter, the customer who was currently being assisted interrupted her conversation with the clerk and said she noticed I had good skin, what did I use?  The clerk then admitted she noticed it too.  Mind you, I have NEVER had great skin.  My whole life I have been fighting breakouts, wrinkles or both.  To have total strangers interrupt their conversation and say this was unprecedented for me.  I told them I credited the Tanda red light (for wrinkles and skin quality) and the Tanda blue light (which prevents breakouts resulting from moisturizer use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of times over the last year I traveled for a week and decided not to pack the Tanda Luxe.  I continued to use my other beauty creams as usual, but the fine lines, dry skin and even susceptibility to breakouts returned.  The fact that the only thing that changed in my beauty regimen was to stop the red light proved to me what a difference it was making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am genuinely surprised at the reviews of 3 stars or less and thought that I needed to put in my 2 cents :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JANUARY 27, 2016:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Tanda Luxe has stopped functioning properly.  It now turns itself off after only about half of the cycle has completed, and when I try to turn it back on again it shuts off again within a few seconds.  I had used it only twice a week, just as directed, so I&#x27;m disappointed to have it konk out on me like this.  On the other hand, the Tanda Clear (blue light device) which I got around the same time is still going strong, and I&#x27;ve used it twice daily for the same time frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked what the Tanda Luxe did for my skin so I considered replacing it, but decided instead to go with the LightStim.  The LightStim device costs much more ($250) but I must say I prefer it to the Tanda for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You can use it once a day, and the results are even more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;2) The LightStim isn&#x27;t cordless like the Tanda.  It has a cord and therefore you do not have to worry about the battery going bad.  In other words, there&#x27;s less to go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;3) The LightStim doesn&#x27;t feature needless noise and vibration (in my opinion vibration cannot eliminate wrinkles; it&#x27;s just an unnecessary feature.)&lt;br /&gt;4) You do not have to press the LightStim against your face in order to get it to turn on.  This was actually one of the things I disliked most in the Tanda.  I am prone to breakout and do not like to touch my face with anything.&lt;br /&gt;5) The LightStim has a larger surface area of red lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When choosing a red light device, one of my concerns was selecting one that contained the right kind/wavelength of lights and not just a cheap imitation with red Christmas tree lights, you know?  In my experience BOTH the Tanda and the LightStim are the real thing and will produce positive results.  If you can only afford the Tanda, or if this is your first time using a red light device and you don&#x27;t want to invest too much right away, the Tanda is a fine one to start out with.  I&#x27;m happier with my LightStim, though.im.

    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results since it broke after a couple months of use. Charge didn&#x27;t last long either. Have to fit it flat on any patt you want to do or it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I decided to write this review because I was shocked by the number of low ratings. I received the Tanda Luxe Rejuvenation device last year as a Christmas present. I have used it at least twice a week since then &amp; have noticed a dramatic improvement in the appearance of my skin. My pores seem to be smaller, there is less discoloration (I suffer from Melasma), lines have been reduced in size and my skin looks tighter. People have often commented on the smoothness of my skin and my mother has tried the device &amp; requested one for herself. I use the Tanda more than any other device (I also have a micro-current device and a micro-needling roller). I have found the warmth from the light to be soothing. On rare occasions, the unit has not fully charged and I have had to recharge it, but this is by far the exception and has happened infrequently. Overall, I have been very pleased with the Tanda Luxe &amp; feel it has improved my appearance.</li>
    <li> I am in my early thirties and am starting to get crow&#x27;s feet, larger pores and uneven skin tone. I have used this product just twice and my skin is smoother, the tone is even and my pores seem smaller. I have had none of the problems with it stopping and starting that others have mentioned. The instructions mention that if you do too many treatments in a row it can overheat, resulting in beeping, starting and stopping. They suggest you wait 10 min. before trying again. The treatments are timed to shut off after 3 min. I do four, three min. treatment sessions, one right after the other and have had no problems. The light itself is VERY bright, it took me by surprise. It&#x27;s sort of like staring into the sun even with the goggles on and your eyes closed, but the product website states that there is no risk of damage to eyesight. It also states that you shouldn&#x27;t use if you are pregnant, nursing or have had migraines in the last two years. I get migraines monthly and so far the Tanda has not triggered any. I am also nursing and not concerned about it. I&#x27;m sure that it is a localized reaction. Any time a product wasn&#x27;t tested on pregnant or nursing women they tell you not to use it. But again it&#x27;s a local external product. I can&#x27;t see how it could affect pregnancy or nursing. I&#x27;m really pleased with the Tanda and will be buying one for my mom this Xmas.</li>
    <li> This was the first beauty device I&#x27;ve ever used, and one of the best. Don&#x27;t expect miracles. What this cool little device does is utilize red led light combined with a warming massage feature. Together, they seem to increased circulation, soften skin, fine lines, and in my case, even helped with the occasional monthly hormonal blemish/ zit. I use mine with a very specific skincare line of products and together they work extremely well.</li>
    <li> I am using this machine twice weekly at night. First I wash my face, dry it, and then use the machine all over my face. After that toner and apply my night cream. I also exfoliate my face at least one time weekly but not in the same day. I really like this device and I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget but unfortunately it arrived with no goggles and I purchased this product in June and it has stopped working so I think I need a replacement head piece.</li>
    <li> I purchased this more than 4 years ago and never had to replace the head yet. Make sure its firmly in base and the light is on for charging. I noticed benefits 3 days into use, they recommend you use it daily I think for a week, then once a week. I noticed after 3-4 weeks of not doing it the effects wore off. It helps to boost collagen to firm so skin is less saggy and helps wrinkles. Amazon is a bit expensive I bought this in another country at a pharmacy for about $125 at the time and the currency is worth less than usd. I have sensitive fair skin which burns easy and this did not dry or cause problems. Better than the cheaper brands out there, considering buying the blue one for zit zapping, waaay cheaper than a derm doctor.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I purchased this as a gift for my mother. She liked it for the four days it worked before the power supply broke. By the time she told me this, the product is not eligible for return as I am three weeks past the return date. I read the reviews prior to purchase and when the device worked, people liked it. Frequently the device did exactly what mine did. However I purchased it from Amazon knowing that they are usually great about returns. I am VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Rita&lt;br /&gt;San Diego</li>
    <li> Got the device 4/24/2013 and now it&#x27;s dead. Light usage only.  At the first month I used it 2-3 times a week. Later 3-4 times a month. Last month it stopped beeping as it used to as the warning sound every 15 seconds.  Today, when I put it on the charger, it&#x27;s not charging at all. $2 cost per usage over its life.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift.  The first two weeks it work and I was really excited.  Then it stopped working.  The light wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I returned it.  It is unfortunate since it was recommended by The Doctors.</li>
