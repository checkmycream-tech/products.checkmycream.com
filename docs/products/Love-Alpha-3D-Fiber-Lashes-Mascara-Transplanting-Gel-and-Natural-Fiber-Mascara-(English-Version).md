<li> It actually works and has made my lashes amazingly long!</li>
<li> I wish they had it in other colors than only black.</li>
<li> looks so natural, not as obvious as fake lashes but definitely makes the eyes pop</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t see a change in eyelash length, so it&#x27;s really not what I expected.</li>
<li> The first mascara had a thin and wiry bristle brush that was all deformed and appeared to be missing about 80% of the hard and spiky bristles.</li>
<li> If I could give this less than a star I would.</li>
<li> I just started using this product and I wear contacts and the little fibers were in my eye.</li>
<li> They all go one a little uneven and the fiber does end up on  your face.</li>
<li> This gloopy, messy mascara came with two formulas.</li>
<li> First time buy an was shocked how it worked</li>
<li> This item was nothino like the description because the mascara arrived all dried up!</li>
<li> I have learned all fiber duo mascaras are awkward.</li>
<li> This stuff is horrible.</li>

    <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> Works great for the price!</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and the product works wonderful!!</li>
    <li> It flakes off easily.  The length of your lashes is wonderful, it can be clumpy.  On lengthening alone i would give ut a 4.</li>
    <li> My regular mascara works better!</li>
    <li> Product falls off when blinking.</li>
    <li> Good product great price.</li>
    <li> If I could give this less than a star I would. This gloopy, messy mascara came with two formulas. The first mascara had a thin and wiry bristle brush that was all deformed and appeared to be missing about 80% of the hard and spiky bristles. The second formula used a pipe cleaner like brush to apply the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34;, which fell all over my face immediately after application. This stuff is horrible. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Looks nice when first applied but feathers off thru out the day.</li>
    <li> First time buy an was shocked how it worked but I love it</li>

    <li> looks so natural, not as obvious as fake lashes but definitely makes the eyes pop</li>
    <li> I have used this and purchased unique 3d mascara and truly can&#x27;t tell a difference . I can promise I will never pay $30 for mascara again!</li>

    <li> I just started using this product and I wear contacts and the little fibers were in my eye. I don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This item was nothino like the description because the mascara arrived all dried up! very dissatisfied with the product.  This should not be happening</li>
    <li> This 3D mascara is amazing!! It actually works and has made my lashes amazingly long! Make sure to read the application directions to get the correct results.</li>
    <li> not worth buying in my own opinion fibers do not stay and constantly are flaking off</li>
    <li> I have learned all fiber duo mascaras are awkward. They all go one a little uneven and the fiber does end up on  your face. However, this mascara alone was worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and it&#x27;s my favorite mascara ever! Never dries out. I wish they had it in other colors than only black.</li>
