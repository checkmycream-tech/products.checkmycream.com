    <li> Love this product - works great! I purchased two packs of five - they were shrinkwraped.  Gave them away for Christmas gifts.  I gave myself some too and found that there was very little inside the tub - yes I know it&#x27;s suppose to be small but less than an inch is a little ridiculous.  If only Hawaiian Tropic would pay attention to its customers and make this in a size for human size users - This should be listed under sample size.</li>
    <li> Tiny containers! Not worth the price. 2/5 containers not full, jars also not sealed.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a zero I would. Containers are tiny and only partially filled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people cry these are 1 ounce jars, the AD clearly states that and.... you cant get the 8 ounce jars anymore. My friend loves this stuff but couldn&#x27;t find more, when I found these they were very happy to get 5 travel, (or beach) size jars of this.  After trying it I kidnapped a couple (my girlfriend had to have one) and had to order more.... odds are when these are gone there will be no more.  .</li>
    <li> These are 5 miniature (1 oz) containers of the product Hawaiian Tropic took off the market.  This is the real thing.  Original container from Hawaiian Tropic was 9 oz.  I love this stuff.  It absorbs into the skin very well.  It is not greasy at all and I have found when used regularly that it prevents peeling.  I love this stuff and was so happy to find it - even if it was a little more expensive.  Was shipped promptly.  I had it in a matter of days.</li>
    <li> Horrible experience , DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM unless you want 5 incredibly small lotions, 1/3rd filled. Not worth the price, high shipping rate, this was waste of time and money. If i had a way to upload a picture i would show you all. Terrible!!! Would give 0 stars but amazon doesnt let me!</li>
    <li> great product, smells very tropical,  jars are smaller than I expected.  Good for caring in purse or beach bag.  They are more travel size</li>
    <li> This is a great product but the jars are ONLY HALF FULL.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than anticipated!!!!</li>
    <li> mostly filled with air pockets, feels good at first but after a minute it dries out, containers are puny and would not buy this again</li>
    <li> Containers much too small!!!</li>
    <li> Thought they would be bigger....wanted the product in laeger jars...</li>
    <li> It was the same cream I love just in itsy bitsy jars. so its no bargain.</li>
    <li> Cute, small sample sizes.. perfect for gift baskets</li>
    <li> Brutal. Says it&#x27;s 9.9 oz size then you recieve 1/3 full sample sizes. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is silky smooth</li>
    <li> Wish u could buy it in the big jar but this works just fine</li>
    <li> Great stuff wish I could larger jar</li>
    <li> What a joke....don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
    <li> I really wish we could get these in bigger amounts!  These little jars are just a tease!  This is a wonderful product.</li>
