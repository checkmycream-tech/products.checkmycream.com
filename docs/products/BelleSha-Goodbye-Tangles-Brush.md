      <li>Children will especially love it when their hair isn’t being pulled by a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is the best made brush I have ever seen, and I don&#x27;t think it does a great job on hair.</li>

      <li>The bristles, with or without the balls, didn&#x27;t do their job well, as there was discomfort experienced from them.  </li>
      <li>No Tangles Brush is good quality and works well.</li>
      <li>and they both agree that this is a good choice.</li>

      <li>/&gt;BelleSha makes another brush that is much better constructed.  </li>
      <li>What more does a brush need to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Before it fell apart, I was liking it better than my Goody brand brush.  </li>
      <li>I got this for free as part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nylon bristles are actually supposed to be perfect for detangling hair as they glide through the hair.  </li>
      <li>It painlessly removed my tangles from sleeping, but caused so much static electricity I had to spray it with Static Guard.</li>
      <li>I say it did okay with my hair, but did pull some, but did take the tangles out.</li>
      <li>I had a paddle brush years ago, and I am glad I saw this brush</li>
      <li>It seemed to work better on my hair, remember it is not as curly as my granddaughters.</li>
      <li>Her experience with another brush from this manufacturer was vastly better ([[ASIN:B00GBMTX4</li>

      <li>It is a nice large size and easy gets rid of tangles.</li>

      <li>I was contacted by a rep for BellaSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid plastic handle and frame, in a sing piece design.  </li>
      <li>This BelleSha Smooth Silky Glowing Hair</li>
      <li>The beads on the bristles are smooth and don&#x27;t damage of rip out my hair.</li>
      <li>Overall very nice brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a brush that ran through my hair so quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say it does a great job helping to detangle by long wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>Both me and my daughter used this and great for long hair.</li>
      <li>You can push it in much more gently.</li>
      <li>This Brush from BelleSha is very nice and will easier help you detangle rough spots within your hair.</li>
      <li>It was definitely nice and not rough.</li>
      <li>This BelleSha no-tangle brush is very lightweight and easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>This is great to get out the knots or helps blow dry my hair straight.</li>
      <li>(My hair is fine and just a bit wavy (not curly, not quite straight).  </li>
      <li>For added comfort, the bristles are mounted to a flexible membrane, which allows them to contour to the the head better than a brush with fixed position</li>
      <li>still screamed a couple of times while she brushed her own hair, but not lots of times.</li>
      <li>received a complimentary sample of the brush to test for my review.</li>
      <li>used the brush on my hair right after I showered</li>
      <li>When I press in the center of the brush, the bristles flex and move with the motion, making it perfect for detangling long hair.  </li>
      <li>I don’t have long hair, but by brushing it separates the hair strands, fluffing them up quite nicely.  </li>
      <li>The brush Gentle nylon bristles have a large surface area to help maintain a smooth brushing motion while using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a flat paddle brush and is quite comfortable and easy to grasp.  </li>
      <li>My wife didn&#x27;t care for this No Tangles Brush from BelleSha as much as she liked the larger paddle brush.</li>
      <li>She also mentioned it also looked better, if you worry about such things in a brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I first saw this brush</li>
      <li>She went first.</li>
      <li>I am glad I have this product and would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Broke the first time using it.</li>
      <li>So she gave this brush to our ten year-old-daughter who isn&#x27;t as picky and liked getting a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>no tangles brush did work okay on my hair after it was dry and</li>
      <li>One of the nicest things about the brush is, it works well if wanting my hair to be worn wavy of straight.</li>
      <li>friend absolutely loves the brush.</li>
      <li>Gentle nylon bristles which will not damage the hair</li>
      <li>Purchased this brush through a promotion, and I would have to say, it works very well with me hair.  </li>
      <li>This BelleSha no tangles brush is lightweight but very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a basic brush, but nothing really special about it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this brush is primarily for detangling long hair I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it for all type of hair.  </li>
      <li>The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!)</li>
      <li>However, after several brushes the little blue tips were falling out, now that cannot be a good thing.</li>
      <li>I have fine, slightly wavy hair.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter spends time with me and one of the hardest parts for her is having her long, fine hair brushed.</li>
      <li>From what I can tell the bristles used on each brush are almost exactly the same, but with that said on my wife&#x27;s much longer hair she had a definite preference for the the BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet [[ASIN:B00GBMTX4</li>
      <li>A sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised at the size of it.</li>
      <li>She especially didn&#x27;t care for the handle as much.</li>
      <li>Nylon bristle are really soft with light green beads.</li>
      <li>I shave my head daily with a razor, so I have no need of a brush, but I&#x27;ve got a female friend with near waist length, super thick hair, who I knew would make a good test subject, so</li>
      <li>I have long waist length straight hair</li>
      <li>This is as cheap as cheap can be:  Thin, dull black, scratches and scuffs so easily; has no padding on the handle and definitely NOT ergonomic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush is of simple single-piece plastic construction; it may be durable, but its flat, hard handle is not the most comfortable handle to hold while brushing thick hair.</li>
      <li>Within a few strokes, I noted that some of the little balls at the tip of the bristles had come off, and this continued the more the brush was used.  </li>
      <li>Decided to test this brush with a nine year old who has very long hair.  </li>
      <li>A little too large</li>
      <li>I understand that there will be some wear on an item of the type, but less that one full head brushing seems pretty poor quality to me.  </li>

<li> While it was obvious solid, the brush felt insubstantial compared to ones with round handles.  </li>
<li> Our daughter has long, thick hair that flows about half-way down her back, and is always looking out for a decent brush.</li>
<li> The entire bed of bristles is slightly rounded with the side and end bristle splaying out slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> When I got the brush back, a total of four uses (two wet, two dry), about half of those little nibs were gone.  </li>
<li> keep my hair quite short, which leaves little need for a brush.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the rubber  part that holds the bristles ,  will come off ,&amp;#34;lite brushing only&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Broke the first time using it.</li>
    <li> Bellesha hair brush is  9x3&amp;#34; in size.Nylon bristle are really soft with light green beads.I have long waist length straight hair and my husband has curly hair.It glides easily through my hair as well as my husband&#x27;s.Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair while detangling it.Grip is proper.The only reason I gave it 4 star is because of it&#x27;s finishing.There are few scuffs on the back of the brush.I got this for free as part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This BelleSha no tangles brush is lightweight but very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush on my hair right after I showered so it was wet and tangled. I was not impressed with the brush&#x27;s detangling abilities. It pulled my hair and didn&#x27;t get the tangles out. It also lost about a quarter of the little balls off the ends of the bristles. I will say that I have LOTS of thick, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...I had received another BelleSha brush for review [[ASIN:B00GBMTX4K BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet]] and it worked great. I reviewed it separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This no tangles brush did work okay on my hair after it was dry and detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This brush is of simple single-piece plastic construction; it may be durable, but its flat, hard handle is not the most comfortable handle to hold while brushing thick hair. Our daughter has long, thick hair that flows about half-way down her back, and is always looking out for a decent brush. This brush just was not very comfortable for her to use, and she probably would not recommend this brush to others with thick hair that needs regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon sales listing does not mention any warranty information, and neither does the simple zip-loc style bag that the brush was delivered in. If an issue arises with the brush, I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this brush gratis from the manufacturer and our daughter put it through its paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a hair brush of this size, style and construction, for use as described above, then our daughter would recommend that you give others a try before this one. Her experience with another brush from this manufacturer was vastly better ([[ASIN:B00GBMTX4K BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet]])</li>
    <li> I shave my head daily with a razor, so I have no need of a brush, but I&#x27;ve got a female friend with near waist length, super thick hair, who I knew would make a good test subject, so I accepted the offer to review the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend absolutely loves the brush. She said it&#x27;s one of the few she&#x27;s used that doesn&#x27;t get stuck and pull out hair. What more does a brush need to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed another BellaSha brush that had an initial bad odor, and gave that one four stars. This brush performs as well and is nearly identical in shape and size, but didn&#x27;t have the chemical odor of the other brush, thereby earning five stars.</li>
    <li> This Brush from BelleSha is very nice and will easier help you detangle rough spots within your hair. The brush Gentle nylon bristles have a large surface area to help maintain a smooth brushing motion while using it. I am glad I have this product and would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.</li>
    <li> Purchased this brush through a promotion, and I would have to say, it works very well with me hair.  I had a paddle brush years ago, and I am glad I saw this brush and I have to say it does a great job helping to detangle by long wavy hair.  The bristles don&#x27;t hurt my head.  One of the nicest things about the brush is, it works well if wanting my hair to be worn wavy of straight.</li>
    <li> Both me and my daughter used this and great for long hair. It was definitely nice and not rough. Bristles were nice and rigid. Overall very nice brush. The grip was good and easy to handhold. Sample provided.</li>
    <li> I have fine, slightly wavy hair. It painlessly removed my tangles from sleeping, but caused so much static electricity I had to spray it with Static Guard. Very cheap, dollar store quality brush. A little too large so it feels awkward to use. Not impressed. ~~~~item received at no charge for my review~~~~</li>
    <li> My granddaughter spends time with me and one of the hardest parts for her is having her long, fine hair brushed. She screams! What is funny is that she screams when she brushes her own hair. A sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she saw this, we explored it and compared it to her current brush which is similar in nature. These have shorter bristles (could be a problem) and the plastic in the center where they rest is a lot softer. You can push it in much more gently. And it is wider and flatter than the brush she was using. Still the handle was small enough to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She still screamed a couple of times while she brushed her own hair, but not lots of times. And when I checked her hair, all of the tangles were gone. So I&#x27;m keeping THIS brush on hand for her to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed others mentioning the white spots coming off. I examined the brush both before and after, and all were intact. Of course, we were brushing dry hair with a moderate amount of tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of the brush to test for my review.</li>
    <li> This BelleSha no-tangle brush is very lightweight and easy to handle.  The beads on the tips of the bristles help separate the hair quite nicely.  I don’t have long hair, but by brushing it separates the hair strands, fluffing them up quite nicely.  It also feels as if my scalp is being lightly massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nylon bristles are actually supposed to be perfect for detangling hair as they glide through the hair.  The entire bed of bristles is slightly rounded with the side and end bristle splaying out slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a flat paddle brush and is quite comfortable and easy to grasp.  There’s also a hole in the end for your convenience should you decide to hang it up.  When I press in the center of the brush, the bristles flex and move with the motion, making it perfect for detangling long hair.  Children will especially love it when their hair isn’t being pulled by a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Gentle nylon bristles which will not damage the hair&lt;br /&gt;►  Easily detangles hair&lt;br /&gt;►  Brush size: 9” x 3”&lt;br /&gt;►  Nylon beads may vary in color&lt;br /&gt;►  Weight:  2.9 ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this brush is primarily for detangling long hair I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it for all type of hair.  The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!) or to just have on hand when the hair gets slightly windblown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This review compares two very similar brushes from BelleSha, this one and the BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet [[ASIN:B00GBMTX4K BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are well made and both worked perfectly on my short hair.  From what I can tell the bristles used on each brush are almost exactly the same, but with that said on my wife&#x27;s much longer hair she had a definite preference for the the BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet [[ASIN:B00GBMTX4K BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet]] saying it did just as good of a job untangling her hair and felt much better and more substantial in her hand.  She also mentioned it also looked better, if you worry about such things in a brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with either, it would just depend if you like the fuller handle and extra weight of the BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet [[ASIN:B00GBMTX4K BelleSha Paddle Brush Violet]] or the smaller handle and lighter feel of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample product for the purposes of doing a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t care for this No Tangles Brush from BelleSha as much as she liked the larger paddle brush. She especially didn&#x27;t care for the handle as much. So she gave this brush to our ten year-old-daughter who isn&#x27;t as picky and liked getting a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were provided this brush to review, and my wife gives it 3.5 stars, where she gave the other BelleSha brush 5 stars. Our daughter&#x27;s hair is long, but not as thick as my wife&#x27;s, so the brush works well for her. It&#x27;s a basic brush, but nothing really special about it. Again, it does a good job and our daughter likes it better than my wife did.</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a brush that can take my abuse. But this brush is a keeper. It is a nice large size and easy gets rid of tangles. The beads on the bristles are smooth and don&#x27;t damage of rip out my hair. I start on the ends of my hair and do small brush-strokes up to the roots. I don&#x27;t expect any brush to de-tangle my hair in one stroke, that would be ridiculous. The plastic pad that the bristle are in is very strong (I have ripped other out with my hair before). I&#x27;m so glad I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is great to get out the knots or helps blow dry my hair straight.</li>
    <li> I received this product for an honest review and here it is.  When I first saw this brush I was surprised at the size of it. I decided to use it on my hair and my granddaughters. I wanted to try it on both as mine is shorter and hers is quite long and curly. She went first. I found that the brush did not seem to want to work through her hair, she did a lot of complaining that I was pulling too hard. I got very few tangles out of her hair, and that was with a lot of complaining. Now it was my turn. It seemed to work better on my hair, remember it is not as curly as my granddaughters. However, after several brushes the little blue tips were falling out, now that cannot be a good thing. I say it did okay with my hair, but did pull some, but did take the tangles out. I don&#x27;t think it is the best made brush I have ever seen, and I don&#x27;t think it does a great job on hair. I&#x27;d rate it as one of those so-so products depending on the type of hair you have and the length.</li>
    <li> Decided to test this brush with a nine year old who has very long hair.  His hair is both thick and LONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was able to go through the tangles and curls....to give him what he said was a painless brush job.  It worked well even after he washed his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be made to last unlike discount brushes that are just mounted on hard plastic...this one has give to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BellaSha sent me this to test and review.</li>
    <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BellaSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid plastic handle and frame, in a sing piece design.  The bristles are tipped with little balls, as usual, for comfort on the scalp.  For added comfort, the bristles are mounted to a flexible membrane, which allows them to contour to the the head better than a brush with fixed position bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair quite short, which leaves little need for a brush.  But I do have a couple of lady friends who let me try it out on them, as well as try the brush itself.  For me, I found that the thin flat handle was uncomfortable for holding and brushing.  The edges wanted to dig into my hands.  Within a few strokes, I noted that some of the little balls at the tip of the bristles had come off, and this continued the more the brush was used.  I understand that there will be some wear on an item of the type, but less that one full head brushing seems pretty poor quality to me.  The feedback from the ladies was similar to what I&#x27;d found.  While it was obvious solid, the brush felt insubstantial compared to ones with round handles.  The bristles, with or without the balls, didn&#x27;t do their job well, as there was discomfort experienced from them.  When I got the brush back, a total of four uses (two wet, two dry), about half of those little nibs were gone.  When told the price, the girls were less than enthused.  &amp;#34;For that?  No way!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d agree with that, having scouted the local stores for similar.  On the plus side, it does make a good wallop on one&#x27;s backside.</li>
    <li> After using this brush for a week, it was already pulling apart where the pillowed rubber tucks under the hard plastic handle.  It was glued in place and there is very little that tucks under the lip of the hard plastic base.  I gave a pull--not a hard pull--and the whole brush head came out of the base!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is unfortunate, because I love how it untangles my medium-length hair.  I&#x27;ve never had a brush that ran through my hair so quickly and easily.  (My hair is fine and just a bit wavy (not curly, not quite straight).  I also love the slightly padded base that holds the bristles in place.  It gives my scalp a bit of an abrasive \\&quot;massage\\&quot; that feels wonderful and stimulating.  (I think it is a bit abrasive because the green coating on the tips of the bristles is very uneven....)  Before it fell apart, I was liking it better than my Goody brand brush.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try to glue it back together....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate how cheap the plastic handle is too:  This is as cheap as cheap can be:  Thin, dull black, scratches and scuffs so easily; has no padding on the handle and definitely NOT ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BelleSha makes another brush that is much better constructed.  It has the same padded bristles as this one.  It is a better buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha.</li>
    <li> This BelleSha Smooth Silky Glowing Hair No Tangles Brush is good quality and works well. Both my son and daughter have very long hair and they both agree that this is a good choice. Here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Wide Head&lt;br /&gt;+ Flexible Bristles&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Sample provided to review</li>
    <li> Terrible. Poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles come of the handle even before use&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware</li>
