<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just misinterpreted how this lotion was supposed to work, but it did not work at all for me.  </li>
<li> Bottom line is if I was just starting out I would use this but trying to become darker after establishing a base, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> but if you&#x27;ve already got a base tan then in my&lt;br /&gt;Opinion it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
<li> I was SO disappointed with this.</li>
<li> kinda disappointed by this one..</li>

    <li> This is my favorite lotion. It gives me a great tan and also has vitamins for your skin. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I only gave this 3 stars because I thought it was gonna be darker. It&#x27;s a great beginners lotion but if you&#x27;ve already got a base tan then in my&lt;br /&gt;Opinion it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;ve tried many Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotions and this is the only one I think Is advertised slightly incorrect.

    <li> Regular tanner. Medium to dark skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a fan of the Snooki tanning line. Loved the strawberrish scent and how well it tans. So I was really excited when the SKINNY line came out. I was SO disappointed with this. It smells like men&#x27;s cologne (a far cry from the awesome scent of her older lotions) and was a little thick and not as easy to spread. And I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much for my color.
