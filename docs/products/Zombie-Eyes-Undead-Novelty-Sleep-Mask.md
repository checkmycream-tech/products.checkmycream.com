      <li>Best suited for small to medium sized faces.</li>
      <li>and my kids constantly complain that its too bright in the car to sleep, so now they have these</li>
      <li>This sleep mask, although fun looking, does not block out light.  </li>
      <li>anybody know where to get cool sleep masks?</li>
      <li>Looks cool though.  </li>
      <li>But he wears it to bed all the time and it always gives me a good laugh to look over and see a zombie staring back at me.</li>
      <li>It was pretty cheap</li>
      <li>it blocks out the light pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It is cheaply made of foam and very lite material</li>
      <li>We like to put it on our basset hound and laugh.  </li>
      <li>And it makes the passerby&#x27;s laugh.</li>
      <li>Nice for short term use.  </li>
      <li>I sleep in my car alot and this is fun to wear and scare people with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun for a joke, but don&#x27;t pay over fifty cents for it.  </li>
      <li>The elastic band broke right away, as in with in minutes after taking this out of the box.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have a very large head or anything either.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>It broke the first night my son put it on.  </li>
      <li>This one was cheaper than the first mask.</li>
      <li>so I think its fair to say the elastic was thinning and coming off after a few months</li>
      <li>Got a few good uses until strap broke</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very comfortable, a little snug, cheap material, and</li>
      <li>Very thin mask - light blocking is not that great.</li>
      <li>I read several reviews where others said that the strap wasn&#x27;t strong and would rip, so</li>
      <li>Cute as a novelty, but not very practical.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this if your are looking for a real sleep mask.  </li>
      <li>This was definitely accomplished with this product.</li>
      <li>Looks like I should probably order him a real sleep mask</li>
      <li>I really like mine-</li>
      <li>Nice novelty but too small to wear.</li>
      <li>Cool gift for a teenage zombie lover that has everything.</li>
      <li>Got this sleep mask because it was funny, but it doesn&#x27;t fit very well (too tight).  </li>
      <li>The overall look of the mask is pretty funny.</li>
      <li>this was super comfortable and very heavily used for my parties.</li>
      <li>We really like it now that it is fixed.</li>
      <li>It fell apart and I ordered a new one.</li>
      <li>The elastic strap is thicker and tighter, and the overall quality is higher.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more heavy duty, I would recommend something more thick like the Sleep Master sleep mask, covers more of your eyes and doesn&#x27;t feel as delicate.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made a little cheap</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 11 year old son who wanted a sleep mask.</li>
      <li>That made this completely unusable, and I ended up throwing it away.  </li>
      <li>i bought this for my 11 year old son.</li>
      <li>2nd night elastic broke, delivered fast</li>
      <li>does look cute but was to tight at first, over time it loosened up a little</li>
      <li>A little rough for material that goes over your eyes, but it blocks out the light like it&#x27;s supposed to!  </li>
      <li>but I just sewed it back on and its like new again.</li>
      <li>Really fun, but elastic band broke in less than a month 8/</li>
      <li>Novelty shouldn&#x27;t mean disgustingly cheap.</li>
      <li>Needed a new one, the string stretched out.  </li>

<li> My husband&#x27;s is broken, though, because the band is kind of small.  </li>

<li> Definitely a novelty item and not really recommended for constant use.</li>
<li> If you put \\&quot;Novelty\\&quot; on a label, does that mean you know it&#x27;s cheap and will break after a few uses?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> This will not properly fit an adult&#x27;s nose.</li>
<li> very thin and when the sun is already out it lets too much light through.</li>
<li> not useful as a sleep mask due to being so flimsy and weak elastic strap,  only useful for gags imo</li>
<li> Elastic is too small for an adult head.</li>
<li> The elastic strap that goes around the head isn&#x27;t sturdy, and the mask part itself is pretty thin.</li>
<li> cool as a novelty, yet completely useless.</li>
<li> im waiting for the elastic band to come loose any day now.</li>
<li> I bought this for my zombie lovin&#x27; husband and the string broke after only a few sleeps.  </li>
<li> Strap is much too flimsy and a bit tight (not good combination).  </li>
<li> It does have a slightly course texture, not silky like other masks.  </li>
<li> Super creepy looking!</li>
<li> My ultimate goal with the purchase of this product was to sleep in when the sun comes blaring rudely into my bedroom.</li>
<li> It looks cool but fits badly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So, the reason I&#x27;m giving this a bad review had to do with how it&#x27;s made.  Not cheap workmanship, really, but the fact that it does NOT sit properly on one&#x27;s nose the way other sleep masks do.  That made this completely unusable, and I ended up throwing it away.  This will not properly fit an adult&#x27;s nose.</li>
    <li> I had to have this novelty eye mask just because its to do with zombies . I love it very much</li>
    <li> 2nd night elastic broke, delivered fast but product was junk</li>
    <li> i bought this for my 11 year old son. he loves it. the material is poor quality, im waiting for the elastic band to come loose any day now.</li>
    <li> Love this. Freaked out my husband lol but works great</li>
    <li> As a zombie fan, this is a cute sleep mask!  Works fine.</li>
    <li> this was super comfortable and very heavily used for my parties. I never actually used it to sleep in but my buddy fell asleep with it on at our last poker night and he said it was super comfortable!!! also you can see anything when you put this on!!! very good sleep mas. also it looks really creepy!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Super creepy looking! My girlfriend is afraid to wake up next to me in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> A little rough for material that goes over your eyes, but it blocks out the light like it&#x27;s supposed to!  Very great gift for the zombie lover / Apocalypse freak in your life :)</li>
    <li> Really fun, but elastic band broke in less than a month 8/ I guess good for the price</li>
    <li> Elastic is too small for an adult head. Nice novelty but too small to wear. Very thin mask - light blocking is not that great.</li>
    <li> Definitely a novelty item and not really recommended for constant use. The elastic strap that goes around the head isn&#x27;t sturdy, and the mask part itself is pretty thin. If you&#x27;re looking for something more heavy duty, I would recommend something more thick like the Sleep Master sleep mask, covers more of your eyes and doesn&#x27;t feel as delicate. If you plan on keeping this, you may want to sew over the edges again where the elastic meets the mask or sew on a thicker elastic band if you&#x27;ve got a sewing machine or needle and thread skills.</li>
    <li> Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.</li>
    <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like it so she turned it around so the zombie eyes pointed to her eyes. Got a few good uses until strap broke</li>
    <li> Cheap, Cheap, and more cheapness.  This sleep mask, although fun looking, does not block out light.  It is uncomfortable and seems to be made for a small child&#x27;s head.  Do not buy this if your are looking for a real sleep mask.  It is a poor value for the money.  It&#x27;s fun for a joke, but don&#x27;t pay over fifty cents for it.  It is cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old son who wanted a sleep mask. The elastic band broke right away, as in with in minutes after taking this out of the box.  I was able to easily sew it back on and it works great now. It was pretty cheap so I guessyouget what you pay for. We really like it now that it is fixed.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wears this every night and even says it helps him sleep. It&#x27;s made a little cheap but he&#x27;s had for a year now and it&#x27;s held up with no tears.  The overall look of the mask is pretty funny. We like to put it on our basset hound and laugh.  He even likes to sleep with it on too lol.</li>
    <li> Cool gift for a teenage zombie lover that has everything. It was nice to find something I could slip into an envelope and mail to my grandson</li>
    <li> Nice for short term use.  Strap is much too flimsy and a bit tight (not good combination).  Does not block all light out due to thin material.  Looks cool though.  Best suited for small to medium sized faces.</li>
    <li> My ultimate goal with the purchase of this product was to sleep in when the sun comes blaring rudely into my bedroom. This was definitely accomplished with this product. A bonus was receiving a product that also scares the crap out of my husband when he wakes groggily and glances in my direction. Beautiful.</li>
    <li> cool as a novelty, yet completely useless. Wishing it was a usable item... gave as a gift to someone who actually needs a sleep mask. Looks like I should probably order him a real sleep mask</li>
    <li> not useful as a sleep mask due to being so flimsy and weak elastic strap,  only useful for gags imo</li>
    <li> I sleep in my car alot and this is fun to wear and scare people with.</li>
    <li> This eye mask would be find if the elastic were adjustable. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend or an enemy.</li>
    <li> Novelty shouldn&#x27;t mean disgustingly cheap. It&#x27;s scratchy, the band is already fraying, and you can still see light coming through it! This is the worst sleep mask ever and I will be attempting to get my money back.</li>
    <li> It looks cool but fits badly. Its more for a child</li>
    <li> Got this sleep mask because it was funny, but it doesn&#x27;t fit very well (too tight).  I read several reviews where others said that the strap wasn&#x27;t strong and would rip, so anticipating this, I reinforced each side with additional thread, which seems to have held up quite well.  But it&#x27;s still really tight.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a gag gift for zombie lovers or non-morning people. I highly recommend this how many more words do you need?</li>
    <li> This is a cute product but it does not block the light. It is cheaply made of foam and very lite material</li>
    <li> Very cute! My son loves them!</li>
    <li> sent this to my son who is in the air force.  he works crazy hours os a sleep mask sometimes is needed. this one just looks great while doing the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my zombie lovin&#x27; husband and the string broke after only a few sleeps.  Cute as a novelty, but not very practical.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my grandson. He loves them</li>
    <li> Not the perfect sleep mask, but good for freaking out friends when you pass out at their houses after a party.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it, it was sort of a gag gift. But he wears it to bed all the time and it always gives me a good laugh to look over and see a zombie staring back at me.</li>
    <li> For my grandson. He loved it.</li>
    <li> Blocks sunlight well. Tends to slip up nose.</li>
    <li> My husband orginally bought me a zombie mask in a local store last year. It fell apart and I ordered a new one. This one was cheaper than the first mask. He paid twenty dollars and I paid $5.74. The mask I bought is better than the first. The elastic strap is thicker and tighter, and the overall quality is higher.</li>
    <li> very thin and when the sun is already out it lets too much light through. luckily i am usually in bed before sun up</li>
    <li> If you put \\&quot;Novelty\\&quot; on a label, does that mean you know it&#x27;s cheap and will break after a few uses?&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a while, but only used it a couple handfuls of times. It isn&#x27;t very comfortable, a little snug, cheap material, and a few days ago, I went to put it on and the strap ripped off of the mask.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a very large head or anything either.&lt;br /&gt;Does anybody know where to get cool sleep masks?</li>
    <li> Needed a new one, the string stretched out.  Love this mask</li>
    <li> Now i could sleep like zombie</li>
    <li> Got this to actually sleep in and I love it. I know its a novelty item so I think its fair to say the elastic was thinning and coming off after a few months but I just sewed it back on and its like new again. I use it every night</li>
    <li> we travel by car a lot and my kids constantly complain that its too bright in the car to sleep, so now they have these and they love them!  And it makes the passerby&#x27;s laugh.</li>
    <li> does look cute but was to tight at first, over time it loosened up a little and it does keep out the light</li>
    <li> It broke the first night my son put it on.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got two of these- one for my husband and one for me.  I really like mine- it blocks out the light pretty well.  It does have a slightly course texture, not silky like other masks.  My husband&#x27;s is broken, though, because the band is kind of small.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for bigger guys.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my zombie loving granddaughter</li>
