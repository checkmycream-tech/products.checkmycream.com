      <li>Good quality product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>

      <li>I love this cap!  </li>
      <li>: I received this item at a discounted price but all opinions are always 100% my own.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great quality product and perfect for ladies who have lots of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
      <li>but it did make me pulll my own a hair a couple of times..</li>
      <li>I have found shower  caps to sometimes rip very easy.</li>
      <li>It fits and feels very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I lay my heating pad (that I use for backaches) on my pillow, then lay my head on it so the oil penetrates and conditions better.</li>
      <li>I had read many reviews of the product before purchase but had not seen any addressing the issue of curlers.  </li>
      <li>and I found that this cap fits perfectly over my head and it sealed around my ears and even the back of the neck.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work since no one had mentioned it in the reviews.</li>
      <li>and I made sure I tried to get all the air</li>
      <li>fits great, kept my hair dry after a good shower.</li>
      <li>Perfect for long hair!</li>
      <li>For the most part, this is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I will be able to enjoy my pool more often as well as take a water exercise class at my gym.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to take off without pulling at our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first want to say that I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>It works fine.  </li>
      <li>It had a light odor to it when I took it out of the package but that went away very quickly after leaving it out of the plastic bag it was in.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new swim cap.</li>
      <li>This cap is great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a lap swimmer and struggle to find a comfortable fit in a cap.</li>
      <li>This is perfect because whatever you use to condition your hair, won&#x27;t drop or leak onto your pillow or the floor, and the roomy part allows you to pin your hair up on top of your head or at the back mid way without being to snug.</li>
      <li>I tried it in the shower and was like a kid in a candy store (EXCITED).</li>
      <li>First let me talk about the things I love about this swim cap.</li>
      <li>: I received one or more of the products mentioned above either free or discounted for my honest review.</li>
      <li>I had to see first if it would be easy for her to put on and off and if it would fit her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the strong smell when I took it out the bag, otherwise I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase!</li>
      <li>One thing I love about this  Swim cap is that it doubles for a shower cap, for those times when you really want a shower but you dyed your hair and you just dont want to ruin your do.</li>
      <li>Okay, so this works great on me but now the real test, my daughter&#x27;s shoulder length extremely thick hair (she looses more hair in one day than I have on my head).  </li>
      <li>The material is stretchy, but is super durable.</li>
      <li>The fact that it fits over my long locs is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad cap, just not the right one for me.</li>
      <li>One thing about this Swim cap and a shower cap is this one is made of silicone and very flexible and comfortable.</li>
      <li>When I squeeze the cap and try to release the air, it makes a fart sound and wants to come off my head.</li>
      <li>I was surprised and pleased with this.</li>
      <li>Anyway, point is, for the purpose of keeping my hair dry in the shower, as long as I&#x27;m not trying to look cute, it works great.</li>
      <li>I love this cap, it&#x27;s much better than other shower caps that I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>Wow...it is very large.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes use it to deep condition my hair over night, it does a good job at trapping my body heat which makes my hair very soft in the morning</li>
      <li>This cap was well worth the $19 as my hair is much softer after 2 treatments!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny....;-)</li>
      <li>The best part you won&#x27;t get the red line on your forehead from a cap being to small.   </li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is not waterproof.</li>
      <li>When I first pictured this swim cap</li>
      <li>and  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so this cap was very helpful!  </li>
      <li>and this is the first cap to keep it all inside without a problem.  </li>
      <li>The material of the cap is that of a waterproof silicone allowing for the stretch to comfortably get it on but also to fit snuggly around your head to keep your hair dry.</li>
      <li>Large enough to go over a head full of curlers and still securely seal around the face to keep out the water.</li>
      <li>I really liked the first one and it lasted a year before literally ripping in half.  </li>
      <li>it pulling at my hair and fitting all of my  long hair in it.</li>
      <li>I tend to have a large head which is why I tried this cap.</li>
      <li>although I don&#x27;t see myself ever using it because it&#x27;s TOO large</li>
      <li>It is really large.</li>
      <li>found when placing it on with my long thick hair that it was best to really either put in a ponytail or bun, or even hold ur hair up when putting on.</li>
      <li>I have very long and thick hair, so this is perfect!</li>
      <li>It is a super nice quality, thick cap</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem getting it all to fit inside this, but it is tight enough around at the edges that no water got in and it kept my hair inside all nice and tucked away.</li>
      <li>Thanks a million...</li>
      <li>but I could literally fit the cap over my hair and my entire head.</li>
      <li>The swim cap has a smaller opening so that it fits snug to your head while having ample room to fit your hair inside.</li>
      <li>This silicone Ladies  Swim Cap turned out to a better cap than I expected.</li>
      <li>It was a lot more than I expected....</li>
      <li>In a braid it is almost 2 inches across and is really wavy.</li>
      <li>Would recommend highly!</li>
      <li>I love some of the other colors that are offered so that they could match swim teams or swimsuits.</li>
      <li>I cannot wash it more than once a week because I do not want to damage it, nor do I want to expose it to the effects of chlorine and other chemicals.  </li>
      <li>This Kept my hair dry and was easy to put on.</li>
      <li>I ordered this swim cap in black because it would go with more swimsuits.</li>
      <li>Now I have to continue looking for a decent shower cap.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find a swim cap big enough.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical when offered this product free to try and review honestly, but after testing it I am hooked.</li>
      <li>My old caps always felt like they were gradually slipping off the top of my head while I was swimming.</li>
      <li>I have big curly hair and most shower caps struggle to keep my hair dry.</li>
      <li>This one did a very effective job &amp; was not too difficult to get on.</li>
      <li>Will become my new go to for swimming laps at the gym.</li>
      <li>It did not pull my hair &amp; all of my mid back length  hair fit under the so with room to spare.</li>
      <li>Yes, these are bigger than cheap one you buy in your local corner store there is a reason for it.</li>
      <li>Holds my daughters hair completely!  </li>
      <li>I love that it is big enough to actually hold hair.</li>
      <li>Spent a full day swimming, dunking and rising water.slides with my kids</li>
      <li>it is large enough to make sure that my natural curly blonde hair remains not only curly but also blonde.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The fact that it fits over my long locs is a good thing. Unfortunately it is not waterproof. The water seeps underneath constantly and I can push my hands down on top of my head and all of the trapped water that seeped in runs out from underneath the cap.</li>
    <li> I love this cap!  I have long thick hair and  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so this cap was very helpful!  I like to style my hair a lot, and was happy my curled hair stayed curled after I came out the showers. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the strong smell when I took it out the bag, otherwise I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> Way too big!,, returned</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely thick and it cna be hard ot find a swim cap or other hat for that matter that works. I was skeptical when offered this product free to try and review honestly, but after testing it I am hooked. My hair is middle of my back, and thick. In a braid it is almost 2 inches across and is really wavy. I didn&#x27;t have a problem getting it all to fit inside this, but it is tight enough around at the edges that no water got in and it kept my hair inside all nice and tucked away. I was surprised and pleased with this. Will become my new go to for swimming laps at the gym.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new swim cap. It covers ALL of my beautiful locks. I tried it in the shower and was like a kid in a candy store (EXCITED). Now, when I take swimming lessons I don&#x27;t have to wear that teeny weeny Speedo cap that was stopping my circulation, literally. Thanks a million...</li>
    <li> I have big curly hair and most shower caps struggle to keep my hair dry. This one did a very effective job &amp; was not too difficult to get on. As for swimming, I personally can&#x27;t imagine wearing this in public as it makes your head look like an alien... or kinda like a light bulb. I could get it to look like the picture if I squeeze all the air out, but it seems to creep back in. Anyway, point is, for the purpose of keeping my hair dry in the shower, as long as I&#x27;m not trying to look cute, it works great.</li>
    <li> Really impressed! Haven&#x27;t been able to find a swim cap big enough. This Kept my hair dry and was easy to put on. I have natural thick African American hair. Would recommend highly!</li>
    <li> I have no words to describe how happy I was when I tried the swim cap.  It was a lot more than I expected....thick material and roomy.  It fits and feels very comfortable.  I will be able to enjoy my pool more often as well as take a water exercise class at my gym.  My hair is long and colored.  I cannot wash it more than once a week because I do not want to damage it, nor do I want to expose it to the effects of chlorine and other chemicals.  I cannot thank you enough for finally marketing the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; long hair swim cap.  Nothing compares !  Worth every penny....;-)</li>
    <li> I used this today for the first time and  my hair 0 percent wet!  I had tried another swim cap previously and most of my hair was wet afterward.  This one was big enough to hold all of my hair and keep it dry.  I have very long and thick hair, so this is perfect!</li>
    <li> This is large enough to fit my very thick hair. I sometimes use it to deep condition my hair over night, it does a good job at trapping my body heat which makes my hair very soft in the morning</li>
    <li> Wow...it is very large.  Holds my daughters hair completely!  Her hair is very thick..and down to her rear-end...  we braid it and then shoved it inside this swim cap and this is the first cap to keep it all inside without a problem.  I&#x27;m impressed</li>
    <li> I have mid-back length locs with very thick hair. Spent a full day swimming, dunking and rising water.slides with my kids and when I took off the cap my.hair was completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap never slipped, I.adjusted it.from covering.ears to.not.covering ears with no issue.</li>
    <li> My wife has  thick, long hair, she is using this in the shower and loves it,  All of her hair fits into the cap.  Great product.</li>
    <li> We received the Ladies Swim Cap within just a few days. I purchased the black one as I figured black would go with everything. I hadn&#x27;t quite decided if I would be using this or my teen-aged daughter. I do have long hair, it&#x27;s past my shoulders but her hair is shorter (not at her shoulders) but tangles so easily and chlorine is brutal on her hair. I had to see first if it would be easy for her to put on and off and if it would fit her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of an order when you first take out the cap of the packaging, I&#x27;ve noticed this with other silicon based products which is what the cap is made out of. Unlike a few other caps we&#x27;ve tried in the past this one is easy to put on, some of them have been extremely difficult. While my daughter&#x27;s hair is shorter than mine she has lots of it so that has also been a challenge in the past. We both can put this on no problem  and it&#x27;s easy to take off without pulling at our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tried it swimming just the other day and yep kept her hair dry. I only gave it the 4 stars just because of the smell, it does go away though and it&#x27;s not strong but I had to include that.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price but all opinions are always 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This silicone Ladies  Swim Cap turned out to a better cap than I expected. I am one that hates my hair being damaged from  the chlorine in the pools and I found that this cap fits perfectly over my head and it sealed around my ears and even the back of the neck. I did not find any problems with there being pockets where water might leak in. One thing I love about this  Swim cap is that it doubles for a shower cap, for those times when you really want a shower but you dyed your hair and you just dont want to ruin your do. One thing about this Swim cap and a shower cap is this one is made of silicone and very flexible and comfortable. I have found shower  caps to sometimes rip very easy. This could be a major problem and I dont see this Swim cap ripping and this is going to outlast and shower cap. the silicone feeling isnt something that bothers me, it does have a little bit of a smell coming from packaging, but doesnt a new car have a smell:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found when placing it on with my long thick hair that it was best to really either put in a ponytail or bun, or even hold ur hair up when putting on. I think if you have a thick curly hair thats a little shorter than mine then it might not be a problem but it did make me pulll my own a hair a couple of times..lol. I found it best to just pull it all the way on then adjust it after all your hair is put in and I made sure I tried to get all the air I could out of it from putting it on just so that I didnt have a big bubble on my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say when I recieved it I used it and not one bit of my hair got what and NO WATER IN MY EARS!  That is a major plus to me so I think this could actually tripple for helping stop water from getting in your ears in the pool! I will have to test that one out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for an honest unbiased review, which is 100% my own opinion and may differ from yours or others!</li>
    <li> i bought this to use as a night time hair conditioning cap. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work since no one had mentioned it in the reviews. I was concerned about  it pulling at my hair and fitting all of my  long hair in it. When I received it, I tried it the same day. I slathered my hair in Nutiva coconut oil, combed it through, and put on the cap. It did not pull my hair &amp; all of my mid back length  hair fit under the so with room to spare. Outfits up around my ears and snug around all the edges while being roomy throughout the crown. This is perfect because whatever you use to condition your hair, won&#x27;t drop or leak onto your pillow or the floor, and the roomy part allows you to pin your hair up on top of your head or at the back mid way without being to snug. It is a super nice quality, thick cap so it seems like it will last a long time. I will probably buy a back up just in case the cap disappears off Amazon. I lay my heating pad (that I use for backaches) on my pillow, then lay my head on it so the oil penetrates and conditions better. This cap was well worth the $19 as my hair is much softer after 2 treatments!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to serve as a swim cap. It is really large. My hair is long, straight, and thick (about the size of a large apple when in a tight bun) but I could literally fit the cap over my hair and my entire head. It fits rather like a snood. All of this is awesome for me as I HATE things squeezing my head. The silicone is thick and even, and there are no weak spots where tearing might occur. I swim laps and I did not expect this to keep my hair totally dry (I don&#x27;t believe that for athletic swimming any swim cap could do that.) However, it keeps my hair fairly dry even though I wear the cap with the edges behind my ears. The cap works even better for me if I wet my hair with plain water before putting on the cap. Not a problem for me as I am not trying to avoid wet hair as much as I am chlorine in my hair and stupid floaty hair around my face as I swim. If you are using this as a shower cap, doing light swimming such as water aerobics, or playing with the kids in the pool; I have no doubt that this would keep your hair completely dry.</li>
    <li> For my sister in law. She likes it</li>
    <li> This cap held my long braids.</li>
    <li> Good quality product although I don&#x27;t see myself ever using it because it&#x27;s TOO large and it would be embarrassing to wear</li>
    <li> I love this cap, it&#x27;s much better than other shower caps that I&#x27;ve used and I don&#x27;t need another one.</li>
    <li> This cap is great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a lap swimmer and struggle to find a comfortable fit in a cap. My hair is short to medium length but this cap is a perfect fit for me. I tend to have a large head which is why I tried this cap. My old caps always felt like they were gradually slipping off the top of my head while I was swimming. This cap handles all my hair and stays firmly in place. I love this cap!</li>
    <li> This ladies swim cap is the best thing since sliced bread.  When I first pictured this swim cap I remembered the ones from years past. Man, was I amazed when this one arrived in the mail. Smaller than a small purse when folded yet when fully unfolded it is large enough to make sure that my natural curly blonde hair remains not only curly but also blonde. The material of the cap is that of a waterproof silicone allowing for the stretch to comfortably get it on but also to fit snuggly around your head to keep your hair dry. Room enough to allow my curls to remain at their fullest and totally dry.   Okay, so this works great on me but now the real test, my daughter&#x27;s shoulder length extremely thick hair (she looses more hair in one day than I have on my head).  Finally a Swim Cap that fits her thick mixed hair. Every other one we have tried would fall off or rip as she tried to stretch it around all of her hair. Yes, these are bigger than cheap one you buy in your local corner store there is a reason for it. It fits all types and sizes. The best part you won&#x27;t get the red line on your forehead from a cap being to small.

    <li> While I don&#x27;t have super long or thick hair, there are times when I want to cover my hair in the shower or swimming. I ordered this swim cap in black because it would go with more swimsuits. The cap is large so those with fuller thicker hair could use this and keep their hair from getting wet. The swim cap has a smaller opening so that it fits snug to your head while having ample room to fit your hair inside. The material is stretchy, but is super durable. I love some of the other colors that are offered so that they could match swim teams or swimsuits. Overall, it is a great quality product and perfect for ladies who have lots of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free/discount.

    <li> Perfect for long hair!</li>
    <li> I first want to say that I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I would give this item a 3.5 out of 5 stars. First let me talk about the things I love about this swim cap. I love that it is big enough to actually hold hair. I have thin hair and seen how others like it cause it doesn&#x27;t smash your hair when going in the cap. The next thing I like is that even when you are stretching the cap, it doesn&#x27;t act like it&#x27;s going to break. Very thick but still lightweight. Now for the things I don&#x27;t like about this cap. I don&#x27;t like that it pulls my hair. If my hair is wet when I use this cap, it pulls it. And if it is dry, it pulls it even worse and then makes it very static. I have found that the shape of the cap is a little different from ones that I have used in the past. Also I have not mastered the fact of putting this on and getting the &amp;#34;air bubble&amp;#34; out where the hair goes. When I squeeze the cap and try to release the air, it makes a fart sound and wants to come off my head. For the most part, this is easy to use. I just don&#x27;t like that it pulls my hair. If you have long and thick hair, then I would highly recommend this cap for you. For me, my hair is thin and so I think that is the issue I have with wearing this cap. It&#x27;s not a bad cap, just not the right one for me.</li>
    <li> fits great, kept my hair dry after a good shower. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  Doesn&#x27;t keep hair 100% dry but works well enough.  Covers my thick hair.  That&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
    <li> I am DELIGHTED with this product! It was purchased as a shower cap, not a swim cap. I usually need to use it with curlers in my hair. I had my doubts, having bought many useless shower caps over and over from stores. This works! Large enough to go over a head full of curlers and still securely seal around the face to keep out the water. It is wonderful for this use!  I had read many reviews of the product before purchase but had not seen any addressing the issue of curlers.  Not so glamorous, but something lots of us ladies deal with on a daily basis.  Excellent product! Update: This is my second purchase of this cap.  I really liked the first one and it lasted a year before literally ripping in half.  I bought another.  It only lasted 3 months before ripping in half.  What&#x27;s the deal with that?  I am so disappointed.  Now I have to continue looking for a decent shower cap.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this cap. It is made of a vinyl type of material and is much larger and thicker than I expected which is good because I have very long, thick hair. It had a light odor to it when I took it out of the package but that went away very quickly after leaving it out of the plastic bag it was in. It fits well and kept my hair dry. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> It really is large enough for long and thick hair</li>
