      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I like the smaller size because I can heat up two of them and put the right on the spot I need it.</li>

<li> like I had been using in the past.</li>
<li> I have  used this brand in the past.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use the matching covers because it blocks too much of the cold, in my opinion, so I use them with a thin sheet in between the ice packs and my skin.</li>
<li> They do not get hard and are always pliable.</li>
<li> and these packs get colder than any ice packs I have tried and stay cold for a long time.</li>
<li> Not very happy with the false advertising.</li>
<li> Gel packs arrived - but not covers so we will use them because it is not worth the cost of returning but still have to find something because the gel is way to cold for skin</li>
<li> Cover is way too thick to feel the cold through.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s difficult to manage making ice bags or packs.</li>
<li> They stay cold.  </li>
<li> You wouldnt think it, but these gel packs are impossible to find in stores.</li>

    <li> Perfect size for arm !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need for relief from migraine pain. Love that there are 3 so I can rotate them through the freezer... covers are soft and make the ice packs more comfortable to use. Delivery was as expected - no complaints!</li>
    <li> We got one of these from an oral surgeon 5 years ago and we are still using it. The package show no sign of leaking. It holds cold for a couple of hours and it stays soft. I have fallen asleep on my original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted more because if the first ever does go, nothing else could be as good</li>
    <li> Much smaller than we anticipated.</li>
    <li> Great ice packs. Perfect size too.</li>
    <li> Convenient bags come with ice pack that stays pliable.</li>
    <li> These packs are great.  They stay cold.  Flexible, not stiff like some ice packs, and easy to wrap around a body part.  We use a velcro strap to hold on.  We don&#x27;t use the sleeves but someone may find them useful.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These things are great. I live in the Great Lakes area where summers include consistent days of 100% humidity. I got these to put in my pillow while I&#x27;m sleeping in the heat. You wouldnt think it, but these gel packs are impossible to find in stores. I was happy to find a three-pack for such a great price. And the added pouches are a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packs are made of average quality. None have sprung a leak yet with continuous freeze/thaw.</li>
    <li> Too small for my needs.  Need neck and shoulders.</li>
    <li> These are ice packs are great.  As they thaw a bit, you can mold them around the affected area. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Cover is way too thick to feel the cold through.</li>
    <li> Keeps the kids&#x27; lunch boxes dry for a fraction of the cost of the other ice packs with covers. We&#x27;ve used these almost every day for months now.</li>
    <li> These ice packs work very well; we use them mainly for our backs, but they did not come with the covers as shown.</li>
    <li> These were wonderful after surgery - but they don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. They get super cold tho!</li>
    <li> The description of the item was 6x7 Ice Pack (Set of 3) - with 3 matching covers.  However, while it arrived on time it did not include the 3 matching covers.  I would appreciate those being sent now.  I don&#x27;t know how to contact them direct.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, form-able, I got these for post-vasectomy.  Thank you Lord for my foresight.  Me and the boys love it!</li>
    <li> These little gems were perfect for my needs. I like that they have a cover. Good for smaller area of the body or children.</li>
    <li> Well made, comfortable and stay soft enough to contour.</li>
    <li> These are great. They stay flexible and the sleeves are very helpful.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for tendonitis in the wrist. I just ordered another set of 3.</li>
    <li> Good strong quality that freezes fast and is a great pain reducer along with swelling from arthritis or any injury.  A medical must-have for every freezer.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to the covers that are stated to come with these packs, but never received them.  And, apparently, I am not the only one who did not receive them.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these. They do not get hard and are always pliable. This is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite ice packs.  I ice my body multiple times a day and these packs get colder than any ice packs I have tried and stay cold for a long time. I don&#x27;t use the matching covers because it blocks too much of the cold, in my opinion, so I use them with a thin sheet in between the ice packs and my skin.</li>
    <li> I heat mine up and have had very good experience with them I like the smaller size because I can heat up two of them and put the right on the spot I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the gel packs...but the therapy pack sleeves were not included as promised.  Sadly, it seems this is true for other shoppers as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered these little ice packs for my daughter to use for her migraines.  They are the perfect size to lay on your forehead or behind your head. They come with the cutest little soft cloth bag where the ice pack neatly fits  We absolutely love these!!</li>
    <li> Just arrived today and no matching covers.  Misleading product description.</li>
    <li> The packs stay cold for a good amount of time after removing them from the freezer.  They were perfect for icing my broken foot for 30 minutes at a time and were still cold at the end of the 30 minute periods.</li>
    <li> I really like having these around in our freezer for when the kids get bumps or bruises. You can use with the cover or not. Never leaked and we have been using them a couple months now.</li>
    <li> Best ice packs on the market. Do not buy them at big box stores!  Reasonably priced. I broke my ankle and used the over and over for months!</li>
    <li> Great packs, love that it came it with cases so I don&#x27;t have to use towels!</li>
    <li> nice and good sleeves</li>
    <li> We bought some of these for our small private school.  We keep them in the kitchen freezer and use them weekly.  We&#x27;ve had them for over four years and they are still servicing us well.  Good quality.  I would recommend getting the cloth sleeves, so the ice pack can be re-freezing after one use while you wash the outer sleeve.</li>
    <li> Like so many &amp;#34;things&amp;#34;...they work..price was decent...don&#x27;t use them till I need them.</li>
    <li> I was using up so much ice to make ice packs, so glad my husband got these. Much easier to deal with, especially if you have a fever and it&#x27;s difficult to manage making ice bags or packs. 3 of them makes it nice to rotate out when using so there&#x27;s always one ready.</li>
    <li> Great Ice packs but they did not come with the covers like it stated it is supposed to. Not very happy with the false advertising. Still the ice packs are great though.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d this from oral surgeon after my daughter&#x27;s wisdom teeth extraction.  Stayed flexible when cold, conformed to her jaw nicely, was her favorite of the ice packs I had on hand.  Also a great promotional idea as the surgeon&#x27;s name/address was printed on it.  May recommend it to the hospital where I work.</li>
    <li> These are the best gel ice packs you can buy, mine came with the cloth covers which are nice they have a velcro strip to close and keep pack in. I first got these from dentist back in 2003 and only 1 has been compromised and these get regular usage for my migraines, they are colder than store bought blue ice packs, they last longer and they mold to your face or head. I got them in 2 sizes this time, 6x7 and 6x10, got the 6x10 ones for those times when I need it to wrap around my forehead to both sides and I still have more old ones left but really need them for the migraines, thought I&#x27;d never find these online but am glad I did and the cost is not high + you get the cloth covers, so you will like these.</li>
    <li> Gel packs arrived - but not covers so we will use them because it is not worth the cost of returning but still have to find something because the gel is way to cold for skin</li>
    <li> Well made! small enough for what i need. I recommend! You can cool it and use to keep bottles of fresh juice cold! i sent it with my daughter to school.</li>
    <li> Decent enough packs but they don&#x27;t actually freeze, the do get nice and chilly though.</li>
    <li> The packs came as advertised – with matching covers. These things are great and they&#x27;re a pretty versatile size too.</li>
    <li> I place these as palm rests so when I use the computer I am at the same time icing my rists.</li>
    <li> I needed for my kids lunch, keep´s lunch fresh for a long period, it is perfect for the School lunch.</li>
    <li> After some recent surgery and muscle tears I got these packs. The covers work really well and are much better than using a wash cloth like I had been using in the past. Ice packs work as expected, so far both the covers and the packs have held up after dozens of freeze/thaw cycles so I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!! I Love that it&#x27;s bendable even when frozen.  It Was helpful during my recovery after surgery.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Soft gel works great. They are good quality and they last a long time.I have  used this brand in the past.</li>
    <li> Items were as expected and of good quality!</li>
