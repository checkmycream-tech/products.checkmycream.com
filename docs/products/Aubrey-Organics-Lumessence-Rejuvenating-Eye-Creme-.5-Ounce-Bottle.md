      <li>This eye creme is a pleasant alternative to the many chemical options out there.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s f2f own again</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s effective when you but it, and when you wash your face</li>
      <li>We need more nature based products that work as good or better than those made with chemicals.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best eye cream I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This eye cream is very light</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but I love it and would recommend it.  </li>

      <li>Says it helps her wrinkles go away more under her eyes.</li>
      <li>I love Aubrey</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many months (it lasts forever) and I will be getting it again soon.  </li>
      <li>the amount of sleep I get and my diet more than some cream I&#x27;m patting on it a couple of times per day.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be very effective given it&#x27;s light texture</li>
      <li>It is light in consitency, more like a serum then a creme.</li>
      <li>good price and fast delivery</li>
      <li>It is very mild without offensive scent.</li>
      <li>It leaves my undereye area moisturized, and has made a noticable difference in the dryness and fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>It helps to keep the skin under my eyes moisturized and helps to keep the fine lines at a minimum.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s actually a fantastic value.</li>
      <li>But I was looking for a good natural eye cream and not miracles</li>
      <li>I specially like the aloe kind for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to shake the bottle very well before applying since there are no stabilizers or preservatives added.</li>
      <li>Works great on mature sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I loved the Rosa Mosqueta cleanser &amp; moisturizer for dry skin</li>
      <li>At first I was amazed how it tightened the under eye area and made my eyes super youthful, so I.bought the full.</li>
      <li>seems firmer, though my smile creases haven&#x27;t disappeared.</li>
      <li>The clear palstic lid is cracked in many places, and I have never dropped it.</li>
      <li>If you have super sensitive skin like me try this!  </li>
      <li>Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine giving a positive review for eye creme, so give it a try.</li>
      <li>It has great natural ingredients and she only needs to use a tiny drop or two a day on her fingertip to get the results she needs.</li>
      <li>So far so good, I thought, but will it do anything other than soften skin?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strange because I had a sample which I loved but the product I ordered seemed quite different from the sample.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost 43, and some fine lines were starting to show.</li>
      <li>Kind of greenish/brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had found Aubrey Organics when I decided to go more natural for my facial care - also cheaper because the big brands are killing me financially in today&#x27;s economy.</li>
      <li>I am a huge Aubrey fan and buy their products whenever possible.</li>
      <li>I have started using argan oil instead and find that I much prefer it to this product.</li>
      <li>I hope you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>If I get a bit too much from the pump, I put it on my face and neck.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to friends and think the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tries many eye cremes.</li>
      <li>This cream is very gentle to my sensitive eyelids.  </li>
      <li>My face is pretty clear of blemishes</li>
      <li>I think dark circles and puffiness for me have more to do</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this creme.</li>
      <li>This stuff is not exactly a cream, it&#x27;s more liquid, but it makes the skin soft around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I use this cream to clear up spots &amp; it works fast even if I miss a day or two.</li>
      <li>She is also very dye sensitive and this product does not cause her any allergic skin rashes or issues.  </li>
      <li>Wrinkle situation is pretty much the same.</li>
      <li>I did not feel that hydrated or as smooth as other products.</li>
      <li>Mind you my mother is 65 years old with not terribly wrinkled skin, but some usual age wrinkling going on.  </li>
      <li>In terms of the \\&quot;rejuvenation\\&quot; aspect of the cream, I have to say that I don&#x27;t see any visible changes other than it being moisturized (which is not a bad thing).</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy this in the future.</li>
      <li>It is even clearing up an old burn scar on my arm.</li>
      <li>received a sample of this creme when I ordered some products directly from Aubrey Organics.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased drug store brands, natural brands, department store brands, Sephora brands...</li>
      <li>It is a bit more expensive, but worth the price we feel.</li>
      <li>Whole Foods stopped carrying this awesome product for some other really bad stuff.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and is much cheaper than the brands I&#x27;ve used before -</li>
      <li>Let me start this review by saying I have tried many, many different brands of eye creme, and got so sick of wasting money on goop that didn&#x27;t work, irritated my eyes, or made me break out, that I stopped using it all together.</li>
      <li>It is light enough to go under makeup in the morning, but it does take a few minutes to absorb.</li>
      <li>I like that the ingredients are not scary like some other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin, especially my face.</li>
      <li>I origanlly bought this to use for my slight under eye color which it fixed really fast.</li>
      <li>When whole foods stopped carrying it, I tried a couiple other creams and none compare.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, dry skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got a sample. At first I was amazed how it tightened the under eye area and made my eyes super youthful, so I.bought the full.Size . but then.after.a week I dont know what happened.  Im.25 trying to prevent..The formula became sticky like glue and I was using very little, it made the under eye area suttle folds stick together Even more!!!! And then it made one of my eyes get puffy little bag that I&#x27;ve never had before and I quit using it after 2 weeks.. It took three months for that puffy bag to go.away, and it even looks like it increased the wrinkles visibility. I love Aubrey but this just Did not work for me, made my eyes worse..</li>
    <li> As I reach the last third of this product in the bottle I have noticed the odor is quite unpleasant and am very hesitant to use it at all. I was not that impressed with this product, anyway. It&#x27;s strange because I had a sample which I loved but the product I ordered seemed quite different from the sample. I did not feel that hydrated or as smooth as other products. I have started using argan oil instead and find that I much prefer it to this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for about a year.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle and use it morning and night.  If I get a bit too much from the pump, I put it on my face and neck. This cream is very gentle to my sensitive eyelids.  I&#x27;ve been allergic to several other eye creams that I&#x27;ve tried and have often had rashes and itching on my lids in the past. I&#x27;ve had no problem since I began using the Aubrey cream. The scent is faintly herbal, and the cream is thin, not at all greasy, yet very moisturizing.  I don&#x27;t see any droopiness in my eyelids, since using this product and the skin under my eyes seems firmer, though my smile creases haven&#x27;t disappeared. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I love Aubrey Organic products!!!  I specially like the aloe kind for sensitive skin.  The eye cream though isn&#x27;t my favorite.  It is a little too watery for me but I still buy it since it is good!  If you have super sensitive skin like me try this!  It is very mild without offensive scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product, but I was not impressed with it at all. Yes, it does moisturize but that&#x27;s about it. Nothing else. In fact I think it made my eyes look even worse in terms of dark circles and puffiness and fine lines. So I took the product back today. Not recommended if you are truly looking for the product that performs and not just plainly moisturizes.</li>
    <li> This is my absolutely favorite eye cream. In my opinion, it beats most expensive brands. I am a huge Aubrey fan and buy their products whenever possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many months (it lasts forever) and I will be getting it again soon.  It is a wonderful moisturizer for the eye area and it is vegan and not tested on animals....what more could you want!?</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very light but a little goes a long way.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be very effective given it&#x27;s light texture but I love it and would recommend it.  Great price as well!</li>
    <li> My mom has used this product for years. Loves it. Says it helps her wrinkles go away more under her eyes. It also is one of the few that do not have aloe vera in it like some of the other Aubrey products. My mom is allergic to aloe and it is in many under eye and lotion products. She is also very dye sensitive and this product does not cause her any allergic skin rashes or issues.  It has great natural ingredients and she only needs to use a tiny drop or two a day on her fingertip to get the results she needs. Mind you my mother is 65 years old with not terribly wrinkled skin, but some usual age wrinkling going on.  I have used Aubrey products too and it is hard to find this product in stores even health food in my area.  I love Aubrey for their natural ingredients, safety, quality and long term record of not using dangerous or questionable ingredients. It is a bit more expensive, but worth the price we feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using some very, very expensive eye creams for many years, but they quit working (if they ever did). I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars and my eyes just kept feeling dry &amp; had weird shadows underneath. Kind of greenish/brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had found Aubrey Organics when I decided to go more natural for my facial care - also cheaper because the big brands are killing me financially in today&#x27;s economy. I loved the Rosa Mosqueta cleanser &amp; moisturizer for dry skin so thought I&#x27;d try the Lumessence eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows were gone in just days. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! This stuff is not exactly a cream, it&#x27;s more liquid, but it makes the skin soft around my eyes. Lost the papery look and feel. But the weird thing is that I had these two deep dent-looking things just above my eyebrows, and I have a tendency to apply my eye cream up above the brow line to use up any excess. It&#x27;s been about 3 months and the dents are gone! I just noticed that this week. Have no idea what expression was causing them, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I&#x27;d smear some of this on the wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth. They&#x27;re diminishing. I have no idea why, this stuff isn&#x27;t marketed as doing that but it has for me. Not saying it&#x27;ll work for you, but for the money I&#x27;m going to use it this way. Who wouldn&#x27;t? It could just be the Rosa Mosqueta skin care - but I&#x27;m keeping on with the eye creme. It lasts a long time and is much cheaper than the brands I&#x27;ve used before - so why not??</li>
    <li> This eye creme is a pleasant alternative to the many chemical options out there. We need more nature based products that work as good or better than those made with chemicals. I&#x27;m happy to have found this and tried it. I have been using it for about a month. It is light in consitency, more like a serum then a creme. A little goes a long ways. It is light enough to go under makeup in the morning, but it does take a few minutes to absorb. It leaves my undereye area moisturized, and has made a noticable difference in the dryness and fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, the container itself seems a little weak. The clear palstic lid is cracked in many places, and I have never dropped it. Not that it affects the products effectiveness in any way, but I just thought I would mention this!</li>
    <li> Whole Foods stopped carrying this awesome product for some other really bad stuff. This is by far the best eye cream I have ever used. I am 61 and I look 40 because of the protection this cream provides. I have used it for ten years now. When whole foods stopped carrying it, I tried a couiple other creams and none compare. I started to get bags and dark circles under my eyes. So I decided to order it on line. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good one tied my eyes perfectly but it&#x27;s effective when you but it, and when you wash your face it&#x27;s f2f own again</li>
    <li> good price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  No allergic reactions and no fragrance.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This cream is great. I origanlly bought this to use for my slight under eye color which it fixed really fast. I never had really dark under eye problems but it was noticeable. I do have sensitive skin, especially my face. My face is pretty clear of blemishes but ocassionally i will have a some acne &amp; it always leaves a dark spot. I use this cream to clear up spots &amp; it works fast even if I miss a day or two. Insrct bites &amp; other scars leave dark spots too so I use on my arms &amp; legs too. It is even clearing up an old burn scar on my arm. I LOVE THIS CREAM!</li>
    <li> Let me start this review by saying I have tried many, many different brands of eye creme, and got so sick of wasting money on goop that didn&#x27;t work, irritated my eyes, or made me break out, that I stopped using it all together. I&#x27;ve purchased drug store brands, natural brands, department store brands, Sephora brands...you name it. Made no difference. Enter Lumessence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this creme when I ordered some products directly from Aubrey Organics. Since it was already here, I figured I might as well try it. At least I hadn&#x27;t wasted money on it, and I do like Aubrey products very much. The sample had enough for a few uses, so I got to apply it a few times. It provided wonderful moisture, didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, and caused no skin eruptions or allergy. So far so good, I thought, but will it do anything other than soften skin? I gave in and bought a bottle just to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O.M.G. I&#x27;m literally amazed. I&#x27;m almost 43, and some fine lines were starting to show. I&#x27;ve been using this product since the end of December, and it has actually made these lines less noticeable. The skin under my eyes looks firmer and brighter as well. You only need a tiny amount to do the job (less than one pump for both eyes) so it&#x27;s actually a fantastic value. Just make sure to shake the bottle very well before applying since there are no stabilizers or preservatives added. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine giving a positive review for eye creme, so give it a try. I hope you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tries many eye cremes. this is the best</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, dry skin.  Most eye creams irritate my skin but not Lumessence!  Have been using this product for over a year and I love it!!!  It helps to keep the skin under my eyes moisturized and helps to keep the fine lines at a minimum.  Would highly recommend this creme.</li>
    <li> I am please with this product, but not certain it is the be-all end-all that I was hoping for. (What is . . .?)  I may consider re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I have been having Syringomas grow under my eyes. I had my dermatologist remove them. My daughter, Mimi, introduced me to Aubrey Lumessence Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;My Syringomas are greatly reduced or gone with the use of this cream under my eyes. It is a good product. I saved money buying it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or sting my eyes and keeps the eye area moisturized without being overly heavy or greasy. I like that the ingredients are not scary like some other brands I&#x27;ve used. Have bought several times and will keep on using.    In terms of the \\&quot;rejuvenation\\&quot; aspect of the cream, I have to say that I don&#x27;t see any visible changes other than it being moisturized (which is not a bad thing). I think dark circles and puffiness for me have more to do w/the amount of sleep I get and my diet more than some cream I&#x27;m patting on it a couple of times per day. Wrinkle situation is pretty much the same. But I was looking for a good natural eye cream and not miracles so I&#x27;m happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> Works great on mature sensitive skin. My skin feels very smooth and it seems to minimize lines in the eye area. I would certainly buy this in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I love it. I am not getting younger (aged 53), but can hope that this will keep my skin supple around my eyes. I would recommend it to friends and think the price is reasonable.</li>
</ol>
