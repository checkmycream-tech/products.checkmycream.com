<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product smoothed out my cockapoo&#x27;s coat and left it silky, but I was a bit dissapointed with its ability to keep knots from occurring. Her coat is long and she gets brushed daily, but she still got knots with this product</li>
    <li> Works great for Shih Tzus with shorter cuts.</li>
    <li> My long hair Yorkie hair is no longer full of static, it lasts a long time and easier to brush out.</li>
    <li> We love to keep little Miss Mia&#x27;s hair on the long side and she tangles and knots quite a bit. I am able to get the tangles out easier with this cream rinse. The comb glides easier through the long, silky locks!</li>
    <li> I have 2 little yorkies,Quigley and Seely, they are both 7yrs old anyway my point ,this conditioner is the best ever use on r dogs. their long silky hair is so soft,no frizz here and they smell goooood&amp;#62; I will definitley be buying more</li>
    <li> I had a customer give me this product to try on my dog and I really liked it. It conditions my dogs&#x27; hair so well. So I decided to order one of my own. I was so amazed on how fast it was shipped and the bottle was new and sealed.</li>
    <li> everyone complements my dog&#x27;s hair on how soft and silky her hair feels. I recommend this product to all dog owners! safe to use on topical flea medicine!</li>
    <li> Leaves my westies coat south and shiny.oSo much easier to remove tangles</li>
    <li> Our groomer used this product for years, and we always got compliments on our dogs&#x27; coats.  Their supplier quit carrying Bio-Groom Silk, so we now buy it and take it to the groomers when they wash our dogs.  We have tried a number of other rinses over the years, but this is the best.  Its benefits (the feel, shine, clean smell) all last longer than other brands.  Our dogs are not coddled lap dogs.  They are very active, indoor and outdoor, German Shepherds, that put any bath treatment to the test!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this product. It smells good and gets all the tangles out of my yorkies. Makes their coats feel really soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this product on my pet. It has a nice scent and leave my pet&#x27;s hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Been using this conditioner for almost 20 years.  My groomer used it when I first got my Maltese almost 17 years ago.  I used to LOVE the way she smelled when she came home from the groomer.  When I stopped taking her to the groomer to help ease her anxiety and to prolong her life, I made sure to have this on hand so she could smell as good as when she came back from the salon! :)</li>
    <li> Although my dogs coat did feel soft and smelled great, the scent is not long lasting.  There are more effective brands out there that do a far better job of keeping my pooch smelling fresh. Furthermore, this rinse was ineffective at lessening / combating my dogs post-bathtime long knotty locks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Bailey, a Shi-Chion with Cotton Candy hair.  I hate snarls and tangles! My mom knows I don&#x27;t mean to get grumpy but it hurts! This cream rinse keeps my hair soft and tangle free! Now I don&#x27;t need to be pinned down on the counter and suffer with pulling and biting because my hair is all knotted. I can snooze and play instead!</li>
    <li> Got this product on recommendation from a groomer. It is easy to apply and rinse off. Leaves coat looking fantastic, and wife loves the way it leaves our little guy smelling for days.</li>
    <li> I love all the Bio-Silk products.  Both of my yorkies coats always look very good...silky, shines, and smell very good!</li>
    <li> Love, great for myyorkie</li>
    <li> I have tried expensive products and no so expensive products for puppies. This paired with the Bio- Groom apple shampoo is wonderful. I use it on my puppies ( Yorkie&#x27;s) and they look like they just came out of the groomers. This product really works</li>
    <li> Nice product, I saw the result already for second time use. I see more the result for a month.</li>
    <li> I have a Yorkie who I keep cut short... but still, I use the Silk Creme Rinse after his shampoo and it&#x27;s awesome!!!  He is so shiny and so soft and he smells GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  Smells great and makes my dogs hair very soft.  Will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the rich conditioner. Smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a creme rinse for my Havanese to tame her cottony coat. After looking at several different kinds &amp; reading reviews, I bought the Bui-Groom Silk. It is truly Silk in a bottle! Absolutely amazing product! My dog is blowing coat right now, and this product makes it so much easier to get those mats &amp; tangles out. I had bought the 12 oz bottle, but will be ordering by the gallon from now on!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it!! Great for my dog. She is a maltese</li>
    <li> this stuff makes your dog hair soft and smell really good, good product.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever. Works best when used with bio groom shampoo</li>
    <li> It works very well , makes her fur very silky . Even if i forget while i&#x27;m bathing her . I love it . Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> had high ratings although i have not used it yet i did open it to smell it and has a very potent scent, will definitely dilute it before i try it.  but was delivered really fast.</li>
    <li> I am a believer. This product WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 10 month-old, white Havanese. She is currently blowing her puppy coat and looks a bit ragged. Last night she needed her butt washed, so in the bathroom we go for a partial bath on her back half. Where I used this Rinse is a noticeable difference. I have tried many different conditioners, including ones from her breeder, and this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of that awful dread-locks look, she is now a beautiful, long-haired fur ball. WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the Bio-Groom Super White Pet Shampoo that I bought at the same time here on Amazon, and it too is FANTASTC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products highly recommended.</li>
    <li> hands down, the best conditioner for our Golden Retriever we have found. Every time we use it- her coat looks wonderful, and feels wonderful. Our vet has commented on her beautiful coat many times-- a tribute to good, quality dog food, but also this product, I believe. A local stores stopped carrying Bio Groom products (very upset about that!)- but we like this product so much we have chosen to continue to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I have a cotton coated maltese and this helps his coat feel silkier. It really has a nice fragrance. It makes me just want to cuddle and smell him. Even some of my friends want to do the same.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! It left my dog silky and shiny smooth! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because this is literally after my first use. I want to see how long it last.</li>
    <li> How much can you write about a dog coat conditioner?  It works, it smells good, but it&#x27;s nothing to write rhapsodies about.</li>
    <li> To call this silk creme rinse is an understatement. This gave my dogs the ultimate soft coat that stays cleaner longer.  Creme rinses usual leave a bit of a residue that eventually feels and looks a bit greasy.  Not this one.  My dogs look and smell great 2 weeks later!</li>
    <li> We got a new tiny impearl Shih Tzu,  We don&#x27;t bath her very often, maybe once between grooming.  it works great, so far and she does not seem to have any allergies to it.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner we have been using it for a while on our yorkies. The smell I would say is a neutral scent. Don&#x27;t expect a floral it is perfect for male or female dogs. The soap has a silky rose look very beautiful, I like the way my yorkies hair flows.  I think you have to try it every dogs hair is different just like humans. I believe you will like it, this is better than all shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love the smell on my babies, leave hair very silky. fast shipping thank you so much</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Makes my Yorkie&#x27;s coat super soft and silky. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Looking for something for my Yorkie...she had smelly oily hair. This product works and makes coats smell good..but only last about a day.</li>
    <li> Top knot he..love it and will order it again...my Shih Tzu has hair like silk</li>
    <li> My shih tzu&#x27;s coat is soft and manageable.  Product rinses well and smells nice.  She&#x27;s easy to comb and groom afterwards.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Bio-Groom Silk Creme Rinse and I have to say this is the best creme rinse for my Havanese. He has very long silky hair and I have tried many different products and this is by far the best yet. It leaves his hair as it should be, luxurious, silky, and oh so soft! He smells wonderful and the scent lasts. I used it with the Bio-Groom shampoo for white dogs. Together they are definetly a winning product!</li>
    <li> This makes my dog&#x27;s fur so silky and soft.</li>
    <li> Loved using Bio-Groom on our pups.  They always smelled great and looked beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have an English Springer and this product does an amazing job on her coat.  I like the fact that the product can be diluted to make it go further and get the same great product results.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for my 2 dogs but the photo is not the size that arrived. It looks like the photo is of a gallon container. I would of given 5 stars except for the deceptive photo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bio Groom since I got my Maltese 11 years ago.  This by far is the best cream rise I&#x27;ve used. I find that when used regularly is really helps with matting. Plus it smells really good.</li>
