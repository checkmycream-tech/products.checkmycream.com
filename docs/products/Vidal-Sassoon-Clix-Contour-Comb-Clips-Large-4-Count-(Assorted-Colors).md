      <li>I love, love them.</li>
      <li>WAY too big for my baby fine hair, but the design itself is perfect.  </li>
      <li>This is the  way that hair clips are supposed to work...pretty, secure, comfortable, and functional!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and keeps the hair in place.  </li>

      <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize how large they were going to be!!!  </li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair, and these hold it (and my layers) in place.</li>
      <li>my hair is so fine...</li>
      <li>These work fine</li>

      <li>They are too greatly huge to work in my hair.  </li>
      <li>These says &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34;... They are huge.  </li>

      <li>Initially these clips are great and keep their shape.</li>
      <li>They are just as effective as Bobby pins and are much easier to manipulate with arthritic hands.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a number of these clips in a smaller size and was delighted when a larger size was offered.  My hair is very fine, and even the clips that guarantee all-day hold, slip off.  These keep my hair in order all day, and the colors are neutral enough so they look good with any color I&#x27;m wearing.  I&#x27;m a little old for cutesy barrettes, and these clips are the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. They have a very tight grip and stay in all day with my thick, heavy, wavy hair. They are just as effective as Bobby pins and are much easier to manipulate with arthritic hands. My hairdresser recently asked me where to get them...she said she absolutely loves them and wants to get some.</li>
    <li> Holds a little more hair than the regular little snappy clip.</li>
    <li> These clips are great.  I love the size and how well they hold your hair in place.  The colors are nice also.</li>
    <li> The clips are good, grips on to large sets of hair and quality wise as well. It works ... BUT .. 4 different colors for 1 head of hair..!! hmmm..</li>
    <li> I use these in my hair every night.  Work great!  Keeps my hair in place very well.</li>
    <li> Initially these clips are great and keep their shape. They hold enough hair and don&#x27;t let thinner hair slip out as much as some other style clips do. BUT, the paint flakes off them after a month of use. That said, I do NOT wear any sort of spray or gel or any chemicals on my hair, so I can&#x27;t imagine why they would do this.  The sad thing is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find as good a clip, so I continue to use them.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick, curly hair and we use there every day. Unfortunately, she takes them out &amp; loses them most days. I throw a set in my cart almost every Amazon order.</li>
    <li> best holding clips for thin hair ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I like these big ones for night time.</li>
    <li> Wife loves them, holds her West Indian curly hair very well.  She is happy and I look good for getting them.</li>
    <li> These types of hair clips are the only ones that seem to keep all of my shorter babyhairs on the back of my head up when I ponytail my hair. Since they are so large, I only need to use one clip in order to keep all my hair in place.</li>
    <li> These are a great find.  I have used the smaller versions of these clips also, and both work well.  I like these large clips particularly when I pull back my hair. They hold it in place beautifully.  I find that I do not need to adjust these lips at all during the day. This is the  way that hair clips are supposed to work...pretty, secure, comfortable, and functional! I highly recommend Vidal Sassoon Clix Contour Combo Clips, Large, 4 Count.</li>
    <li> I have some of these already but they are smaller. I didn&#x27;t realize they would be this big and frankly they are just to big.</li>
    <li> Why is it that no barrettes can stay in my hair? First of all, these hold hardly any hair. The hair cannot go through to the back of the clip, so it has barely any hold. Maybe it&#x27;s bc my hair is so fine...so frustrating...These also pull out your hair...it gets stuck in between the bits of metal on the front point. The only thing I like about these is the size. They look very pretty, but they just don&#x27;t stay put!</li>
    <li> These are extra large for hair clips.  I assume kids are small, then there are medium and large for adults, but these bad boys are really big!  Just beware.  I like their color choices and their performance, just a little too big!</li>
    <li> They are too greatly huge to work in my hair.  You need a horses mane to keep them in.  There is no realistic size description when ordering, so I just threw $10 out the window!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use them.  Can&#x27;t return them.  What a waste!</li>
    <li> absolutely ugly and cheap!!  My hair gets caught in the clip and hard to get it out of my hair.</li>
    <li> These are huge - much larger than I expected.  I use the smaller version to pin curl my hair at night - with a spritz of water - my hair looks naturally curly in the morning.  Now for longer hair these will be perfect for making pin curls.</li>
    <li> These work great!  I have fine hair, which is always slipping out my clips, but these stay tight and keep my hair in place.</li>
    <li> These are a lot BIGGER than I expected.  But, after the initial surprise, I really love them.  I use them in my daughters&#x27; hair.  Very functional.--Lisa</li>
    <li> I have some trouble clipping my hair up because it is on the fine/thin side but these really do the trick.  I wish you could bu a pack of one color, but minor detail.</li>
    <li> Someone on a fitness forum had recommended these to me to use to hold your hair in place while working out, and I really like them for that purpose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a great grip and are really strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that they came in matching pairs of two.  With this set, you get four different colors, which looks odd if you do want to wear two of them at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also don&#x27;t snag your hair or get caught on it.  I have fine, wavy hair, and these hold it (and my layers) in place.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and medium thick.  I have the hardest time finding clips that hold and stay for any amount of time.  After reading the reviews, I was hopeful but now, once again, I am disappointed :(</li>
    <li> These clips are okay, but you need to know that it takes two to hold your hair if it&#x27;s pulled straight back.</li>
    <li> I bought these clips because the ones I have are about 2 years old. These are a little bigger which is what I wanted because I wanted to use less bobby pins. The only issue I have is the one I&#x27;ve used so far has peeling paint. I have only been using it for a week, and while I figured this would happen, after a week seems crappy. I doubt I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
    <li> These clips were bigger than I expected, used to the medium size. but worked well regardless. good for long hair</li>
    <li> So far, the best clips of this kind I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The standard contour clips ALWAYS pull out a hair when I use them - I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t just throw them all out.  These - so far - have not done it once.  And the slight curve to the design makes them hug the side of your head really nicely. Really pretty colours, too - I ordered two packs so I could have matching sets.</li>
    <li> these are the best clips for my hair i have found!  i have very fine, whispy hair.  these clips catch and hold the sides up off my ears.  i am very pleased.  they close almost flat all the way across the clip, unlike some which have a larger space which does not hold anything and one end.  they are large, but not too large and take the place of 2 smaller clips that i used to have to put in.</li>
    <li> I love these clips. I use them to hold up the hair under my pony tail, and they are long enough to use two to hold up all my hair off my neck. They are easy to clip in and remove, without pulling my hair. I love, love them. The colors are ok, but they function so well, I don&#x27;t mind the colors. I wish they came with four that matched, rather than three colors.</li>
    <li> My sister looked for these everywhere and finally found them on line.  These are large and just right for thin or thick hair.</li>
    <li> These work fine but they are enormous. Most people don&#x27;t want clips this large in their hair unless you want an industrial look.</li>
    <li> These are quite large! But they do the job nicely for my thin, slippery straight hair!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay put as long as I would have liked for our Asian thick hair, but does a better job than the others that claim that they are non slip. They were large in size, but I did not pay attention to description when I purchased it and I&#x27;m going to look for the smaller versions. It&#x27;s a good sturdy clip.</li>
    <li> These says &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34;... They are huge.  If you&#x27;re looking to clip back an entire side of your hair, these are the ones you want to use.  They are too big for &amp;#34;clip your bangs back&amp;#34;.  But, they are really strong and have good grip, even on slick hair.</li>
    <li> these stay put, a must have hair clip. I use them nearly every day and will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. They are huge. Each clip measures approximately 2.5-2.75 inches long, and is a little over 3/4 inch wide (top side). The under side has looks like a hair comb, and that part is wider than the top (a little over an inch wide). The hair comb under side is the reason the hair stays put. My daughter has the thickest hair I have ever seen. Mine is thick too. These hold and stay put all day for both of us. My only complaint is that it only comes with one of each color. If you are looking to have a set of each color, you need to order 2.</li>
    <li> a little big but they do work well. easy to put in and they stay put. two of mine look like they are the same color so could wear as a pair, but i usually only wear one at a time anyway.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these comb clips. The combs on the back of the clip make it so easy to lock my thick hair into place. You can use them for lots of different styles, but my favorite is to simply keep my hair that&#x27;s too short for a ponytail in place.</li>
    <li> i have very thick hair, so i needed a clip to pull back my bangs, and i read the reviews on these clips, and decided to purchase it and glad i did. great clips..totally recommend it..</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got these. They work great! I like that I can pin more hair back for ea. clip!</li>
    <li> A little too shiner than I expected, but work perfectly</li>
    <li> One of the clips arrived broken, so I only had 3 usable barrettes.  I was disappointed, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle and cost of returning the product.</li>
    <li> Ordered for a gift - they were exactly what I needed - I&#x27;m glad to have such things as add on items too</li>
    <li> These clips are medium sized &amp; easy to use.  Just clip &#x27;em on and keep my hair in place without fuss or bulk or weight.</li>
    <li> Hold hair great with more comfort than other clips.</li>
    <li> I wear hair clips every day and these three pronged don&#x27;t budge!  I will never go back to the standard hair clip.  These are great!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite hair clips. I bought a pack then could not find them again. I use them so much that the paint on them has worn off some &amp; I have had to touch them up w/ brown nail polish. My hair is very fine &amp; flighty so need something good. I do something athletic most days so can&#x27;t stand my hair getting in my way and they DO NOT slip out.  I&#x27;m a small female &amp; they contour around my head so don&#x27;t appear too bulky for me. I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t have to pay $4.00 for them before but nothing else works nearly as well so they&#x27;re worth it to me.</li>
    <li> these are big - about 2-3 inches in length and 1.5 inches wide. really good for holding up a good amount of hair. i wish i would have known about these sooner!</li>
    <li> Finally something for thicker hair!  My girls love these.  Will definately order more of these for my girls.  They fit great</li>
    <li> I use these to keep my hair back playing tennis.  Unlike other snap clips (the oval kind) these stay right where I put them no matter how active I am.  They work very well in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> first had this type clip a few years, they are perfect, hold in place.  I love them</li>
    <li> I know it says \\&quot;Large\\&quot; in its description but I didn&#x27;t realize how large they were going to be!!!  They are HUGE!!!  I was so surprised when I opened up the package.  I have no use for this size clip but it is also not worth returning them.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They hold more hair in place and stay put well. Seem well made and durable, but I guess only time will tell if that&#x27;s truly the case.</li>
    <li> they are not at all effective as regular hair clips. You need to put a fairly large amount of hair in to get them to hold properly, so you need to use them as a styling tool as opposed to something to just keep your hair out of your face</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect these clips to be so big!</li>
    <li> I like that the clips hold my thick heavy hair without falling or sliding out.  The color us nice too.</li>
    <li> These hold my thin hair in place, does not weigh my hair down and they&#x27;re comfortable unlike a big hair holder.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy these clips because they hold my fine, Celtic hair without cutting it. A really great product for me!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t pinch, which is essential. They lay nice and flat against your head and look classy, as well as holding my fine hair tightly. I&#x27;m thinking about buying the large size as well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful for soft and somewhat thin hair.  Most clips slip out easily, but these clips hold tight all day.  The little drops of glue-like sticky stuff holds the clips better than any I&#x27;ve used before and do not stick to the hair when the clips are taken out.  Shipping was super fast, and I highly recommend these clips.</li>
    <li> These clips work really well at holding fine curly hair up and in place. They are much less bulky than a clip and reliable than bobby pins. I&#x27;m going to buy more.</li>
    <li> They look stunning and hold my hair (which is thick and curly), which is saying a lot. I like how classy they look too, beautiful colors!</li>
    <li> I needed some clips to hold the little pieces of hair off my neck when I put my hair in a ponytail. They&#x27;re big enough that one holds the hair up like I need.</li>
    <li> These clips are nice and big and hold lots of thick hair. Love these clips.</li>
    <li> perfect for thick hair</li>
    <li> These clips are amazing, so strong! The colors are pretty too, I wish there were sold in pairs of the same colors.</li>
    <li> Great clips for my toddlers hair... wish they made fun kid barrettes</li>
    <li> Holds my hair well but the paint chips off very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also amazon description says 2 black and 2 brown. That&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s 4 different colors so if you want to wear 2 at a time and have them match, you have to buy multiple packs, like I did. Since they are chipping, I will try to spray paint them all black so they match.</li>
    <li> These clips are amazing! I have long, thick curly hair and these clips hold well and never fall off. They are strong and sturdy, yet light.</li>
    <li> I have african american curly natural hair. the clips work as advertised. It does not hold went hair well. and after several uses the pain flakes off in your hair. Even the black clips. so the color is useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a great hair clip &amp; I ran across this one at walmart and bought to give it a try, thinking I would most likely return them. But no..... these are the best hair clips I&#x27;ve ever used!! Use them almost every day. They hold up in my thin hair &amp; never slide off like other clips. I&#x27;ve been using these for the last 2 years, Walmart were the only ones that carried them &amp; I would buy a packs every time I could. Other stores &amp; beauty supplies carry them too now, pretty much the same price :)&lt;br /&gt;Not too crazy for the color mix though, I give away the gold &amp; light brown ones :(&lt;br /&gt;Would be great if they sold them by color choice, dark brown is what I used the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color on these clips tend to peel off if you use them in water. I still save them thinking someday I will spray them all dark brown in case they stop making them. I keep them every where, in my car, purse, travel bag, just in case I need them.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t emagine being without these clips!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for this long review, had to write something when I saw these clips</li>
    <li> I have to keep my hair under control while I&#x27;m at work, so I have to keep trying new ways to clip my hair down. Found these in Walmart one day and decided to try em out. THEY ARE AMAZING! The ones I bought came in a six-pack with two blonde, two brown and two black clips. I lost a black one, so I&#x27;ve been getting away with wearing the two brown ones (it needs to match my hair color, which is black). I recently broke down and decided to buy TWO MORE packs, because I rely so heavily on these clips. They are hands-down the best clips I&#x27;ve used in years!</li>
    <li> These clips are great! The clips sit close to the head, as they should. They can hold more hair than other similar clips. They stay in place and don&#x27;t get hairs stuck in them. I recently purchased another brand that kept getting my hairs stuck in them, it drove me nuts!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 2.5 and we needed something to hold her hair as we grew her bags out.  her hair is more than half way down her back so she has a lot of hair for her age and it kept falling in her face as other clips fell out.  This is the best clip I have found so far.  Wife and I picked out about 5 different clips on here to try and these were the best.  A little bigger than expected but they worked great.  The size actually helps us keep from loosing them.  when we buy more these are all we will get.</li>
    <li> These are much better than regular bobby pins, which is what I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy and cute. I don&#x27;t care that they don&#x27;t match my hair color, but some users may.</li>
    <li> I love these clips bc there r 3 underside teeth-like holds and r larger than the single ones. I would never want to go back to the single teeth clip</li>
    <li> These clips catch hair and tear it. You can&#x27;t get the hair out. You just have to let the clip break the hair pieces. The top of the clip where the metal is attached to itself in a point is where the problem is. Not good hair clips! Don&#x27;t buy these!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> ...clips are strong and tight and can tangle in the hair.  The bare metal and sharp edges seem likely to damage fine hair.  Mine went to the thrift shop.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I bought these clips to help keep a rather large and unwieldy headpiece on during a dance performance.  I was wowed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headpiece I needed to attach was a very three dimensional, fabric, stuffed, awkward piece.  It had a thin elastic band that went under the chin.  If you just used the elastic band, the heavy headpiece would fall to the front or the back.  If you used regular &amp;#34;normal-sized&amp;#34; clips, you could clip them to the elastic and your hair, but then it would just pull your hair when the headpiece fell off.  And if you tried to clip them to the headpiece itself, the clips would pop because of their size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really large clips not only stayed put, but they did a great job of holding the headpiece to the hair with no tugging or pulling.  We didn&#x27;t have a single costume malfunction with these clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping a set on hand for future performances.</li>
    <li> These clips do keep hair in place well. They are 4 different finishes and I would like to wear one on each side sometimes so I am going to order another set so I&#x27;ll have two of each finish.  They are much more attractive than bobby pins and not childish looking.  They work!</li>
    <li> The clips work good in holding my hair and they are a nice big size.  Sadly it came unwelded in the center point and I could no longer use this as a set of matching clips</li>
    <li> these are easy to use and carry around whenever you need a little extra help to manage a bad hair day</li>
    <li> Great size clips, they hold ok for larger amounts of hair, for thin hair it kind of slips sometimes. Four large clips, for the price id&#x27; expect it to be a bit better..</li>
    <li> These are the best hair clips for holding back bangs, hands down. They&#x27;re not completely flat like other hair clips so they can hang onto a sizable chunk of hair, and the best part is that they don&#x27;t slip! I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other brands, and Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s are definitely the best.</li>
    <li> This is the only clips I&#x27;ve bought that I loved. It can clip tight and doesn&#x27;t look bad.</li>
    <li> I like big clips and this keep my hair were I want it.  Would like to order more when I can.</li>
    <li> Versatile clips that hold all day, very comfortably. I&#x27;ve even used these to section my hair when dying it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These stay in my hair better than many other clips and don&#x27;t pinch!  However, they still peel after a couple months, so you&#x27;ll need to replace them like every other clip, it seems.</li>
    <li> Wish it were cheaper though.</li>
    <li> Best clip I found for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great clips and very big. They are not made for thin hair. With my hair, they tend to fall out.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
    <li> These clips just dont have enough grip and they hold very little hair. Was looking for something stronger that would last al day without readjusting.</li>
    <li> These are larger than I had expected, I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to the description. They are about 2 inches long.  That said, they work just as well as the smaller version I love and will hold a surprising amount of hair.  The clips also hold well, for long periods. Like, 8 hours long.  Great product.</li>
    <li> cute, they are big and can pull hair a little. I am growing out a pixie so they are needed for my hair.</li>
    <li> These would be five star, IF the colors matched. Otherwise perfect for very thin hair &amp; WILL hold that kind of hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these barrettes!!!!  You put them in and they stay where you put them and do not slip loose. Great concept!!!!</li>
    <li> I have heavy, thick, wavy hair.  I&#x27;d hoped that these, being big, would help hold my hair - no, they do not.  If you have light, thin hair, I think they&#x27;ll work very well - but might slide down due to the weight of the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them of little use.</li>
    <li> been using these all summer to hold my long hair up off my neck.  They work so nicely to hold my fine silky hair up.  I have quite a collection of barrettes and bands that do not work.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to find clips that work so well.</li>
    <li> It does a good job holding my fine &amp; silky hair. Now I am waiting to order another set (this item will be my filler for free shipping) so I can have a pair of each color.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the small clips, and these turned out to be giant.  WAY too big for my baby fine hair, but the design itself is perfect.  Excellent design for fine hair but stick to the small ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that they hold thick hair, not many barrettes are large enough to. They do slide out over the course of the day. Also, they are all different colors. I was hoping they&#x27;d be two matching pairs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything better on the market for holding hair in place then these kind of hair clips. They come in 3 sizes but I love the LARGE sizes the best. I also like the next size down, MEDIUM, but I find the SMALLest size pretty useless. Once they are in the hair they don&#x27;t look that big as the pictures look here out of the hair because the broad under prongs go under the hair and only the single &#x27;V&#x27; shaped top prong shows on top of the hair, so once put them in the hair they look like a small single clip. The prongs have little acrylic like type bubbles that really hold the hair in place once they close. The paint job on them does eventually peal or chip off. It is too bad because the different colors are nice for blending in with the color of your hair or maybe a scarf you are securing in your hair. I had to buy two packs of these LARGE size to get pairs of matching colors. On each card there are 4 single colors, so buy to cards to get matching pairs of clips. THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE but they are WORTH EVERY CENT you pay. I just don&#x27;t understand why they are so expensive though.</li>
    <li> Wow, these are big.  I was using the smaller ones and really could not appreciate the difference in size until I received these.  It is easy to use and keeps the hair in place.  My complaint is that I have dark hair and only receive one dark barrette per pack, which makes them pretty expensive.  They give you 2 light ones, one gray and one black.  Really?  You should have a choice of the color you buy.  I will try to get a picture comparing the sizes and upload it.  If you have unruly hair, this is a great item.</li>
