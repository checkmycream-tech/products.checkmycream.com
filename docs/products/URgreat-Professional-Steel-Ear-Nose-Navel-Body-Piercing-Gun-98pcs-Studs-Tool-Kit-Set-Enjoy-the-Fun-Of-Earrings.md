      <li>the mirror was not conected well, it came on time, the gun works nicely and the studs are perfect</li>
      <li>and it worked good</li>
      <li>Mostly before bed!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>and you cant ask much more than this for the price, I recommend it!</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made...worth the price.</li>
      <li>Not something you want to redo for sure.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly for ears and ears ONLY.</li>
      <li>and I  love it.</li>
      <li>But I have successfully infected my families new piercings...</li>
      <li>Just make sure you clean your peircings once or twice a day.</li>
      <li>it was quick easy and almost painless love</li>
      <li>and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>I thought my ear wouldnt even fit in it</li>
      <li>Cheap earrings and</li>
      <li>I pierced my nose and it hasnt gotten infected and it was fast and quick!</li>
      <li>Shipping does take about a month but its worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>For the price it was worth the buy.</li>
      <li>This was SO worth the money.</li>
      <li>, when I opened it it wasn&#x27;t attached at all, but other than that it works good, and I say you get what you pay for</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve sterilized the earrings that came with it, pierce and change earrings right away.  </li>
      <li>but it came with some nice sturdy gun easy to figure out how to use once you play with it a little since there are no instructions the studs are nice and sharp for piercing the backs fit nicely in the gun just make sure to line the back up with the stud before pulling back the gun readying it to pierce</li>
      <li>At first I didnt know how to use it.</li>
      <li>The gun is good, I&#x27;ve tightened the tension on it and have done quite a few piercings.</li>
      <li>The first piercing went great, the second one the gun jammed and the earring went halfway through.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this product because you can&#x27;t really see where you are piercing</li>
      <li>The earrings do not stay perfectly straight when loaded.  </li>
      <li>I really wanna give this a 3 1/2 star rating.  </li>
      <li>The trigger part doesn&#x27;t close enough to fit my earlobe.</li>
      <li>i would recommend to anyone who wants to save some money and do it yourself</li>
      <li>they are the only ones that fit in the gun</li>
      <li>Ours fell and comprised more than half of the earings.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anybody</li>
      <li>not properly sterilized and the studs dont fit in the gun properly it allows for movement upon piercing</li>
      <li>I do recommend the moment you open it, put all the loose earing into a container with secure lid.  </li>
      <li>but it looks great and everything was in it and nothing broken or missing</li>
      <li>Mine was broken right out of the package!!</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; real let down</li>

    <li> Worked great, but there was no instructions so it took awhile to figure it out. The first piercing went great, the second one the gun jammed and the earring went halfway through. Had to released Pierce it again with the gun. For the price it was worth the buy.</li>
    <li> neatly packaged i was prepared to have to by backs for the studs but it came with some nice sturdy gun easy to figure out how to use once you play with it a little since there are no instructions the studs are nice and sharp for piercing the backs fit nicely in the gun just make sure to line the back up with the stud before pulling back the gun readying it to pierce i pierced my ears it was quick easy and almost painless love this i would recommend to anyone who wants to save some money and do it yourself</li>
    <li> Junk broke all up .....said navel.nose body peirceing studs for gun not long enoufh navel too big nose mis rep.this mirror broke off case .marker dried up ...studs all l size and bent ...bend to straighten break !&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; real let down</li>
    <li> This was horrible the first time I pulled the trigger back the gun broke, I never got to use it!!! :(</li>
    <li> I really wanna give this a 3 1/2 star rating.  The gun is good, I&#x27;ve tightened the tension on it and have done quite a few piercings. My problem with it is it only holds one earring. The earrings that came with it I don&#x27;t care for and they aren&#x27;t sterile.  I bought sterile earrings and the gun won&#x27;t hold them. So I&#x27;ve sterilized the earrings that came with it, pierce and change earrings right away.  I will be checking other guns out, I really want one that will hold different earrings or at least one&#x27;s that are already sterlized.</li>
    <li> the mirror was not conected well, it came on time, the gun works nicely and the studs are perfect...good backs too!</li>
    <li> I tried this and I  love it. I pierced my nose. It didn&#x27;t hurt one bit.</li>
    <li> Crappist thing ever it got stuck while i pierced it through and i couldn&#x27;t get it off i almost lost my ear! DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> not properly sterilized and the studs dont fit in the gun properly it allows for movement upon piercing</li>
    <li> does it come with starter earings</li>
    <li> The earrings do not stay perfectly straight when loaded.  One time, it went very crooked and I had to remove the earring from my friend, let it heal up, and do it again the next week.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for ears and ears ONLY. Dont attempt to pierce any thing other.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I would highly recommend this to anybody</li>
    <li> I do not like this item</li>
    <li> Box was cracked and pen didn&#x27;t write, but they aren&#x27;t even necessary anyway.  I do recommend the moment you open it, put all the loose earing into a container with secure lid.  Ours fell and comprised more than half of the earings.</li>
    <li> mirror was also broke</li>
    <li> The gun does not fit safety back ear rings and the ear rings that came with it didnt have any backs.</li>
    <li> This was SO worth the money. I peirced my my second ear hole, cartilage and my nose and NO infection or any problems at all. Just make sure you clean your peircings once or twice a day. Mostly before bed! and no problems. At first I didnt know how to use it. I thought my ear wouldnt even fit in it and it was crappy then I realized you have to pull the back of the gun backward! thank god I figured that out. So when you get it theres a knob on the back of the gun and if you twist it itll mqake the gun peirce slower or faster and you have to pull it all the way back for it to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got everything out of it that it said it would come with. I changed the studs to earings after 1 hour and it worked fine. Shipping does take about a month but its worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Did not go all the way through ear lobe. Had to force ear ring through 2nd half of ear.</li>
    <li> does not work at all it was a piece of crap</li>
    <li> Cheap earrings and they are the only ones that fit in the gun so this is pointless. But I have successfully infected my families new piercings...</li>
    <li> 4 day after I used it the gun not working well no more</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made...worth the price.</li>
    <li> Mine was broken right out of the package!! I had to mess with it and take it apart to get it to work. This gun misfires and the earring gets stuck in the gun almost everytime and you have to wiggle it out while keeping the earring in the ear. It still works just is a pain in the butt!! I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price. Was inexpensive and still pierces the ear.</li>
    <li> The trigger part doesn&#x27;t close enough to fit my earlobe. You may have to modify or it will shoot it into your ear crooked like it did mine.  Not something you want to redo for sure.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this product because you can&#x27;t really see where you are piercing</li>
    <li> Did‘t like this at all. The post we&#x27;ve plastic ans very small and hard to hold they are slippery. Would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Bought the gun, my Fiancé did her ear and her nose with it and it worked good, The stud does sit in it a little funny, it can move if you aren&#x27;t careful, that is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5, also the mirror looked like it was supposed to be glued to the case, when I opened it it wasn&#x27;t attached at all, but other than that it works good, and I say you get what you pay for and you cant ask much more than this for the price, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I pierced my nose and it hasnt gotten infected and it was fast and quick!</li>
    <li> have yet to use but it looks great and everything was in it and nothing broken or missing</li>
