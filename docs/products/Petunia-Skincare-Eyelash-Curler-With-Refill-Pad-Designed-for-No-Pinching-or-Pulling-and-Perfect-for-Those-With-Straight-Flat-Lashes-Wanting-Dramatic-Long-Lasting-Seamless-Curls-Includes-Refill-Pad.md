    <li> I do really loved this professional eyelash curler as it is very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;its non-slip as handle is rubberize.It is also durable and stylish perfect enough for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;does get curled lashes quickly and safety.Convenient to use and take everywhere as it is compact, perfectly fit in cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;great piece its very cute and girly.Very stylish eyelash curler.highly recommended its very useful and  best eyelash curler for eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided in review purposes.</li>
    <li> It is super girly , my wife love the color pink Eyelash Curler , i got something for her collection again , she loves pink stuff and this is really fit to her likes. Anyways shes satisfied on this product as what you can see it has a soft silicone pad applies the perfect pressure to curl big and bold lashes with a anti-slippage grip handles and does not pinch or pull and with an extra refill pad included in the package and for your information i got this for free after a promotional code applied on it</li>
    <li> I purchased this Professional Eyelash Curler because my eyelash curler wasn&#x27;t good enough for curling lashes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a new eyelash curler already,  good thing I found this one. After I tried using this eyelash curler I was so happy and surprised how nice and curled my lashes are. It&#x27;s easy to curl the lashes, no need to repeat it many times nor used a mascara because it will stay curl for long hours. This is perfect for those people who&#x27;s looking for an eyelash curler that will stay curl for longer, they might try this product specifically the brand itself. And I will post a before and after photos down below for you guys to see the difference and how good this professional eyelash curler is. I am absolutely satisfied of this product. I would love to recommend this to the people I know especially to those girls out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in exchange of my honest feedback of the product.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Was shipped right away and I started using it immediatly. I love the sponge feel on my eye lashes. It does not pinch the eye or anything. This is a very easy product to pick up right away. Fast and prompt service. Great. This product was free.</li>
    <li> Just received today for review for free for giving my honest feedback just used it really does work and curls your lashes to make them look longer fabulous product . Seller got the item to me on time and it was all in one piece came in nice packaging I give a 5 star rating</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is amazing! I just bought the shiseido one and was very disappointed. Something about this curler makes my lashes stand out and up so amazingly. I will be repurchasing over and over.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!! I tried a ton of them. They really curl mine. I have Asian eyes. Not too small but not big. I have them annoying straight Asian eyelashes. They get to the root of my lashes. They don&#x27;t pick at all. A lot of eyelash curlers I tried pinvh and hurt my eyes but this doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler does not pinch and is easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> So much safer feeling than those eyelash curlers with the spring! I love the design and the pink handles! Very easy to use - however, have to be cautious when opening so you don&#x27;t pinch your cheek (only done once!) but that depends on what angle you&#x27;re holding the curler. So happy I purchased this one after comparing several others! This is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many eye lash curler from drugstore and high end also. My favorite is from drugstore only. using this eye lash curler for almost two weeks i have pretty much used everyday. Cons; its easy to use, have a nice grip handle, reaches to very bottom of eye lashes, just in two holds of 5 second it gives nice curl to eyes lashes. so pretty much work exactly same as any other eye lash curler. nothing major of a difference i noticed after using it, so an average eye lash curler do what it supposed to do. i have received this product for review purposes, these are all my personal opinions. as far as i am purchasing this in future , no as you can get same exact thing at cheaper rate at drugstore.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work well, too expensive, doesn&#x27;t worth its price</li>
    <li> This curler seems to have a little bit less of a curve to it that the old stand-by of mine. I actually stopped using the old stand-by because it ALWAYS pinched the corner of my eye. No matter how I held it I would either pinch the corner or miss my lashes entirely.&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash Curler... where&#x27;s the pinch! I have been able to do my lashes and not pinch the inner corner once and I have a nice evn curl to my lashes. Something i have lacked for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;This curler comes with an extra pad that is a different color. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in it from the pink on the curler. I like the wide grip on the handles and smooth clasping motion. The handle is wide and rubber so you can have a firm grib and not have to stick your fingers in little awkward holes.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this eyelash curler at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have already told my friends about it! I highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> This is so nice. It curls my lashes easier then any of the other ones. The way it is shaped makes it easier to get to your lashes. It really doesn&#x27;t pinch your eyes or lashes.That is one reason why I didn&#x27;t  use eyelash curlers. Is because they would pinch and I couldn&#x27;t get all my lashes in. With  this curler,I will use it all the time. So easy and comfortable. It comes with an extra silicone pad. It is easy to grip and I like the hot pink color. Petunia Skincare Beauty Tools are backed up with a lifetime guarantee.Which is really nice.I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AND HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> It curls my eye lashes perfectly and stays from morning till night with the perfect mascara. Its not painful. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I really like how this feels in my hand and how easily it curls my lashes.  I threw the old regular ones I had in the trash.  I highly recomment this.</li>
    <li> The Petunia Skincare Professional Eyelash Curler was easy to use. The handles helped prevent the tool from slipping during use. After using this, eyelashes stayed curled all day.&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review, disclosed as per FTC guidelines.</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that this curler really helps curl my eyelashes.Its not painful unlike the other eyelash curlers!</li>
    <li> The worst eyelash curler I have ever bought! Do not purchase it. It has cut off part of my upper kid eyelashes on the right side. The rubber is far too hard. I have been curling my eyelashes for over 10 years. This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me. I am horrified! This is a terrible product that is badly made. It just looks &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It works like all the other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve had. Didn&#x27;t notice any major improvement with  the higher price.</li>
    <li> Worst eyelash curler I have ever used.  Pulled my lashes out and what it did not pull out, it didnt even curl very well.  I cant believe this product has so many 5 star reviews..some kind of scam I think.  Dont waste your money on this.  Im so happy I have my trusty Japonesque curler, I didnt know how good it was until I tried this one.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f7cf4531b4e2c418cfca45102e0d4589]]I received a sample for evaluation, and all opinions are my own.      A classic eyelash curling tool with cute, pink rubber grips.      -Excellent spring action, and very nice quality.    -A true must-have beauty tool to make your eyelashes stand out.      I&#x27;ve used a really cheap mascara in my before &amp; after picture. The better the mascara,  I am sure the better the results will be.      I am now using this curler with Act 5&#x27;s Fiber Mascara($10), and the results are much more dramatic.  You can see the mascara and my new before &amp; after pictures here: [[ASIN:B00UU27G0K ACT5 Studio Effect Mascara - Black]]      A good eyelash curler should last you years. So, far it&#x27;s a great little curler. However, I wish it did come with extra rubber  strips, in case the one it came with fell out. They are replaceable.</li>
    <li> Creates wonderful lashes. The silicon pad helps to keep the mascara from sticking to the pad, the silicon pad also looks like it will really last longer before it needs to be replace. My old eyelash curler pulled some of my lashes which I totally hate, this curler is ouch free. The handle is easy to grip.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Works well.  But it can pinch if you put it too close to lash base.  Otherwise very nice.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:4737e1301376a5b525eb4daabe0cabea]] Check out my video review of the Petunia Skin Care Professional Eyelash Curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler works great to give your eyelashes that perfect lift and curl. Simply squeeze the eyelash curler onto your eyelashes for several seconds for perfectly curled lashes. This curler feels like very high quality. It is very comfortable to use with the silicone grip handles. It also has a silicone pad and a spare replacement pad comes in the package. The eyelash curler is a beautiful pink color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this eyelash curler. It works great and looks great, too.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no cost for review purposes.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34; essence &amp;#34; of the curler is great..BUT..upon opening package the pink &amp;#34; guard &amp;#34; came off &amp; the advertised replacement guard was not in package</li>
    <li> Got this for discount of review. I have tried many eye lash curlers in the past and has not been a fun experience for me. I was hoping for something a little different by getting this. I was surprised that it was different. It was nice rubber pads. The handles are very nice to handle. The openings are a great size and with my hand/joint issues it was really great that I didn&#x27;t have to put much force into it. I got a great curl on my lashes. It was so great to find one I could actually use without any issues.</li>
    <li> Works great! Bought two so I could do both eyes at the same time. Great for stiff hands</li>
    <li> The Petunia Skincare Eyelash Curler is a great curler for a great price of just under $13. I have been using a curler I bought for $5 at Walmart- a Revlon silver one. When I clean it, there&#x27;s always eyelashes in the crack of the plastic pad, and it&#x27;s always pinching me.&lt;br /&gt;The Petunia Skincare curler is better than your average drugstore cheap-o curler. The silicone pad is nice and thick so there&#x27;s a good curling action, but there&#x27;s no crack in it to pull and keep your eyelashes. The handles are nail-clipper style instead of loops, and I think it helps not pull your lashes out, because if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re moving your fingers around in loop-style curlers and you end up pulling your lashes. With the free handle nail clipper style you can pinch comfortably.There&#x27;s also sort of a spring in The Petunia curler so it runs smoothly. Great curler!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion but I&#x27;d be willing to pay the extra money for this over my Revlon eyelash curler for the nice quality and to save my lashes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried out several of my mom&#x27;s old eyelash curlers and none of them are as easy to use and as smooth as this one. It&#x27;s spring loaded and allowed me to get quick painless free eyelash curling. Big rubbery thumb grips allow for easy access for people with bigger hands and prevent slippage. Overall this is efficient and great. I can now show the beauty of my eyes without any hassle! Easy for the very few guys like me who actually use these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank the manufacturer for providing me with a review sample. All opinions and experiences are genuine and my own.</li>
    <li> I love this product already. It is very strong and sturdy this may be my favorite eyelash curler out of my other 3 I have. Its an amazing product so far if I do encounter any problems within a week I will be back to write another review.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eyelash curlers I have ever owned! The silicone rubber handles have an amazing grip; and the soft silicone pads have the perfect amount of pressure. I can honestly say I feel safe curling my eyelashes with this curler. I am not worried about the curler cutting off, pinching or pulling my eyelashes out. I love the hot pink color, its super fun. Note- I did not have any mascara on, and wow I can see a difference!</li>
    <li> Really thought this was going to be better than the standard drug store eye lash curler but it&#x27;s not. It doesn&#x27;t curl very well, especially the inside/outside corners. I&#x27;ll be going back to my revlon. Also, I paid for this product, didn&#x27;t get it for free. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Works really well but it is quite large on my eyelids and I need to position just right or else I pinch my skin.</li>
    <li> The appliance is good and it works fine.  It&#x27;s my eyelashes I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler came in a broken case, the handle part was sticking out of the box. I also compared the the eyelash curler I got to the picture above and the one I have has a much wider grip. For some reason the curler I have also smells. I am extremely unhappy with the product and will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I really love these, very comfortable and easy for me to use, which is a primary consideration for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger and the design of these allow me to get a good grip on the tool but not pinch my eyelid while using it. Curling was very good to excellent and for me the curl was most pronounced on the outer third of the eyelash line. Without loops on the grip, I found these fit really well into my consmetic bag and likely will be my go to when I have to pack lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a free sample to review for my opinion. This one is a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Received the eyelash curler yesterday 8/26 and tested it out this morning 8/27 while getting ready for work. I noticed that the eyelash curler has a spring on it so that when you crimp the curler it easily opens back up on it&#x27;s own with is a great feature. It also has the silicone grip on the ends. With my other curler, I have to open up the curler manually and it doesn&#x27;t have the grips at the ends. This curler is really amazing. While putting it up to my eye I was bracing myself for the pinch, but it never happened! It&#x27;s really easy to use. You get a nice curl on your eyelash. You also get an extra replacement pad for the curler. I&#x27;m really happy with the eyelash curler! This will be my go to eyelash curler.  **This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

    <li> I don&#x27;t typically use an eyelash curler because I don&#x27;t usually need one. I tried it and it worked great. It came with I guess what is a replacement pad, I&#x27;m not quite sure if that&#x27;s what it is or not. There are instructions but they don&#x27;t say what the extra piece is. I suppose if you use a curler often you would know what it is. I was offered the item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review. But, I did like it and how it made my lashes look. I had been in the pool all day and just swiped a bit of mascara on and curled them real quick to see how they looked and they looked great!</li>
    <li> Comfortable to use. Easy to find amongst my beauty tools because of the hot pink color.</li>
    <li> Listen, this is not only a wonderful product that is built well and works really smoothly but the customer service blew me away! They are really caring, and follow through really well. I will buy anything I can from them! You should to, you will be delighted!</li>
    <li> WIFE BOUGHT AT PROMOTIONAL PRICE, ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND LOOKS GOOD. NOE ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS GROW SOME EYELASHES - HA!</li>
    <li> The best choice i have ever made .General instructions for a perfect curve. .Eyelash curlers work best on clean eyelashes. Make sure eyelashes are free of mascara. If necessary, use eye makeup remover to remove old mascara.With your blowdryer on low heat, blow air on the curler for no more than 5 seconds. Touch the metal. If it&#x27;s hot, let it cool for a few seconds. You don&#x27;t want to burn your eyelid.Open the curler, clamp lashes near the roots. Hold for 10-30 seconds. Never curl lashes after you apply mascara -- as the mascara dries, lashes can stick to the curler &amp; be torn from the roots. Don&#x27;t bother curling bottom lashes.Repeat on the other eye..The curve is perfect for my eyes .I would definitely include in my regular beauty routine.I received for free or disconted to test .</li>
    <li> I really love these eyelash curler it never pinches and it make my eyes look wider and brighter. With these curler I had no problem hitting the tip of my eyelash and reaching the base, while missing my eyelid. It did works perfectly. It&#x27;s handle was made of silicone rubber which is easy to  grip and comfortable to hold. Great product all around! Would definitely recommend this to my friends as a must have. I got this for free in exchange with my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This writer lash curlers is really everything it says it is and three reviewers were right. No punching, easy application, great curl. If I use regular mascara, I lose a little bit of curl at some point in the day but if I use water proof mascara, the curl stays exactly as when I first applied the mascara. It is a great bargain, you get way more for your money. I also have the shu uemura lash curler and this one is just as good but half the price.</li>
    <li> Tried this as soon as I got it.  Love it!  Curls with ease and no pinching.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for testing but, would gladly buy it.</li>
    <li> I stayed away from eyelash curling after disliking it in the past, but this was offered to me as a free sample to review (with my honest opinion, of course) and I was curious to see if it could really be that much nicer. I guess this just proves that nothing works as well as it could when you&#x27;re using cheap equipment, because this was a much better experience than I&#x27;d had in the past. The silicone makes it more comfortable to grip and keeps it from being pinchy, but it still does a great job. The bright color also makes it look a bit nicer sitting among the makeup, of course.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a really good eyelash curler.  The handles on it are extremely nice.  They grip really well in hand.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy.  I have had some that just don&#x27;t work that well because they slip off easy or the handles make it awkward.  That is not the case with these.  I received these for free with the contingency that I give my honest opinion.  That is exactly what this is.</li>
    <li> got this item at discounted price. i like how it doesnt pull off my lashes and love the color too!</li>
