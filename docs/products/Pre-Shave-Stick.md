      <li>It use to perform beautifully.  </li>
      <li>It works great.  </li>
      <li>Great product for pre-shave with an electric razor.</li>
      <li>It was great and when it was used up, I searched for another one, but to no avail.  </li>
      <li>dunno if my shaver is that great though.  </li>
      <li>The product of Remmington face saver is remarkable.</li>
      <li>so I can wash it off good.</li>
      <li>So cheap and so good!</li>
      <li>It is also very handy and easy to keep.</li>
      <li>It feels nice and soothing to the skin even as a powder.</li>
      <li>Add me to the list of people thrilled with the way this stuff improves an electric shave.</li>
      <li>Mostly, I resorted to just shaving with an electric shaver with no pre-shave at all and still got good results, but it took a toll on my face.  </li>
      <li>Most Noble</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;ve found it again and love it.</li>
      <li>and I still love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these pre-shave sticks for more than 20 years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m placing an order for more of them</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re probably better off with one of the liquid based pre-shaves if your face can tolerate it.</li>
      <li>However, does result in more detritus during shaving that ends up on my shirt.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>aftershave lotion is better to me.</li>
      <li>The razer glides across the face more easily just like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>Remmington facer saver washes away very easy and it is also easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
      <li>I find that these powder sticks make shaving a bit easier and more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Cleaning the shaving heads after shaving is also easy.</li>
      <li>This powder stick removes the excess oils from your face and allows your electric razor to glide smoothly over your stubble.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much, just a light swipe across your stubble and shave it all off.  </li>
      <li>Simple, yet effective.</li>
      <li>It actually saves and helps the skin,I strongly recommend this product to any man espeacially and man with strong masculan sense of feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, I was stuck with fluid pre-shaves and I tried many of them, including William&#x27;s Pre-Electric.  </li>
      <li>The razor glides more smoothly across my face and the little hairs just stand up and begged to be cut.</li>
      <li>The combination of my Phillips Norelco triple head rotary shaver and Remington Face Saver powder have pretty much solved my problem.</li>
      <li>We haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for a long time.  </li>
      <li>shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like this stick.</li>
      <li>found just ok, alittle messy, powder gets all over shirt and tie and counter, not sure why so many excited people.</li>
      <li>The mild scent is similar and the stick is much firmer.</li>
      <li>It has gotten impossible to find them in stores, so online is the best way to get them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>All it does is gum up my new panasonic razor.  </li>
      <li>kinda wish i would not have got 3 since i may be getting a new rotary shaver soon.</li>
      <li>I just tried it for the first time, and the difference is immediate and obvious.</li>
      <li>Years ago I used old spice shaving talc.</li>
      <li>good product, but is is expensive.  </li>
      <li>The powder does exactly what it needs to and gives your skin a very dry texture with which it makes it easier to shave.  </li>
      <li>I am an African American male and this does help keep my skin smooth after using my electric shaver and I also do have curly facial hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda messy, but not bad.  </li>
      <li>Have used  these for years, quality is always the same, price is right in the six pack quantity compared to other stores.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of my old English Leather stick, but is not scented.  </li>
      <li>They were all ok, but not great.</li>
      <li>And when the airlines started limiting fluids onboard, the fuid pre-shave took up valuable space in my little plastic bag of fluids and gels needed for trips, if I could get one in the right size to even qualify for the bag.  </li>
      <li>The powder is much less irritating and far more comfortable and less messy than solutions and gels/ foams.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Add me to the list of people thrilled with the way this stuff improves an electric shave. I just tried it for the first time, and the difference is immediate and obvious. The razor glides more smoothly across my face and the little hairs just stand up and begged to be cut. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. So cheap and so good!</li>
    <li> reviews suggested they had dispensed with the perfume odor.  Not.    Product works well, improves glide over the face and decreases irritation.    However, does result in more detritus during shaving that ends up on my shirt.    The perfume smell sits on my face all day, and I have to put up with it. Ick. I can wash it off with soap and water, but I got an electric shaver to avoid that.    If the perfume was removed, I would give it 4-1/2 stars.    Hey Product Makers: get rid of perfumes!</li>
    <li> It works. The razer glides across the face more easily just like it&#x27;s supposed to. I didn&#x27;t like the scent so I use it before my shower so I can wash it off good.</li>
    <li> This powder stick removes the excess oils from your face and allows your electric razor to glide smoothly over your stubble. If you have acne or bump problems, this stick is a godsend. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product for pre-shave with an electric razor. I have used this product for over 40 years as well as my father before me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these pre-shave sticks for more than 20 years and I still love them. It has gotten impossible to find them in stores, so online is the best way to get them.</li>
    <li> This for some reason does not work for me. Not a close shave at all.  I bought it because of all the rave reviews.  All it does is gum up my new panasonic razor.  Years ago I used old spice shaving talc. It use to perform beautifully.  To bad they do not make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Have used  these for years, quality is always the same, price is right in the six pack quantity compared to other stores.</li>
    <li> The product of Remmington face saver is remarkable.Remmington face saver is one the best product I have ever used. I have tried face gaurd and serveral others and they just did not seem to  compare to face saver. It feels nice and soothing to the skin even as a powder.It is also very handy and easy to keep.Remmington facer saver washes away very easy and it is also easy to clean up afterwards.It actually saves and helps the skin,I strongly recommend this product to any man espeacially and man with strong masculan sense of feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Tyson Angel&lt;br /&gt;  Most Noble</li>
    <li> Long ago I had a powder pre-shave stick from English Leather that came as part of a package with other shaving items.  It was great and when it was used up, I searched for another one, but to no avail.  So, I was stuck with fluid pre-shaves and I tried many of them, including William&#x27;s Pre-Electric.  They were all ok, but not great. Sometimes when I had small cuts on my hand, the fluid stuff would sting my hands.  Mostly, I resorted to just shaving with an electric shaver with no pre-shave at all and still got good results, but it took a toll on my face.  And when the airlines started limiting fluids onboard, the fuid pre-shave took up valuable space in my little plastic bag of fluids and gels needed for trips, if I could get one in the right size to even qualify for the bag.  So, I started searching again for the powder stick type and discovered the Remington Facesaver and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It reminds me of my old English Leather stick, but is not scented.  It works great.  You don&#x27;t need much, just a light swipe across your stubble and shave it all off.  The powder collects in the shaving head and acts as a constant lubricant for the spinning cutting surface and is easy on the face.  Some powder does fall down while shaving, but it is not too messy.  Cleaning the shaving heads after shaving is also easy. I really like this stick. It travels well and treats my face well.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this product years ago but it became unavailable in  stores. Now I&#x27;ve found it again and love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> This talc-based product definitely helps avoid irritation from using an electric shaver. Unfortunately it also tends to gum up the shaver heads, and can sometimes make it harder to get a close shave. So while I like what it does to my skin, I don&#x27;t care for the end result after the shave. You&#x27;re probably better off with one of the liquid based pre-shaves if your face can tolerate it.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with shaving products causing irritation-- including both blade and electric shavers. The combination of my Phillips Norelco triple head rotary shaver and Remington Face Saver powder have pretty much solved my problem. The powder is much less irritating and far more comfortable and less messy than solutions and gels/ foams.</li>
    <li> good product, but is is expensive.  dunno if my shaver is that great though.  kinda wish i would not have got 3 since i may be getting a new rotary shaver soon.</li>
    <li> it is really hard to find this product in the stores. Even some of the shaver stores are out. The only problem is that by the time you pay the postage it gets a little expensive but no other choice. My advice is to buy a few of them and that will justify the cost of the freight.</li>
    <li> I usually get the [[ASIN:B000IO2DT4 Derma Bloc]] versions of this pre-shave treatment, but the last batch I got was oversoft, so i decided to try the Remington version. The mild scent is similar and the stick is much firmer. Perfect in fact. This is what I apply to my stubble every morning before using my [[ASIN:B0012TLPBQ Electric Shaver]]. I find that these powder sticks make shaving a bit easier and more comfortable. Talcum power alone doesn&#x27;t work the same -- I&#x27;m not sure how they formulate these to work on the face, but they do. I&#x27;m placing an order for more of them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> could not find it in stores only online. Purchased do to my barber recommending this product to use along with an electric shaver.I am an African American male and this does help keep my skin smooth after using my electric shaver and I also do have curly facial hair</li>
    <li> found just ok, alittle messy, powder gets all over shirt and tie and counter, not sure why so many excited people. probably will not buy again. aftershave lotion is better to me. shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I have used a similar product years ago and recently bought an electric shaver.  The powder does exactly what it needs to and gives your skin a very dry texture with which it makes it easier to shave.  Simple, yet effective.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda messy, but not bad.  At the same time, it&#x27;s less messy than Phillips/Norelco spray on stuff.  The mess is contained in the shaver.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff.  We haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for a long time.  It lasts forever and I do notice he gets a cleaner shave and less face irritation when he uses the Face Saver Stick.  Will definitely keep him stocked up!</li>
