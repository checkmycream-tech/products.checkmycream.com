      <li>Advice: do NOT expect a perfect bun your first time.</li>

      <li>they need more sizes!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve made purchases since!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my hot bun</li>
      <li>Must better quality than in stores!</li>
      <li>They works great and are so easy to use.</li>
      <li>idea, not using bobby pins or 3 hair bands like I do now to secure a sock bun-- sounds great</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>but once I got the hang of it, it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>AND IT IS AMAZING</li>
      <li>its kind of a pain to use too ..</li>
      <li>Makes the perfect buns, but your hair gets really tangled when taking it out.</li>
      <li>These are super easy to use and I have a perfect bun with no fuss in minutes.  </li>
      <li>Dont buy this unless you have completely smooth and completely naturally straight hair!!!!!!</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t vouch for her, but I certainly enjoy the use of my own!</li>
      <li>Now, it may just be my hair type that doesn&#x27;t get tangled very easily</li>
      <li>but it was very easy to style on medium hair.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love it! :)</li>
      <li>when you take the Hot Buns out of your hair you should have beautiful</li>
      <li>This product gets a thumbs up from me, but I have hair an inch longer than shoulder length and no layers my hair is also fairly straight/tangle free.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love them!</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t perfect it until my 3rd attempt), but once you get it, you&#x27;ll love the product!</li>

      <li>I chose this rating because they felt very cheap.  </li>
      <li>Product works well.it is easy to use.keeps your hair in a nice bun.good price for what you get.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>AND IT TAKES MORE THAN A MINUTE TO ASSEMBLE.</li>
      <li>It definitely will take some practice at getting it completely perfect.</li>
      <li>I can pin some of them, but as I walk around more and more keeps falling out.</li>
      <li>Wherever you have the pony (top of head or lower)</li>
      <li>If your hair is curly, it will tangle up in this thing and you&#x27;ll be pulling more hair out of this thing than when you detangle your hair in the shower.</li>
      <li>If I take enough time, I have a perfect bun just like the box says.</li>
      <li>Better to skip this product or wait to buy it when it goes on sale at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>Firstly, I love that this comes with two sizes:</li>
      <li>love  it.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I get many compliments from this product.</li>
      <li>and it worked magic</li>
      <li>that it looks stylish</li>
      <li>I love this it works for me</li>
      <li>I feel there are better bun maker products out there</li>
      <li>I found that the finishing tie over the top was a disaster.</li>
      <li>they would not stay in no matter how many bobby pins and hairspray I put in.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it as a product.</li>
      <li>I should have known better but had to try it....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>That would work better with those with a bit shorter hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Meh...they work alright after you play with it awhile but your bun looks giant. I feel there are better bun maker products out there</li>
    <li> they need more sizes!</li>
    <li> I have never been an expert with hair so when I saw Hotbuns in Walmart I thought I would give it a try. For $10, it didn&#x27;t seem too bad (and with the Walmart return policy, I knew I could return it). I was surprised that it was easy to use. It definitely will take some practice at getting it completely perfect. Advice: do NOT expect a perfect bun your first time. So far, the elastic hasn&#x27;t broken. I would suggest using bobby pins for fly away hairs or to keep the bun closer to your head. The downside is the elastic is hard to get around a big bun of hair so you really have to work with it. Overall, good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased hot buns at CVS for 10$. Not bad. At first it was a mess. I COULD NOT do it by myself, and I needed my sisters assistance. Even when she did it, the bun was a little messy but took less then a minute (like it says on the box), and held well. I did a shake test and after shaking my head, it was messier, but stayed in for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on that evening, I took the bun out, and got beautiful curls that looked really natural and flowing. If u want curls, U MUST HAVE YOUR HAIR WET/DAMP WHEN U PUT THE BUN IN. THE BUN ALSO MUST BE KEPT IN FOR A FEW HOURS!!!!!!! I understand you say that ur hair gets stuck(it doesn&#x27;t for me! When wet, but you have to wait until its dry to take it out. The product was cute and unlike other people, the curls worked better for me then the bun itself</li>
    <li> Product works well.it is easy to use.keeps your hair in a nice bun.good price for what you get.I just use the small bun.</li>
    <li> While this is a popular look right now, the buns they create are too big and puffy even with the smaller tool.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. It just unclips out of nowhere!</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to get this after all the bad reviews, but Bed Bath and Beyond had these on clearance for $5 so figured it was worth the money. My hair is about six inches past my shoulders, layered at the ends, and these work great. I couldn&#x27;t ask for an easier way to pull my hair up in a bun. I will say that I use them differently than the directions however. These work best for me on clean hair, not day or two old hair, as once the oil has set in I tend to end up with the underside of my bun looking greasy if I use it then. Also, don&#x27;t worry about pulling the hair band that comes within the scrunchy out and wrapping it around the bun at the end. Simply roll your hair until the bun, pull it around until it covers the full thing, hairspray and go. I found that the finishing tie over the top was a disaster. If you have layers you will need to tuck as you go, but overall it should work great. Hairspray and pins should finish if off if you have any stragglers.</li>
    <li> Took over a month to get this. Otherwise a good product.</li>
    <li> The product that I am reviewing today is the accessory known as Hot Buns.  The Hot Buns is available in two colors, dark and light.  A package contains two Hot Buns, one is small and the other is large.  when you take the Hot Buns out of your hair you should have beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt; From my personal experience the product works okay.  It got stuck in my hair a few times.  It didn&#x27;t work at all in thick hair.  I personally think it is much easier to use a plain old sock.  The sock is also cheaper than the Hot Buns.</li>
    <li> These were horrible! I usually use my husbands old socks to make my buns, I saw hot buns and decided I would gove them a try instead. The price should have been my first clue at how awful they are. First of all they were so difficult to get on and they would not stay put. When I finally figured them out and got them on they would not stay in no matter how many bobby pins and hairspray I put in. Second they fell apart the first time I used them. The snaps broke and they were completely unuseable. These are junk! Save yourself some money and use an old sock instead!</li>
    <li> Although I have very thick, long hair, the hot buns styling solution works really well. I only use the larger one, and gave the smaller one to a friend who does not have as much hair. I definitely use bobby pins to secure the bun to my head.</li>
    <li> i havnt bought this product only because its a waste of money you can make your own hot buns by taking a sock and cutting the toe out of it and rolling it up to look like a band and then put your hair up in a pony tail at the top of your head ( as high as it will go) and then roll your hair up into your sock and then make sure all your hair is evenly wrapped in the sock  leave it in over night and in the morning you will have curls... you can find tuturials on youtube save your money people</li>
    <li> Ok I did not buy this online but I bought it at michaels craft store and when  I got home I tryed it and it is so so hard to do!!!!!! I took this back and bought a doughnut bun thing and it is amazing!! so don&#x27;t bother with this doughnut is way better!!!!:)</li>
    <li> i got 2 of the same size in the box ... its kind of a pain to use too ..</li>
    <li> The Hot Bun is a really neat tool, there are some downsides to the product but overall its a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use the smaller roll because the big one is too big for my tastes but I&#x27;ve used both.  I&#x27;ve found to get your hair into a bun its best with damp hair (I do have long layers in my hair), like fresh out of the shower and slightly air dryed hair, it gets the smoothest buns, or I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell smooth to get my hair to stay together to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest bun issue is fanning my hair out, it tends to get a bit messy over the snap after fanning out.  Really easy to decorate with flower clips. &#x3D;) I frequently don&#x27;t even use the hair tie attached to the bun to hold it in place, it doesn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- have a great looking up-do within seconds&lt;br /&gt;- great waves after wearing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- messy over the snap closure&lt;br /&gt;- can be hard to use with layered or fine hair (hair products DO help this)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cool. Just don&#x27;t like at the fact it gets stuck in your hair. But, it&#x27;s worth buying for a perfect bun.</li>
    <li> its absolute waste of money. hard to close, cuts the hair. pls dont waste your money. i will return it</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t really stay up unless you dont move or really thight it but beware of the headache and the hair doesn&#x27;t really go all the way</li>
    <li> waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even use it ... it&#x27;s so hard to use and click&lt;br /&gt;into place... I don&#x27;t know why they made something&lt;br /&gt;so simple so difficult to use. I&#x27;m usually a quick learner but&lt;br /&gt;this product is just not worth it. will not recommend or repurchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter takes ballet and they are very strict about the girls having ballet hair.  My 6 year old has fine hair and it&#x27;s pretty long.  No layers.  Ballet day was full of tears and \\&quot;Mommy your pulling my hair,\\&quot; and messy buns.  I bought the Hot Buns at Wal-Mart and it was super easy.  Changed our Saturday mornings forever.  I wet her hair with a spray bottle, brushed it back, and then rolled it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had reviewed the product a year ago, I would have given it 5 stars, BUT it&#x27;s now falling apart.  The little velcro bands that go around the thing are all scrunched together and it&#x27;s a little lumpy.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting another one.</li>
    <li> When she got it she was disappointed. Not easy to put long thick hair up with. Better to skip this product or wait to buy it when it goes on sale at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, creates a bun that stays in all day and looks sophisticated. Should use with wet hair.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it! my hair is really layered so it did not work for me. Oh well...</li>
    <li> Works as promised. I only wish the large size was a bit larger, or when I went to spread my hair over it that it wouldn&#x27;t pop open the snap so easily. Otherwise, delivers as advertised.</li>
    <li> i bought one from walmart right after they came out for myself and it works wonders i have very light very thin blonde hair and it worked magic so i decided when i wanted buns on all my bridesmaids that this would be the fastest easiest route. they are genuine not some knock off and got here faster then the seller anticipated would def buy again from these guys</li>
    <li> I wish I would have seen this on Amazon first. I purchased it at JoAnn&#x27;s fabric for ten bucks, which is in my opinion about nine bucks too much. While the bun roll seems relatively well made, it&#x27;s very poorly designed. I gave it two stars because it does seem sturdy. However, it is useless. There is a tube of tulle-like netting which is the main bun form, then there is a gigantic snap on the ends. The idea is to roll your hair into this tube starting at the hair end up to your scalp, then connect the snap, and somehow cover up the snap with your hair to hide it, forming a bun. However, it is impossible for me to cover up the snap because it&#x27;s HUGE. I don&#x27;t have thick hair, I have very fine long hair, and nothing I can do with my hair will cover the snap even on the small form. So looking at the back of my head with this ridiculous contraption on, you see a horseshoe of nicely rolled hair, with a gigantic ugly snap holding it together, ruining the entire appearance of a bun. It&#x27;s just not worth it; also the snap and extra gizmos on this thing make it heavier than it should be to be comfortable. You would need massive amounts of hair to have enough to cover up the snap, and then you&#x27;d always see a bump or a mess over the snap area. Frankly, snaps are not necessary on a bun form!!! You can purchase a regular doughnut bun form for about fifty cents, and it works far better. Also it&#x27;s much lighter so you don&#x27;t feel the weight. I don&#x27;t know what this thing is for, but it&#x27;s a whole lot of fancy gizmo &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34; garbage that doesn&#x27;t need to be there, and ruins its ability to do its job. I tossed mine in the trash.</li>
    <li> So happy with my hotbuns! And they came&lt;br /&gt;Right away. Must better quality than in stores!</li>
    <li> I wish they made one for really long hair but it was very easy to style on medium hair. but if you have long hair it will be little hard.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get these because I typically wear a sock bun for work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea, not using bobby pins or 3 hair bands like I do now to secure a sock bun-- sounds great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic band doesn&#x27;t tighten the mesh donut&lt;br /&gt;the clip is really hard to fasten&lt;br /&gt;my hair is shoulder length so the small donut doesn&#x27;t even want to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my conair hair donuts until my hair is long enough to use this thing</li>
    <li> I like this very much im getting the hang of using this but I like that it makes my bun very big.</li>
    <li> It is Great, every time a do a bun it comes out perfect. It is easy to do!! Love it so much that I order a other one. Now I have two colors.&lt;br /&gt;Now I will be ordering a third one soon.!! Good price!!!!</li>
    <li> Really hard to use, no instructions and far, far, far too expensive for what it is.  Save yourself money and go buy a pair of brown socks and cut the toe off, roll it up and stick that through your hair in a ponytail and pin it into place.  You&#x27;ll be done in under a minute and look fabulous for $2.99.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and worn it many times, but this time the snap broke off within a few wears.  Otherwise would be 5 stars because it looks good and is easier to use than the bun-makers that are donut shapped.</li>
    <li> I have the old version...a good 2 inches longer in the large and thinner. MUCH better and easier to use. New version is nearly impossible to use on thick, long hair - too short! Looks like they tried to cut costs and corners.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this unless you have completely smooth and completely naturally straight hair!!!!!! I should have known better but had to try it....I followed all directions and helpful hints but it the Velcro strips that are supposed to hold your hair in place while you roll up your hair just tangled up my hair when released....it was awful and in the end it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted..........never again!!!!!</li>
    <li> Hot Buns Simple Styling Solution (Dark Hair)- Set of 2..girlfriend likes the product. it works well and matches hair color.</li>
    <li> I had seen this before and i was really curious so i went and did some research online and found it worked for some people and didnt work for others, but then i decided to give it a try AND IT IS AMAZING I needed something to make a large sock bun fast for competitions that still looked sleek and put together and this product did the perfect job. This product gets a thumbs up from me, but I have hair an inch longer than shoulder length and no layers my hair is also fairly straight/tangle free. I can see how this wouldn&#x27;t work for someone with curly hair. I ordered the Hot Buns in dark and expected a dark brown and when I opened the package the hot buns were black which was fine with me because my hair is actually black and i was actually really happy to see that they were black. All in all this product worked for me, but i have very plain hair so this product may not work as well for people with thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this it works for me even it took me a couple of times to practices. I have long hair so what I do once I get out of the shower I put gel in my hair &amp; get it in a pony tail up high since I love it like that it looks stylish I just comb the back of my hair not the top it&#x27;s just bumpy then put the hot buns on &amp; yes once you take it out it does give you curly hair for me but since I put gel &amp; hair spray &amp; yes when you take it out it does get tangled a little but that doesn&#x27;t bother me I&#x27;m so happy with this I have purchased a couple of them now so worth it for me even when it&#x27;s a hot day for me since I&#x27;m in California</li>
    <li> Makes the perfect buns, but your hair gets really tangled when taking it out.</li>
    <li> I ordered the brown ones and recieved black ones in the package but the box was for the brown ones.it also didnt help that it was just about two weeks late.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all for us. I bought it for my daughter for dance recitals. The snap was such cheap plastic that it broke after we tried it out at home. Of course I bought it from a place that doesn&#x27;t take returns, so I am stuck. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> love  it. Iuse it all of the time and it works well. This is a great product for long hair</li>
    <li> Firstly, I love that this comes with two sizes: Small + Large. I personally use the large size (I have layered, medium/thick wavy hair), and I use the small size on my 5 year-old daughter (she has layered, super thin curly hair) who gets a kick out of our hairstyles/buns looking the exact same! But I will say that there are two tips/tricks that I personally figured out to getting these to work for both myself and my daughter. Even though we two totally different hair types, these tricks/tips make these buns work for both of us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) CUR OFF THE RINGS THAT SURROUND THE MESH - THIS WILL PREVENT DAMAGE FROM OCCURRING TO YOUR HAIR. There are 5 on the large and 4 on the small sizes. I cut these off because I noticed my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair were getting snagged in them. This doesn&#x27;t keep them from working/holding our hair up in the bun any less than when we were using them with the rings, like I originally thought it may. This is most likely because of the next trick/tip I personally discovered...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) YOU NEED TO BRUSH YOUR HAIR AND/OR STYLE IT INTO A PONYTAIL AND SECURE IT WITH HAIR TIES BEFORE YOU USE THIS. I personally brush may hair back into a taunt slick ponytail. Wherever you have the pony (top of head or lower) this is where your bun will be. I personally like to put the pony at the top of my head for the topknot look. I secure my ponytail in place with two hair ties (I prefer these by Goody http://www.amazon.com/Goody-Ouchless-Metal-Elastics-Large/dp/B001T8W4BK). I then hold the pony up vertically and start wrapping it around as tightly as possible with the &amp;#34;bun&amp;#34; opened up like a hair roller. I then snap it in place at the back, and start spreading the hair around with my fingers so that it fully wraps around the bun. I don&#x27;t even bother with the built-in pony tail holder because it can break easily, and by creating my own ponytail first, I don&#x27;t even need to use the built-in ponytail holder. Render it useless if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) USE BOBBY PINS FOR EXTRA HOLD IN THE BACK OR EVEN WITHIN THE BUN FOR FLYAWAY LAYERS. I use regular black bobby pins, always flat side outwards to secure my hair in the back as sometimes it can start to fall during the day - especially if you have layered hair like me. This just gives the overall hair some support at the back. Occasionally, a tip of a layer will pop out after I&#x27;m done, and bobby pins do the trick for securing these little pop-out pieces as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing these things definitely made the BIGGEST difference for us, and we now LOVE these! I hope this helps someone out there!/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) USE BOBBY PINS FOR EXTRA HOLD IN THE BACK OR EVEN WITHIN THE BUN FOR FLYAWAY LAYERS.

    <li> this product is not for females that have a lot of hair, like me. it does not work on me, it doesnt even clip.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t look as good in thin hair, sock works better, but if you have thick hair this would work great for you!</li>
    <li> I was walking down the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; aisle at Rite Aid and saw these. I thought to myself &#x27;I&#x27;ve been wanting to learn how to sock bun my hair forever! This is cool!&#x27; So I decided to do a little research on them before I bought them for 10 bucks.. I looked around at some reviews, some terrible, and some say it works pretty good. What did I have to lose? I caved in end ended up buying them. My first couple go-arounds were a little frustrating, I was trying to use bobby pins to get my hair to stay together where the two ends meet, and my bun came out crooked, bumpy, and wasn&#x27;t staying in place at the end split. Then, a lightbulb went off in my head. I grabbed another hair tie (rubber band type) out of my drawer and held the two ends together (overall, holding the whole bun down but putting more emphasis on the split part) and put the rubber band over the entire bun, just once. I looked in the mirror and of course it looked funny but I started to pull the hair out a little where the hair tie was holding the split part of the ends together just enough to match the rest of the bun and, VOILA!! A perfect &amp;#34;sock bun&amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me go into my hair type and other issues people seem to run in to judging by the reviews. My hair is waist length, pretty thick, and very manageable. Some people have said that it tangles up in their hair when they try to take it out. Now, it may just be my hair type that doesn&#x27;t get tangled very easily but I haven&#x27;t had this issue at all, you just have to be careful with it when taking it out and be sure to remember to take the elastic that is attached to the Hot Bun itself off (by pulling it up and back around toward the ends). Maybe putting some leave-in conditioner or something along those lines to prevent any tangling you might have would help for those still having an issue with this. Also, I can only use the large size bun, my hair is too long/thick for the small bun, which is totally fine to me anyway. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the snap, it works perfectly every time. It works in my hair whether it is dirty or clean, I&#x27;m sure it would work wet too. The bun stays in place a little better for longer and doesn&#x27;t get as many fly-aways the dirtier it is but all in all, it takes less than a minute for me to re-do so if it needs a touch up, it&#x27;s super quick and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;One more note on my method is that I put my hair up in a ponytail, a tighter one seems to work better, and flip my head upside down. I then proceed to roll in the direction towards me, tucking in any strays/layers that poke out as I go along and also making sure that the roll is tight as I get up to the top. Keep in mind, that when you put your hair in a pony tail, it&#x27;s always going to have &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; where some parts are longer/shorter than others so that is an unavoidable aspect of it, but as long as you keep tucking as you go, you won&#x27;t have a problem. I finish it with a little hair spray to keep my &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; down, and sometimes even straighten the short &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34; down to make the bun overall classic and cute.&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a long review, I&#x27;m sorry for that but I hope to help some people out because I don&#x27;t think this product deserves so much bad feedback, you just have to roll with it (hahah pun intended) and see what works for you. Practice makes perfect and within a few go&#x27;s at it, you&#x27;ll be making adorable buns that get a TON of compliments in less than a minute every other day! It is my new favorite lazy-girl hairstyling hack! Good luck everyone!! &amp;#60;3trouble with the snap, it works perfectly every time.

    <li> Impossible to get right! You can&#x27;t get it tight like in the picture. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it at all :(</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have very long hair and it is fairly wavy so this is great when I do not want to blow it out.  One trick that works for me is that I put my hair in a high pony-tail but also secure my hair with another small hair elastic more down towards the end of it to secure some shorter hairs.  I then roll it.  It stays until I take it out.  I had to try it a few times but once I got the hang of it, it was amazing.  I suppose I could use some sort of product on my hair to secure the short ends as well.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife for x mas. Came from hong kong. Takes a lil while but it came BEFORE date and she loves it! And she wears it all the time. She also said its not as cheap made as alot of ppl put it out to be</li>
    <li> Either my hair is too short or too thin, but something isn&#x27;t working. My hair is about two inches past shoulder length with long layers. I tried many times to use the smaller bun-maker, but it just wasn&#x27;t happening. I had a hard time getting it to snap together. When I was finally able to get it to snap, I didn&#x27;t have enough hair to wrap around and cover it. The larger bun-maker was really big, so I didn&#x27;t even try it. I guess if you have a lot of think, long hair, it could work... if you can get it snapped.</li>
    <li> Hated this product ! I bought it because I thought it would be of some use to me as I am in the military and need to wear my hair in a bun a lot of the time. However it is impossible to use if your hair is too long and it won&#x27;t work if its too short. It won&#x27;t work either way! The ends will not connect ieven if you follow all the instructions on the box. This product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this hot bun! At first I had a feeling it wasn&#x27;t going to work but it&#x27;s amazing. Very affordable price I&#x27;m very happy with it. The reason why I gave it 4 stars was because of the velcrom some hairs get stuck to it at times but it&#x27;s not a big deal. I&#x27;m very happy with my hot bun I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> This item worked perfectly for me. I&#x27;d read where the snap malfunctioned and broke. However, it&#x27;s the same snap found on windbreakers, so I found mine quite secure. I&#x27;d also read where users took 15, 20 minutes to put on. Again, I found that not to be true. It took less than 5 minutes to put on &amp; I moved onto the next grooming task. It stayed secure all day. I currently have mircobraids, so I did see the curl pattern advertised once it was removed; however, I see similar curls with other bun-making products &amp; regular, large hair rollers.</li>
    <li> I couldnt get the snap to close so i had to have someone help me . Then when we finally did i went to bed and it still wasnt wavy in the morning only in a big snarl.. Cool idea but it wasmt worth the money</li>
    <li> I have no idea where i should start. Okay, first, hot buns is smaller than i expected, and I&#x27;ve seen that commercial literally hundreds of times. Second, it is definitely NOT roll, snap and wrap. It is easy to roll, but the snapping is close to impossible to do. Also, the snap is cheap plastic. Thirdly, trying to pull the secure band over the hot buns was impossible for me to do. But when you get it, the bun looks horrible. Lastly, when you try to undo hot buns, it does not leave beautiful, bouncy curls. It got tangled in my hair and basically had to rip it out. Do not get this product. It was a waste of money and I ended up returning it after trying it out. Very overpriced.</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair and thought this would be a good way to curl my hair without damaging it. it got stuck in my hair and I had to pull and twist to get it off and with it a chunk of my hair. worst investment ever!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these especially because they come in various colors and sizes.  I wear them all the time and get so many compliments.  Also these are way easier to use them some of the other types similar to this one.  You just roll your hair up and clip.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a great idea, but it just didn&#x27;t work with my hair - couldn&#x27;t get my hair to stay around the tube even with the little grippy things. Also think my hair was too long because the donut just got so large by the time I rolled it all the way to the end, the bun wouldn&#x27;t even close. When I was able to, by pure luck, get the two ends of the donut to actually clip together, the bun was pretty much the same size as my head (not cute) and it never held the hair together in a very tight bun - always had a lot of bits and pieces of hair falling out of the bun. Not my favorite purchase - great in theory, not great in actual product</li>
    <li> It is terrible. The quality is really poor. The button is inside and cannot be closed properly. There are some particles that take apart when you use it. Just don&#x27;t buy it. Because if you want return it, you should pay abou10$ to mail it to china!</li>
    <li> I love these!!! I will buying another just to ensure I always have one on hand. It is easy and fast ( I have tried many of these hair styling items and am usually disappointed)</li>
    <li> I have not had any problems thus far with the snaps like other reviews, but in general i would say....SAVE YOUR MONEY and just do the Sock Bun (google it for instructions). I think the sock bun produces a better looking bun. The only benefit for this product is that i can use it to roll up my hair easily on top of my head sans hair tie to then sleep in and have curly hair the next day. I have long, but fine hair that is just plain straight. I put my hair up dry (otherwise it would never dry if it was wet or damp) and leave over night for good curly hair the next day.</li>
    <li> I have super, baby fine hair which is impossible to have a proper stylish bun!  Hot Buns actually makes me look like I have enough hair to put up AND it stays in place all day!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, especially for someone with hair that tends to frizz. I live in a very humid environment and the summer can be a hair nightmare- this solves all of my issues and takes about 30 seconds to get in place. Seriously a life saver.</li>
    <li> I have tried other bun rings, and I keep coming back to the Hot Buns brand of bun maker. I LOVE that the ring opens and closes, and has a hair tie to hold the bun in place. My sister, who is special needs, LOVES that she can be a ballerina, and the bun will actually stay in place while she dances around the house. the color is rich, and easily camouflaged within her dark brown hair. I don&#x27;t plan on ever purchasing another brand of bun maker, and might even order another set, so that I can do 2 buns like pony tails.</li>
    <li> I gave the larger one to a friend with longer hair than mine so I can&#x27;t vouch for her, but I certainly enjoy the use of my own! I see a lot of knock-off products in beauty and department stores everywhere, but I feel like this product is the only one that is easy to put on--and fast, too. I&#x27;ll usually have to add several (maybe 2 or 3) bobby pins to keep the top from drooping down, but this can somewhat be avoided by tying a ponytail higher up on your head.</li>
    <li> This thing reminds me of the fuzzy part of Velcro. If your hair is curly, it will tangle up in this thing and you&#x27;ll be pulling more hair out of this thing than when you detangle your hair in the shower. They need to make a smooth version of this, maybe covered in satin or silk, for it to work on anyone other than a person with absolutely straight hair.</li>
    <li> This is so much nicer then the normal bun deals where it&#x27;s just one piece. The fact you can roll then snap into a circle is genius! Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I have two bun sets- one being the hot buns set and another being a similar doughnut type with no snap. The one that is simply round with no snap beats this piece of crap anyday. This one is rough, the snaps don&#x27;t work, the material is rough and snags your hair, and they are not well made, at all. This is a glorified, $10 piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I use this for work ask I am a flight attendant. It makes doing my hair so simple and easy.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love them! Cute easy hairstyles! It really is as easy as roll snap and wa bam, cute buns!</li>
    <li> I bought the set of 2 large ones since my hair is long and thick, and I swear these aren&#x27;t real hot buns brand because they came in a bag not a box and they are so much thicker (in a bad way) than the original one I bought 2 years ago.  They make the bun HUGE, it looks horrible!</li>
    <li> This product ruins your hair permanently it gives you split ends and tears out tons of your hair I would not recommend this product at all it doesn&#x27;t look good I hated it</li>
    <li> Best bun maker! I use both sizes all the time, especially when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair! It makes my hair look like I spent so much time on it and it looks professional and neat. I&#x27;ve introduced my friends to this product and all love it. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve made purchases since!</li>
    <li> The only reason that I did not give this product one star is that I suspect it may work slightly better on very long, non-layered hair. This product created a very sloppy bun for me. My hair is thick and definitely past my shoulder, so I thought this would be great and save me some time in the morning! I attempted to use the bun tool and immediately noticed that there is really nothing for your hair to hold on to while you are rolling the bun up your ponytail. The snap was very difficult to close. By the time the bun was finished, I had a bunch of my layers that had fallen out all over the place. I tried this several times since I purchased it with my hair wet, dry, with gel, hairspray, etc... I am calling it a loss. U would not recommend this product unless you have naturally sleek, long, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have short, thin, layered hair, and using this product is difficult, but not impossible. If I take enough time, I have a perfect bun just like the box says. It works a lot better on my friends hair, which is long and thick. Snapping the button is hard, but the rest is a breeze. I love it! :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. After a couple tries it did work just not as satisfied as I thought I&#x27;d be. It took 37 days on the dot to get here, ridiculous. And to top it off, when it arrived here I was already open and wasn&#x27;t even in the box.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for grandaughter.</li>
    <li> I have long brown hair and this accessory is great.  I tend to use the smaller bun to create a bun.  I&#x27;m also going to use them to create princess leia buns for my halloween custom.  It works perfect!</li>
    <li> We had to return this product as the first time we snapped the ends together the snaps broke and the product came apart. Sad because it was a great idea. Thankfully, Amazon refunded me in full</li>
    <li> Dont buy so not worth it, I have medium length thick hair doesnt stay on and the clip is hard to clip on not worth even a penny if you buy it you will regret spending your money not for thick hair girls i can tell you that</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use!</li>
    <li> they seem good however I did not read the information as well as I should because when I received there is 2 different sizes but for shorter hair...if you have very long hair neither will really work that good as least not for me but they are really good quality and received on time as indicated  good product for the price</li>
    <li> My GF originally hated buns.I helped her with one of these and now she likes them. And her bun was very sleek and soft.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, this product is made up of the hook part of velcro, and it got horribly stuck in my hair.  Imagine trying to get velcro out of your hair.  I will not be using this product</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work, but with my layered hair that is midway  down my back the shorter layers just fall out. I can pin some of them, but as I walk around more and more keeps falling out.</li>
    <li> So much easier to use than that other donut bun makers.  I think it&#x27;s the wrap around, snap function that make it a breeze for me.  I have long hair that reaches my bra strap, my friend has shorter hair below her chin but above her shoulder.  This worked great on both of us.  Great price and loves that it comes with two.</li>
    <li> The large bun is missing the button to clip it closed</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it as a product. I can&#x27;t get it just right so I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love the Hot Buns! They works great and are so easy to use. I use mine all the time and they don&#x27;t get tangled in your hair either.</li>
    <li> Took some practice, but it works great for my daughters dance performances</li>
    <li> I was freaking out about having to put my shoulder-length, layered and fine hair into a bun for a law enforcement academy when I stumbled across this at the store. I was honestly not expecting it to work with my hair, but I bought it out of pure desperation. I am so glad I got it though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put pomade in my hair when it&#x27;s almost dry, because otherwise my bangs will not stay back. I&#x27;m sure it partially ends up helping the neatness of my bun. When I get it in the initial ponytail, I tease it a little bit so it&#x27;s easier to fan out and roll up. I think the snap is pretty easy myself. My hair is so short that it requires a lot of bobby pins to keep certain pieces from flying away, but I make it work. It lasts all day through wind or working out, so I&#x27;m stoked. :)</li>
    <li> Difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t work well for layered hair. I had a hard time snapping the product together and once I finished I ended up with a big mess. Not worth the money when it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to make a sock bun. Skip this and use a sock instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my daughter had been using it for awhile in her hair. She said that it took a little while to \\&quot;master\\&quot; it, but once she did, her buns always looked great! So I decided to go out and buy a dark brown set from Walgreen&#x27;s. Maybe it was just luck, but from the first time I used it, the bun went in perfect. I have had no problems with the snap and my long layers stay put all day. But I would suggest that you try to use it while your hair is wet and brushed into a slim ponytail on top of your head so it is easier to wind down. It will also keep the hair in place and give a nice clean finish to the bun. Good luck ladies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Conair donut bun maker, but my long hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite long enough to wrap around well and cover the donut, so I though the Hot Buns might work better for me, and it does! I love the size of the large bun, my hair is wavy and long, mostly one length, but isn&#x27;t very thick at the ends, and with the Hot Buns, the thin ends are hidden. I haven&#x27;t found any issue with my hair sticking, but I agree with another reviewer that the ends should be tapered, so they&#x27;re easier to slide the hair across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the snap on my large Hot Bun broke after using it maybe 4 times, and I thought about returning it, but I figure this is a design flaw that will probably occur again, so when I want to use the large one, I actually just safety pin it together. Yes, kinda low-rent, but it works well, and the smaller one is still holding up with then snap intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problems mastering a neat looking bun after a few tries, and now I can put my hair up in a great bun in a minute or so and go! I&#x27;ve also slept with it, and if you do that, you should really make your ponytail very high up on your head, so the bun isn&#x27;t on the back of your head, or will interrupt your sleep. Since my air is naturally wavy, I think that helps my second and third day hair look like I spent time styling it, when all I did was take the bun out and fluff my hair!</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter for her birthday, she has very long hair so the larger one wrks great, holds hair great</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because they felt very cheap.  It was like a cleaning scrubber.  I have to admit the small one I put in my daughters hair rolled fine and did everything it promised but taking it out was a nightmare and her hair got entangled in the Hot Bun.  While we were trying the small one for the first time my husband opened the big one and immediately the snap went flying and ripped out of the Hot Bun.  USE GENTLY ladies!</li>
    <li> Use for dance costumes as does all dancers. Works well.</li>
    <li> This makes an easy bun.  The hair clings to the fabric making it easier to tuck in the fly aways.  Works great!</li>
    <li> soooo easy , i could wear it everyday !</li>
    <li> I got these because my aunt RAVED about them. I have thick wavy hair that is mid-back. I thought it would be super easy to just roll it right up into this product and snap... done. NOT. These are made out of horrible velcro-like material which just left my hair a huge rats nest when I took it out, no matter how carefully I tried to unroll it, I always had to end up yanking it out of my hair because it was so embedded in my pony. I could never get the snap done up and once I did, there was always a giant gap at the top of the closure, I had to end up putting a bunch of bobby pins to close it. This may work for long, all one layer, hair and thin hair. These are not big enough for thick hair and not good for curly hair because it just causes a disaster of a mess.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick, and easy, professional looking qoif. I get many compliments from this product. This is the second one I bought.</li>
    <li> My sister have me some Hot Buns for Christmas, knowing I have an inexpensive one from H&amp;M. I was a little skeptical when trying it out, and for good reason! It&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous! The directions make it seem straightforward and easy, but it is far from that. I can&#x27;t even imagine the difficulty those who have never tried a sock or sponge bun before trying to learn using this thing. I have been doing buns like this as a quick hair fix for 2 years now, and for the life of me I could not use Hot Buns to work in a way in my or my sisters hair in a way that was comfortable and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never even write reviews online for anything, unless it is remarkably superb, or horrendously awful. I&#x27;m afraid hot buns is the latter. If you&#x27;re looking to have a bun like this, buy one at the drugstore. I assure you, it will be much easier and save you time and money.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and makes a really cool BIG bun. I just practiced with it a few times and use a few sprays of water from a spray bottle to help gather my hair (my hair is super fine and stick straight) and roll my hair up and bam! Hair is done for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the package did not come with direction so I Youtubed it, the customs agents took apart the packaging to inspect it when it when through customs. No big deal though, they are just doing their job! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> it worked great while it was working.  then the snap broke and we really cannot fix it. i would not recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this instead of using a sock to make my buns. Cool idea but definitely harder then they make it seem  tv. You need to practice a lot!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work too well for me...</li>
    <li> works great for my curly hair. I needed to get used to the process of wrapping my hair around it, but after a few tries you get the hang of it. price is right!</li>
    <li> The hot buns didn&#x27;t work well  well at all. Nothing like we&#x27;ve seen on the commercial. We want to return the product.</li>
    <li> The shipping of this product was pretty fast, it came within a week. I have long layered hair so rolling all of it up in the bun was very tedious and time consuming. When i finally managed to get all of my hair around the bun, fastening it with the snap was almost impossible. After struggling with the snap, i found it difficult to adjust my hair so everything looked smooth and circular. Overall, it is much easier, and cheaper, to just use a sock or hair donut.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to use, almost not possible, if one does not have a person to help to put it in the hair. However, even with help,&lt;br /&gt;it does not look right unless you have really long and tick hair</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!!! Do not waste your time or your money on this false advertisment product! I purchased a hot bun set only to be disappointed by the product and how it did not produce a \\&quot;perfect bun\\&quot;. I will continue to use my sock bun along with my hair pins. The snap does not snap with an instant and when you spread the hair evenly over the actual bun, the hair will continue to fall from the sides before you even have time to pull the actual elastic band around it. WILL NEVER purchase this product again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> the snaps hardly snap together and my hair falls out of the bun... i have very fine and soft hair, and it just slips right out.</li>
    <li> I liked this product cause it does the job &amp; my buns look perfect. I did not gave 5 stars because I most of the time have to do it several times for it to look perfect &amp; because it is not as easy to take it off. When I&#x27;m taking it off it stays stuck on my hair so I have to pull it out.</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughter who has straight hair and of course wants curls and waves. Supposedly after you wear this, your hair will be somewhat wavy. The problem is that it&#x27;s not easy to use so she doesn&#x27;t use it.  We saw it on TV and have been happy with other &amp;#34;As Seen On TV&amp;#34; products, but this one is kind of a dud.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She absolutely loved it. Second day the plastic snap broke and cannot be fixed. In the trash it went :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military, so I bought this for two reasons: 1. because I really suck at doing my super thick hair &amp; 2. to save time in the mornings. The product is barely noticeable as it sits in my hair, but it&#x27;s a bit difficult to take out sometimes. Also, there always seems to be a considerable amount that never makes it into the bun, but gel or pins can fix that easily. Without this thing, I&#x27;d always need to wake someone up to help me with my hair!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get these in the mail. When I first got them I ran to the bathroom and went to try it, it&#x27;s easy to roll but the snapping is so hard to do. I have super thick long hair so I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s why it wouldn&#x27;t snap. Eventually after getting it snapped I&#x27;d go to use the elastic on it and it would make my bun stand up. I got so frustrated with it and in my trying to do it the next time I tried it the stupid elastic broke. I&#x27;ve watched the commercial countless times and I just don&#x27;t understand. I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> It does not actually curl your hair as it says it will, when you take your hair down. I was disappointed in that, because I wear these to bed, and wanted it to curl my hair when I woke up. So sad. :(  Also, could someone make them a bit thinner?? That would work better with those with a bit shorter hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Kinda big and bulky. Takes a few attempts to get it to work right.</li>
    <li> Once you practice two or three times, it gets super easy. Make sure your hair is well brushed, otherwise it&#x27;s gonna tangle it. My favorite part is that it gets really firm and your hair style is safe all night. Also, if you have thin hair, that will make you very very happy! Don&#x27;t really know why people complain about the little button... Never had any problem, don&#x27;t see it breaking like some people pointed out. For this price, this is a miracle!</li>
    <li> This was not  what  my  granddaughter thought  it was but she has been  using on her  new  styling  doll head.</li>
    <li> I love these! I ordered them after seeing them on a talk show and wanted to order them because I&#x27;ve been feeling pretty frumpy lately. I&#x27;ve put on some weight due to stress and an injury and feel like I&#x27;ve let myself go. I feel like I always look the same-everyday! This was just what I needed. They are so easy to use and stay in tight all day and night. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it but after about 5 times I feel like a pro! They&#x27;re very, very easy and mine haven&#x27;t broken? Also, when you go to take them out your hair doesn&#x27;t get all tangled and caught in the velcro like everyone is making it out to be. You just unroll your hair the opposite way you rolled it and it comes right out. For less then $10 and to get two of them this was a steal. This was definitely what I needed to feel more trendy and alive again. Takes two minutes and I look like a celebrity!</li>
    <li> i love this product its fast easy and looks really good for a simple love forgoing out or for work</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product as I have used other bun makers and most of the time I couldn&#x27;t get the bun to work.  I really wanted a bun so I bought these hot buns.  I love them!!  These are super easy to use and I have a perfect bun with no fuss in minutes.  I have worn it several times and it seems durable.  My hair is medium length and has a natural loose curl to it. I put my hair in a bun this morning at 9 am and it&#x27;s still in a bun 14 hours later!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Anyone buying this is wasting their money. Google \\&quot;Sock Bun\\&quot; OR Pinterest Sock Bun and you can do the same thing with a sock, which is free! You get the exact same results as you would with this thing. I have been using it on my very thin hair. I get pretty curls with no heat and a cute bun. Make sure the sock matches your hair and you are good to go. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> This product includes both a small hot bun roller (which is perfect for achieving a classic ballet bun) and a larger bun roller which works great for people that want a more dramatic and full bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is nearly halfway down my back and is moderately thick, so I had plenty of hair to push around the bun roller and everything looked smooth (as seen on the picture and in the commercials.) If you have shorter hair (shoulder length or above) and/or thin hair, the larger bun roller probably won&#x27;t work as well since you have less hair to pull around the roller. You could still make a nice bun with the smaller roller, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some practice and patience (I didn&#x27;t perfect it until my 3rd attempt), but once you get it, you&#x27;ll love the product! Watch some YouTube tutorials and don&#x27;t be afraid to improvise. For example: I don&#x27;t use the bungee cord thing. Instead, I just pull my hair around the hot bun roller and then secure it with a u-shaped hair pin.</li>
    <li> I have watched videos and attempted to use it but it does not work with layers. I also tried gels and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The tie on the small one broke the second time I used it. Does not stay secure in hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Makes me look like I have a full head of hair! Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Hot buns is so easy to use</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;ve been writing my reviews in the wrong place!  This is a great product.  I use the smaller one on my 4 year old daughter and she looks simply adorable.  We get complimented on her hair all the time.  It&#x27;s such an easy product to use and the price is very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it since the only &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that came with it were the pictures on the outside of the box.  I didn&#x27;t catch on too quickly so I looked up videos online.  I feel silly.. it&#x27;s the easiest thing to use!  I start off with a ponytail then curl the ends around the &amp;#34;hot bun&amp;#34; as I could any roller.  Once it&#x27;s close to the crown of my head, I snap the two ends together.  There&#x27;s an elastic part that tightens and can be twisted around the bottom of the bun to keep everything together.  I&#x27;ve only worn it twice, but it stays on all day no matter how much jumping around I do.</li>
    <li> many different styles</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work for shoulder length hair..it needs to be significantly longer.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It takes two minutes to do your hair.  If you have medium length or longer, get it!  My hair looks perfect every time!</li>
    <li> I got this for $10 at Walmart. Does not work!!! I have thick, wavy hair that has layers. It really doesn&#x27;t work on people with layered hair. Some layers that are short ended up falling out, screwing up the look altogether. I tried bobby pins but it still would somehow fall out. DONT BELIEVE THE CRAP U HEAR. IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT LOOKS. AND IT TAKES MORE THAN A MINUTE TO ASSEMBLE.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product. I thought it was not easy to construct the bun and it was not very secure. Also, my hair got stuck in the the material whenever I tried to take it out causing it to rip the material from pulling hair away. I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptictal but once I received the item and had time to play with it a bit, you get the hang of it. They make the cutest buns and ppl always ask how I get it so perfect!</li>
    <li> Inadequate directions!  I cannot (nor my friends) figure out how to use.</li>
    <li> my second order .. Love it</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work and fall out. I haven&#x27;t been able to use them at all.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this product however when receiving the package it had someone else&#x27;s hair was already in it!!!!! Gross! After cleaning it out I tried them on.... both the big and small didn&#x27;t fit  right. After several attempts, I found the rubber band and snap and fell right out anyway. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I believe this would be great for someone with longer &amp; thicker hair. My hair is a decent length but it is also thin which didn&#x27;t work for this product.</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, thin hair. I work in special education, so for safety reasons, I wear my hair up. Hot buns are easy to use and they add volume to my thin hair.  I can make my bun neat or messy (by pulling some strands out).I gave tried the knock offs or one ones that don&#x27;t open up. They may be cheaper, but Hot Buns are the best. I have several and I am buying them for a co-worker.</li>
    <li> I like the product as I have used them before, however, this does not come in a box it is like taped together...looks very junky. But they do work just don&#x27;t use to open as they can damage ur hair if not careful.</li>
    <li> was not happy with the product, arrived on time, the product is hard to sleep on, your hair sticks and pulls like it is stuck to velcro, did not send back because of shipping cost not worth my time nor effort, was excited about getting it but that was expelled quickly, save your money people!</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use on a bad hair day.</li>
