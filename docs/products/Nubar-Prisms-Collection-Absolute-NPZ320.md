      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll get good coverage with two</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the picture shows.  </li>
      <li>good product.</li>

      <li>To achieve the look that&#x27;s pictured online, it would take more than 4 coats!  </li>
      <li>Have not used this on my nails yet, but received it and the color is amazing.</li>
      <li>Excellect product, the color is amazing...</li>
      <li>Kind of a dud.</li>
      <li>The color is nice but nothing like pictured.</li>
      <li>Color club brand has much more coverage with still being 3 free and their colors are beautiful,  </li>
      <li>Would buy more of this kind.</li>
      <li>but wow it looks great in the sun!!</li>
      <li>Wow what an awesome color,the more coats you add the more amazing the polish becomes.</li>
      <li>1 gram is $20-$25 way more for your money than these crappy polishes.</li>
      <li>I love the formula and the coverage, and of course the holo effect.</li>
      <li>Use a top coat and it brings out the sparkle in it.</li>
      <li>You get a deeper sparkly effect the more layers you apply.  </li>
      <li>I use a top coat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>so the polish stays on longer than most</li>
      <li>When used with a top coat, it lasts for  a week</li>
      <li>I was hoping this polish would look like the picture, but it is more of a blue/gray, with some sparkle.</li>
      <li>this blue is perfect.</li>
      <li>I love to catch the sunlight with my nails after I use this polish.</li>
      <li>n happy with my new polish</li>
      <li>It applies easily, and in 3 coats covered the visible nail line for me on most nails (on two fingers I had to do another coat).</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the most comfortable my fingers have been when painting themselves.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>my China Glaze OMG polishes that I loved so much.</li>
      <li>I would probably buy some other colors, but I am not as impressed</li>
      <li>but pretty close after I use the top coat!</li>
      <li>very good product the collect is light blue and sparklyis just like the picture</li>
      <li>To add, I was dissapointed with how incredibly easily it chips.</li>
      <li>and I was denied stating they do not do any returns of any kind on nail polish and that they believe their product looks exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>It turns out, 3 coats is the magic number to get the full holographic depth effect.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of holographic nail polishes and this one is one of the less impressive ones.</li>
      <li>It just very light blue, so it doesnt look good at all (</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also a huge fan of the handle.</li>
      <li>on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>it goes on really light</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t cheap either.  </li>
      <li>Chuncky and does not paint smooth.</li>
      <li>As it is 3 free, it does not damage my nails at all.</li>
      <li>so I get 4 or 5 chip free days out of it.</li>
      <li>A very  unique product and fun to wear.</li>
      <li>the polish is very light but after applying 3 coats it looks exactly like it&#x27;s advertised.  </li>
      <li>It looks best under sunlight or direct light; so it probably won&#x27;t be noticed too well at the bar or club for you single ladies.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is a special way this polish needs to be applied</li>
      <li>Good lasting color.</li>
      <li>When I saw it, I was stoked because the &#x27;Prisms&#x27; effect reminded me of a nail polish that CG used to sell that had the cool rainbow effect, but they stopped offering it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sparkly, which I love.  </li>
      <li>it looked super cool.</li>
      <li>One positive thing I can say is that it dries VERY quickly.  </li>
      <li>it was delivered on time and it is a very pretty color when your done...</li>
      <li>but it was very pretty after a couple of times..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty!</li>
      <li>If you want holo polish buy a gram of SpectraFlair instead and add it to a top coat or clear nail polish.</li>
      <li>I am a professional nail technician and love halographic colors.</li>
      <li>Maybe she didn&#x27;t shake it enough but neither of us liked it.</li>
      <li>Its much more blue-gray, with pretty silvery blue fine glitter.  </li>
      <li>Hard to describe, gorgeous to wear!</li>
      <li>And all the other reviews, even the good ones, state that this product looks nothing like its picture.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color,  but is super sheer.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It really takes daylight to do its thing!</li>
      <li>This polish is pretty ONLINE.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY reccomend you do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
      <li>is definitely a brand I&#x27;m going to be exploring more.</li>
      <li>I guess its pretty</li>
      <li>The nail polish looks so pretty in the picture and in the bottle.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying Nubar.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically just a very sheer turquoise polish with nothing more than a glittery shimmer.  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty polish</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this nail polish!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, as I&#x27;ve never worn blue polish before.  </li>
      <li>I wish I had read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to see any holographic effect, not even with multiple coats applied.</li>
      <li>She applied it without a basecoat or top diamond coating just to try it on and at first it looked dull, so she applied one more coat.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, but it very glittery and pretty.</li>
      <li>paint my nails frequently, sometimes twice a week, and have a decent collection of nail polish, primarily China Glaze.</li>
      <li>It lasts long with a topcoat, and has such a gorgeous sheen.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re going for that, then i guess it&#x27;s fine, but it is definitely nothing close to holographic.</li>
      <li>The color is brilliant, but it requires at least four coats for a very deep colored finish.</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>However, I really like what it does look like.</li>
      <li>I really like the way it looks on her.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome color.  Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish thank you!</li>
    <li> This nail polish goes on beautifully, and when it dries it has an almost microscopic holographic shimmer. Not glitter, a deep holographic shine. In the aqua color are overtones of rainbow. Hard to describe, gorgeous to wear! I love to catch the sunlight with my nails after I use this polish.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a holographic polish ever since i saw chanel&#x27;s holographic color, and when i saw the picture of the prisms polish it looked super cool. once i got it, i could tell all it was was shimmery, but one review said it looked cool when it dried. nope. its just a light blue shimmer, no holographic quality whatsoever. if you&#x27;re going for that, then i guess it&#x27;s fine, but it is definitely nothing close to holographic.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying Nubar.  Pros were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly.  The formula is the right consistency, not too thick or too runny.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get good coverage with two coats.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is tough and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cons:  Well, I found that my color is nothing like what was pictured and frankly, I found that disappointing!!  Its much more blue-gray, with pretty silvery blue fine glitter.  The bottle I was shipped had no holographic sheen to it.  Although overall this wasn&#x27;t a bad formula, I found the polish to be disappointing for the final color and it wasn&#x27;t cheap either.  I know that you&#x27;ll find even more expensive nail polish out there, but I find that for the price I paid for this bottle, Color Club or Zoya has better Holographic nail polish.  Oveall I would give it a 3.75.</li>
    <li> this blue is perfect. My manicure lasted so long that as it was growing out, I painted the white dotty polish on the moons. It looks like snowflakes! Can&#x27;t wait now to see how my toes will look in summer with Absolute. This color simply makes me smile.</li>
    <li> The color was hard to get dark but it was very pretty after a couple of times..it was delivered on time and it is a very pretty color when your done...thank you</li>
    <li> My granddaughter wanted this -- the product looks very watery when it&#x27;s put on nails.  Maybe she didn&#x27;t shake it enough but neither of us liked it.</li>
    <li> I got 3 colors of Nubar&#x27;s Prisms collection after I had used my China Glaze OMG polishes that I loved so much. I was hoping this would be just like the CG ones. It&#x27;s the worst holo polish out there. You need 3 or 4 coats of polish to see some holo effect on your nails. And the polish chipped after 1-2 days. If you want holo polish buy a gram of SpectraFlair instead and add it to a top coat or clear nail polish. That wasy you can apply it over any nail color you like and get a holo effect like CG OMG collection in 1-2 coats. And 1 tiny dash oh SpectraFlair in your top coat is all you need, so a gram of SpctraFlair will be enough for 7-8 bottles. 1 gram is $20-$25 way more for your money than these crappy polishes.</li>
    <li> I love the formula and the coverage, and of course the holo effect. It&#x27;s so bright and shimmery!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of holographic nail polishes and this one is one of the less impressive ones. Usually, thinning out a holo can help to bring out the rainbow, but this one already is cellophane sheer. Kind of a dud.</li>
    <li> The picture hooked me in but neither I or my manicurist could achieve this prism effect. Really disappointing! The color is nice but nothing like pictured. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color,  but is super sheer. I&#x27;m not happy with the opacity until I&#x27;ve got about 4-5 coats on.  Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.</li>
    <li> I am a professional nail technician and love halographic colors. this one was not acceptable with 2 coats, it was very sheer. Not what you would expect from looking at the color in the bottle.Color club brand has much more coverage with still being 3 free and their colors are beautiful,  I wouldn&#x27;t  buy these again,very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Have not used this on my nails yet, but received it and the color is amazing. Nice! Everyone should try it.</li>
    <li> This is pretty but its opaque, it looks to be a solid color but takes at least 3 coats to look that way</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Gave it to my daughter as a gift and she loves it. Good lasting color. Would buy more of this kind.</li>
    <li> Is definatly not this color that s on pic. It just very light blue, so it doesnt look good at all (</li>
    <li> Its really not holographic like the Color Club brand it goes on really light and you can barely tell you have anything on unless you put 3 or 4 coats on. I guess its pretty but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this brand again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color and I am very happy with it. I use a top coat so I get 4 or 5 chip free days out of it.</li>
    <li> This nail polish does not look ANYTHING like the picture on the product. The picture looks like it should be irredescant blue with specks of glitter in it and it is nothing but a plain light blue nail polish with NO glitter or irredescance of any kind. VERY disappointing. And I sent a letter to the seller asking them if i could send the polish back and receive a refund since it does not look anything like the picture and I was denied stating they do not do any returns of any kind on nail polish and that they believe their product looks exactly like the picture. I HIGHLY reccomend you do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! And i would be weary of ordering anything from this company</li>
    <li> good product. works great.</li>
    <li> Excellect product, the color is amazing...</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, as I&#x27;ve never worn blue polish before.  It&#x27;s very sparkly, which I love.  The iridescence is there, but only in certain lighting conditions.  Seems to dry fast and it holds up well over several days.  You get a deeper sparkly effect the more layers you apply.  May have to try other colors now.</li>
    <li> This polish does not look anything like the picture! It is blue with sparkle! I was hoping it would look just a little like the picture!Not the case! This one is not worth getting,unless you just want plain blue wih sparkles. Same with the Nubar Treasure! House of Accessory was however very prompt with sending my order, which is why there are three stars and not one.</li>
    <li> I put on 3 coats and it does sparkle, but I didn&#x27;t see prisms. I could sort of see it in the sunlight, but it was a slight rainbow effect. I would probably buy some other colors, but I am not as impressed and I thought I was going to be.</li>
    <li> The holographic pictures are misleading! This polish looks nothing like the images advertised. I don&#x27;t know if there is a special way this polish needs to be applied but I wasn&#x27;t able to see any holographic effect, not even with multiple coats applied. It looks like a dull navy blue on my nails, not even any sparkle to it. I am so disappointed but not worth sending it back.</li>
    <li> The color is not nearly as deep nor as multifaceted as the picture. However, I really like what it does look like. It ends up more of a pale blue green with a bit of a shimmer. The odor is way better than average! And it is holding up well under wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going out in the sun I have to say that the holographic effect is brilliant! The color is still way paler than the photo, but I really do like this polish. I am hard on nail polish and it has held up well for 5 days now. Even my husband noticed the unusual sparkle from my nails when we were outside. Inside, not so much. It really takes daylight to do its thing!</li>
    <li> I accidentally ran across this while checking out some other nail polishes and was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;I paint my nails frequently, sometimes twice a week, and have a decent collection of nail polish, primarily China Glaze. But, I had never heard of this brand before. When I saw it, I was stoked because the &#x27;Prisms&#x27; effect reminded me of a nail polish that CG used to sell that had the cool rainbow effect, but they stopped offering it. And finding it elsewhere was about $30/bottle. I did some research on the Nubar brand before deciding to purchase it and was blown away by the reviews all over the internet. It was rated the number one nail polish at one point by some British Beauty Magazine. That was enough to convince me buy 4 different bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Absolute was the first to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 coats, the color looks less teal, and more gray/blue. I was kinda bummed about that. And the prism effect was more subtle then I thought it would be. But I&#x27;ve had it on for a few days now without a top coat (because I&#x27;m just experimenting) and haven&#x27;t had any chips. Not to mention the fact that it dried super fast without any help from me. I&#x27;m also a huge fan of the handle. I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t style their handle in that shape. That&#x27;s the most comfortable my fingers have been when painting themselves.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a brand I&#x27;m going to be exploring more.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something holographic, this just isn&#x27;t it at all. And it&#x27;s pricey, to boot. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> the polish is very light but after applying 3 coats it looks exactly like it&#x27;s advertised.  Looks great with jeans.</li>
    <li> After finally getting the polish it clearly showed more Blue in the bottle and online shows the color as being a Green tone. I hope after trying it out I won&#x27;t be more disappointed. Even though there is a difference in the shade I will still recommend  this color. Why? ...The other colors rock by hands down and your lucky if you can collect them all. But if not then surely you will find a color that fits you best.</li>
    <li> This nail polish has some of the neatest colors out there.  When used with a top coat, it lasts for  a week but my nails grow fast.  I would highly recommend it.  I have it in several colors.</li>
    <li> I loved how I recieved it before it was even supposed to arrive. The color is brilliant, but it requires at least four coats for a very deep colored finish. To add, I was dissapointed with how incredibly easily it chips. A hour after I finish, it is already coming off. I suggest putting a clear coat ontop on the finish, as well as the bottom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a light blue.  You cannot see anyother colors.  Looks nothing like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;There are no other colors seen when painted on.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this polish would look like the picture, but it is more of a blue/gray, with some sparkle. It is a pretty polish but I see no other hues in the polish at all.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what happened with this bottle. The nail polish looks so pretty in the picture and in the bottle. However, when I tried to paint my nails with it it went on as a see thru light blue that you could barely see. Even after 3 coats it looked like this. Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> Not only does this polish dry fast, it is very pretty and it is chip resistant so the polish stays on longer than most and I have very brittle nails.</li>
    <li> I like this polish! It&#x27;s pretty! Use a top coat and it brings out the sparkle in it. It&#x27;s not exactly like the pix but pretty close after I use the top coat!</li>
    <li> Absolute is a gorgeous holographic teal, with a rainbow of hues ranging from pink to yellow to green. As it is 3 free, it does not damage my nails at all. It applies easily, and in 3 coats covered the visible nail line for me on most nails (on two fingers I had to do another coat). It lasts long with a topcoat, and has such a gorgeous sheen. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this nail polish! It&#x27;s actually my favourite now. It really does sparkle and gleam like a holographic card from the 90&#x27;s. Just apply a few coats and a top coat and you&#x27;re ready to dazzle everyone. Seriously, this nail polish got me many compliments and I would wear it everyday if I didn&#x27;t work in the food industry.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today.  The picture shows it being freaking awesome.  It&#x27;s not as good as the picture shows.  It is somewhat hologrammed and sparkly if you put 3 heavy coats of polish on.  The nice thing is this polish dries super fast, so it doesn&#x27;t take long to put 3 heavy coats of polish on.  Happy I tried it and like the steely blue color, but not sure if I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> This polish is pretty ONLINE.  It appears as though there are several different colors in it that compliment the base turquoise color, but that is not the case in reality.  It&#x27;s basically just a very sheer turquoise polish with nothing more than a glittery shimmer.  To achieve the look that&#x27;s pictured online, it would take more than 4 coats!  One positive thing I can say is that it dries VERY quickly.  All in all, I would not buy this polish again.</li>
    <li> This polish is not AT ALL like the picture!! I&#x27;ve been drooling over this polish for a couple months and finally decided to order it. When I pulled it out of the bubble wrap, I honestly checked the name and such to make sure they didn&#x27;t ship me the wrong polish, but nope, supposedly this is the right one. It&#x27;s a bluish grey with a little shimmer, not even a sparkle, definitely not the prism/holographic look it claims to have and the color is so sad looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on almost clear, with a grey/blue tint... one coat makes you look like you&#x27;re in the beginning stages of frostbite, 2 makes you look dead, after 3 coats I could still see through this polish and it just looked like a transparent version of my mom&#x27;s car. I am extremely disappointed. I will try to get some pictures up soon to show how terrible this is... what a waste...</li>
    <li> A very  unique product and fun to wear.</li>
    <li> NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING IT WAS WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PIC AND WHEN I GOT IT. THE PIC ON HERE IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN  YOU PUT IT ON A NAIL</li>
    <li> takes a lot of coats but wow it looks great in the sun!!</li>
    <li> very good product the collect is light blue and sparklyis just like the picture n happy with my new polish</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews first. This is a dull blue gray color with fine glitter. NOT holographic. The bottle does not have the many colors that the picture falsely represents. A total waste of money. And the company Ultimate Beauty Supply has  a no return policy if the product has been opened or TESTED IN ANY WAY. Really? I painted this on paper to test the color. I wanted to see if perhaps the bottle appearance was misleading. Maybe the polish really would look holographic. But, NO! Now I can&#x27;t return it. I have not harmed the product in any way.&lt;br /&gt;This was their response to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product picture posted on Amazon for this particular color is not taken by us, we know that colors with tint of mint and purple are the hardest to match the actual color in photo accurately.&lt;br /&gt;Hence, we always recommend our customers to search \\&quot;Google Images\\&quot; to view as many as photos (product photos and color swatches) taken by different people under different cameras and light settings in order to see how actual tone can be. By doing this, it greatly reduces a chance to purchase wrong colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no mint or purple. And all the other reviews, even the good ones, state that this product looks nothing like its picture. And there is no recommendation to check images in the listing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it, and I really like the way it looks on her. She applied it without a basecoat or top diamond coating just to try it on and at first it looked dull, so she applied one more coat. It turns out, 3 coats is the magic number to get the full holographic depth effect. It looks best under sunlight or direct light; so it probably won&#x27;t be noticed too well at the bar or club for you single ladies.</li>
    <li> Chuncky and does not paint smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice color, but requires at minimum 3 coats to actually look somewhat similar to the picture. It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, but it very glittery and pretty.</li>
    <li> Wow what an awesome color,the more coats you add the more amazing the polish becomes.Very pleased with thi color selection</li>
