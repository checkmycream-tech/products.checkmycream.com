    <li> I saw someone on youtube using this product and she loved it. so i hopped on the bandwagon and got some and it really has worked for my edges amazingly! I bought 6 more bottles of the stuff lol!</li>
    <li> Great product! Superfast Shipper!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT SOOTHES THE SCALP AND YOUR SCALP WILL LOVE IT TOO. YOU WILL FEEL THIS ON YOUR SCALP FOR 10 MINUTES AFTER USE. IT&#x27;S GREAT.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have definitely been able to tell a difference in my hair. It reduces the itching.</li>
    <li> This product sucks waste of money  I  never will purchase any of these products ever again Never Save your money</li>
    <li> bought the several products shampoo, conditioner, on the spot, grotivator, root lifter and it did&#x27;t.  Either it don&#x27;t work for everyone or ppl are lying about this product line.  I didn&#x27;t even find minimal growth. difference.</li>
    <li> Speeding up the growth of my hair I have a couple if thinning areas and this is the only thing that seems to be working and filling in my crown and edges been using for a month and a half very pleased I have the whole kit</li>
    <li> i am just trying it for the first time. After a few weeks I&#x27;ll be able to write a true review.</li>
    <li> Love it....makes my scalp comes alive!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed while using this product is how it reverts my permed hair.  Other than that, I didn&#x27;t see an improvement in my hair at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, while I don&#x27;t see major growth it does seem to have stopped any additional breakage</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the best product of all regrowth hair treatments. I wanted to try this because weaves and braids nearly destroyed my hairline and my mother recommended this product. You can feel it tingling after you put it on and I noticed results within just 1 week of using it. I have tried almost every hair product that promises to grow hair and I never saw results this quick with any other product. As an African American woman who doesn&#x27;t get perms, I think the only problem is that it makes my hair revert since it is a water based product. However, I still use it twice a day and just put my hair into a ponytail since the results are well worth me sacrificing bone straight hair. I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing thinning or balding spots.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few times to find that there was no use in continuing it. I still use the poo and condt</li>
    <li> Product was reccommended by my beautician with high praises for the product. Have been using it since end of November I really wanted to believe in it as I lost my hair line from braiding over the years but it does not seem to be doing anything I feel no tingling and nothing seems to be happening but I keep applying it daily still have hope. Will give it a bit more time.</li>
    <li> I love the tingly feeling it gives and I have noticed hair growing faster around my hair line where I apply it. I&#x27;d say it is working and it smells good to me.</li>
    <li> Love it, it works great.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product yet, but other product in this range works well. I&#x27;ve tried a few of this groganics product.</li>
    <li> it makes my hair feel weighed down. I wouldn&#x27;t order this again</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  I saw results in 2 weeks.  I read the reviews and purchased it.  It really works.</li>
