      <li>:)</li>
      <li>this one is better than many I have seen....</li>
      <li>Be sure to keep it sterile and please do not share this gun with anyone.</li>
      <li>but for the most part it worked rather well.</li>
      <li>My friends now all want me to do more piercings on them</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>Be sure to clean your gun with alcohol as well.</li>
      <li>Great Just Be Careful</li>
      <li>luckily i borrowed and sterilized some from a friend.</li>
      <li>First time I paid $55 on my daughters ear piercing (10k gold earrings included) and my daughter&#x27;s ear had an allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>These piercing guns put you in a higher risk of infection.</li>
      <li>It came on time and was packaged very well.</li>
      <li>Clean your earlobes with rubbing alcohol first and allow the alcohol to dry first before piercing.</li>
      <li>Earrings don&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
      <li>I purchased this with the stainless steel ear studs.</li>
      <li>This is a fairly decent product.</li>
      <li>So far I did four ear piercings</li>
      <li>I got it like a week early.</li>
      <li>and I dont know how my ear and the earring can fit in that small of a space.</li>
      <li>Suddenly it clicked that we all got our ears pierced with an ear gun, very similar to this one, using stainless steel earrings and nothing happened.</li>

<li> and I&#x27;m a little scared.</li>
<li> I just got this a few days ago</li>
<li> i dont know it seems hard to do</li>
<li> the peircing gun itself works very well, but the studs are horrible and caused scabs and infections for all peircing.</li>
<li> Its just awkward for me.</li>
<li> Horrible use a needle instead please!!!</li>
<li> Worst product ever.  </li>
<li> AWFUL!!!</li>

    <li> I got this gun no needles, no studs and no directions. Do I need to buy needles? if so which ones? The studs I placed in the machine fall out. AWFUL!!! DOES SOME ONE KNOW THE ANSWERS?</li>
    <li> Great Just Be Careful</li>
    <li> I just got this a few days ago and I dont know how my ear and the earring can fit in that small of a space. How do I use this!  Okay so I think I just figured out how to use it.you put the stud in and then you pull back on the thing at the end, put your ear in, pull the trigger, and let go of the thing? i dont know it seems hard to do and I&#x27;m a little scared. Definitely not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> it works. It is not what I was looking for but it is what they said it was  but I wont use it on myself. Its just awkward for me.</li>
    <li> It got stuck once and hurt a lot but for the most part it worked rather well. great price :)</li>
    <li> Earrings don&#x27;t fit properly. Gun has little force and earrings bend when the trigger is pulled.</li>
    <li> Never even felt it. Worked great no issues or problems. Great gadget. My friends now all want me to do more piercings on them</li>
    <li> Good performance. ..but need to improve the package. ...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even come with with studs. Worst product ever.  I want my money back! The gun doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> How is it supposed to work? Like theres no room to put my ear in the space. It just pushes the ring out and the ring wont even stay in the hole</li>
    <li> Horrible use a needle instead please!!!</li>
    <li> This piercing gun is good and the company was great to work with.  When I called with an issue they responed immediately and bent over backward to fix my issue.</li>
    <li> I was too scared to try it, but my friend used it and she said it made her nervous but worked none the less.</li>
    <li> Where the heck are the instructions!!!</li>
    <li> got the job done piercing my ears but it could have came with a pair of studs. or instructions. or something! luckily i borrowed and sterilized some from a friend.</li>
    <li> They did everything they said they would do.. I got it like a week early. and it works. the only thing is they should tell you what size needles to use. The needles that I bought are too long.. but I made them work..</li>
    <li> The piercing gun came in about a week and works well. So far I did four ear piercings and I have no complaints. :)</li>
    <li> This is a fairly decent product. It came on time and was packaged very well. Its small enough for my little hands and was easy to use. I purchased this with the stainless steel ear studs. First time I paid $55 on my daughters ear piercing (10k gold earrings included) and my daughter&#x27;s ear had an allergic reaction. The second time, I took my daughter to Walmart because she kept insisting on having her ears pierced. I spent $38 at walmart on 14k gold earrings that tarnished in her ears and infected them. Suddenly it clicked that we all got our ears pierced with an ear gun, very similar to this one, using stainless steel earrings and nothing happened. I purchased this gun and pierced my daughter&#x27;s ears and 3 months later her ears are still pierced without any infections.... Be sure to keep it sterile and please do not share this gun with anyone. Clean your earlobes with rubbing alcohol first and allow the alcohol to dry first before piercing. Be sure to clean your gun with alcohol as well.</li>
    <li> this one is better than many I have seen....it should have a little direction on how to use it however.</li>
    <li> The piercing gun I received was much smaller than I had it assumed to be. The needles it came with made it look like some child&#x27;s play tool. These piercing guns put you in a higher risk of infection. I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> the peircing gun itself works very well, but the studs are horrible and caused scabs and infections for all peircing. DO NOT USE THE STUDS</li>
