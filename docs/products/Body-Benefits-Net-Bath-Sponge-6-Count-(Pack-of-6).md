### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t the best loofahs ever, but they get the job done.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great pricing!</li>
      <li>LOL!  </li>
      <li>These bath sponges seemed like a great deal.</li>
      <li>great for the kids.</li>
      <li>I think I got a great deal and would encourage others to buy this product.</li>
      <li>This is perfect value for how many you get and the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up purchasing these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CTQMIC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_85 and am very happy with them. :))</li>
      <li>The perfect size to fit in your hand and well made...plus a great value for a pack of 6</li>
      <li>We like having a good stock of this type of thing.</li>
      <li>It would take three or four put together to make one good bath sponge.</li>
      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>Who doesnt like a good bargain?</li>
      <li>I did like the fact that the price was good and there were six included in the package.</li>
      <li>A nice option as many folks dont use washcloths anymore.</li>
      <li>Fall apart very quickly !</li>
      <li>Should have known the price was too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>I love having a stash of these under the sink so that when gets worn out</li>
      <li>And to top it all off</li>
      <li>okay cleaning a barbie doll.  </li>
      <li>It turns out; however, that the size seem to be okay.  </li>
      <li>Use this sponge in place of your washcloth with your favorite soap and scrub that scaly skin away.</li>
      <li>Now I can change out my loofah more than once every 6 months</li>
      <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it  5 stars was because they aren&#x27;t of the greatest quality.</li>
      <li>These would be best used as a facial buff than a body sponge.</li>
      <li>THEY ARE OKAY</li>
      <li>These body poofs are cute if you never want to use them.</li>
      <li>I ordered these sponges because the price seemed pretty good.</li>
      <li>They work great for my 6 year old.</li>
      <li>The lightly abrasive netting rinses out easily after use.</li>
      <li>I see why this was so cheap now.  </li>
      <li>cheap price for 6 sponges.</li>
      <li>I got a great deal and would order again for the same price.</li>
      <li>but when I opened the mailbox and saw a package about 3&amp;#34; X 3&amp;#34;, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what I had ordered that would fit into a package that small.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks :) :)</li>
      <li>These net bath sponges are very nice.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for the random occassion a guest needs to use the shower or forgot to bring their own loufa.</li>
      <li>Do the job, come clean in the washing machine, no complaints.</li>
      <li>Might make good bath toys for toddles, but don&#x27;t expect anyone to actually get clean using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not eve worth the cheap price they charge.</li>
      <li>If you use your loofah daily and replace it monthly like I do then this is a good purchase.</li>
      <li>Tiny and not even sewed together good.  </li>
      <li>I would have returned the product but would not have been worth the effort</li>
      <li>This &#x27;very cheap&#x27; bath sponge is more like a child&#x27;s craft project using very little material (netting) and cheap piece of string to hold together.  </li>
      <li>They might be perfect for a child, but for an adult they&#x27;re definitely too tiny.</li>
      <li>Great if you like the small ones though.</li>
      <li>Cheap, but I expected more.</li>
      <li>And even if you were ok with the amount of (or lack of) material, they aren&#x27;t held together well enough to use.</li>
      <li>Most items are sold by third party sellers.</li>
      <li>The first one I used fell apart on the first use.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>They smelled like cheap plastic and were unsuitable in size even for my 4 year old.</li>
      <li>so you always have a fresh one when you need it or a new one for travel.</li>
      <li>We certainly do.</li>
      <li>I thought they were going to be the large ones.</li>
      <li>These sponges look like the  large ones that are sold at stores like Walmart, but they are not.</li>
      <li>The Body Benefits Net Bath Sponge works great in the bath or shower as a body scrubber and exfoliating dead skin.</li>
      <li>We used just one of the sponges for our toddler and have been gentle in our use.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried using it, but I&#x27;m sure it does what it needs to as with any other bath sponges.</li>
      <li>the next one is right there ready for me!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure the sized were in the details, my fault for not reading more closely, it simply never occurred to me that these would be anything other than standard size.</li>
      <li>I only received 11 which pretty much voided the price discount.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the suction cup on the rope, and that is easily cut off if necessary.</li>
      <li>I would think these are more for small children.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!  </li>
      <li>This is why I write this review, because they have helped me decide on many purchases in the past.  </li>
      <li>They were all light blue and had a strange rust color on the rope.</li>
      <li>2nd one is holding up a little better, but for the price you cannot beat it.</li>
      <li>The product itself is just fine, however, I thought I was ordering adult sized loofas, so I was surprised to see they were about half the size of a regular one.</li>
      <li>I will save them for when we travel and stick to buyings them locally for $1-2 each for normal size.</li>
      <li>Much smaller than normal poufs.</li>
      <li>Product Description says that they are 5x5 when they are barely 3 inches in diameter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are nowhere near as big as they look in the photo!&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
      <li>Smaller than I expected but ok for small kids to use.</li>
      <li>These are quite small, and I can&#x27;t seem to not destroy loofahs, but they work pretty well.</li>
      <li>My Pregnant girlfriend purchased a total of 24 sponges with the intention of using them as part of her Blue and Green Baby Shower.  </li>
      <li>The are so tiny that you can barely hold onto them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Upon opening we find that the color distribution was completely off, with 5 Purple, 2 Blue, 2 Light Blue, 1 Orange, 2 Yellow, 5 Green, 4 Pink, and 3 Red.</li>

<li> They do not fall apart or anything, they are just a little small to hold while trying to get clean.</li>
<li> Not as big as I thought and since mailed from China took two weeks longer than other orders.</li>
<li> I was a little worried about the size of the bath sponges as I wanted a decent size (not too big and not too small).  </li>
<li> I would have rated higher but shipping was very slow.  </li>
<li> /&gt;All 6 of these sponges arrived packed in a single 6 x 9 envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who don&#x27;t know, Amazon is not the seller for all items on Amazon.com.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth shipping them back to China for six dollars.  </li>
<li> But it was clear that DoroSports tried scamming me at least twice.</li>
<li> They were a total waste of money.</li>
<li> not very abrasive either don&#x27;t buy</li>
<li> And for that reason I ask that you be careful who you buy this item from.</li>
<li> and my bf doesn&#x27;t have to drag the bar soap across his butt, now he has a loofah.</li>
<li> They also felt very loose and flimsy.</li>
<li> Not an everyday loufa for personal use.</li>
<li> to the low price, I will not go to the trouble of returning the item....</li>
<li> I used one and it fell apart, and the other ones are hanging by a thread.</li>
<li> Very small, and despite the tasteful colors shown, what I received was all pink and yellow.  </li>
<li> However, the sponges I received were 3.5 inches on average.</li>
<li> This is not worth your money.</li>
<li> 1 one fell apart in less than a week.</li>
<li> fits into half of my hand</li>
<li> These bath sponges do the job, but not good enough for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fall apart very quickly !</li>
    <li> Kinda so so quality. Too small for the price. Would not buy again and would just this kinda item at Walmart</li>
    <li> WAY TOO SMALL like for a doll</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the suction cup on the rope, and that is easily cut off if necessary. Otherwise, these are bigger sponges than some, and are lasting as they should! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I used one for a week and it fell apart.  Another one fell apart just by falling on the floor before I even used. The one I&#x27;m using did not fall apart because I tied an extra knot in string.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE OKAY BUT A LITTLE TOSMALL FOR ME.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t the best loofahs ever, but they get the job done. If you use your loofah daily and replace it monthly like I do then this is a good purchase. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it  5 stars was because they aren&#x27;t of the greatest quality.</li>
    <li> These are really small.  I would have rated higher but shipping was very slow.  I did like the fact that the price was good and there were six included in the package.</li>
    <li> The product itself is just fine, however, I thought I was ordering adult sized loofas, so I was surprised to see they were about half the size of a regular one. They work great for my 6 year old.</li>
    <li> These puffs would only be sufficient to wash your left hand. To say they are MINI size would be an understatement. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and tried one. I left the shower second guessing my cleanliness. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these unless you are using them for decoration.</li>
    <li> These are way too small. They might be perfect for a child, but for an adult they&#x27;re definitely too tiny.</li>
    <li> like a really small child.  Should have known the price was too good to be true.  They&#x27;re really, really small.  Did I mention they&#x27;re small?  I mean, they&#x27;d probably do okay cleaning a barbie doll.  Maybe a Cabbage Patch kid.</li>
    <li> Wish i could get it no stars... Unbelievably small. fits into half of my hand and  do not work at all. Fall apart and were packaged poorly</li>
    <li> These are quite small, and I can&#x27;t seem to not destroy loofahs, but they work pretty well. Thanks :) :)</li>
    <li> Might make good bath toys for toddles, but don&#x27;t expect anyone to actually get clean using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the sized were in the details, my fault for not reading more closely, it simply never occurred to me that these would be anything other than standard size.</li>
    <li> Who doesnt like a good bargain? We certainly do. We like having a good stock of this type of thing.</li>
    <li> Guess you get what you pay for. Took five weeks to show up and are so tiny they are useless. Ive been using them on my Chihuahuas!</li>
    <li> These sponges look like the  large ones that are sold at stores like Walmart, but they are not. These would be best used as a facial buff than a body sponge. I used one and it fell apart, and the other ones are hanging by a thread. I will be using them for something because I do not want my money to go to waste, but I just have to figure out for what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend these unless you are looking for a bunch of small loofahs for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality, fell apart straight away.  Took FOREVER to receive!</li>
    <li> The quality of these was horrible.  The website stated that they were bigger than the actual size.  We used one for 2 days and it fell apart.  I would never order these again!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about the size of the bath sponges as I wanted a decent size (not too big and not too small).  It turns out; however, that the size seem to be okay.  I haven&#x27;t tried using it, but I&#x27;m sure it does what it needs to as with any other bath sponges.</li>
    <li> It is a poor quality product. The white string came off and the sponge has unwinded. Cannot be used anymore. We used just one of the sponges for our toddler and have been gentle in our use. I planned to use it for myself, but it is too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star because it shipped well in time.</li>
    <li> This product is nothing like what is pictured.  This &#x27;very cheap&#x27; bath sponge is more like a child&#x27;s craft project using very little material (netting) and cheap piece of string to hold together.  I would have returned the product but would not have been worth the effort so I am writing a review instead.  Typical false advertising.</li>
    <li> Tiny and not even sewed together good.  Useless product.  Do not waste your money!  Not eve worth the cheap price they charge.</li>
    <li> These are very thin and I was not happy about them at all.  It would take three or four put together to make one good bath sponge.</li>
    <li> I see why this was so cheap now.  Very small, and despite the tasteful colors shown, what I received was all pink and yellow.  I threw them out.  It&#x27;s not worth shipping them back to China for six dollars.  Also, it took over two weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> I ordered two packs.  I should have received 12 sponges.  I only received 11 which pretty much voided the price discount.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of ignoring all the negative reviews. I ordered these sponges because the price seemed pretty good. But ultimately these were completely useless. Trash is trash, at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are advertised as 5 inch sponges. However, the sponges I received were 3.5 inches on average. They also felt very loose and flimsy. Combining all 6 of these in a knot will probably give you the same size and destiny of one standard pouf you get the a drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 6 of these sponges arrived packed in a single 6 x 9 envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who don&#x27;t know, Amazon is not the seller for all items on Amazon.com. Most items are sold by third party sellers. Which is the case with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller through Amazon and asked for the correct item and a return label for this junk. I was offered a refund instead. realizing that the &amp;#34;correct item&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t exist I agreed to the refund. Three weeks later I still had not received a refund. I contacted the seller and was fed the following BS &amp;#34;A refund has already been issued to your account. It was in pending status and needed a verification, I have verified this for you.&amp;#34; What? lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t care what they said since the refund showed up in my account immediately after that. But it was clear that DoroSports tried scamming me at least twice. And for that reason I ask that you be careful who you buy this item from. Or, go the safer route and look at a different item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CTQMIC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_85 and am very happy with them. :))</li>
    <li> When they say you get what you pay for this product comes to mind. These scrubs are really small and some were falling apart before use..don&#x27;t purchase these.</li>
    <li> Too small  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> These are about the size of a tennis ball. I was led to believe that they were regularly sized. I would return them if they weren&#x27;t 5 dollars.</li>
    <li> These bath sponges do the job, but not good enough for me. I would think these are more for small children. They are tiny compared to the ones I buy in the department store. They do not fall apart or anything, they are just a little small to hold while trying to get clean.</li>
    <li> The bath sponges were labeled as &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and they were small.  They were poorly put together and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but I expected more. not happy with the poor quality and small side. not very abrasive either don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Tiny, tiny. And they are shipped from China so they take forever to arrive. Absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> The are so tiny that you can barely hold onto them.&lt;br /&gt;They are nowhere near as big as they look in the photo!&lt;br /&gt;More like 1/10th the size!!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than normal poufs. I will save them for when we travel and stick to buyings them locally for $1-2 each for normal size.</li>
    <li> Worst product on Amazon. These are tiny and are practically unravelling out of the package. Don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
    <li> Why 3 stars. I guess you get what you pay for. 1 one fell apart in less than a week. 2nd one is holding up a little better, but for the price you cannot beat it. I think I got a great deal and would encourage others to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This was the worse purchase I have made through Amazon and I use Amazon quiet often.  VERY poorly made.  The first one I used fell apart on the first use.  The second fell apart on the second use.</li>
    <li> 2 sponges were defective with pieces untied and fell apart the moment I removed them from the parcel. The rest were so small I did not even imagine they make them this size! Money thrown away!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the random occassion a guest needs to use the shower or forgot to bring their own loufa. A nice option as many folks dont use washcloths anymore. Equivalent to keeping disposable razors or toothbrushes on hand for the same reason. Not an everyday loufa for personal use.</li>
    <li> These net bath sponges are very nice.  The perfect size to fit in your hand and well made...plus a great value for a pack of 6 so you always have a fresh one when you need it or a new one for travel.</li>
    <li> This is perfect value for how many you get and the price. Now I can change out my loofah more than once every 6 months and my bf doesn&#x27;t have to drag the bar soap across his butt, now he has a loofah. No more pubes on my soap! Victory!</li>
    <li> These bath sponges seemed like a great deal. I read the reviews, looked at the pictures.....but when I opened the mailbox and saw a package about 3&amp;#34; X 3&amp;#34;, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what I had ordered that would fit into a package that small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, I was amazed to see all six sponges stuffed into a snack bag sized ziplock bag! I wondered...&amp;#34;How did they compress those darn things so small?? So, I opened the bag, only to discover that each sponge was about 3&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34; in size! About big enough to use as a women&#x27;s facial puff. Definitely not the bath sponge I was lead to believe I was purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the low price, I will not go to the trouble of returning the item....I wonder if I see a patern here....</li>
    <li> These body poofs are cute if you never want to use them. They are about 1/4 of the size/fluff they appear to be in the picture. This is not worth your money. Seriously. And even if you were ok with the amount of (or lack of) material, they aren&#x27;t held together well enough to use. See my added picture above.</li>
    <li> I thought they were going to be the large ones. Be aware that they are small. Great if you like the small ones though.</li>
    <li> Probably the worst purchase I have ever made online.... and I shop online a lot! This is why I write this review, because they have helped me decide on many purchases in the past.  I can&#x27;t think of a anything they could be used for except, perhaps washing my daughter&#x27;s Barbie dolls. They were a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> junk.  small fall apart in a week.</li>
    <li> These are horrible. So tiny and flimsy. Instead of returning I just use as travel ones.</li>
    <li> Buy this set so you don&#x27;t have to get one every month!  I love having a stash of these under the sink so that when gets worn out the next one is right there ready for me! LOL!  These are just like the ones you&#x27;d buy at Target or the drug store.  Good value.</li>
    <li> My Pregnant girlfriend purchased a total of 24 sponges with the intention of using them as part of her Blue and Green Baby Shower.  After waiting a month to receive them, they showed up in our mailbox stuffed  in a 12x10 envelope. Upon opening we find that the color distribution was completely off, with 5 Purple, 2 Blue, 2 Light Blue, 1 Orange, 2 Yellow, 5 Green, 4 Pink, and 3 Red. No where in the description did it say that they would be random colors, and the picture did not say that it was not representative of the actual product.  Product Description says that they are 5x5 when they are barely 3 inches in diameter.  And to top it all off they are of terrible construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the company (VIKEN) was contacted about a return, they were informed of our displeasure with the product. After describing our issues that we have with their product and sending pictures of the sponges and how they were packaged, they refused to return the product unless there were defects with the sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed with this product and the Customer service of VIKEN. I DO NOT recommend this product or company.</li>
    <li> smaller than anticipated but worked well for my purpose</li>
    <li> Do the job, come clean in the washing machine, no complaints. I got a great deal and would order again for the same price.</li>
    <li> The Body Benefits Net Bath Sponge works great in the bath or shower as a body scrubber and exfoliating dead skin. Use this sponge in place of your washcloth with your favorite soap and scrub that scaly skin away. The lightly abrasive netting rinses out easily after use. Machine washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you find it helpful.</li>
    <li> cheap price for 6 sponges. great for the kids.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected but ok for small kids to use.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought and since mailed from China took two weeks longer than other orders.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great pricing!</li>
    <li> These sponges are horrid. I failed to read the reviews before buying them. They are very small and stunk. I didn&#x27;t use any and because of the price I didn&#x27;t bother wasting my time getting credit. They smelled like cheap plastic and were unsuitable in size even for my 4 year old. They were all light blue and had a strange rust color on the rope. This company needs to stop selling these puffs to anyone.</li>
