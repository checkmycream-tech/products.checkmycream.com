      <li>the price was right</li>

      <li>I checked all my tops and sure enough all the necklines are ruined!</li>
      <li>I first started using the curling cream but then came across the curl activator</li>
      <li>The bottle also says frizz free, soft, bouncy curls.  </li>
      <li>At first when I first bought this product I thought it was working fine, but then when your hair dries the product dries and turns white.</li>

      <li>Once I used too much</li>
      <li>DO NOT waste your money on a product like this!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using flax seed gel for a few years with great results on dry days.</li>
      <li>me, the true end result of a product, is always after my hair dries and next day hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is wonderful! It leaves absolutely NO residue in my hair and once sealed with oil it leaves my hair butter soft. I pray that this product stays around!</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps my curls through out the day.  Have purchased a few of these.</li>
    <li> This is a great curl activator. I like the way it curls my hair.  I&#x27;ve been natural for quite a few years and I&#x27;m just tired of flat ironing my hair especially since it never looks as good or lasts as long as when my beautician does it.  Initially I thought this moisturizer was going to sit on my hair and make it look white and flaky but it didn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or greasy either.  I&#x27;m still torn between this moisturizer and my proclaim conditioner with argon oil. 100% pure aloe vera gel was suggested to me but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but so far I really like this curl activator.  The only downfall I have found with the products that I like is they are not sold in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Oh. My. God! This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve been using flax seed gel for a few years with great results on dry days. However, my curls developed a weak pattern when it was humid and I had a halo of frizz that got worse as the day went on. On a whim one day I bought this because Sally&#x27;s was out of my usual Cantu conditioner and I was mad and just wanted to spend money :) My curls are 3a/3b. I start by applying flax seed gel, parting my curls, then using lots of water and 1-2 dime sized dollops of this curl cream all over, scrunching as I go to encourage &amp;#34;clumping.&amp;#34; Then I plop as usual and diffuse. This stuff does make quite a difference. Is the halo of frizz gone? No, that&#x27;s the life of a curly. But it&#x27;s so much better and I foresee myself using this stuff all year because it also makes my hair really soft once I scratch out extra crunch as it dries. Give it a shot, it&#x27;s cheap and also smells great!</li>
    <li> No just No!  This product left white residue in my hair, I&#x27;m five months transitioning to natural I used this product to enhance my twist outs, I only used a nickel sized amount on my fingertips &amp; smoothed it in my demp freshly co-washed hair I applied this as stated on the directions section by section  The product feels sticky slippery kind of like shampoo without the lather it smells nice but I didn&#x27;t buy this product just for the smell alone my main reason for purchasing this product was to moisturize &amp; enhance my twist outs I wanted to try a new product that has curl enhancing ingredients plus moisturizing properties and this product boasted all these elements on the label  This product left my hair feeling stiff also it left white flaky residue I had to rinse the product out of my hair and re-twist &amp; moisturize with my usual products, I would not recommend using this for any reason unless you plan to do a wash &amp; go if not don&#x27;t waste your money unless you don&#x27;t mind a white crusty flaky mess, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product one star is because it has potential if improvements are made or if you use it as a wash &amp; go only.</li>
    <li> A beautiful bottle of AWESOMENESS!!!  I have been natural for 4 years and my natural hair is curly. Kidd you not for the last 4 years I have been on a journey to find a miracle product that would moisturize my locks and give me curl definition. I have wasted sooo much money on nothing that works until now. Stumbled upon this after so many great reviews and decided to try it. I was sitting in the car this afternoon with my curls looking dull, tired and dried out. I literally applied this product to my hair while sitting in the parking lot and for a minute I thought that something was wrong. It was almost too good to be true, because IMMEDIATELY I felt a difference in my hair texture and knew that I was hooked. This product gave me INSTANT MOISTURE AND INSTANT CURL DEFINITION. That was over 8 hours ago and my hair still looks BEAUTIFUL!! It&#x27;s soft and moisturized. Everything else can now go in the garbage. I am very happy and impressed. I will update in a few days.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me! I am new to being natural and I have 4c hair. The product smells good, and MOST DEFINATELY defines my curls. When it dries it does leave a white residue but nothing you can&#x27;t manage. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure of my curl pattern, but I thinks it&#x27;s 4B. Either way, my hair is very fine and thin and this product worked wonders. This product helps my hair clump together for beautiful wavy curls, without making the hair crunchy. Excellent buy!</li>
    <li> I love it, it did exactly what they said it would do.  Just perfect for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product! Not only does it leave my hair dry and frizzy, it also leaves a white residue.  If you have 3b hair, stay clear of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product it really makes my hair curly and soft and it also smells good.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that really works! It gives such soft manageable bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> LOVE all of Cantu&#x27;s hair products. This stuff is very affordable and yet works SO good. LOVE it and will continue to buy Cantu products and will spread the news...LOVE it....It&#x27;s for any type of hair</li>
    <li> I pair this with Cantu&#x27;s Coconut Milk Shine and Hold Mist, using the mist as my moisturizer and this to encourage my curl definition.  I&#x27;m a fine-haired curly, low to medium density, type 4a/4b/3c.  This product makes my curls/coils pop and leaves them perfectly moisturized without any crunch.  My hair isn&#x27;t weighed down and the curls are somewhat elongated.  It also detangles and smoothes. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> makes my hair super dry.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and provides a decent enough hold on my curls.</li>
    <li> I put a lot of product in my hair so the result is slightly crunchy but I love the way it defines and holds my curls. My major issue with it is it has ruined all my clothes. I let my hair air dry b/c a defuser leaves my hair too dry and gives it too much volume. I noticed one day that my white cardigan had grayish brown marks all around the neckline which wouldn&#x27;t come out by washing it. I checked all my tops and sure enough all the necklines are ruined!</li>
    <li> At first when I first bought this product I thought it was working fine, but then when your hair dries the product dries and turns white. It has a delightful smell but leaves your hair like you put white sand in your. DO NOT waste your money on a product like this!!!</li>
    <li> This product is moisturizing and a great curl activator. It makes my curls revive and pop. Better than I hoped. No need for gel if you want.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, my hair is 2c/3a and 3b. If you use the correct amount for your hair there&#x27;s no problems. Once I used too much and I could see residue, that was the only time.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a white residue in your hair once it dries. Im going to stick with Cantu leave-in moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I put this on my type 3 texture and i liked the moisture and my curls popped!...and then throughout the rest of the day my hair felt as dry as a bone..although my curls stayed my hair was soooo dry and thirsty and i am a bit disappointed and i wont be purchasing again as opposed to their coconut curling cream which i LOVED! the price was right but i was expecting 5 star moisture especially within hours of applying. *thumbs down*</li>
    <li> Luv this moisturizing lotion... works great!  Keeps the frizz down and doesn&#x27;t look wet all the time. Must have if you have curly hair!</li>
    <li> i bought this from the beauty supply awhile ago &amp; i love it it actually defines my curls &amp; smells great when i run out ill buy one offline</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because some of the reviews on Amazon and You Tube stated that this product left their hair soft and moisturized.  The bottle also says frizz free, soft, bouncy curls.  NO NO NO!  Not for me...  I DID NOT have any problems with white residue like some of the reviewers stated.  When I washed and conditioned my hair, I put this product on my hair.  While my hair was wet with this product on, my hair was detangled and bouncy.  I always let my hair air dry.  Once my hair dried, my hair was stiff, crunchy, no movement and my hair felt like I had a pasty residue/build up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the true end result of a product, is always after my hair dries and next day hair.  The next morning, I could not run a comb through my hair because it was so stiff.  I had to wet it just to comb it.  I have 2c/3a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be repurchasing this product.  I bought this from my local Sally&#x27;s for $5.99 and I returned the unused portion with my receipt the next day for a refund.</li>
    <li> THIS IS HOW YOU USE THIS PRODUCT on 4a/b/c hair:  apply an oil of your choice on damp hair (not soaking wet)...I use jojoba oil.  Apply an average amount (2 quarter sized) throughout the hair.  I just big chopped again (due to color - I will never color mg hair again!!! ) and my hair is fine 4a/b/c hair...yes, I have all three types.  So the key is to use an oil underneath and not overuse the product----thereby avoiding the white residue.  The product is awesome and the price at Walmart ($5.50) and you can order it online.  I love Amazon but sometimes the prices are ridiculous.  Always compare.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It gives my hair excellent shine, defines my curls and unlike many curl conditioners gives my hair incredible hold without being hard or crunchy.  The holding power is most likely due to the shea butter.  I hope Cantu decides to keep this new product part of its line. This product has excellent slip for styling and when it dries your style is sure to stay in place.  I use this product under a styling gel and achieve excellent results.  The smell is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> At first I liked this product but now I am not so satisfied with it. It works well during styling but once it dries, the hair looks dry with no shine and the product leaves behind a tremendous amount of residue. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This curls my hair perfectly!!! Would recommend for any natural girl.</li>
    <li> I first started using the curling cream but then came across the curl activator and i must say i LOVE IT!!. I have a mixture of 4a to 4c hair and my curls where popping. I do not get any residue as mentioned by other reviewers. It smells great i always get compliments on how my hair smells and i literally do not need to use anything else. For me it has become a staple for every day use and its great on my pockets $$$$ we have to save save as much as we can. If you don&#x27;t like it well its under 10$.</li>
    <li> Best Curl Cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I have 4C natural hair and this cream allows me to wash and go with great definition and curl.  I do twist my hair regularly, but sometimes all I have time to do is wash it and take off and this cream defines my curls but still leaves my hair baby soft and bouncy.  I absolutely love it for keeping my hair moist and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have very curly but also very dry and brittle hair. This product smells wonderful and does define my curls, but first off it stayed white in my hair for quite some time and then eventually (and not even half way thru the day) it dries out and leaves my hair looking dry again although still curly.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing curl activator for the hair.  Works good on the hair and makes it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have brought this item twice.  It keeps your hair moisturized pretty good and it smells real nice to me....</li>
    <li> I have used this product only one time. However, it smells great and gives my hair a nice matte shine. I would use it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it revived my dry curls and made them shiny and black, bouncy. I have dry dark brown hair, the product moisturized my curls so much it made them black and shiny and changed the texture to soft , spiral curly wavy. it literally unleased my frizz covered curls and defined thme. I have 3b/3c hair. My mom has 4a hair and it did not work for her. It dried her hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love this stuff. It smells awesome. It is not sticky, and it holds wonderful.</li>
    <li> This curl activator is a must have for all Naturalistas</li>
    <li> A little crunchy if you use too much, but it&#x27;s an awesome product! It smells great. Keeps my curls hydrated and defined. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I like the way this works and I don&#x27;t have to put a lot of other stuff in my hair when I  use this.  It really keeps my curls moisturized.  I&#x27;ll  buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my hair looking moisturized and smelling great all day. Would highly recomend.</li>
    <li> Tried putting this on wet hair and dry both time the results were the same....DRY HAIR...I have 4a natural hair and this product dried out my hair leading to breakage during my wash and goes....never again</li>
    <li> Realized I was using too much and now that I&#x27;ve figured out a proper amount I&#x27;m in love. My hair is softer, I can finger comb my afro and it looks incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad to find this isn&#x27;t being carried at Walgreen&#x27;s anymore.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Previously I would apply gel to my natural hair before going to work and we all know the characteristics of gel is the hair will be crispy and hard.  Since I found this product, I apply it to my hair instead of the gel and my hair is so soft PLUS I love the curls my hair creates when this cream is in my hair.  Great product!</li>
