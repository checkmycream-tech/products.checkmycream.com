<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I saw a few reviews saying this product was fake. Fake or not it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and I noticed a nice difference after one session.</li>
    <li> smells amazing and works really well, not necessary to use a large amount for tanning. I use this for bed tanning and outside</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product</li>
    <li> I love this lotion My skin tanned very quickly and the smell is great</li>
    <li> This is more of a lotion than a tanner. Did absolutely nothing for me but stain my hands orange.</li>
    <li> Saw the negative reviews and sceptical about ordering. But I wanted to chance it because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about luminary and wasn&#x27;t going to pay retail. The shipping was fast , it wasn&#x27;t sealed and the light didn&#x27;t work ( the least of my worries) . Tried it today for the first time. The smell was nice , after I got out of the tanning bed saw glimmering on my skin. Later I could tell a big difference , didn&#x27;t think I could get darker(no trace of streaks and no trace of Orange color) . Wow</li>
    <li> Works very well and a lot cheaper!!</li>
    <li> I used this for a week and I got a beautiful glow that doesn&#x27;t look fake. Haven&#x27;t had problems with streaking either and the scent isn&#x27;t bad either. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Loved everything about this. From the smell to how dark I got!</li>
    <li> I just received this lotion today, and instantly fell in love. When i first applied it to my skin, it felt so soft and amazingly silky, even better than Black 20x. This is hands down, the best \\&quot;smelling\\&quot; tanning lotion i have ever purchased! and not to mention, the packaging along with the ligh-up stars, was super cutee! As for the scent, i would definately describe it as citrusy and fresh, which is a very nice scent for going in the tanning booth. I&#x27;m not a fan of the after smell of tanning, so having the fragrance from this product definately helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem i had was that my shipping was delivered a day after the estimated delivery date, but i have a feeling it was partly the post office&#x27;s fault, due to being inconsiderately SLOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately buy this product again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was fantastic. It smells SO good, doesn&#x27;t leave that stinky \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell at all. The lotion leaves my skin super smooth, although just a tad greasy. It left my skin definatly darker just after tanning twice in two consecutive days as well. Overall i was very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past month and it&#x27;s worked great so far. Also, its smell is just perfect, not too strong. I&#x27;ll absolutely buy it again because it works perfectly for both indoor and outdoor! &lt;3</li>
    <li> I really like Luminary Tanning Lotion!  I have yet to try all of the other top brands of tanning lotion because they are too expensive and now I see why!  The Luminary bottle itself is probably worth more than the lotion!  It&#x27;s got a whole light up sparkly deal and all... Anyway, what&#x27;s most important is that it works and I have noticed a difference in my tanning.  I wish there were more lotion in the bottle though... I feel like I have to be so frugal using it but the lady at my tanning salon says you never need a lot anyway... just enough for a thin layer over the skin!</li>
    <li> I used to tan a lot in high school and I took a break from it for a while until recently.. I wanted to invest in a good lotion even though they&#x27;re usually pretty pricey and i asked one of my friends for her opinion so she told me to check out amazon for lotions vs. buying them at a salon (she worked at a salon that sold luminary and other designer skin products for $80-100) overall I really like this lotion, it makes my skin feel like silk, I like how I don&#x27;t smell like a tanning salon after using it. also, the packaging is pretty and the bottle lighting up was a really nice touch</li>
    <li> I like this product but can&#x27;t get past the smell.  Way to fragrant.  I&#x27;ve used Black 20X and it&#x27;s a nice light scent this one smells like mens deodorant.   Ewwww - Can&#x27;t wait to use this up so I can buy another bottle of Black 20X.</li>
    <li> this tanning lotion is okay. it got me tan at first. but its at the end of my month at a tanning salon and i havent noticed incredible results like other people were talkikng about.  i just ordered obsidian from designer skin and i am waiting for it to come. one of the girls at the tanning salon recommended it. i also ordered paint it black ( i think) it was only $15 so i figured i would try that one too that comes today so i am hoping it comes in before i go tanning. i wasnt that impressed with Luminary. hoping the others will be better.</li>
    <li> Turned me a little orange. And there was a horrible after tan smell thats worse than anything else I&#x60;ve used. But, that&#x60;s just me. My salon manager  loves the stuff and bought it off me. Everyones different.</li>
    <li> I wanted this in the salon but it was about $100. No way am I wasting my money on that!! So I came to amazon and sure enough the price was cut in half. (I bought this 1-2 years ago and it was $50, i see its now around $40.)  The little plastic sign on it didn&#x27;t light up for me. Very disappointing since that seemed like a cool little feature. Anyways, I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference with this lotion then with other lotions. I&#x27;ve had $15 lotions work better. I was expecting this to give me gorgeous dark color; nope, never did:(</li>
    <li> I love all the lotions in the Designer Skin line. I have tried several and have worked my way up to the level of the Luminary Bronzer lotion. It smells fantastic and it works great. Because it is a bronzer, it gives you color as soon as you put it on and as soon as you step out of the tanning bed you have a gorgeous tan. Nothing about this lotion causes you to turn orange. My preferance is to put the lotion on after I get out of the shower and then go to the salon, that way it has a a little time to \\&quot;soak\\&quot; in. Then, I come home and get dressed for where ever I am going. I smell great and I&#x27;ve got a nice tan to go with it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and the way it smells.  It seems to work really well for me and my skin is fair.  I recommended this as a starter lotion.  Use common sense though and start at a lower time...I always do that when I switch lotions beat cause you never know how your skin could react.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite scent but it was nice but had a great bronzing effect. I would suggest you try it at least once.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is pleasant, but that&#x27;s where it ends.  Why?  Primarily because the print on the bottle is too small to read.....cannot make out directions or more importantly what sunscreen it contains.  I do not tan with sunscreen so my intent was to purchase an indoor/outdoor bronzing product.  On the one occasion when I did venture to use it, I did not notice any bronzing effect and I was surprised because I tan very easily.  I&#x27;ve been afraid to use it again because I can&#x27;t read the print which may include information that I need to know for optimal usage!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite tanning lotion. I will never use another product again :)</li>
    <li> I ordered Luminary because a friend said it was really good for tanning your face in the tanning bed. It&#x27;s a bit more than I would normally spend, but it&#x27;s just for your face. I&#x27;ve used it for about two months straight (I have my own bed at home, I tan daily) and I have not noticed any color difference. I will say though that it does smell good and it&#x27;s not oily. I use it now just when I&#x27;m outside or for a moisturizer as it does help with keeping your face feeling moisturized.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, as I have seen no results color-wise with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Irish and have light skin and naturally red hair, but I have found several different lotions that work really well for me personally to get the tan I want.  This isn&#x27;t really one of them that offered me any color results over two months.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product, I have used it before this purchase so it was not a new product for me. I would recommend this product because it does work. This seller had quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST lotion! I will buy it again and again and again! I would def buy this lotion if you are indoor tanning and want to get darker faster. I have only been tanning for 2 weeks now(twice a week) and everyone keeps asking me if i just got back from the beach! it&#x27;s JANUARY!!!I love it!!</li>
    <li> All the Designer Skin products are great! This one smells like a feminine perfume, it leaves my skin silky smooth, and skin color is nice after I tan. I&#x27;ve smelt like I was burnt a few times, but it&#x27;s better than smelling like I was burnt every time with a different product I used. My boyfriend uses Obsidian and he&#x27;s a lot darker than me and we started at the same time. Obsidian also smells stronger, he said it tingles his skin, and it more masculine of a scent. I like the Luminary and maybe I&#x27;ll try his next.</li>
    <li> Luminary is a great tanning lotion by Designer Skin. I was forever looking for a lotion that left me smelling fresh and clean after tanning and this lotion most definitely delivers. It has a light perfume-ish scent and a great consistency it even has a light glitter in it! I am also always worried about going any hue of orange and I have not had any issues with that while using this lotion. I have let several girlfriends try this lotion and they have all loved it as well. I would recommend this lotion for a beginner or intermediate tanner or anyone who is keen on a perfume like scent like I am.</li>
    <li> So I was a little hesitant about buying a tanning lotion online. I did a lot of research( 3 or 4 days worth) about the different lotions and sellers and what not. I prefer Designer Skin, because they are just awesome in every way. The scents are yummy, never too powerful and never the ATO. The ingredients are always only the best, and they always have things in them including silicone and vitamins to nourish your skin during the tanning process. I wanted a lotion that would get me dark fast, and no not orange, dark. Because I am moving to Florida in a month. I tan at executive tans and have went so far 4 times, and I have the most beautiful dark tan, already. All thanks to my favorite tanning lotion  ever!! \\&quot;Luminary\\&quot;  Talk about a moisture rich, creamy, not greasy, lovely scented, DARK tanning lotion. And it comes in the most adorable bottle ever! I noticed as soon as I put it on that my skin was SUPER SOFT. I didnt even have to wipe my hands off after applying, no orange at all. This lotion retails for $120 at my salon, and I will not lie, If I had the money, I would actually pay that for this lotion it is that good. But why do that when you can get it here for $40!?! I love this lotion!  Also, another great lotion is Obsidian by Designer Skin!  By the way I have very pale skin, and this lotion still worked great! :)</li>
    <li> Feels like spreading on silk.  Great smell that lasts even after tanning.  Never a tanning bed smell after tanning. Have tried lots of lotions and this is the best so far.  Am not a fan of the flashing/glowing light-up bottle.  Pulled that off ASAP...I&#x27;m not 8.</li>
    <li> I burn very easy and this tanning lotion gives you a great bronze tan without the red blotches. It smells wonderful and it isn&#x27;t a thick lotion like most of the ones out there. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. The smell is wonderful and the color is fantastic to. It doesn&#x27;t give you an orange color, it gives a BRONZE color like it says. I love how the bottle lights up also. Purposeless but it&#x27;s still cool. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I received this product almost 2 weeks ago so I&#x27;ve used it around 5 times so far. I purchased it because I had read that it got high ratings for anti-aging. I&#x27;m 28 and 2 old 2 be using tanning beds, *sigh* so I wanted a product that would help fight off that old-lady-who-still-does-indoor-tanning look. When the lotion arrived it was still in plastic wrapping so I knew it was new. The bottle lights up, which wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the description. I personally found it lame, since I would rather pay for more product than a light-up-bottle, but I could see how someone else could find the feature charming. I do like the way the lotion smells. It reminds me more of a cosmetic lotion than a tanning lotion scent. The lotion does apply very smoothly and it definitley leaves my skin softer than any other tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. My only issue is that it just doesn&#x27;t seem 2 be building much color for me.  My last lotion \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; by Australian gold gave me a much darker color and though the bottle didn&#x27;t light up, it cost half of what Luminary does. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase this lotion again, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it. Overall, it&#x27;s better than a lot of other lotions I&#x27;ve used, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone trying 2 darken quickly.</li>
    <li> I am new to tanning, and this is my first time buying tanning lotion.  I have very fair skin, and I was worried that I would burn when starting out.  However, I haven&#x27;t burned once, unlike my sister who has been tanning for a while now!  This lotion is very comfortable, too, not oily or anything like that.  That, and I absolutely love the smell of it.  So do others, I always get a lot of compliments that I smell good when I wear it!  Haha.  Definitely buying another bottle once my current runs out!&lt;br /&gt;Only slight disappointment was that the little Luminary sign didn&#x27;t light up when I opened it!  I didn&#x27;t really mind but my sister wanted to see it light up really badly?  Hahaha.</li>
    <li> I recently got back into indoor/outdoor tanning.  Upon being faced with shelves upon shelves of very expensive lotions, I did some research.  I&#x27;m so glad I did too because I was able to snag two bottles of tanning lotion and a moisturizer for less than the price of buying ONE bottle of this lotion from the salon.  I&#x27;ll admit I was wary at first due to many claims of people getting fake lotions so I saved my packet of Luminary to compare to the bottle I received and it most definitely is the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading the description of this lotion and seeing the salon price, I was skeptical.  The silicon really is magical because it feels so wonderful on the skin!  After applying this, I don&#x27;t even need to apply an after-tan moisturizer because it keeps my skin super silky and smooth.  It lasts all day long and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily.  I can take it or leave it when it comes to bronzers, I never notice them for some reason.  I really love the smell of this lotion too but more importantly, there is no gross after-tan smell when using this lotion.  I do believe the subtle shimmer makes a big difference in catching more of the UV rays.  I love that I can use this lotion outdoors as well.  I can definitely see a difference in color using this lotion in a high-pressure bed.  I also think the light-up plaque is super cute and it caught my attention right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend this product and had a great experience ordering from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update: i&#x27;ve been very curious to see how luminary would perform at the beach as there are no reviews about that, so here is mine for anyone else who may find it useful.  i did a little test by putting luminary on one part of my body and my old dark tanning oil on the other.  i have to say that the light shimmer was much more prominent to me on the beach than it has been in the salon.  i didn&#x27;t have any wet wipes with me but thankfully i did not need them because this lotion did not leave orange or streaky hands at all.  as always, i love the smell of this lotion and my skin was so silky smooth.  not long after application i started to notice that my skin was much warmer on the luminary part of my body.  i wasn&#x27;t expecting that because i thought the oil would be warmer.  the l.e.d. is not just a gimmick like i previously figured.  it really does capture more of the light.  my color was definitely more noticeable on the luminary parts and that colored stayed even after a shower, so i know it wasn&#x27;t just from the bronzers in it.  even after swimming, most of it stayed on but it&#x27;s not even a problem to re-apply because i got this lotion for 40 bucks, i could never bring myself to do that had i bought it for 120 or so from the salon.  the beach and the salt water usually leaves my skin pretty dry, but not when using this lotion.  my skin stayed hydrated and so smooth.  i kept my bottle in my cooler so it wouldn&#x27;t get ruined by the heat.  i&#x27;m still amazed by this lotion and only wish i had discovered it here on amazon sooner!  happy tanning!orange or streaky hands at all.  as always, i love the smell of this lotion and my skin was so silky smooth.  not long after application i started to notice that my skin was much warmer on the luminary part of my body.  i wasn&#x27;t expecting that because i thought the oil would be warmer.  the l.e.d. is not just a gimmick like i previously figured.  it really does capture more of the light.  my color was definitely more noticeable on the luminary parts and that colored stayed even after a shower, so i know it wasn&#x27;t just from the bronzers in it.  even after swimming, most of it stayed on but it&#x27;s not even a problem to re-apply because i got this lotion for 40 bucks, i could never bring myself to do that had i bought it for 120 or so from the salon.  the beach and the salt water usually leaves my skin pretty dry, but not when using this lotion.  my skin stayed hydrated and so smooth.  i kept my bottle in my cooler so it wouldn&#x27;t get ruined by the heat.  i&#x27;m still amazed by this lotion and only wish i had discovered it here on amazon sooner!  happy tanning!</li>
    <li> So i have yet to try this lotion. I wanted to read the reviews first and it sounds like an amazing lotion. The ones who didn&#x27;t seem to like it too much mention that the smell is nice so the don&#x27;t have to shower right after tanning ....hello? U r not supposed to shower for six hours after u tan with a bronzing lotion. This is why u r not seeing the results. This goes for all lotions with bronzers. Hope this helps some of u!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the best!  What a great price too!</li>
    <li> Great product. Received in a timely manner and in good condition, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This lotions is AMAZING!! Very smooth and makes skin soft! I was using other lotions, but noting that seamed to really work, I am prone to dry skin, so when I tan it fades rather quickly. But with this I stay tan, and got tan quicker. After my 3rd session i really noticed results, and had softer skin after the first use. I bought the lotion from this seller, and love it. I had to buy a new one before the bottle was less than 1/2 way empty, because I forgot it by the bed, and someone took it. :( One of the girls I work with worked at a tanning salon for years, and she said that Designer skin is the best brand out there. She said all of their products are the best. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> ok so i tried this lotion today..yes it was velvety smooth, nice \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; scent...not like most lotions, you know bananas, almond, coconut etc. I&#x27;ve only used it once and i have a nice base tan from using a much cheaper lotion that smells amazing (protan black). I have 14 karot gold on the way to my house from Amazon but i needed something for now since i ran out of my protan...so i bought an packet of this because everyone has been raving about it..the packet at my salon was 15.oo!  However i did get a discount because i own my own tanning bed at home..sweet!  the lotion is nice but i did not see a significant (sixty dollars worth) difference between this and others i&#x27;ve tried.  sorry.  just being honest..maybe it takes more than one try to see the difference..but i tried one called \\&quot;white to black\\&quot; and i was 2 shades darker within 24 hours!  I guess i was expecting more from ds.</li>
    <li> Ive never used a lotion that smelled this good and got me so dark. I love this product. Buy from this seller!!!! I got my bottle in less then a week! Very prompt service! I cant wait to buy my next bottle.</li>
    <li> Cute bottle? Yeah. Great smell? Better than some other lotions I have smelled, but not worth the extra money quite honestly.  I did not think it was anything special, like buying perfume or whatever.  Also, I put it on everytime I went tanning and I am pretty sure I got just as dark just as fast while wearing indoor tanning lotion that I bought at the local store (that was like ten bucks).. so, maybe I am missing something here, but the difference in this lotion versus less expensive, more reasonably priced lotions seems to hardly be different (except the bottle is cute!) The BIGGEST downsides: The bottle is EXTREMELY hard to squeeze! &amp; it&#x27;s overrated. bottom line.</li>
    <li> I first bought a packet of this at my tanning salon. The lotion is powdery smooth and smells awwweessooommmeee. I was looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t give you that \\&quot;just tanned\\&quot; smell, since I often tan before I go to work. This definetly did the trick! My husband hates the tan smell, but when I come home and get a welcome hug and kiss he can&#x27;t help but smell my neck! :)  I would recommend this product to anyone! The only downside is that the bronzing isnt that powerful.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion! Smells great and is better than BLACK, which I loved last year.</li>
    <li> Works really well... this lotion is sold in tanning salons for $98-$120! Used as a daily moisturizer, it works great and makes skin satiny smooth.</li>
    <li> I got this ONLINE from my wish list here on Amazon. Im all for buying lotions in the salon but my salon dosent have this in yet and I wanted it. Well I have most of the designer skin 2010 line and I LOVE this one. I feel like SILK Its way more moisturizing  then black. I love it and you do see pretty much instant color. I Love this lotion and I notice like a tiny little super light shimmer on my skin from this. Its really a great product. I def love this lotion its worth the amazon price for sure and the packaging is so cute that little luminary sign lights up! Aw lol but its annoying getting the lotion out of the bottle with it. However just be really careful when ordering ur lotion online to make sure it dosent freeze cause then the lotion is no longer any good so make sure ur expecting the mail and get it in right away. My mail ppl are great so they just throw it on the ground on the ice so I went upstairs and checked for it my other face lotion from alaffia was frozen but THANK GOD this lotion wasn&#x27;t I opened it RIGHT away to check. SO yea its totally worth the price it smells good before and after tanning and it feels amazing. Most importantly it WORKS!</li>
    <li> This lotion is AMAZING! It smells great, not the typical \\&quot;fruity smell\\&quot; like most lotions, it has a very light perfume scent. But the results are awesome! I have only used it twice, but the results are great, im happy to say im very tan because of Luminary. The bottle is really cute, props. on the light up idea. You smell just as great getting in to the bed as you do getting out. Best lotion ever. Will def. buy again!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product but it really is great, you can&#x27;t beat the bronzing level that you get from using it, I went from being medium to very dark in 1 1/2 weeks. highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> amazing! saw immediate results right after getting out of the tanning bed. The girl working there was amazed at how dark I was and how fast it worked on me (I am fair skinned). This lotion smells great too, it smells like ralph lauren perfume. And the lotion as a moisturizer is FANTASTIC. it feels silky smooth and is extremely moisturizing. I highly recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to be tan very fast and cares about the health of their skin as well.</li>
    <li> Great price! This lotion smells really good and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell.</li>
    <li> I advice you to buy this product on amazon.com because the tanning salons try to rip you off and sell it for $120 or more. The Luminary bronzer is the best tanning lotion I have used and the Black tanning lotion by the same company is my 2nd.</li>
    <li> I have used 50X black made by the same company but this product blows it away! I got great color after the 1st use and it smells amazing! i would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping!!! I have ordered from them twice now and i would do it again!!!! They ships items very fast and the products are great!!!!!I definitely recommend that you purchase from this company!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> At first it smells nice then after a couple of hours it smells like a self tanner. It didn&#x27;t really give me the results like other lotions I&#x27;ve bought from designer skin (which I bought from tanning salon). Overall it was like putting on self tanner without the results.  I bought it for the price. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My fiance bought this lotion under the impression that it was very good. The tanning salon highly recommended this lotion and a lot of people on Amazon have left good reviews.    My fiance has fair skin and liked the Luminary, but wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with it. I tried it and found it to be a waste of money. This lotion did not have ANY noticeable effect on me. I tan very easily and can get very dark. I haven&#x27;t tanned in over a year. I tried this lotion about 4 times and was not happy with the results. Last year I used Melt and had good results. The tanning salon said this was better than Melt. It wasn&#x27;t for me.     After my disappointing encounter with Luminary, I found a lotion that blows Luminary and Melt out of the water. My fiance&#x27; and I will not be going back to Luminary or Melt. I wrote a review for the other lotion if you want to find out about it. Just check out my other reviews.     Side Note - I am not associated with selling tanning products. I&#x27;m a pilot and just wanted to let people know my experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I got the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been using this lotion. You can tell a major difference after one use. If you are new to tanning and don&#x27;t already have color, I don&#x27;t recommend this, you&#x27;ll probably turn orange. Use this after you&#x27;ve gone through another bottle of something less intense (I used Buzz and Smile mixed together, then moved on to Luminary). It smells amazing and it makes your skin really soft. I never felt leathery or itchy!</li>
    <li> I recieved it in the mail today. I went to the salon and saw immediate color, and even better color after I got out. the smell is fantastic especially because most lotions have the same smell. This scent leaves me smelling good, even after tanning. Which is great becasue it means I don&#x27;t have to run straight home and clean up before any other activites. The best part about this lotion is the softness it gives you, I was amazed and speachless about how soft my skin was.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing...but not quite as amazing as the seller. I received the lotion way before the projected arrival date. The bottle was packed so carefully and the blinking medallion on the front of the bottle was the first one I&#x27;d ever seen work. I will never buy tanning lotion from the store or another seller again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this lotion twice now.  It is one of my favorite bronzer lotions (Worship Me is also a GREAT lotion too) This lotion leaves your skin softer than anything!! The color is natural and results are immediate after one tan and only get darker each time tanning. A little goes a long way, so dont over apply. As with all bronzers, its better to not shower for at least 4 hours after tanning. When you do shower, you will see color in the water coming off your body- but not much, all bronzers do this :) I promise you will be satisfied if you order this product! For most people i know that have used this, it has become their absolute all time favorite!</li>
    <li> I loooooove this lotion! I will definitely order it again. I got so dark the first time I used it &amp; it makes you&#x27;re skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Luminary for a while. I started using it when I was already tan, and did get even more noticeably dark than I was before. Just started tanning again after winter and am using Luminary and am getting tan quicker than I used to before. The smell straight out of the bottle is nice, like Ralph Lauren, and it makes me feel silky. BUT maybe 30 minutes after I&#x27;ve finished tanning it starts to smell weird... the nice fresh scent from before is replaced with a \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just spent 20 minutes in a hot box\\&quot; smell, that I never smelled with other products. I used something from Australian Gold before, and while I didn&#x27;t get as dark as Luminary, I still smelled nice hours later with Australian Gold.    Sad, the blinking medallion stopped working rather quickly and then just plain fell off the bottle. No big deal, the lotion is the important thing, but I liked the medallion.    When I run out of this I plan on trying a packet of obsidian and a packet of the JWOWW lotion since I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews about both of them.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS LOTION FOR YEARS. I ONLY BOUGHT THIS LOTION B/C OF THE REVIEWS ON HERE, WHEN NORMALLY I BITE THE BULLET AND BUY IT IN A SALON. I HAVE BOUGHT MANY LOTIONS OFF OF AMAZON AND HAVE NEVER BEEN RIPPED OFF, UNTIL NOW. VERY UPSET. I GAVE IT A BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND USED IT A FEW TIMES A WEEK FOR A FEW WEEKS AND IT WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE OENS IN THE SALON. TEXTURE, SMELL, COLOR, EVERYTHING. ITS A KNOCK OFF. VERY PISSED. LESSON LEARNED, PEOPLE DONT WRITE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOR NO REASON, AND THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE. I HAVE BEEN TANNING FOR 15 YRS AND HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY A CO OWNER OF A SALON.... SO I AM FULL OF KNOWLEDGE WHEN IT COMES TO TANNING BEDS, AND LOTIONS, AND THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IS NOT THE REAL DEAL. SAVE YOUR MONEY, TIME, ETC. DOOOOOOOOOOO NOTTTTTTTTTT ORDER.</li>
    <li> Like the product. It has a great scent and helps hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used many other products, so I&#x27;m unsure of how it stacks up to the competition.</li>
    <li> Okay, coming from a tanning JUNKIE, this lotion is AWESOME. I have used a million kinds, and Designer Skin is always my favorite. I was using Black, which I loved but I got tired of it. I just ordered this one last week and so far have used it twice and WOW I got so dark. It makes my skin super soft and I can feel it working while I&#x27;m tanning. The scent is also really nice, its very light but smells very feminine and floral. I definitely will keep using this lotion.    *Also another cool thing is the bottle lights up which I didn&#x27;t know upon ordering it! :)</li>
    <li> My all time fav!!! Will always get this lotion even with the new stuff coming out this is always my favorite.!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions on the market not just for indoor tananing but it is just a fantastik body type lotion it stays with you all day</li>
    <li> This Is an Absolutely !! Excellent!! Lotion!  It is a High End Product - It does deepen your color even if you have \\&quot;level 3\\&quot; color like me, and what it does for your skin as a moisturizer is incredible !!      [[ASIN:B002X9XV48 2010 Luminary Bronzer Indoor Tanning Bed Lotion 13.5 oz]]       This lotion was recommended to me as one the very top products for indoor tanning by the Tanning Salon I use out here in Sunny Southern California - the image capital of the US as well as home to One of the top Sun Worshipping Locations in the country.    Add to that I work outside and live between the beaches and in the deep High Mojave desert; From Malibu to Death Valley. So take it from someone who has to take serious heavy duty care of their skin whil trying to keep myself looking neatly bronzed to avoid a harsh hard highly uneven desert rat/beach bum appearance, I can&#x27;t settle for anything but the highest quality most effective product available!       Add to that, Like everyone else though, we have to still tan indoors thru the winter months if we want to keep the deep bronze we earn all the rest of the year. Although at the higher altitudes where I am about 50% of the time we are closest to the most available UV Solar Daylight In the Northern Hemisphere, there is still not quite enough of the UV-A radiating to replenish the body and allow effective tanning if desired. Better than most, but not enough such that unless you keep a base tan/color, you can burn more easily!     And it can be just as dry in the winter as in the summer.   I often go for weeks in that part of our climate and at altitudes where there is literally no recordable humidity whatsoever.    Having used this product though has actually caused my skin to grow more moist and smooth than I&#x27;ve ever been able to do even with medicated lotions and protection even under these conditions.    It has an irresistable silicon bead type feel. Although designed for Indoor tanning and therefore somewhat water soluble and safe on clothes and plastic, as it heats up on the skin it really does absorb and enhance whetever you have naturally even on skin like mine which is often dried out from exposure! It stays with you - not greasy at all but smooth light and really pleasant to touch....  It does seem to be on of the top products you can use!    So after I tried a tester/sample and wanted to buy it at the salon, I found out the price they wanted also reflected a platinum grade product. Aaargh.  It was only by an odd quirk that my schedule for the day I first tried it also had me at home relaxing killing a little time which I spent at the computer.    It did not occur to me at ALL that I could find it here at Amazon much less online at all.  But---- if you don&#x27;t \\&quot;google\\&quot; it, how willl you ever know?    The Real surprise though was that I&#x27;m able to buy it here at LESS THAN HALF what the salons charge.  Frankly, I almost thought I was going to get a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; product but still the price was worth taking a chance. Besides, Amazon is excellent about returns and customer satisfaction.  No Knock off here!!! It is as good as good as - no, it&#x27;s BETTER than buying it at a High End salon  at over twice the price!    I should also mention that I have found at Amazon.com and among their vendors the best price online. Period.    Oh, And the service is Excellent.   Every delivery date I am promised on every order has arrived days and even sometimes up to a week! sooner.    So to summarize:   Best and Highest Quality Product I have ever found;  Best Prices Anywhere online here at Amazon less than half of retail;  Best service you can ever get;  And Highly recommended By myself- Humbly, a World class professional Tanner- Used regularly as my primary skin care in some of the most harsh sun and weather conditions in the NorthWestern Hemisphere! ( I Love it out here!!)    Enjoy, and Bye-Bye for now from Sunny SUNNY SoCal !</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the Designer skin products and I can say this one is my favorite. I like their Obsidian as well but the smell of Luminary is much nicer and got me just as dark! Very pleased with this product its not overly oily, great smell, and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This Product works better then any others I have used.  It gets you darker right away and really develops. I typically leave it on for 6 hours after tanning.  It does rub off a little on light colored clothes, but comes off easy in the wash.  As a guy the smell is definitely tailored more toward females.  Its not super overpowering or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to comment on how great my skin feels after use.  It leaves you very moisturized, which is probably a big contributing factor on it working so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price at the tanning salon is crazy expensive.  Getting it for under $40 on Amazon is the way to go.  I also had great luck with the seller I used. .</li>
    <li> very disappointed, way over priced!! I&#x27;m a fan of Designer Skin but this lotion was horrible the worst I&#x27;ve tried the only reason I gave it one star was the scent wasn&#x27;t bad other than that it was horrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of the Designer Skin products. I&#x27;ve used pretty much every tanning lotion they make that doesn&#x27;t contain tingle. Last year, I was using Black (20x bronzers), which is an excellent lotion. The only reason I stopped using it was because I&#x27;d seen that DS had come out with Luminary, and the 25x bronzers caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of Luminary, and it&#x27;s working so well for me. I&#x27;m really fair skinned, so I don&#x27;t get as dark as a lot of people do. But all the bronzers in this lotion give me that extra boost of color I want. It has never streaked me or made me look orangey at all. It also makes my skin feel super soft, something that most other brands of tanning lotion don&#x27;t do. The smell of this lotion is great too; it&#x27;s a nice clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since my very first visit tanning this year, and it definitely helps me get the most out of every visit to the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this lotion to anyone who tans indoors, even fair-skinned folks like myself. The prices on Amazon are really good too; this lotion goes for $100 and up for a bottle in the tanning salons in my area.</li>
    <li> The lotion absorbs lightning fast into the skin and leaves it smooth and moisturized. I did not have to slather it on like with Designer Skin 2009 Phoenician Tanning Lotion to keep skin hydrated. The scent is very light and pleasant after tanning, although I would not call it \\&quot;Sweet Champagne Fizz\\&quot;, I wouldn&#x27;t say its all that sweet or champagne-y or fizzy. In the bottle however, the smell reminds me of wet feet... But all my best creams do not smell great. Because it has bronzers, it does stain clothing; the surprising part is that with all its 25 bronzers it does not stain it all that much.  I do not like the bottle, it looks like it&#x27;s for children. I do not like the bulky sign, either, and it doesn&#x27;t always light up when I want it to. The background chosen is horrible, I cannot read the print on the back of the bottle because the matte black letters don&#x27;t stand out against a shiny blue/black background...  A for lotion. FAIL for bottle design.</li>
    <li> Luminary bronzer smells awesome, goes on smooth, and leaves your skin feeling very silky. The bronzing is effective and doesnt give a fake orange look. It helped me to build and maintain a quick tan as I was preparing for a FL trip in 2 weeks. Its great for after vacation tan maintenance too, AND It can be used for outdoor tanning!  I definitely noticed my tan lasting longer. The best part is my tanning salon was selling this product for $150!!!!!!!!!! It came quickly and fully sealed!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff, because I mean come on! The bottle lights up!! How cool is that?! But honestly, I went from using 24 Carat Gold to this crap and I saw no difference in my color..I burned all the time because of the silicone that&#x27;s in it..Don&#x27;t waste your time on this..Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing- it leaves your skin feeling like silk and you don&#x27;t have that stinky smell after tanning.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for years - I recently over the past 2 yrs slowed down on my tanning &amp; I was so upset that I had to but it was recommend by my dermatologist &amp; he is amazed at how well this product helps to cut down on the tanning &amp; is now recommending it to his patients that refuse to stop tanning - I have amazing color from just going 2-3xs a week!! I highly highly recommend this product &amp; I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM A SALON AGAIN! They offer this @ my salon for $125- I paid $44 here on Amazon!! Smells great &amp; softens skin like no other lotion - No cooked skin smell @ all :D</li>
    <li> I must say, this product sure smells good!  My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t bronze you as dark as other products.  I had a month long membership at a tanning salon and used it every other day.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I was tan all right, but not as dark as I am used to after going that many times.  Maybe this is a good thing!  I certainly did not look \\&quot;orange\\&quot; or \\&quot;fake baked\\&quot;.  I will probably continue to use this product.  Oh...and the bottle is super cool.  The little lights on it blink when you shake the bottle!</li>
    <li> Try this...it turns you dark quickly. I have red hair and fair skin - this is my second bottle of this lotion &amp; it&#x27;s given me a great tan without burning.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this lotion is $120 in salons! This is a great deal and totally worth it. It shipped fast, the bottle is just precious, I love how it lights up, and after just one use in the tanning booth I saw results! Natural, dark tan. It&#x27;s not greasy and it smells amazing. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, as well. Definitely glad that I bought this lotion, I&#x27;m going to buy the luminary face one as well and hope it works just as great.</li>
    <li> I used to tan but now I am happily pale- but I still buy these lotions just to use on special occasions. This one smells a lot like the perfume Light Blue, and I cannot tell you how soft and glowing it makes your skin. It is my secret \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; and perfume. The light up stars is kind of ridiculous however.... Hahah</li>
    <li> As a general rule I avidly avoid UV exposure (read sunblock and sunless tanner to prevent skin cancer and pre-mature aging), but for a trip to Vegas I decided to go to the dark side (pun intended) and hit the indoor beach a few times before I go.  After reading all the Amazon reviews I selected this product.    PROS:  This product definitely does what it says it will!  My skin has never been so smooth (the silicone really is amazing), the bronzers are in no way orange, and after only two trips to the tanning beds I am perhaps the most tan I have ever been in my life! I have very fair skin and light colored eyes with a tendency to burn easily so this is really saying something. This same product was highly recommended by the staff at my tanning salon and retails there for 3x as much.    CONS:  While many reviewers rave about the fragrance that&#x27;s what cost my review the final star.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it is decidedly perfumey and strong. It does cover the \\&quot;after-tanning\\&quot; smell, but is too much for my taste. A little more subtlety in the fragrance department and this product would have been 5 stars!    BUY AGAIN?  Overall I am very happy with the performace of this product, but next time I think I&#x27;ll sniff around the salon and try another product that has a smell that appeals to me more and then order it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> For the price this product sells for on Amazon (around $40.00) it&#x27;s the best indoor tanning product I have used.  I&#x27;ve tried about fifteen brands throughout the cost spectrum.  A quick note on that- This product sells at my local retail salon for $89. I&#x27;m not sure where the MSRP of $120 is generated, but that&#x27;s inflated. As for the product:  This is the only tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used which after my session I do not need to shower. I do not know what the chemicals are in Designer Skin Luminary but the product is neither oily nor greasy. A retailer told me silicone provides the smooth texture. It does have a smooth feel to it like silicone. Never-the-less, it feels cleaner and does a great job of minimizing that chemical smell skin creates after indoor tanning.   The fragrance is too strong for my liking, however; it&#x27;s a far cry from that nauseating dessert fragrances most indoor tanners use. To me, it smells like flower air freshener.  The moisturizing properties are excellent as is the bronzing effect.  My one criticism is the packaging: The bottle is very rigid. This makes squeezing out the last of the lotion almost impossible. Shaking the bottle rigorously will displace some product but I usually hold it under the faucet and suck in water to dislodge and loosen up the remainder.  Finally- an important trick to knowing whether you are receiving a first rate product: This product comes in a bottle which lights up with little LED lights. Twice I got a new bottle with the battery protecting tag still in place. I pulled it out and little lights around the front label blink for about ten seconds. On the other occasion the tag was not in place and the battery was dead. Just food for thought if you&#x27;re looking for the highest quality merchandise.  In short- Great product. Just watch the price and keep in mind that you may not be getting a new bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I have used it for several years.....love it!  I am very happy with the supplier.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times, not more that a couple consecutive days, so I don&#x27;t really know how well it works when used regularly.  I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t stain my hands and there is not as much noticeable color from a single use 10 min in level 3 bed as you get from Smoke Black.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I love the smell, it makes your skin SUPER soft and it gives you a nice tan! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Gives a nice bronze look and leaves your skin feeling super smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very nice as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good bronzing tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Also the cute light up bottle adds a chic flare to it.</li>
    <li> This pruduct is not the best that&#x27;s for sure it i&#x27;s very expensive though for some reason I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Had a base tan almost instantly and it kept my skin moisturized pretty much all day. Nothing bad that I can say about this one..would love to try the face version.</li>
    <li> I have Scandinavian skin, but I tan very well with high quality tanning products.  This product turned my skin the cheapest looking orange color.  I was so embarrassed!  I am a professional, and this was an very un-classy look.  The positive reviews on here must be from people with little experience with tanning products or with a skin color completely different to mine.  I am sure that you can find good deals on Amazon, but this was not even close.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how good the deal was if the rest of the bottle is not even worth using.  I usually have great experiences with Designer Skin products, but all I have to say about this one is what the heck. Considering how far off the mark this product is,  I have serious doubts about its authenticity.  This was shipped via Amazon so I had no problems with the seller or shipping, great experience there.</li>
    <li> Loving how this product feels. Goes on very smooth, smells wonderful, and I am tan after only 2 days of tanning with it. Highly recommeneded for those with any skin type includung rare!!! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love all of designer skin&#x27;s lotions, but this is my favorite by FAR. this is the best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s the right consistency, not too thick or thin and the lotion has little sparkles in it. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I noticed I&#x27;m a little darker than normal and I&#x27;m smelling good as hell for the rest of the day lol and a side note, this has nothing to do with the actual tanning, but the bottle is so so cool. it lights up blue on the emblem and the sparkles are awesome haha</li>
    <li> Omg I love this lotion. My skin just glowed from a wonderful tan. I first bought it from the tanning salon for 120.00 USD, and when I found it on Amazon , I bought it right away for a great savings.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s real... Hated it, couldn&#x27;t wait to use it up and ordered my black 100x</li>
    <li> We are in Costa Rica for 2 weeks and wanted to tan and get a base in oregon before we went.  We tanned 2 weeks and started using this at home and then when we got down here. The couple we went with were from Minnesota, and white as sand. Put it on me, my wife and them along with sunscreen.  Our white friend burned like bacon...it did nothing for the base tans wife and I already had.  It is junk!  Do not buy as you are wasting your money. With so many negative reviews, why does Amazon allow them to sell.  Why have reviews when there is so much counterfeit crap.  Listen people, there is a reason(other then people trying to cut down the competition)that so many people have left negative feedback.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion love the shimmer and sparkle</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! So glad the package arrived earlier than expected and the lotion was sealed!</li>
    <li> I have been using Obsidian for the last year and was looking for something different to try.  The reviews on Obsidian were great so I gave it a try.  Overall, the product is very nice.  It has a great scent, goes on well and it is pretty moisturizing.  I didn&#x27;t have the same level of results that I achieved with Obsidian, but I really do like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> okay, i DO like this lotion..it smells great and does give good color...but being a red head with normally pretty light skin, i have found that i get the BEST color from DESIGNER SKIN BLACK...i wanted to try something different just because i heard a lot of people liked this. i have a also tried JWOWW, and it gives a lot of color, but the bronzer in it comes off pretty quick...honestly, id spend your money on BLACK. :)</li>
    <li> I never tried a bronzer in a tanning spa before, I used to get red but now with this product I get an instant tan. Dark n nice!! Love it! Is what I was expecting :)</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase a packet of this at my tanning salon before purchasing an entire bottle, and I loved it!!  I already own a few other Designer Skin lotions, including Black, so I had prior experience with the silicone emulsion formula.  I was hoping Luminary would be even more moisturizing than Black, and I was not disappointed!  Like Black, Luminary smells nice on your skin both before and after tanning, which I love because I frequently tan before work.  Personally, I think it&#x27;s silly to buy your lotions at the tanning salon, where you can spend up to three times as much money.  I absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone who has hit a plateau, or even a beginning tanner, as it&#x27;s safe for all skin types, and tingle free.  Happy tanning!</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TANNING LOTIONS! IT SMELLS GREAT. IT LEAVES YOUR SKIN SO SMOOTH, AND IT WORKS. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This came very quickly, un damaged! It&#x27;s about the third of the price of any I&#x27;ve gotten at a tanning salon! Great product! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> This is the best, wont use any other lotion.  I think the light up bottle is a waste, but I am almost 40!</li>
    <li> I have used this twice already (once with the Masquerade as a substitute until this gem came in) and I&#x27;m ridiculously bronze (in the best way)!! This lotion smells very pretty and is not overpowering. It also absorbs very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait too long to hop into the tanning bed. It also glides onto the skin very nicely, almost ensuring a nice and even application. I must say that the bottle is beautiful and the lights on the logo are even more adorable (very sensitive though)!! It&#x27;s best to buy the bottle online because tanning salons will sell this for anywhere from $75 to 130.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Way cheaper that salon prices and definitely worth it! The only annoying thing was I couldn&#x27;t figure out how the front worked, until I realized it was a button. Once I realized that, I loved it even more and pushed the light up like 20X in a row!!! Not to mention I used it once and came out with a definite glow to my skin. I have used it 3X now and am definitely pushing myself to the next level of tan!! BUY THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> Great price, much better than salon prices. I will definitely be buying more of this. Came quickly and just as described. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I love the price here, it works real good, they are ripping u off at the tanning salons, way overpriced there</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and ordered Luminary and was not disappointed.  I love the smell, the texture and how silky my skin feels after using it. Well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I decided to spend more money on a tanning lotion for once and I am glad I did! All the other lotions I used in the past were ony 4 bronzers.  I hit a plateau with the 4 bronzers and Luminary made me darker after only using it once! I recommend this product but don&#x27;t buy it in the salons its $120 there.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for tanning keeps my skin feeling smooth and smells great.  I received great service my product arrived in less than 8 days.</li>
    <li> This product was everything that I had hoped it would be.  I especially liked the price. My local tanning salon sells this product for $120.....Really!  What a rip-off!  I will continue to purchase my Design Skin products on-line on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I order their after tan lotion now faithfully, but this is the first time I had tried this lotion. The Luminary Bronzer is definitely pricey, but still MUCH cheaper through Glamour Tanning than at the tanning salon. I have my own tanning bed so i refuse to pay the exorbitant prices for lotion at the salons. I&#x27;ve used this twice (i already had a base tan). I was very dark getting out of the bed but it seemed to fade alot after i took a shower that night. I am hoping I just needed to exfoliate, lol. I def like the smell and am not going to let it go to waste since I paid for it, but may stick to my black 100x afterward, or the Worship Me lotion. Still good product, great service, and excellent packaging.</li>
    <li> My roommate used to work at a tanning solon and she is like a tanning expert. I needed something that would give me good color and fast. She suggested one of her favorites, Luminary, which normally runs about $120. I bought it for about $45 and its better than anything I have ever tried. Smells amasing, makes skin feel great, I tan so much quicker in the beds and it saves me a lot of money![[ASIN:B002X9XV48 Luminary Bronzer]]</li>
    <li> Used it twice so far and I can already see a difference. Plus,it smells great. I will definitely be reordering this when I run out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT.! it made me two shades darker right when i got out. my mom looked at me in disbelif. It was crazy! and it doesnt washboff in the shower what so ever. It smells amazin too! I would recomed this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Designer Skin never fails me :) I&#x27;ve been in love with BLACK since it first came out, but decided to give Luminary a shot--- I was not disappointed! The fragrance is not overwhelming, but smells delicious. It gives me a nice bronze glow with no orange :) I&#x27;m buying my second bottle today.</li>
    <li> this product was shipped promptly and brand new never opened and still in the packaging! Smells and works great! One of the best!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the retail price on this although I believe the upcharge comes from the \\&quot;lights\\&quot; on the front that were broken when I received this. Not that it mattered to me, but I tan easily, have tanned over 30 years in beds, have owned my own bed, and have used many different types of lotions so I consider myself a pro at tanning products. I bought this mainly because you can use it indoors and outside, though I have yet to use it outdoors. The smell is nice, it has moisturizers in it which is great for the skin, but I must say that LOTIONS ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE TANNING BEDS YOU USE THEM IN AND VICE VERSA. And it really depends on whether you tan easily or have fair skin. Having said that, I can only rate this as a 3 with the current tanning bed I am using. It can really only be truly rated if you use various beds since there are different types of tanning bulbs.</li>
    <li> This was originally given to me as a gift, and I was shocked at the retail price at most establishments. Much less expensive from Amazon. The bottle is a bit fancy, but the smell is pleasant, and the results are great.</li>
    <li> This is not your ordinary bronzer...after the first use, I couldn&#x27;t definitely tell a difference and it smells good too!</li>
    <li> I bought Luminary on the word from my tanning salon as well as many others that this lotion is THE best tanning lotion out there. Well, alright then I must try it if it&#x27;s THE best! My opinion is it&#x27;s just...average. Maybe slightly above average. The initial smell is wonderful, fragrant and smells like a perfume. By far one of the best tanning lotion smells I&#x27;ve encountered. The feel of the lotion is great as well, goes on smooth, silky, the &amp;#34;crushed pearls&amp;#34; give my skin a beatiful glow. After using the lotion I have a fairly normal ATO, it&#x27;s definitely noticable and this doesn&#x27;t do the best to cover it up. The results are good. But that&#x27;s it, just good. Nothing to shout from the rooftops about. I definitely notice some color after one use but I feel like I would need to use this multiple times a week at the salon to continuously have color. I&#x27;m a very busy person and I need a lotion that will keep my color with minimal use at the salon. I&#x27;m going to use a different lotion after this one is done so I can see if there&#x27;s really a difference with this one. Personally I&#x27;ve found that Designer Skin&#x27;s Obsideon to be my absolute favorite thus far. Buy this lotion if you wish, you won&#x27;t be disappointed but I definitely believe there are better ones out there!</li>
    <li> Great tan...great transaction...did everything to fulfill my tan and my needs immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and tell all my friends!</li>
    <li> This is nice bronzing lotion. The aroma is WONDERFUL! And I use a lot of these over the year and the Designer Skin Liminary is perhaps the best I&#x27;ve used. Pricey but not out-of-this-world pricey for the quality.</li>
    <li> I love the Luminary tanning lotion by Designer Skin!  I was tan after the first use! I have already received many compliments on my golden/bronze tan!! I highly recommend this lotion, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller! The product is exactly as described! The lotion arrived in 2 days - way before the promised arrival date!</li>
    <li> I got the Luminary because it was the most expensive and promoted at the tanning salon I used to go to. They were selling it for $100. I have tried other Designed Skin bronzers that are cheaper and give you better results. This isn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
    <li> - Almost eliminates after tan smell  - Softens, glows, perfumes, hydrates, tans your skin  for CHEAP!!!  - Scent blends with your skin chemistry to give an alluring smell!  I can&#x27;t make this up people!  - Works fast to give you fast results in short amount of time.  - and It&#x27;s blinged out with glitter and a light up sign!   - I prefer this over the HD California Tan line (Bridget, Ginger, Moxie, etc) which still gives you that after tan smell.</li>
    <li> Great and got here quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion!  Designer Skin products are always great, but this is definitely my favorite.  It smells really good, and applies smoothly and cleanly.  You don&#x27;t end up with brown hands or brown shades on your clothing.  The color isn&#x27;t orange at ALL--just a nice tan brown (no grays, either).&lt;br /&gt;I see a difference in one tanning session--even over the \\&quot;Black\\&quot; Designer Skin :)&lt;br /&gt;I am bringing it to Hawaii next week :)  I can&#x27;t wait!&lt;br /&gt;The lights on the bottle are a gimmick and overkill.  I hate to think that I paid extra for little led&#x27;s.  ;)  But even with that, it&#x27;s totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> i used to purchase this at my tanning salon for about 3x&#x27;s the price. I love it, gives a deep tan and skin feels great afterwards, the difference that I see between this lotion and others it the way it fades, your tan lasts longer and fades evenly without looking blotchy.</li>
    <li> I just purchased a bottle of Luminary 13.5oz tanning lotion from Amazon directly (not a third party merchant). Reason being is I was given a \\&quot;Promotional Store Credit\\&quot; that can only be used through products amazon sells and not another seller (such as Glamour Tanning or Sealed Tanning Lotions.) I was a bit skeptical I must say, considering there was and are not any comments/reviews posted under Amazon as a seller. Of course there were MANY raving reviews for the two sellers I mentioned previously. Also, when ordering this product, amazon listed it as out of stock and it will be available on Feb 13th. I was shocked to see that it was shipped out on February 11th and arrived at my front door on Feb 13th at 11:15am !! I ripped open my package extremely excited and it included shrink wrap around the product as well as a plastic barrier (such as when you buy a prepaid cell phone, you have to cut the thick plastic that is surrounding the item. Also, there was even the plastic tab behind the LED logo that you have to remove in order for the label to light up when touched!!) I opened the bottle, smelled the product, IDENTICAL to the real thing. My next test was putting some on the back of my hand and feeling its texture, consistency and observing the color.. Everything looked spot on. And mind you, I previously bought a bottle from my tanning salon for $98 + tax (10% now) &#x3D; $107.80 and still had a little bit left (i purposely did this so I could compare my bottle ordered offline, to the real thing from a tanning salon.) NO DIFFERENCE. I used it yesterday (Mon 02/13/12) and got extremely dark from it. I could not be more THRILLED. I just put in an order for another bottle through Amazon (currently the item is \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; but I will not be charged until it is re-stocked and available in inventory.)  I hope my review/comment will help some indecisive/hesitant buyers. My recommendation to any future buyers for this product, is to DEFINITELY buy it through either; Glamour Tanning or Seal Tanning Lotions (free shipping &amp; available for amazon prime &#x3D; free 2 day shipping)or Amazon.com directly. If you do order through Amazon, and the item is listed as \\&quot;back ordered\\&quot; or temporarily out of stock, this may work in your favor, due to the less likely of getting a fake/bunk bottle of lotion, and it being brand new due to being back ordered!!  Thanks everyone and to my fellow tanning lovers!! :]</li>
    <li> I purchased Luminary from this buyer the bottle looks completely legit and all the great reviews made me buy it. I tried it and it was a COMPLETE disapointment, i did not get dark at all. I truly believe this is a FAKE. I had a base tan with Masquarade and its cheaper and gave 100% better result. I dont recommend spending your $40.00 here. NO NO NO!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It was shipped to me extremely quick too.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Luminary by Designer Skin took me to a new tanning level I never imagined! This lotion is set to replace Black in 2010. For whatever reason, my salon has had it on the shelves. I have been tanning for 3 years and have tried dozens of lotions from different lines, including my favorite Designer Skin. Luminary is unlike any other. With 25 Bronzers, you reach your tanning peak! The smell and after-smell are both great, somewhat citrusy. It leaves your skin baby soft and does not come off on clothes. As if not enough, it comes in this beautiful bottle that has flashing stars on it! However, like all other Designer Skin products, it is pricey! I purchased it from my local salon and you should too! Buying off line creates many troubles, from personal experience. The lotion could be -old, damaged, obsolete, contaminated, counterfeit, or stolen! Pay the extra money... after all your skin is worth it!  [...]</li>
    <li> I have been buying tanning lotion from my tanning salon and this was a great price. And was the real thing I am so thankful for my lotion and I love amazon. I will only buy my lotions here now.</li>
    <li> Price is the best!!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the only stuff that tans me (awesomely) and doesn&#x27;t give me an awful rash. I love it so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of in the middle on this lotion. It was recommended to me from a friend, and I just don&#x27;t get the dark color from it that I thought I would. I am a serious tanner, so I am very critical of the products I use and try. The smell lingers and I don&#x27;t care for it plus it just doesn&#x27;t give me the color that I get from a different brand. Skip It.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong perfume smell when you put it on. After tanning it has a strong smell thats not good!!!!!!!!!!!! It does great for the color tho!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few months back and love it. It is silk smooth on your skin and the after smell isnt a gross tanning smell, you could even ask my boyfriend! It has great bronzers in it, the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used in the 5 years of tanning. Another plus is the size of the bottle. This WILL go a long way. Super great deal buying it here, salons may triple the price! Ordered JWOW next. Hope it has great results like this. Look for my review on that coming up!</li>
    <li> not bad for that price</li>
    <li> this lotion smells wonderful, and works great.    i have used this since i started tanning again a few weeks ago. i wanted a smell good lotion, and some bronzing action, i usually use the tinglers-like bombshell, or goddess in the past-but when you first start tanning, you can&#x27;t use those right away. so, i decided to try this, having used designer skin lotions before i knew i wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.......and i am extremely pleased with this lotion!    it helped me to establish such a deep and rich tan within a few days, and i was practically transparent. now i alternate with this lotion and bombshell.     if you are thinking about purchasing this lotion, do try it. i think you will be very pleased with the smell, feel and results that this lotion will deliver.</li>
    <li> I love the this lotion, I was going to get it from the tanning salon I go to, but is was $120.00, so i looked on amazon and found for a lot less.  I ordered it on a Friday nite at 8pm, and it was on my door step on that following Monday when I got home from work. great service and love the lotion, I have olive skin and sometimes it&#x27;s takes awhile for me to notice a differnce but notice after the 1st time I used it. from a happy customer in Sacramento, Ca</li>
    <li> First I have to say that I spent hours, yes hours, researching tanning lotions..So, based on the reviews of this product I expected to be really impressed..Well, unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t..It works no different than the $20 brands I used to buy..But with that being said, I have to admit that it does leave you skin silky smooth and the smell is nice and fresh..The lotion overall is just okay in my book..Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on a second purchase of this lotion :/</li>
    <li> I have tried a few other lotions before, and I always come back to Designer Skin brands.  I have been using DS Black 20X since it came out, so when I saw people review this as being \\&quot;better than Black 20x\\&quot;  I had to try it.  It&#x27;s definately worth spending the extra money for a quality item, and amazon always has great prices on the products.  I have fair skin, and since using this product I have never been so dark.  The lotion goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and smells wonderful--reminds me of a Ralph Lauren perfume.  Even after tanning, it still smells just as great.  The bottle actually lights up, which was a cute idea.  I would definately recommend splurging the extra cash for this product.  It&#x27;s wonderful, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I am an avid tanner and I love the Black products!  This is the best lotion so far that I have gotten.  I would recomend it to anyone.  The price was very nice and the shipping was outstanding!  I had it within a few days and have been using it ever since. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I saw this product at a tanning salon for WAY more money and decided to try to find it online. As always, purchasing through Amazon.com was great, and the product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! This one is by far the best I have ever purchased. The scent is great and leaves no after tan smell. Goes on easily and leaves my skin silky smooth. I also am getting amazing color after only 2 uses! I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The light up sign is STUID,I Love the SMELL! which face it in a tanning lotion is the 2nd most important thing. Works great too. Leave skin soft and Dark. I use supers and I tan very easily so its hard for me to get past a certain point without going jersey shore look. A+! Also arrived very quick with AmazonPrime.</li>
    <li> This will now be my fourth time buying this lotion and I love it!  I can use it when I&#x27;m tanning indoors as well as outdoors!! I consider it a double bonus just on that.  The smell of the lotion isn&#x27;t strong but has a sweet smell to it.  Best lotion ever and would never pick anything else!</li>
    <li> very fast shipping! great product!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion can be used outdoors which is great because I love to lay by the pool and tan. I recently used this for the first time on the beach and was very suprised by how amazing it smelled. The scent reminds me of a high priced perfume and doesn&#x27;t have the sunscreen smell that most tanning lotions have. As for the level of tan I got from this product, I&#x27;d say it was above average. I spent most of the time in the ocean rather than laying on the beach, but I still got a good tan. I&#x27;ve bought several different tanning lotions and this is my favorite.    Also, I usually don&#x27;t use tanning lotions that have a bronzer in them due to the fact that I don&#x27;t want my skin to look orange, but the bronzer in this lotion didn&#x27;t give my skin any kind of orange tint. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning irregularly for a couple years now, I go now and then and at one point I had good color, but then I stopped going often enough, this tanning lotion gave me a great even boost in color after just 1 session, and I assume after a few more sessions it&#x27;ll have me dark in no time, I&#x27;m quite satisfied as it does take me awhile to tan, also it smells awesome from the descriptions that it was perfume-like concerned me, its really not, very fresh and clean smelling slightly citrusy</li>
    <li> I have to say that Designer Skin has the best products on the market overall, the skin care can&#x27;t be beat. As far as getting a super dark tan as fast as possilbe I have to recommend Beyond Black from Millineum lotions..after no more than 2 visits you will be as dark as you want to be..smell after is not pleasant, but you can beat the tan. I use Designer skin to keep it up and will use Bombshell for the sun-kiss look. For the fastest, darkest tan I have to recommend Beyond Black hands down.</li>
    <li> The product was a good price and was shipped in a timely manner. However, after a month of using the product I did not received the tanning level I expected. The salon owner wanted to check the lotion since every time I used one of her beds a film was left on the acrylic and it was incredibly hard to get off. She compared my lotion to the same product she sold in the salon, and told me that the lotion I had bought was either fake or had extra ingredients in it causing damage to the acrylic in the tanning beds. I had to throw this lotion away and purchase another bottle from the salon. By the end of the next month I saw a dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> It was shipped very fast. The seller was awesome. I was just not impressed with the product. It had so many good reviews, so I was excited to receive it. I saw no results, as far as a better tan. It smells great and is good as a lotion. But it did nothing as for achieving a better tan.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this lotion. It makes you get really dark quickly.. I&#x27;m buying this one from now on.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, you don&#x27;t leave the tanning bed with the scent that tells everyone that you&#x27;ve just been tanning.  it has great coverage and makes your skin feel great, I love this lotion for the scent, but I would recommend Black 20x for a slightly darker tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion from the tanning salon, and purchased here on Amazon. Same thing, quarter of the price! Love this lotion! My skin felt GREAT afterwords and the bronzer worked well. I totally recommend this if your going to buy if for a reasonable price from Amazon! By far the best lotion I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this lotion because I had seen a lot of hype about it and knew that it retailed at $100+. I wasn&#x27;t really disappointed because the price was so low, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as many other less expensive lotions I&#x27;ve tried. The bronzer was not very effective and I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I read reviews and talked to friends of mine about it for probably about 5 months before I actually found one for a good price and decided to purchase it! And let me tell you - it was definitely worth the wait! I&#x27;ve only used the lotion twice, in medium pressure beds, and I can already see a HUGE difference! I&#x27;m a few shades darker and my skin feels a million times more smooth! The lotion smells great, feels great going on, doesn&#x27;t have a yucky after-tan smell, and gives me the best tan I&#x27;ve ever had! I&#x27;ve been tanning for about five years and I have to say this lotion is hands-down the best I&#x27;ve ever used! Love love love it and will definitely be purchasing more when this bottle runs out! (:</li>
    <li> Makes your skin soft and silky and gives you some color while waiting on a good base tan, apply a little and rub in good and wash hands afterwards, I have fair skin and this stuff gave me an amazing glow without streaking !  My tan got many compliments and I use after bathing if im tanning or not just to keep that glow! Then apply Vaseline to your skin and you will feel amazing !!</li>
    <li> I recently got a job at a tanning place where they sold this product for $114.00 and with my discount, I still wouldn&#x27;t buy it! The price on here is well worth it! This is one of the very few tanning lotions that you can actually use for indoor and outdoor. Luminary gives you an instant boost of color while also actually tanning you. The smell is like a perfume. I always get complimented on my smell when I get use it. The little Luminary sign lights up too when you shake the bottle which I thought was super cute. This is the only Tanning lotion I use :)</li>
    <li> Great smell. Beautiful packaging an works quickly to tan your body. Doesn&#x27;t leave bad smell after tanning.</li>
    <li> This lotion costs $120 at my salon. I was super curious and since they didn&#x27;t have sample packets my only choice was to buy a full size bottle from Amazon. I&#x27;m sure glad I did. I finally found a lotion to help me break through my tanning plateau. I can always rely on Designer Skin to offer bronzers that don&#x27;t cause streaks. I&#x27;m pretty sloppy when it comes to applying my lotion so non-streaking ones are a must. I had fabulous results after just one use, and it made my skin feel silky smooth and moisturized for hours later. There was no ATO, even on my hands which for some WEIRD reason always smell like burnt toast no matter what lotion I&#x27;m using. It has a perfume-y/cologne-y smell that&#x27;s familiar to me but I can&#x27;t remember exactly what it is. I would consider it a unisex scent. I think a man could easily get away with using this lotion without feeling self-concious about it. I normally prefer more fruity scents. However the smell doesn&#x27;t linger for long so I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a man after tanning. It has quite a bit of glitter in it which some people may not like and I don&#x27;t think Designer Skin emphasized that enough in their official description. They call the ingredient \\&quot;Soft Celestial Stardust\\&quot; but it&#x27;s very noticeable. I personally think it&#x27;s kinda sexy. The bottle is hilarious. I didn&#x27;t realize that the stars actually lit up when I bought it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! Gives you an amazing golden look the very first time and continue to get darker an darker with very few lays. Goes on very good and nice consistency. I can&#x27;t wait to buy another bottle!!!!</li>
    <li> Not very good, makes my skin look weird color and takes for ever to develop any color at all.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It goes on super smooth and makes your skin super soft! Gave me and my husband beautiful color. Doesn&#x27;t give you the &#x27;I just tanned &#x27; smell&#x27; I highly recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow, I am truly impressed. I have tried literally dozens of lotions (thanks to Amazon) in search of one that actually works. This is it. The silicon is so soft on my skin and leaves me smooth all day long. The smell is definitely fragrant, but not overly perfumy like many other reviews stated. There is no after tan smell like burnt flesh- only a soft feminine smell kind of like Dolce&#x27;s Light Blue. And the bronzer-the best part. This lotion gave me a gorgeous bronze color that is noticeable immediately. No streaks, no orange, just glowing color. I always purchase my lotions from Sealed Tanning Lotions here on Amazon. They come sealed as promised and that makes me feel confident in the safety of my purchases. I definitely recommend this lotion. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice lotion but do not spend the full retail price on it: it&#x27;s not worth it. It does make your skin feel silky smooth but the bronzers are nothing special and the scent is a little too perfume-y for a tanning lotion IMO.    I have nothing bad to say about this lotion, I just feel like it&#x27;s over-hyped.    11/07/10, Update: I just want to mention that I just used a sample packet of Designer Skin Spellbound and I am convinced that it and Luminary and actually the exact same lotion. I don&#x27;t even think the scents are significantly different. So don&#x27;t pay more for Luminary if you can get Spellbound at a better price.</li>
    <li> Luminary goes above and beyond any other tanning lotion! It feels great on your skin and the moisture lasts for hours. It has the best smelling scent of any lotions I&#x27;ve used, and it seems like the color I get after tanning with it lasts for weeks.</li>
    <li> I love what this lotion has done for the color of my skin! I am a pale person and needed to get tan quick. I had tried some other lotions (some cheeper lotions by designer skin some from other brands) but was having a hard time getting tan. I sampled this at the tanning salon and loved it!! I noticed a difference after one use and went home and bought a bottle after the second use. The reason I give this lotion a 4 star rating and not 5 is because the smell is VERY strong and I like more mild smelling lotions. After I tan I feel like ppl can smell me from a mile away so I have to go take a quick shower.</li>
    <li> I am an experienced tanner and was looking for a product wiith great bronzers that don&#x27;t make you look orange...this was it!  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I just received this lotion in the mail yesterday.  I am SO glad I bought it.  Goes on silky smooth, smells great, no horrible after tan smell.  I saw a difference after the first time using it.  It shipped in a reasonable amount of time and arrived quickly.  :)  At my salon it sells for $120.00 and I got it here for $39.90, I was skeptical, but I am SOOOO glad I ordered it.  I definitely recommend it to other tanners!  :) The pretty lights on the front are a plus.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging! Excellent product! Excellent price! Very smooth transaction. Product arrived several days before expected arrival date. I will never purchase from a salon again.</li>
    <li> Well,  I was beyond excited to get this lotion - usually I love anything from Designer Skin, but this lotion fell short. The bottle is absolutely amazing the way the stars light up - I was so excited like a little kid. And the smell is amazing - I don&#x27;t feel like I need to shower right after. It also feels amazing - sososo silky and smooth.  As for my darkness..it really didn&#x27;t do much for me. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot darker from other lotions. I had Black2White and I loved it, but the smell was too horrible.   I also really liked Designer Skin Ravish Me - Loved it actually. It made me ten times more darker than Luminary did.  Oh well - I fed into the hype.</li>
    <li> I go tanning a lot normally at least 4 to 5 times a week. so I was looking for something to boost my tan. after reading the reviews I thought I would give this lotion a chance. It did nothing for my tan. After using it a few times I started to look like I hadn&#x27;t been tanning at all I stayed my some color. It does go on your skin nice but I don&#x27;t see what all the talk is about it being such a great lotion. I ended up wasting my money. Since I was not going to use it and it was going to just sit in my cabinet I ended up giving to a friend to get her bass tan started.</li>
    <li> This stuff sells at the salon for about 90 bucks so it was a steal on here.  It takes a lot for me to get tan and I feel like this gets me there faster and I hold on to it longer.  I dont ever burn with it plus it doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes like some do.  It has a great smell.  So impressed with everything that it offers.</li>
    <li> This product is great for those who tan indoors. The price here was more than reasonable. My tanning salon was asking 4 times as much. It arrived within the time frame promised. I recommend the product highly.</li>
    <li> So i was a little nervous buying lotion off line worried that it would be tampered with but my lotion wasnt:) I love, love, love luminary. it is a super rich dark lotion and doesnt turn you orange. it smells super good and would definetely buy it again. they wanted $130 in the salon and i got it for $40 i was so happy.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for the wife after she told me she needed lotion and they charge double the price at the tanning salon. She liked the scent and the color she got at the salon from using the lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of my favorites. I have used it before but never ordered it online. It normally runs for $120 in tanning salons, so this was a total steal. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny... it bronzes without leaving you streaky and it leaves your skin SO soft. It came within a few days, even with the standard free shipping. The only thing is that the cute little attachment on the bottle was broken so it doesn&#x27;t light up... But that is not worth giving it less than 5 stars. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It smells great I LOVE the smell but I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference after using it, even after an extended period of time (a few times a week for a few months) but not terrible and certainly better than using nothing. Won&#x27;t buy it again, I would go with Jwoww (black and gold bottle) or Masquerade.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews on here. I own my own bed and have tried countless lotions (mostly sample packets received free with bulb orders). LOVE this stuff. Very nice smelling and not too powerful. Right after my tanning session my husband said, wow are you brown. Since I tan all the time I had pretty much hit my plateau and really wanted something to push me over the &#x60;tan limit.&#x27; This did the trick. I have been an avid tanner for about 14 years and this lotion exceeded my expectations and is one of the better lotions I have used. I would personally highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty neat too - it has a battery operated light up plaque just for fun and would make a great display in a shop.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion, but its primarily a bronzer cover tanner. it tends to cover you current natural tan. thus is your darker than this lotion, you can take a step back as I did. leaves skin silky smooth with good scent.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have greasy feel, instead it gives your skin a satin feel. I noticed slight color the first time and three days later, had a natural tropic glow. No orange staining on my hands, streaks, and no color transfer on clothing or on towels after showering. I am pleased with this find and am getting ready to order more!</li>
    <li> Be very careful where you get cosmetic products if not directly from a dealer. I have used this lotion for years, and this bottle seemed a bit different than all the others. Maybe a batch issue, maybe not.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t turn my hands orange, even when I don&#x27;t wash them right away.  It feels so smooth and goes on quickly, which is important when you only have four minutes to strip down and lotion up.  However, the bottle is kind of stupid.  First, it is hard to squeeze with the giant light up plaque glued to the front.  Second, I keep wondering how much it cost to put the light up plaque on the front of the bottle.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s cute and the sparkles made me notice it.  Regardless, the practically of a novelty product wore off quickly.  I ripped the light off and tossed it, making it much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how much of an effect the lotion has on my tanning though.  I seem to get darker when I don&#x27;t use any lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is better than most, like perfume.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves skin fresh and dark, I didn&#x27;t feel greasy or stinky after using it at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I defnitately recommend this product! It&#x27;s worth it. I would die before I would pay $120 dollars for a bottle of tanning bed lotion. This lotion is the real deal and for a cheap price. BUY IT NOW!!!!!</li>
    <li> love the lotion, the smell of this product is awesome. would buy this tanning lotion again. will tell my friends to also buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I&#x27;ve used a lot of different tanning lotions and this is, by far, the best lotion I have ever used. It has a wonderful smell (before and after tanning) and leaves skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for approximately 7 years now and I am typically a VERY fast tanner. I&#x27;ve been going to the tanning bed for over a month now using this lotion and I&#x27;m really disappointed. It never takes me this long to tan. Therefore, I&#x27;m moving away from this lotion. I feel like I gave it a fair shot..it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. The only reason I gave it an extra star is because it doesn&#x27;t have a bad ATO and it does feel good/moisturizing on your skin after you get out of the bed.</li>
    <li> First off, I am the ultimate lab rat to be testing skin products on. I have very very sensitive skin, I can only use Clinique super balanced hypo-allergenic foundation when applying makeup because the cheaper department store makeup will make me break out. I have to use salon products, such as Matrix brands for my shampoo and conditioner because brands such as Suave, VO5, herbal essences, and other cheaper brands will make my forehead, scalp and so on break out. With Lotions I have to use a little more pricey stuff, I can use most of bath and body works stuff, because I will break out on my back or get rashes from too much of perfume infused stuff or lower quality lotion.     I started tanning a couple months ago, I am very very light skin, my skin is often classified as Ivory when it comes to foundation. I have tons of freckles on my face and back. I&#x27;m so white you can see my blue veins on my legs, which I&#x27;ve looked at as looking like old granny legs because they are so white and veiny. When I started tanning I was just paying the (...) each time for the packets of lotion at the salon. I had to start for a couple of minutes in the low pressure bed, I went every other day, and now a couple months later I am up to 7  minutes in the medium pressure bed and I&#x27;m gradually getting tanner while avoiding getting burnt, which i easily do get burnt.     One thing I&#x27;ve noticed when going tanning, my legs especially will get really dry after wards, I will get rash looking things on the calf of my legs and other areas where it is in direct contact with the tanning bed, it&#x27;s not actually a rash but more so just uneven tan. I also notice that I smell like burnt skin after wards, I get a little itchy, and with some products if you put alittle on your face your skin will get itchy and sometimes even break out.     I decided to look online for a decent seller of good quality tanning lotions after seeing the prices of my local tanning salon for a bottle. First off, you do have to becareful when shopping online for tanning lotions, they can be old, knock offs, or they can put generic stuff in the bottle and sell it like the real thing. I looked around and found a seller who offered them sealed, offered exchanges/refunds, and had a very good feedback/rating. I was very pleased with them and the lotion arrived wrapped in plastic and was authentic.     When it comes to the lotion itself, I looked around online for a couple days and this was the lotion that had the most pleased customers. There was other cheaper lotions that had decent reviews, but even on those customers would say things as it was their second favorite behind Luminary. So, I figured I&#x27;d try the best and go from there. It goes on smooth and I notice it goes further than the rest. The bottle is cute, lights up and looks very princessy. The smell is decent, I can see why people like it. I prefer the smell of Designer Skin&#x27;s Believe in me, but the smell of luminary seems to last longer after wards. It does leave your skin feeling very soft. I typically go tanning and then shower after wards, but with this I will take a shower and then go tanning because I like how it leaves my skin feeling/smelling. The bronzers also work, not leaving you orange and making you appear tanner faster and gives your skin a more even look.    I would recommend this to anyone and will be sticking to this especially if I can keep getting it half price from my current seller. It took some time debating on spending (...) on a lotion, but when you consider that you get free shipping, a guarantee, the added up costs of buying packets every time, and the fact you get more uses out of this bottle compared to how much you get buying packets each time. Not to mention the quality. Don&#x27;t think about it, just do it.     While I&#x27;m on the subject of products I&#x27;m happy with, when you get done spending money buying this head over to Victoria&#x27;s secret and buy a miraculous push up bra. It makes for the perfect night out, youare tan, smooth, smell good, and you have awesome cleavage/it adds 2 cup sizes, makes any shirt look better. This is coming from someone who just had a baby a year ago and is getting back out there and doing things to feel better, treating herself to some pleasure items, and getting back into shape.     Happy shopping!    Gloria</li>
    <li> I have been using Desgner skin Spellbond. But I have seen so many reviews on this item, so I thought I would try it out. I have been using designer skin lotion for a long time and I have never been dissapointed. I ordered my bottle on Monday and I recieved it today ( Friday ) Well As soon as it got here, I went to the tanning salon, and let me tell you this stuff really lives up to its name. I swear My skin is at least two tones darker. It does not leave streaks, and it has a nice smell. I Havent been tanning a lot lately, and my skin is really fare skined, and I am truly shocked at how well it works. It works for any skin type!!! ( ohh and I love the way it makes your skin feel ) If you are looking into buying this lotion.. DO IT. I promise you will not be disappointed. And as for the seller. ABSOLULTLEY AMAZING. Fast replies to the emails I have sent, and also quick time for me to recieve my lotion. All in all I give this lotion and the seller a 100 %</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion from my best friend who owned her own tanning salon and of course the price I paid was much cheaper than this but however I always try the newest products on the market for the year. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a deep golden tan (depending on skin type). When I first tried this product the first day - I didn&#x27;t see any change @ all. When I woke up the next morning I could see a difference - so don&#x27;t doubt this product until you give it a chance. It seemed to have made me a shade darker in just one use. (Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s skin type is different so you might not see the results I seen in one use - my skin type is olive.) I also tan year round so I always keep a base tan. With this being a silicone based product it goes on smoothly, easily and makes your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> great stuff.. makes your skin feel soft and the smell is a real plus....  plus it really does give a good color! whats not to love!</li>
    <li> besides the stupid light up bottle.. this lotion  is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried many by swedish beauty / australian gold, and cal tan, but this is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and tried many brands as well as other types of lotion including this brand&#x27;s other products. Luminary is far superior than anything I&#x27;ve used. Silky and very yummy smelling with instant results!  Heavenly.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed with the lotion it was not very good and did not help me get a tan. The smell was less then satisfactory as well. The service was otherwise very good got it on time.</li>
    <li> I personally do not like this. I feel it does nothing for me. For myself, I would give it zero stars.... BUT I gave it 3 so my personal experience doesn&#x27;t influence someone else&#x27;s choice to try it. Just because it didn&#x27;t do much for me, doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t be fabulous for other people... I&#x27;m going to order black legacy to replace this bottle I have.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing, is dark, and makes your tan last and your skin soft!! This is a great lotion!</li>
    <li> I was using Black 20X which is great, but I decided to try other Designer Skin product.  So I ordered Luminary. It&#x27;s great too, but...  The Sweet Champagne Fizz Fragrance is so girly, that I had to leave it to my wife : )  I&#x27;m returning to my Black 20X.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s soft and smells so good. I used to feel so dry after tanning but this keeps my skin in perfect condition so I can continue.</li>
    <li> I ordered mine from Tantastic Enterprizes (on August 13, 2013) and at first I was skeptical since it came in an easy to open plastic clam-shell case (the kind that are molded around the item) but it wasn&#x27;t vacuum sealed or shrink wrapped or anything else to ensure it wasn&#x27;t tampered with. I have used The Phoenician (it&#x27;s like Luminary but without the bronzer) it goes on smooth and silky and your skin feels moisturized and nice smelling even after tanning. The bottle I got appeared the same, smelled similar, glitter in it as described, but the texture of the lotion was all wrong. It didn&#x27;t seem to accelerate my tan at all (I tried it 4-5 times). It absorbed fast but felt sticky and that was it, no moisture to it at all. I suspected that it was fake so I took it to the salon and compared it to the salon&#x27;s Luminary. It was fake, you can feel the difference immediately on your hand. Designer Skin makes great stuff (which is why I am rating this a 4 stars) but check first who you are buying from!!</li>
    <li> Same high quality lotion as sold in the tanning salons at a fraction of the cost! Will for sure buy again!</li>
    <li> works jus as it stated it would! silky soft and got tann faster then i ever have before! suggest this product to anyone! only thing is the smell is good jus girly and strong!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Designer Skin products and this one did not let me down. It goes on so smooth and feels like your skin just drinks it up leaving you silky and smelling AMAZING. I like to tan AFTER I shower to get all the dead cells off and achieve a deeper tan and this lotion prevents that nasty burned smell so I can leave the house right after and know I smell good. I&#x27;ve read a few reviews saying that this product smelled bad and left them orange and sticky and I guarantee you they bought from a catty seller and were not sent the actual DS Product (even if it arrived in this very same bottle ) - PLEASE read customer feedback on the seller before you purchase. I am fair skinned and have NEVER been anything short of nice and dark with this brand.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! Can&#x27;t use in tanning beds because its a fake...might damage the acrylic and who knows what it may do to ur skin!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, first of all, which is extremely important to me when purchasing products online. I used a sample of this lotion at the tanning bed, so when I got the lotion in the mail, I could tell that it was legit, the same product. Works fantastic. Makes quite a difference in your tan. Also leaves your skin feeling beyonddd soft! You will not have to put lotion on after the tanning bed anymore. And it doesn&#x27;t leave a \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; smell, so you can use it whenever. (if you don&#x27;t want the smell on you, say, when you go to work, for example.)</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of my all time favorite tanning lotions! I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and not many bronze this well. Gave me a nice brownish glow :) I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I am a guy, I think it&#x27;s kinda weird for guys to tan until my friend got me started. It&#x27;s not so bad and is kinda actually fun! I don&#x27;t tan a lot, just enough to get a little color. This lotion makes me really dark so that I don&#x27;t have to go in for a long time. Since I am getting so dark, I think it is better for me so I don&#x27;t have to be exposed to UV rays as much as I would if I used some other lotion. This is the best lotion that I have tried and I have sampled many. I work at a salon that does tanning and this is hands down the best one that we offer! This place offers a great price as well! This will forever be one of my favorite lotions!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon so I have tried my fair share of tanning lotions, but this is by far the best smelling,most moisturizing, and most effective tanning lotion I have used.  The bronzers are great; very dark and not at all orange.  I agree with many of the other reviews that the lotion has a light, perfumey scent, much like that of a Ralph Lauren perfume.  My favorite part about it though has got to be the moisturizing benefits.  It goes on really smooth and moisturizers for hours, which every avid tanner knows, will not only help you deepen your tan, but also maintain your tan and prevent it from fading.  I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon in North Carolina and this lotion is $110! I bought it for myself after many packets when I got it for 65% off and I love love love love it! I love the smell and I love how velvety and smooth my skin feels after each use. This lotion is just perfect and it gets you SOO tan!</li>
    <li> I have used designer skin products since I started tanning years back. Im not that serious of a tanner but when I do go, I like to do my research on all the new lotions and get one that either has great reviews or is from a somewhat reputable company. Ill have to admit, being a male, the look of this bottle alone scared me. If the sparkles and glowing lights on the bottle arent a enough of a hint that this is (most likely) aimed towards women or the \\&quot;certain\\&quot; type of male, then I must be out of my mind. But, from all the positive reviews, it pushed me into purchasing this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I do not like and can not stand about this lotion is... the smell. Good lord is it strong. It is an over the top perfume smell that I would not recommend anybody buy who is sensitive to these kinds of smells. I for one am not, as long as its in moderation. Luminary defies that \\&quot;in moderation\\&quot; concept and showers you in its fragrance. Have you ever been stuck in an elevator with and \\&quot;old\\&quot; lady who has that over powering musk perfume sprayed all over her? We have all come across these kinds of people from time to time. Well this is pretty close to that strength. I really wish it wasnt as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself, makes my skin feel incredible and does get me dark after a couple visits. But I wont buy this again and would rather recommend a similar lotion  (Black Storm), to all my fellow male tanners or people who dont like over powering perfumed lotions. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I found this lotion at one of the higher end tanning salons near me. For $120.00, i was intrigued but not interested. Anyways i ended up finding it here on Amazon and bought it for about $52.00 bucks shipped. One thing for sure is that it works, pretty well actually. The smell is kinda strong at first but by the time i get out of the salon me or my boyfriend can hardly notice it. It&#x27;s a good bronzer for both in and outdoor&#x27;s, Ive tried it it roughly 6 times now and i am very pleased with my tan, definitely not orange at all...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for my tanning sessions before trips and have had so many great comments on how tan I look!  I&#x27;ve had people asked where I went on a vacation since I have such a great tan already.  Love the scent of this as well as how it is not too greasy after application.  I don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after I&#x27;m done either.  Quick results as well!!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my first year using a tanning bed as well as tanning lotion, so I&#x27;m skeptical about some of the reviews saying they had received \\&quot;fake\\&quot; lotion. I just recieved my bottle of Luminary in the mail, as well as Luminary for the face. Both bottles had no seal on them.    I bought from GlamourTanning. Can anyone verify that the products they sell are authentic?    I have no experience with tanning lotion or Luminary to guarantee my product is the real stuff, &amp; I&#x27;m a little scared to try it out.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It is very moisturizing and feels so smoothe on your skin for hours after application, but unlike other reviewers stated; i found this lotion to leave the same \\&quot;after tanning smell\\&quot; as all other lotions do. Which is the only reason why i didnt give this product 5 stars. It definately did its job in the bronzing category! I noticed myself getting tan after only 2 tanning sessions. Now after about 2 weeks of tanning i am definately a bronzed babe! :)</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is the best lotion i&#x27;ve used since I started tanning, I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and they just couldn&#x27;t get me tan &amp; I stopped tanning and had very many sessions left then my soon to be mother n law told me to try this lotion within days of using this i&#x27;m darker than I get outside. I defiantly recommend this lotion to everyone that wants a fast working bronzer lotion that won&#x27;t streak or make you orange. Also it was cheaper online than in the salons &amp; the shipping was very fast so that was an also plus.</li>
    <li> I like it.BUT everyone said its not the real stuff because it retails for 120 and there is no way I could get the real stuff for that cheap</li>
    <li> This works very good!</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  Used the whole bottle and got a great base tan.  Will for sure be ordering again.  Highly recommend to new tanners!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this lotion for 2 weeks now and I can tell a big difference from it. It works best in higher level beds like a level 2 at least to get the full effect. The smell is ok and it does have a tiny bit of shimmer in it which I don&#x27;t mind. The front emblem on the bottle has lights that sparkle.</li>
    <li> I have found other lotions to bronze a lot longer and darker than this one.</li>
    <li> not at all like when i bought this at the tanning salon. this started to separate and was very runny</li>
    <li> This is 100% Authentic! $120.00 in Tanning Salons, I saved about $80.00 buying it here.  Shipping was very quick.   I saw results instantly. I had been using Obsidian, by Designer Skin. I saw faster results with Luminosity. Designer Skin, in my opinion, has the best Indoor Tanning products.  I will definetly buy from this Seller again.</li>
    <li> This product is great for fair skin, you instantly get some color and have a glow to your skin and the scent is great.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for indoor tanning!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a stain on hands, goes on effortlessly and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I was really amazed at the price of the packaging alone on this lotion; I mean, come on...light up tag on the bottle?!?  Oh well, its the stuff inside that counts, and you can feel while putting it on that this has to be the most moisturizing, silicone-loaded lotion ever (at least that I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.)  Can&#x27;t really tell how much of a difference its made yet because I have one hell of a base tan, and immediately after getting out of the tanning bed I went to the park with my daughter and got even more sun (probably not the best idea; read: \\&quot;Hello, skin cancer!\\&quot;)  I will definitely buy this lotion again just for the condition it leaves your skin in before and after tanning, plus the fact that there is absolutely NO bad fragrance after getting out of the tanning bed like most lotions.  I&#x27;ll probably try the Obsidian next time I get a high quality lotion (I&#x27;m always switching lotions on and off to get the broadest spectrum of UV absorbed possible,) but I would absolutely recommend this to any serious tanning fanatic.  Considering most of your tanning potential comes from the amount of moisture available to your skin, this has to be one of the most potent bronzers out there.  Granted, there isn&#x27;t as much of an immediate effect as a tingle lotion, but even using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell I tend to get blotchy and peel just from having the lotion on me for some reason.  Ever since that incident, I&#x27;ve stuck to bronzers, and I&#x27;ve now found a new favorite.  I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping this in my rotation of pretty much all Designer Skin lotions now (Worship Me, Luminary, Tao, Smile, You&#x27;re Dark, and I also have a bottle of JWOWW by Australian Gold at the moment.)  Also, I use facial lotions; I&#x27;ve been using the Luminary facial lotion for the last couple months, and I&#x27;m waiting on my new bottle of Australian Gold&#x27;s Crystal Faces right now (which I&#x27;ve read is even better than Luminary facial lotion.)  A lot of money to spend for a good tan, but buying through Amazon as opposed to the local salon has probably saved me hundreds of dollars, and I&#x27;m so dark that even my family from Florida was impressed and I live in INDIANA!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I have tried several tanning products and this product is a 5 star.  Smells great, makes your skin feel soft and produces a great bronzing color.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL LIKE SILK. THIS IS MY SECOND SUMMER TO USE IT. GREAT SILKY SMOOTH SKIN &amp; GREAT TAN..</li>
    <li> Just received my Luminary today!! I can 100% attest this is real! The entire bottle was completely sealed, a tab in the battery for the lights and even included a free sample of Black Sensation!! Opened it up and so baby soft! They are not kidding! One day and already in love, will not buy anything but from now on!</li>
    <li> The light up feature was a suprise, a little silly but enjoyable. I Love the SMELL! which face it in a tanning lotion is the 2nd most important thing. Works great too. Leave skin soft and Dark. I use supers and I tan very easily so its hard for me to get past a certain point without going jersey shore look. A+! Also arrived very quick with AmazonPrime.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, husband even complimented me after tanning. The light feature was broken on my bottle, but I received my order very quickly (2days). It has given me a decent bronze color, but not the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and the tan, and really love the smell!! I use this year round, but I don&#x27;t go to tanning beds. Tans wonderfully outside. Leaves skin soft. I do recommend, though try to get it when you get a good deal, price-wise.</li>
    <li> This is a great bronzing lotion! Love the sparkles left on your skin after you use it! Would buy again</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of my favorites; I love the smell and it produces great color with every use. Absorbs into the skin very smoothly and does not leave a sticky residue or bad after smell.</li>
    <li> Smells good but not the same as one you buy in the tanning salon.  The color is much lighter. Stars only lit up a day before they stopped! Did not get me a nice tan....seemed to do the same as if I was not using lotion.</li>
    <li> Not enough moisturizer</li>
    <li> I have only tried this stuff once but it is my new favorite. Nice soft smell and gorgeous color boost. I wanted to try something that would firm my skin but not make me want to cry after a shower. I&#x27;m proud to say no tears were shed after I showered! Plan on trying it again and buying a big bottle!</li>
    <li> i rate this product 1 start due to i received this product on may 9 2015 and  i went tanning in a stand up booth at my gym and all i can say is that i didnt see any results 10 mins i was in the tanning booth for the 1st and i put alot of lotion all over my body and didnt see any color just got red which is im really disappointed cux i have used other bronzers as a 1st time and u can uxsee any minimum results however i will continue to use it to see if is cux im pale that im not seing any results if this lotion proofs me wrong than i&#x27;ll change my review but for now is negative not good at all if somebody experience similar results like me please feel free to comment and if somebody could give me an explanation that will be great and i hooe the seller see this cuz i think athe product could be expired and maybe thats why the product is being sold cheaper online due to that thanks, i  hope be helpful</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this brand. It came in a sealed bottled. Strong perfume smell that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy. The lotion is nice and thick but I wish it had a bit of shimmer to it. I feel like the name of it &amp;#34;luminary&amp;#34; is a bit misleading. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> The product smells good and does what a tanning lotion should, has a good bronzer but doesn&#x27;t make you &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; after using it.  I wasn&#x27;t blown away with it and the plastic light up &amp;#34;tag&amp;#34; on it was very annoying, the light died after one day and when I would try to use the lotion the tag would fall off, I threw it away on my 3rd use of the lotion.  The lotion is also a little hard to get out of the bottle and I&#x27;m sure once it&#x27;s close to empty you won&#x27;t be able to get the &amp;#34;remainder out&amp;#34;. I might buy it again if I didn&#x27;t have any other choices, but I seem to like Australian Golds lotions a bit better, will probably go back to them for my next purchase, I would have been a little salty if I had paid full price for this at the tanning salon though!!!</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and leaves my skin silky smooth but it is also a little greasy. I used this product for a week and barely noticed any color. This product is not for the experienced tanner looking to achieve maximum color. Only use this if you want greasy skin!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I didn&#x27;t have any increase in my tan from the tanning bed as to not using tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Not really sure if it works but it has a great smell. The &amp;#34;Luminary&amp;#34; sign did already fall off though.</li>
    <li> THis is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. To buy it in the salon is WAY too expensive. This is the actual lotion not a knock-off. It smells great and leaves skin super soft while allowing for a great tan.</li>
    <li> It stinks! Leave waxy, peeling substance on skin after tan. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this tanning lotion! It works so well and it&#x27;s perfect for indoor AND outdoor tanning! I was in for a surprise when I found out that the label on the bottle lights up :) Thus bottle will last a long time because you really don&#x27;t need much to cover your body. After tanning your skin feels so soft and smooth, I just love it!</li>
    <li> This was the beat purchase I&#x27;ve made on amazon. The product was shipped quickly and arrived with more than enough time before the scheduled date. The product works great! An is cheaper than the salon bought bottle.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I agree with an earlier reviewer--I will never purchase from a salon again, either.  This product smells great, feels very smooth, absorbs completely (no greasey feeling afterwards!) and is in amazingly cute decorative packaging--I plan to keep the bottle to display!!!</li>
    <li> In LOVE!!  It gives you a deep bronze tan and it smells amazing. I&#x27;ve had my friends try this who are tan-aholics and then have now gone out to buy it</li>
    <li> This lotion smells awesome!! I have used designer skin products for years. They always leave my skin feeling silky. Love the bronzer in this one. It is the best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Smells great makes skin feel almost like silk..still smells good when you get out of tanning bed..I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from the tan man for 2 years now..I&#x27;ve tried other bronzing lotions, some even from State Beauty Supply and no dice, they don&#x27;t even compare. If you want a dark tan quick try Luminary</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s with the negative reviews. I ordered this product on Wednesday. I&#x27;ve used the Designer Skin product Phoenician before and really loved it. I chose Luminary because it had great reviews from people who reported fair skin. I was some what skeptic, being that it&#x27;s a third of the price compared to the salon. I received the product from Amazonin one day (selected 2 day shipping) so that was impressive. Within the box, it was in a plastic packaging then surrounded with plastic again. Very professional. It smells wonderful and feels amazing on your skin. I have very fair skin and after 6 minutes in the tanning booth today with this lotion I can notice a difference. Definitely try it out, especially considering it is this cheap. Never buying tanning lotion at the salon ever again!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin so soft! Smells great too! I use it all over and then apply the Ruby Tingle to my arms and legs only.</li>
    <li> It seems to work okay but I swear I don&#x27;t remember it being as greasy or smelling weird. Maybe mine is expired. Sadly I will not be ordering again. Not a bad smell and no more oily than normal tanning lotions but not as good as I remember it.</li>
    <li> Definitely was not the real thing. Used it for two weeks and saw no results.  Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> I researched a lot of lotions before settling on this one. The reviews were the best and this price was the best for the product!</li>
    <li> I first heard of this lotion when I went to a tanning salon. I ended up paying $150 for it there which I though was ludicrous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ended up finding on here for $30 and I have never been more happy. The smell is a bit too much but it leaves your skin nice and soft and gives it a nice tan when you sum bath.</li>
    <li> has a pretty shimmer to it. works great, smells okay better than most lotions. cost 120 the place that i go to</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Would definitely reorder again!</li>
    <li> like this tanning lotion</li>
    <li> I purchased my first bottle of Luminary at the Tanning Salon for $120 .... it&#x27;s my favorite and I&#x27;m so happy I found on Amazon for so much less!! Has a great scent and does the job!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always LOVED Luminary. It&#x27;s definitely my go-to lotion. It has a good scent to it, and makes your skin super soft! They sell it at my tanning salon for $120. I got two lotions on here for $68 including Luminary! Such a steal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good lotion and smells good too. However I have used other cheaper lotions that work just as well if not better. It&#x27;s aight. I would never pay 120 dollars in a salon for it though!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this bottle last year through my tanning salon and I Loved it. Became so brown so fast. This bottle I purchased through Amazon does not do the same. I don&#x27;t think it is authentic. The color of the lotion is lighter than my other bottle</li>
    <li> Nice tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t stink or feel sticky after. Good results with fast tanning and smooth touch from silicone.</li>
    <li> Kinda sketchy. When I compared this lotion to a bottle at the salon... the lotion in my bottle was much lighter than the other... don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s watered down, mixed with other lotion, or just old... very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> Ok..so I&#x27;ve indoor tanned in my early 20&#x27;s and now, I just want a base color and will be going for just 5 sessions in over 2 yrs.  I don&#x27;t EVer tan my face or decolletage putting a ton of suscreen and covering up my chest and wearing 3 layers of masks and towels on my face..LMAO! (I use self bronzing for those parts to even out)  I Love Designer skin and have tried many different ones including Bombshell, which is Great, but BURNS like hell!! So I always try sample packets first and I LOVED this one!  They always try to upsell or get you to buy products saying they are one sale or a free tan session, but it&#x27;s not worth it. I have bought ALL my products on ebay or amazon and its is 75% cheaper than the salons!! This cost at the cheapest from one salon $55 and being as high s $75!!  WTH!  I guess they are trying to make up for the lack of service for cancer scared people.  I don&#x27;t mind tanning my stomach and legs arms, since I cover the important sensitive areas like face, and chest and cancer doesn&#x27;t run in my family nor am I scared. I figure tanning 6 sessions for only 10 minutes in almost 4 yrs isn&#x27;t that BAD!  But by far this the a VERY GOOD quality tanner and it goes on smoothly and is very good at moisturizing. I do use coconut oil though when I bath rinse and lotion after shows to seal in moisture for my skin. THe more moisturizing your skin is, the better you&#x27;ll tan and won&#x27;t get itchy or dry.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t really tell that this did anything for my tan</li>
    <li> I just love this lotion.... and the best part its about half the price of salons.. will reorder when this is gone.</li>
    <li> I was torn between purchasing this and Obsidian for several days, glossing over every review I could find. As a super-pale person (think &#x27;Casper&#x27;, who mostly burns and tans VERY minimally - 2-3 shades darker after weeks of trial and error), I am overly delighted with Luminary and glad I chose this lotion. The smell is fantastic, I really like it; it&#x27;s not too perfumey, subtle and really a nice fragrance, like very light designer cologne as others have stated. It goes on super smooth and absorbs quickly, but be careful with application, you don&#x27;t need much - too much and you risk streaks or having it rub off on your clothes. Although I still burned a bit in the level-2 stand up machine (mostly my back which has not seen any sun lately), I also developed a really nice, subtle golden glow on my arms and legs. I was expecting it all to wash off in the shower, assuming it was solely the bronzers taking effect, but I&#x27;m happy to report it seems to be doing the job where all other tanning lotions in the past have failed for me. It may not be just me, but the weird part about my skin is that I look much tanner indoors (warm light); outdoors in the sun I still look very pale, but no longer paper white - I do have a nice normal skin tone now lol :) A bit pricey, but well worth it. Plus, I LOOOVE the light-up logo; although it&#x27;s super sensitive and goes off a lot when walking around the room, I find it to be super cute and a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It has noticeable bronzer but doesn&#x27;t leave you orange and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this lotion at the salon and paid like 80 bucks for it .. It is awesome ! And smells good too .. I was so excited to see it here ! Definetely recommend it</li>
    <li> This is so perfect for when I tan and I see and get results!!! For this price I am preety saticfied!!</li>
    <li> Love luminary! Smells so good and works well! Also packaging was done well.</li>
    <li> I received my new lotion yesterday, and tried last night.  I was very happy with this product.  The scent is fresh, but most important is the way it accelerates the tanning process.  I am a light skinned person, who usually doesn&#x27;t tan easily, but after one use I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> not happy with this particular purchase....it&#x27;s on the watery side compared to the actual lotion sold in the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion and can&#x27;t believe I used to pay for the salon version at 3x the price ... Smells delishously fresh. AWESOME !!! Will be ordering again for sure :)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion on the market. I&#x27;ve tried many different bronzers and Luminary is the only tanning lotion that gets me up to 2-3 shades darker after only 2 tanning sessions. If you&#x27;re prepping for vacation or an event, Luminary is the way to go to get tan QUICK! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research online before ordering.  This lotion received more 5 star reviews than other seller&#x27;s.  I am so happy I have this lotion! It smells amazing.  It feels so silky and absorbs quickly.  With good quality lotion like this, I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product when I tan.  Just a quarter size will cover my arms, shoulders, neck and face.  I also use it as a moisturizer/ tan extender/ bronzer.  It has a light, perfume scent that is not altered from the tanning lights.  (Some lotions make you smell burnt after) I have sensitive skin on my face and neck, and I don&#x27;t get a negative reaction after applying.  Thank you and I can&#x27;t wait to get the Adore.  Oh also I received a free packet attached to my bottle- thank you! That is so nice. The light-up label doesn&#x27;t work. But the lotion does, so that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> Great product and a third of the price online versus inside the salon!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she was mad at first for not including her on the purchase.  Then she found it at her tanning salon and they wanted over $100 for it!  Now she is happy and she loves the color its helped her get</li>
    <li> I have used a LOT of tanning products, and this is by far my favorite bronzer. It smells wonderful, there is no terrible after tan smell, you see instant color. It isn&#x27;t just a bronzer that stains your skin, it actually tans you very well. I love it. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real product I have previously purchased at an actual tanning salon. It just doesn&#x27;t make me tan that well.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t know what to think about the smell. Not pleasant at all but leaves skin soft. I&#x27;ll try different product to compare then repost review.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion for indoor tanning. It&#x27;s smells great, I get a much darker tan, and have reordered many times.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well, but I&#x27;m NOT a fan of all the glitter it leaves behind on me.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lotion.  You pay a bit more for it, but it smells good, works well and moisturizes your skin really well.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes a long way and the bottle lights up and tans you good. Smells good and tans good.</li>
    <li> like it but not a big fan of bronzers - im more of a tingle person, but i do like to switch it up. smells nice and goes on smooth. doesnt leave orange tint on palms.</li>
    <li> I like this.  It smells good and a little bit goes a long way.  Spreads evenly and enhances my tan.</li>
    <li> I only tan if I&#x27;m going on vacation somewhere where I know I&#x27;ll be spending most of my time in a swimsuit and may get sunburned.  It seems to help to get a base tan… keeping me from getting a sunburn in the first 15 minutes.  After doing some research, I ended up ordering this.  Since I tan so infrequently, I&#x27;m really not familiar with all of the products.  I was concerned that a product with a bronzer would make me really dark fast in an unnatural way.  It didn&#x27;t happen that way at all.  This worked very well and had a beautiful color to it, and with each use, eased my skin into a nice tan color that complemented the tanning process.  I am very light skinned but tan pretty easy.  Using this product helped me get a nice color, a bit faster and made it all look natural.</li>
    <li> great tanning lotion, smells really good even after tanning keeps your skin moist . You really don&#x27;t burn  you just keep getting darker.  noticed a big change in color after my second tan. Already had two people ask me what I was using. This is a really good product.</li>
    <li> I love leaving the tanning salon not smelling like burnt skin! This lotion gives my skin a subtle shimmer and glow and it works really well! My only complaint is that there is no date on the bottle and most lotions expire after two years so I have no clue how old the bottle is.</li>
    <li> Everything went great with this order. The shipment was on time and the lotion is just what I wanted. My skin is very sensitive to just about everything and this lotion does not cause any problems to my skin. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks on your body(which I am always scared of with bronzer products). The only thing that annoys me is you can&#x27;t read the back of the bottle because of all the sparkles. I mean it doesn&#x27;t bother me to the extent that i won&#x27;t buy it again but I&#x27;m just one of those weirdos that likes to read the label of everything. All in all though great product and definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype over this lotion. I LOVE Designer Skin products, and bought this with good faith that it would be just as amazing as the other lotions I have loved by them... but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. The bronzer sucks, and while it makes my skin feel decent when I put it on and for a little while after tanning, it doesn&#x27;t last. As soon as you shower, your skin is screaming for lotion (which is part of my daily routine anyway, but I mean, I usually have like 10 minutes of other stuff to do right out of the shower before I get to lotioning my body, and after using this lotion I can&#x27;t wait). I used it 7 times, with no change in my color which was disappointing. Plus the smell is decent, but after tanning it wreaks. I gave it to a friend to see if maybe it just didn&#x27;t go well with my skin or something, and she didn&#x27;t like it either... Sad. I&#x27;ll stick to my trusty Spellbound.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used! I would highly recommend it to anyone. It smells great, leaves no after tan odor and has got me darker than any other lotion I have used before. I have tried other Designer Skin lotions and this was the best one yet!</li>
    <li> The first time I went tanning the lady suggested I use the Luminary sampler because it is a lotion considered for all skin types. I used it, liked it and decided to order it. Several weeks later it still hadn&#x27;t arrived at the salon so I had to use different samplers. Some smelled weird and others dried out my skin, but the main thing I noticed was my skin was no longer getting tan, I was actually losing the tan I had and realized how badly I wanted this lotion. Shortly after I found out it was going to cost me $95.50 for this lotion from the salon, that price did not sit well with me, so I shopped online and found this great price. :) I ordered it on a Monday night and arrived Wednesday Mid-afternoon in New condition. Since arrival, I have actually been excited to go tanning. It works well with my skin (I have very fair skin) and feels great as well. The \\&quot;Perfumy\\&quot; smell isn&#x27;t to strong either. After one use I noticed a difference and have noticed a difference since. The only thing about it is although the title says bronzer, everyone at the salon told me there is no bronzer in it. I will definitely buy from this seller again when my bottle gets low.</li>
    <li> Everyone at the tanning salon where I go warned me against ordering online with several different terror stories about lotions bought online. I made sure to only buy from a source with several reviews. I have received my lotion and I am completely satisfied. It works exactly how it should.</li>
    <li> Before using Luminary, I used Designer Skin&#x27;s Sheer Wisdom.  With luminary, I get bronzed, tanned, soft skin AND it smells SO good!  I love this stuff!  Wish I could get it cheaper though...</li>
    <li> This lotion gives a very good color, but it seems to take more than normal lotion to spread it all over the body. It smells great out of the bottle and not too bad after the tan. I don&#x27;t think anything can make you smell GOOD after a tan. I didn&#x27;t care much for the little blinking light thing on the front of the bottle so I pulled it off. I got this lotion for a great price here on Amazon, but would never pay retail for it. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I always hated the way I smelled after tanning no matter what tanning stuff I tried. This smells great and leaves your skin very very soft.  I am able to stand myself after tanning now.</li>
    <li> I find this product no better than the $10 indoor tanning lotion that I have purchased from my local beauty supply store in the past. Not worth the extra $20+.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This bronzer costs $120 at the tanning salon, but it&#x27;s only $39 on Amazon!! It has silicone in it which makes my skin feel silky soft after each tanning use. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin smell bad after either, so far it&#x27;s my favorite bronzer, and I&#x27;ve used many many different kinds, too.</li>
    <li> Luminary is one of the best Designer Skin Tanning Lotions in my opinion. I&#x27;ve bought the same bottle 3 times now and haven&#x27;t had any complaints. It has a great scent that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or smelly. It also gives you GREAT color.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and gives me great color!</li>
    <li> Leaked from bottle when it arrived. I think this is a &amp;#34; flashy &amp;#34; over priced and not as beneficial as advertised. Amazon refunded my money without any problems. That is why Amazon is the number on on line market place.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I would recommend this to all tanners that want to tan fast. Very effective and glides on easily!</li>
    <li> The fact that by ordering online I got this product for 1/3 of the price of my tanning salon is awesome. I tried small sample packages of a variety of lotions and I love this product. I am not orange and love the scent. I also have very sensitive skin and so far it has not caused me any problems.</li>
    <li> By far the best lotion. .feels great tans great..smells amazing. Love love it!&lt;br /&gt;Have tried others..none do a better job than this amazing lotion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay retail, as, it didn&#x27;t provide the moisture I was told it would by the salon owner.&lt;br /&gt;But, overall I liked it.</li>
    <li> My FAV! Has some self tanner in it so my tan lasts longer. Doesnt smell like a self tanner though. This and Bombshell are my favorite lotions.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and I only recommend this lotion for my costumers! Absolutely love it! You get great results fast, it smells great, and is SO good for your skin! It&#x27;s a must have! :)</li>
    <li> This works fine for tanning bed use. The smell is OK when you first out it on, but I don&#x27;t like the smell of it after I tan! Lotion rubs in nice and doesn&#x27;t look streaky. Will I buy this again? probably not, I&#x27;ll try something new.</li>
    <li> This has a bronzer in it which i like. The color of the lotion is a tan color which i like, i feel it helps boost my tan and it its a tinted color to me that means that it has a self tanner in it. It will not streak your skin. When i used this i had a nice glow when i got out of the tanning bed. Not my fav but it works. I would not recommend this for the guys as it has a little bit of a glitter effect. I am am a person that already has natural tan color skin tone. I would recommend this for a person that is fair skinned. If you have fair skin you usually can&#x27;t tan as often and this will help you get a base color faster.</li>
    <li> My salon is selling this lotion for around $85. I really wanted to try it but couldn&#x27;t because there was no way in heck that I would spend that much on a lotion. When I cam across this on Amazon at $38, I was really skeptical. I got this lotion in a day and a half, and was super excited to use it. When I got  to the salon I compared it to theirs, and its the real deal!! It smells amazing, and it goes on so smooth. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. When I was finished tanning, I was a little upset because I was expecting to be really dark. But I gave it a chance, and within an hour I was super dark! I love this lotion and will buy again!</li>
    <li> this lotion is silky and smooth, has a great scent that lingers on your skin, and is a great bronzer. I can notice an immediate difference when using this lotion. One of my top 3 tanning lotions!</li>
    <li> I like this tanning lotion.  I Could see a big difference after using it and I am now tanning fairly quickly.  I am very fair skinned and this has worked great for me.  I have not burned since using this product.  The smell is a little purfume like and I am not to fond of that.  The light on the front of the bottle did not work.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the seller getting my item to me in a timely manner. I got this lotion for my wife who thought it would be a great lotion but she is not impressed with the lotion at all. We both feel we only paid for the fact that the bottle lights up when it&#x27;s opened or banged on. Wish we would have just bought some Back in Blaque or some other lotion, but my regards to the seller.</li>
    <li> Wow! I love this tanning lotion! It smells so great and really truly is a fabulous bronzer! I would really recommend this lotion to anyone!!</li>
    <li> My friend got this and recommended it so i tried it!  I cant say enough how awesome it works!!!  It smells amazing as well!!  Like candy!!  I cant stop smelling it!  After the 2nd day of using this my legs were dark as ever!!  This stuff works wonders!!  Great price! Fast shipping and overall great product!! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves a nice, dark moisturized tan.</li>
    <li> Brings out your tan makes skin moist</li>
    <li> This is my favorite smelling lotion and I get nothing but great results when I use it. Also, it feels very lovely and silky. I still debate the price though.</li>
    <li> This product may have provided me with a slight boost in my tan, however, it ranks among the worst at maintaining your tan. Fades almost instantly.</li>
    <li> Amazing and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> So happy I got this. Everyone tells you not to get tanning lotion online, but you just have to search and make sure that its completely sealed when you get it. This works great and helps get me tan and its also smells nice!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion. Smells great, lasts, and does a good job for an even all over tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little reluctant to buy lotions on amazon . The tanning salon will tell me that you will get fake watered down products and others say the salon just says that so they can&#x27;t sell lotions for 3X the amont I just bought lumanray for $41 at the salon they are selling it for 120!! When I received my lotion it was completely sealed I bought from&lt;br /&gt;ALL AMERICAN TAN . I compared my bottle to a package in the salon the color , texture .&lt;br /&gt;And smell is exact.  I used the packets at the salon before deciding what lotion to buy and luminary got me super dark my legs don&#x27;t tan as fast as my upper body and this lotion gives me a even tan which I love . Luminary is a good but.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells amazing, leaves a beautiful glow/hint of sparkle too, and doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. I&#x27;ve used it twice and have been really impressed with the quality of my tan. I don&#x27;t get incredibly dark which is perfect for me because I prefer to look naturally tan versus bright bronze. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or burnt skin smell. I am very fair skinned and tan on stand up Sunscape (Super) and I&#x27;ve been so impressed! I plan on trying it on the Velocity bed eventually. :) I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion works great!! Much cheaper than it would be if you bought it at a tanning salon and it leaves sparkles on your skin after tanning:)</li>
    <li> I just recently switched tanning salons and was asking the girl about lotions. She suggested the luminary and said all great things about it so i was like &amp;#34;cool! How much?&amp;#34; She tells me its 120$. Umm.... Yeah right crazy lady. I&#x27;ll just stick to my 40$ bottle of lotion. So I looked through amazon and found this bottle for a fraction of the price so I just went for it not knowing what to expect. There were so many great reviews but there&#x27;s also the handful of unsatisfied customers whose reviews really get in your head. But I bought it anyway and I&#x27;m so very pleased especially since the girl at the tanning place was knocking my cheap bottle. I asked her to let me see the luminary they had on the shelf and my lotion is the same color, consistency, has the same great fragrance, and the exact same shimmer. And it works! I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now and though I don&#x27;t tan but 3 times a week, I haven&#x27;t lost my nice summer tan. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is fake... it smells good but sheds! after it dries it flakes off ! I&#x27;ve tried everything to try to get this to work out its just either fake or so expired.... :( do not buy</li>
    <li> I love Designer Skin Luminary Bronzer! It smells great in and out of the tanning booth. The blue sparkly bottle with lighted \\&quot;Luminary\\&quot; sign is too cute!</li>
    <li> Luminary is a great lotion if you like the greasy feeling of the silicone. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell and I didn&#x27;t get that much color from the bronzers. I feel like the best color always come from a tingle lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven and always works well for me. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I saw this product in the tanning salon I use.  They were asking over 100.00 for this.  I looked online and found it a lot cheaper!!!  I love it!!  It only takes a couple of times tanning with it and your dark.  The smell is great! Your skin feels great too!</li>
    <li> This lotion was a great purchase for those being a little friendly to their wallet. The tanning salons will ask over 100$ for the product that Amazon sells here. I purchases somewhat worried that I might receive a different kind than the store sold, or a rip off version, but this was the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a great fragrance, something a little fruiter but not coconut on the beach fruity, but it also is amazingly silky and has a great darkening affect. If you are looking for a good bronzer that smells good, does a good job and even leaves you feeling smooth, this is a great product to help your tan stay darker longer.</li>
    <li> I use to use luminary all the time but it doesnt get you that dark at all!! If you want a designer skin product that gets you DARK try obsidian...in one tan I was super dark.  Obsidian is not a tingler...it is slightly warm when you are tanning but does not make your skin red.  Obsidian smells great before and after tan.  Luminary smells great going on but has an after tan smell.  Luminary will make you look bronze; however, it doesnt get you VERY DARK!!</li>
    <li> So i ordered this online and it came in the mail a day late, not to thrilled. The box was a little damaged but the product itself was wrapped and totally unused. I used it for the first time today, it smelt good when i put it on but i shortly noticed that it left a burnt scent on my hands, highly un happy. However, i do see a slight difference in skin color. If i would have bought this at the retail price i probably would have been upset because even tho yes the product did produce some results i would not pay the retail 130.00$ price for it. seeing as tho i got it for 40 bucks, yes this product is eh whatever ... ill give it sometime.</li>
    <li> the lotion smells okay but i feel like its not helping me tan.. on the back of the bottle it has a 18 month expiration so i&#x27;m wondering if it was sold to me expired. there&#x27;s no way to really tell but i know with other lotions i can feel and even see results with good lotions and this one just isn&#x27;t doing it for me. also the same result from the lotion my boyfriend is using that i bought the same day (black) and i have used the black before and i just feel as if they are not working.</li>
    <li> i got this for my sister in law for her bday, its her favorite one, she loves the smell of it. i ordered through a-z had standard free delivery and it got to her house in 3 days. it was supposed to take like 8 so that made me happy....</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product yet.  It looks very authentic with the blinking light on the front of the bottle but that only lasted maybe 3 days.  The smell and feel of it was identical to the samples that I have purchased in the past but the smell didn&#x27;t last as long as I experienced with the samples.  I do love how soft my skin feels after use and it seems to tan evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that there are forgeries of the original formula because it is so expensive but for the most part I think this was legitimate.  For those commenting that the sparkles on the bottle come off and they end up all over your hands and skin....I have not experienced that at all.  I have had mine for about 4 months now and none of the glitter has come off.  Love the price compared to the spa&#x27;s which are about $120.</li>
    <li> This does not smell the greatest and then after applying it and tanning I smelled like I had old lady perfume on.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! The smell is great and so are the results. I prefer tingles but this is a nice one that I put in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Do not buy compared it to salon and it did smell the same but was a completely different color not sure if it was fake or expired.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for it.  Thought since it had a bronzer and it it would give me more color. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Luminary isn&#x27;t a bad tanning lotion by any means. I just have a different preference for my lotion.  I really like the Designer Skin Adore</li>
    <li> love love this bronzor</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do for me what all the other reviews stated or even what the product description indicated.  For that I am disappointed.  The smell and moisturization wasn&#x27;t bad but it just didn&#x27;t give me good results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed I didn&#x27;t think it smelled great like everyone else said, I thought I smelled like a hippie. Only used it once but have seen no bronzing or tanning enhancements, I have used other Designer Skin lotions that were much better.</li>
    <li> Not a legitimate designer skin product. Took it to my local tanning place cause I was running out and when I took out the bottle they noticed that the look was off of the product and opened a brand new bottle to show me what it was supposed to really look like. I am really upset that I got scammed. I should have known. Try to save a buck and you will pay for it in the long run. They said that what actually occurs is that people like this buy the product and dilute the product with lotion or cheap tanning products. They asked me if it arrived wrapped up in the plastic and I said no and that is a dead give away. Don&#x27;t throw your money away.</li>
    <li> The place where I tan suggested this lotion, at 3 times the price. It didn&#x27;t work that great for me. Great smell though.</li>
    <li> Good starter bronzer. Does not leave your hands stained, but it doesn&#x27;t give a deep, dark bronze!  Bought 2 bottles before moving onto something darker!</li>
    <li> Fun bottle and very nice smell. Can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I really liked luminary when it came out. The silicon base made your skin feel super silky.  Also really effective at getting you tan, fast.  Only thing I dont like is the price!</li>
    <li> Lotion is great for the tanning bed. I love the smell and the shimmer. It was a little pricy though. I found it cheaper somewhere else</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic. I usually have a hard time tanning my legs but ever since I started using this everything on me finally tans! Great product and price. I&#x27;ve used many products in the past and this is now one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. For a tanning lotion it&#x27;s smells pretty good. Leaves just a slight sparkle to your skin. The added bronzer is great! By far... The best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> after i came back from the tan, i went to put foundation on my face, and it was all rolling off so nasty i don&#x27;t know how to explain it.. no other tanning lotion has been like that for me and i have been a frequent tanner for 8 years..&lt;br /&gt;the light up front and everything works… but I&#x27;m not sure if what i got was the real thing because that was a very bizarre reaction</li>
    <li> This was my first time tanning. I bought this item and fell in love with it. It smells good. I lot of bronzer in the item. I suggest this item to anybody.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome lotion that doesnt make your fingers orange even when you forget to wash your hands, awesome</li>
    <li> I chose this perfect rating because after using so many tanning products, this one is the best!  It does not leave any tacky feeling after putting it on.  Also, the scent is pleasant and extremely light.  The scent does not transfer onto your clothing.  I use this product along with the matrix, and I see results after the first time using it, maybe not much on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute FYI- the name portion of the bottle lights up whenever you touch it, until the battery dies, which is within a few weeks.  Too cute!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Works extremely well. Dark as wanted after one week in tanning bed. Extremely great price!</li>
    <li> I love my new Lotion it got to my house quick and sealed completely! Glad I ordered from you and thanks for the quick service I will DEFF. Be ordering from you again.</li>
    <li> THIS THE REAL STUFF GUYS!!!! im just sooooooo excited it came in such a timely manner! i got free express shipping from amazon as well, (yall amazing!!) i&#x27;m not gonna lie, i was a little skeptical but this is the real stuff! I&#x27;m super super tan thanks to this sparkly beautiful bottle! xoxo so so happy with my buy, will be ordering more luminarys! never paying $150+ at the tanning salon ever again!!!! great great buy</li>
    <li> It smells great before and after tanning, no burnt smell at all. I usually cant stand the smell so i must shower an hour later after tanning but this lotion smells great after that i can wait several hours after i tan. and I get such an awesome color after just one tan using it. Definitely would recommend!!</li>
    <li> I orderd this product because I have used black before and I loved it. I actually received the package a day early and when I received it I was a little disappointed to find that all though the bottle itself was packaged the lid itself was not sealed....kinda worries me a little is that normal? As for the product itself I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I rubbed alittle on my arm and it smells soo good not a fruity smell but more like Brittany spears curiosity perfume. And its a little shimmery. Not hooker shimmery though :) over all I am pleased with my experience with this seller I just wish my lid was sealed since I bought from \\&quot;sealed tanning lotions\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and is super silky on the skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was the first tanning lotion I have ever used - so I honestly have nothing to compare it to.  But, this lotion was great. I loved it since the first time I used it. The lotion smells great and goes on very smooth. When you put it on, you really don&#x27;t need to a lot to do the trick. I have tanned over 20 times and still have a good portion left in the bottle.  Some people complained about the lotion not working immediately but it does! In general - the higher the level the bed, the better off a tan it will give you. I get a great tan in a level one bed and an instant AMAZING tan in the level 4 beds. The tan holds for a long time, but I tan about twice a week if I go in a lower level bed, and once a week in a higher level bed to keep the tan up. I never completely loose the tan though even after I didn&#x27;t go for a little over a week. I hopped back in a level four bed and got it back instantly.  People can tell I went tanning because I come out nice and dark. Anyone who didn&#x27;t know that I went tanning has complemented me on my tan, thinking I went to Mexico for a week.  It&#x27;s deff worth spending the $40 on this tanning lotion instead of the cheap stuff because I have never had streaks, orange color, or dry skin from it. After you pay $30+ a month on tanning, spending $40 every 2-3 months on lotion isn&#x27;t a big deal at all, especially for the results you get.  It was deff. work the $40 that I spent on the tanning lotion, so I have no intentions of buying any other. Unless a friend wants to loan me some - it&#x27;s not happening.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this product! Best by far, I have tried several tanning products and none compare to the appearance this one provides. This one is so light, that your skin is left feeling refreshed, not oily like other products. I Highly reccomend you try this product if you are looking to get fast results, from the first use I noticed an extreme difference from before and after tanning. Make note, I leave this on my skin all night, so the bronzer sets in. If you shower afterwards you will wash it off. I love the glitter that is in this product, men might frown upon using due to the glitter. But its my number one choice, if you want the best product around Designer skin is it...I hope you try and enjoy this amazing product...Thank you Keely Jo</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t make me look like an oompa loompa, nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I usually use 24 karat Gold by Designer Skin, and while I love the results the smell is a little over powering. Luminary gives that same silky smooth feel, beautiful golden tan (tanning booth or natural sun) without the heavy smell. Pricey but worth every penny</li>
    <li> It may or may not be real, but it works and smells amazing. I&#x27;ve purchased the accelerator before at the full price and it works just that same (minus the bronzer) I&#x27;ve been hearing from everyone how tan I am so if it is real yay! and if it isn&#x27;t it smells fantastic and is still a dam good bronzing lotion for the price. I would definitely recommend to buy this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for sizzle lotion so this lotion was perfect for me. Smells great and helps you get tan quicker!</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it sells for much more at the salon im so happy i looked it up this lotion gives me great color</li>
    <li> Nice light fragrance,but absolutely&lt;br /&gt;useless, it is more of a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;then bronzer.and at this price you&lt;br /&gt;would expect good results</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal, no fake lotion put in a real bottle like some other sellers. This is a quality lotion with subtle bronzers and a great scent.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I got the lotion. But when I used it, it was runny and the name tag fell off. That is cheap.</li>
    <li> Gives you good color and keeps your tan Last longer.</li>
    <li> This product worked okay for me.. I have used better, and I have certainly used worse. It didn&#x27;t streak or dye my hands, which was nice. My husband tells me I smell good after tanning, which I like since I am always paranoid I smell burnt afterwards. No huge complaints, but I just didn&#x27;t feel like this lotion did much for my tan. I would go for Conceited or Black 20x if you want a big color change.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with the product---The Real Deal</li>
    <li> I bought this at my salon since I have received fake lotions buying online before. First off, yes it&#x27;s expensive and if you are lucky enough to get the real thing on line then great. But I don&#x27;t want to take the chance anymore. I used this twice so far and already am a few shades darker. It is a darker lotion but not too dark. Some others on here say that it is a light tan, that would be incorrect. It does have more of a perfume scent which many like, I&#x27;m not crazy about it but hey that&#x27;s what body spray is for! Goes on silky smooth and after tanning is still smooth. This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used thus far but I&#x27;m always trying new things. Oh it does leave your skin sparkly I for one am not crazy for the stripper look but the sparkles are okay</li>
    <li> This lotions smells great, works well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  I&#x27;m loving the results from using this along with the face lotion.</li>
    <li> Identical to the lotion my salon sells, no flaking, weird smell, or problems with the lotion itself. The medallion worked once (when my husband unwrapped it while I was at work) and hasn&#x27;t lit up since. Not a big deal, just sad that I didn&#x27;t get to witness it.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...I only see the results I want when using a bed called the Matrix (it&#x27;s one of those non-burn beds). I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week and I have a VERY pale complexion.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product from the tanning salon where I was going. I looked at alot of products before choosing this one. The salon price was very expensive, but the Designer Skin Luminary Bronzer was so worth it. Then I found the Amazon website; and was so delighted to find that I could purchase the same product for half of what I had paid. I have now found my new favorite shopping place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark complected Italian,and I can soak up a tan EXTREMELY quickly! Which is a great thing but also a bummer when you jog in the summer;massive tan lines. I had one of the employees at my tanning salon recommend this product and she was correct. Hands down,this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. No overwhelming oder and no tingle,but phenomonal results! One visit with this product is,in my opinion equivilent to 4 strait tanning visits. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried. I tan once a week, that&#x27;s it, and this makes me look slightly tan all week. It doesn&#x27;t give off a super feminine smell, and really doesn&#x27;t smell as much after tanning like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  So even if I hit the gym after and sweat, i don&#x27;t start giving off a crazy strong smell.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would nourish my skin and achieve the tan I wanted. Boom! Here it was. Great smell without &#x27;tan&#x27; smell or &#x27;bubble gum&#x27; smell. Wonderful finished feel with a silky touch and a hint of sparkle. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product left my skin feeling silky smooth.  It does not leave any oily residue behind which is really nice.  It creates a shimmery bronze color that actually glistens!!!  It smells wonderful and made me at least 2-3 shades darker! I recommend this product and I plan to buy it in again the future!</li>
    <li> This retails at my tanning salon for $120.  I purchased a sample ($22!) and liked the smell as well as the silky smmoth, non-greasy feel of my skin. I have worked at a salon before and know their mark up on retail is always 100% or more.  Of course the girl at the tanner warned against purchasing on the internet, but she just wanted her comission on the sale.  The bottle arrived within a few days. Another great purchase via Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. it also keeps me feeling cool in the bed. I forgot it the other night and went in the bed with no lotion or bronzer and it was really hot in there! The Luminary keeps my skin cool while I&#x27;m in the bed. The bronzer doesn&#x27;t impress me though. It only seems to have a slight tint that only last until my next shower unlike self tanners.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and goes on smooth. I definitely felt like it made me get darker quickly. I do have fair skin but when I tan I can get pretty dark and this definitely sped up the process a little bit. I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I love designer skin and I love this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites! It gives you great color and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> My 2nd time buying Luminary. I really love this stuff. It smells great, the shade of bronzer is beautiful...can&#x27;t go wrong buying this stuff.</li>
    <li> Felt like it took forever to get....the light up label was damaged &amp; broken off when I opened the box &amp; the bottle was NOT sealed in any way. It smells like someone literally dumped a bottle of Clinique Happy into it. I had a headache from the smell before I was done tanning! And my skin was really red &amp; itchy after getting out of the tanning bed (I never have issues with burning). The redness &amp; itch disappeared once I got home &amp; took a shower. I&#x27;m highly skeptical that this is the real deal. I&#x27;ve used designer skin lotions for years &amp; have never had an experience like this before.</li>
    <li> The product works great. I noticed a deeper tan right after one use. But I am not a huge fan of the smell. Very perfumey. I prefer the lighter scents. But because it works so great, the smell isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
    <li> Absolute love. Can not say enough good things about product and shipping was fast.  After tanning your skin stil smells great. Does not leave a burnt skin smell</li>
    <li> Title says it all - the product worked great. I don&#x27;t tan easily, but I saw colour quite quickly. I always smelt amazing after as well.</li>
    <li> This lotion really does make you turn a beautiful brown. Love it!!! I use it indoors and outdoors. I have never had so many compliments on my tan before.</li>
    <li> designer skin luminary?

Never luminary it also smells like selftanner q t from the 80s grose! Pammy D</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was not sealed. I didnt think anything of it until I started using it and found no results from this bottle. I have used this tanning lotion before when I paid full price and it worked than, I always seen results instantly. Well after seeing no results from this bottle I have come to the conclusion it is a fake! I am very upset that I spent $40 on a bottle of lotion that will just get tossed away. What a joke! If it would have been a real bottle of tanning lotion I would have seen tanning results.</li>
    <li> Smells great, does great, beautiful bottle, great price!! I have used for 3 yrs now, and i will not change for anything!!! I have compliments on the smell and the color it gives you all the time!! Happy Tanned smelling good mama haha</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I will order it again .... helps my skin through the cabin sun&lt;br /&gt;my skin feels soft and moisturized before and after  it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> Sooo I was very worried I was going to get a fake like some of you others I used to work at a tanning salon and loved luminary with it being so expensive I decided to look on Amazon got the lotion last night two days early :) and its definitely the real deal!!! Satisfied customer :)</li>
    <li> Love this the black label always gives me the tan i want and no streaks. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> i tan pretty easy. I figured with all the rave this bronzer would give me a good boost but boy was i wrong. Only good for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like luminary but this batch seems like it was mixed with something else. I didnt get a rash or enything but it didnt seem to give me as good tanning results as it has in the past. But it does still work well.</li>
    <li> True to the quality of designer skin products, this one delivers.  Fast results, nice scent, and left my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this bronzer. It doesn&#x27;t orange you and it goes on like cashmere. I don&#x27;t feel sticky or have the \\&quot;just roasted\\&quot; smell that I&#x27;ve had with products in the past. The effect is very natural and the smell is better than average. This price is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I just received this lotion and after reading the reviews I expected a magic potion. I used it for the first time and my entire back from shoulder to legs was burned horribly! The staff at the tanning salon thought I might have been given a fake... I&#x27;m in so much pain! I&#x27;m going to let my skin heal and give this lotion one more time, because it&#x27;s hard to believe it&#x27;s a bad lotion with such amazing reviews. If this happens again I&#x27;m trashing it, regardless how cute the light up bottle might be.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion.  I love the smell and how silky it feels.  It gets me dark quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me orange. So its a winner for me!!! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this lotion! I am kind of fair-skinned and I was tired of my previous lotion turning me a weird, fake orange color, so I bought this one hoping it would look more dark and natural. The first time I used it, I noticed a deeper, darker tan almost immediately and it also smells really nice (sort of perfumey rather than beachy). My skin still feels moisturized even 2 days later and I&#x27;m so happy with the results of my tan- I&#x27;ve finally achieved a nice dark, even and natural looking tan that doesn&#x27;t seem to fade. This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used so far and I feel it&#x27;s totally worth the price! Highly recommended for everyone!</li>
    <li> Looooove this lotion! Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Gives a great color and doesn&#x27;t smell funny like a lot of tanning lotions out there!</li>
    <li> It has a really nice scent, which I have personally found to be hard to find with tanning lotions. It works well and leaves skin feeling smooth. I will absolutely buy this again once my current bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> The product is a good product. Not so sure about the company that I bought it from. The seal had been broken and the top had been taken off. It made me think the company had made the ol&#x27; switcheroo and a different product in the Luminary bottle. Tread lightly.</li>
    <li> This Designer Skin product is average. The light on the bottle stopped working after the third use of the bottle. Smells good but not work the extra money. I would recommend Black 20X or Black Noir over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review was helpful please let me know by clicking &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; below. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have. Thank You</li>
    <li> I had never used this lotion before and I was a bit skeptical to buy it from here. But after reading the reviews, so many great things were said, I figured I would give it a try. I&#x27;ve only used it once and can already tell the difference in my tan. It left my skin so soft and not sticky after the tanning bed and it smells great! Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely lotion! I get a great bronze color when I use this! It has a nice fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or oily after I get out of a tanning bed. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and will use it again.  Works well and a good amount for the price.  Only downfall, make sure you shake the bottle relly well before squeezing lotion out ... otherwise, it gets a little clumpy.</li>
    <li> If I could give this lotion 10 stars I would. It smells awesome, goes on smooth and wow...the bronze I got from this lotion is so so bronze. I can tell just by my tan after one use that the product is real.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my bottle from theetanman, I have heard a lot about buying fake lotions online and I really wanted this one so I ordered a different lotion a few weeks ago (from snooki&#x27;s line) cuz they&#x27;re cheaper and I&#x27;ve used before so i&#x27;de know if it was a fake or not.  It was not fake when it arrived so that was my ok on ordering my bottle of luminary from this seller, I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive, and when it did I showered and went to the salon. This lotion has no after tan stink, and I&#x27;ve already gotten so many compliments on how good it does smell. My hunt for good lotion has come to an end. Not to mention the silicone is so smooth on your skin. I&#x27;ve done my research, this is THE BEST lotion!</li>
    <li> Wish I would have bought more</li>
    <li> Great price and a quality product!</li>
    <li> Best bronzer and everyday lotion</li>
    <li> I have a real problem with the smell of tanning lotions. This lotion smells realy great not like tanning lotions at all. Cant say nothing negative about it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new Luminary tanning lotion! It is such a great purchase, a very reasonable price for such an effective product! The fragrance is very mature, not like the cheaper lotions, almost a perfume smell! I love it sooo much, I have always bought my lotions at the tanning salons where they can charge you 150% or more than the lotion is actually worth, i reccomend ordering from amazon!:)  Genuinly a very good purchase!</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin feel great,But I didn&#x27;t c any difference in the color,It does seem to be a better lotion and I have used a lot of lotions</li>
    <li> Same product is sold at the tanning salon.  I love this stuff and appreciate the lower price. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I had bought this due to the great reviews! Well, they were right! Awsome product and hope to buy again!</li>
    <li> if you want a quick dark tan this is the product for you.  I keeps my skin moisturized and has a great smell also.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite tanning bed lotion.  It smells fantastic and has a bronzer in the lotion which really enhances my tan.</li>
    <li> My legs are super pale white and very difficult to tan. I noticed a difference after the first use and my legs continue to tan better. I also love how the lotion feels silky, not greasy. I highly recommend this product. I gave 4 stars only due to the price. It&#x27;s a bit expensive compared to other products.</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion I have ever used. Smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on Feb 18th received on Feb 20th wasn&#x27;t suppose to be delivered until Feb 26th. I used it once and it turned me a horrible brown color. I have used other bronzers and they have never done this. My hands are still stained from the lotion. I had looked and looked at lotion and went back a forth about which one to order and finally went with this one and I&#x27;m very disapointed. I just knew it was going to be a great lotion like everyone had said and it&#x27;s not worth the money.. I am in the process of returning it. Going to the post office in the am.</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning lotion. Love the smell! Decided to try this after I read some reviews on here and am so glad that I did. It&#x27;s perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well!! It got me and my daughter much darker after we switched from the other lotion we used.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells really good. Does not stain hands</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a few months and got a great base tan using Millenium Tanning&#x27;s &#x27;Solid Black&#x27;, which is around $17.00 on Amazon.  I was VERY white, and started tanning at 4 min!  And moved up to 25 minutes.  I quit tanning for about a month and tried this product and I&#x27;m not impressed.  It&#x27;s very expensive, even at Amazon&#x27;s amazing discount and I turned more orange than tan, and it really didn&#x27;t help accelerate my tan.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t been tanning for a while, but I got better results from a cheaper product.  Save your money.  I did like the smell and I got the product in record time!</li>
    <li> This is a great sun tan lotion and the price is better then you will find in tanning salons or stores.  It does not contain any sunscreen so if you are looking for protection this is not for you.  If you are looking for a georgeous bronze color this is the right lotion for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it indoor tanning and outdoor tanning and was happy using it either way.</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion would have made me tan to another level especially considering how expensive it was. I am not a fan of this lotion and will not be purchasing it again. I don&#x27;t need my lotion to twinkle on the outside but I would like it to make me tan better. Save your money!</li>
    <li> This bronzing lotion is absolutely awesome! It is light, moisturizing and has a pleasant scent. It doesn&#x27;t leave you with that funny after tanning smell. You can go about your business all day and not worry about the smell. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion because you dont have to use a lot an a little rubs a lot of skin ! I was 120.00 at my local tanning salon an amazon had it for under 40.00 ? why would you pay almost 3 times as much. it smells good doesnt leave sticky residue Its a great over all tanning lotion. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  The smell is nice and light.  I have already noticed a change in color after only one use.  It leaves your skin nice and smooth and doesnt have a funny ATO.  Love it and will continue to purchase this off amazon.  The bottle is super cute.  some people complain about the little light up plastic but I think its cute and if you dont like it, its really easy to just pop off the bottle.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Pair it with Juicy tan extender for SUPER SOFT SMOOTH skin after tanning.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Designer Skin Luminary tanning lotion and am very impressed with this lotion.  Results were instant and had a pleasant scent.  I recommend this lotion.  It was one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve been tanning for YEARS and have purchased many tanning lotions.  Definitely money well spent, compared to salon prices.  Product was definitely not a fake, my suspicion that was salon owners that wrote them reviews;-)))</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the product, the sparkles , and color product gives you . I LOVE  this product</li>
    <li> I had never used this lotion before and was looking for something new to try. I looked on lots of websites for reviews and this one seems to get some of the highest. So I bought it and have been so glad I did. It&#x27;s everything the reviews said and more! The smell is a kind of perfumey smell but not overpowering. I don&#x27;t end up smelling like a burnt baked potato when I get out of the bed. I just have a hint of that perfume type smell which is not bad. I have gotten so dark so quickly using this lotion that after about 4 times tanning I had to start using bronzer on my face so it would match! (My face doesn&#x27;t tan very well no matter what I do). I love everything about this lotion. The ONLY thing that I would change if I could would be the bottle shape. It is kind of wide and doesn&#x27;t fit in my purse too well. Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect. I am about to order my 2nd bottle because I don&#x27;t want to run out! If you want to get darker faster and want a better smelling lotion then this is worth the try. I think the price is right and I will gladly pay it for the results. (I got this for about 42.00 and heard it retails for 120). Please give this lotion a try and you will not be sorry. I have tanned for nearly 26 years and this is the best lotion that I have bought.</li>
    <li> gets 4 stars because bottle is hard to squeeze, other than that, works well, smells good. would buy this again</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned, alternate between level 1-level 3 beds. This lotion works but it is not the most effective lotion I have used and also seems to dry out my skin more than others. I read the reviews before buying so maybe I just got a bad batch? I bought this because a coworker said it was the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m much darker after only 5 minutes of first use, it doesn&#x27;t have a great smell but rather doesn&#x27;t smell at all so no after tan smell, yay!! Plus the label/necklace thingie on the front lights up, sooooo cool.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The scent and skin conditioning means I get more that just a tan. I get a spa treatment.  I have very fair and senistive skin and this product works for me. No orange coloring from the bronzers. Great Real color for fair skin. Wont tan without it,</li>
    <li> Im a frequent tanner and pretty picky about my lotion. Smells great, gets me very dark, zero streaking, and doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky after getting out of the bed. Will absolutely purchase again</li>
    <li> I have loved many different tanning lotions that Designer Skin makes, so thought I would try this one. This was the first time I have not liked a Designer Skin product. I feel like it was a waste of my money. This was my first time trying Luminary, and in my opinion it&#x27;s the same as putting on a scented lotion from Bath and Body works. It does absolutely nothing when I tan. I am so disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad though, so maybe I will just end up using it in place of lotion! I do not recommend this product and would never spend money on it again.</li>
    <li> This product was $125 at my local salon! such a good price for a good product. I love the smell, and the quality. Definitely will recommend!</li>
    <li> I got tanner using NO LOTION. I bought some Walmart tanning bed lotion for the time being, and it has already made me darker in 2 tans than the Luminary in 4 months. Frustrated and will never buy tanning bed lotion off Amazon again, I will buy directly from the manufacturer next time.</li>
    <li> I love Luminary Bronzer..It feels great and smells wonderful.  It definitely delivers for me.  I leaves my skin feeling great after tanning.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I have EVER USED! It smells soooooo good and after using it once and using a good bed, I was so dark!  People thought I had been tanning for weeks!  No exaggeration the best tanning lotion on the market!</li>
    <li> I love designer skin products I have purchased many of them to use in my tanning bed and have yet to find one I dont love.</li>
    <li> I would never spend $120 on lotion so for me this was a great buy. I was concerned initially as to whether or not the lotion would be legit, and I can&#x27;t say with much confidence either way BUT I can say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results and it does work better than my Conceited designer skin lotion that I purchased from my tanning salon for $80.</li>
    <li> great lotion! and more affordable than buying at the tanning salon.!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in the tanning salon and the product is awesome I love it. But, one thing I will never buy any tanning products from the tanning salon, they are over priced.  This price was unbelievable. I got three products for an awesome price.  It was very well packaged. No damage what so ever.  Very satisfied!  This lotion smells so good before and after you tan.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning seasonally for 6 years. I&#x27;m fair skinned, with red hair and freckles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always bought Designer Skin lotions. I&#x27;ve tried 14 Karat Gold, Belleza, and Queen. I&#x27;m huge on smell, so I&#x27;ve bought 14 Karat Gold many times - the fruity/tropical smell is my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;I researched Luminary online as I have heard good things about it. I&#x27;m certain I received the real product. I tried it and asked to smell the lotion at a salon to confirm my version is real. It was.&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of trying it was nothing amazing. The smell is very perfume-like, which I&#x27;m not crazy about but I don&#x27;t mind dealing with. It feels very silky on your skin and has a brown tinge as you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I asked the salon owner what he thought about Luminary and he said he wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. He said the silicone feels nice on your skin, but it only sits on your skin as the silicone does not penetrate through, therefore not very moisturizing. He also mentioned the bronzers in the lotion. He said it&#x27;s a waste to build in a tan in a bed when the bronzers are fooling you into thinking you have a deep tan. He said I may as well get a spray tan instead. He recommended lower cost DS lotions, so I genuinely think he was being honest. Not to mention, the ATO is much more terrible in comparison to my previous lotions. I feel embarrassed going back to work after my session. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and I can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s a huge change in colour yet. May take a few more sessions for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy Luminary again because of the terrible after smell and the higher bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably a good idea to smell and sample a lotion before purchasing. I&#x27;m glad I paid much less online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the bottle lights up - that&#x27;s not exactly what I was hoping to put my dollars into, haha.</li>
    <li> As with all designer skin products this was a win!  Leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth.  Fresh scent that is not overpowering.  My only complain is the shimmer...should have read the product description better.  Really don&#x27;t like the glitter effect.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my skin feel so soft! Only down side is the name &amp;#34;luminary&amp;#34; is a sticker and it came off right away but bottle is in tact and lotion is great</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff..and the bottle that it comes in too, with its flashy little stars..The Bronzer is GREAT and a fraction of the cost I found at the Local tanning bed places..Good buy..Fast shipping,,Thanks</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and got great results! Would definitely buy again. Not a knock off.</li>
    <li> Light didn&#x27;t work, the front was broken. But I didn&#x27;t buy it for the bottle.</li>
    <li> Looks great in the sun light or on the dance floor.</li>
    <li> tan tan tan tan tan tan tan. &amp;#60;--- thats how I was looking after using this product and I got a ton of compliments. Plus it has a nice smell!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion about a month ago after I began tanning again.. I just wanted a nice natural tan nothing too dark or too light.. With the first use I was very pleased, smells amazing before and after use.. Leaves your skin amazing after tanning, felt like silk.. I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s wanting a nice settle tan..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it smells great, it works great, and on top of that it arrived fast. Definitely a good buy and I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have used this bronzer lotion at least five times now, and WOW are the results amazing!  I have received several comments on how dark my tan is, and I have tanned indoors for years and never got any compliments!  My doubts about ordering this product has been proved wrong.  Besides helping to accelerate and deepen my tan, the lotion also leaves my skin extremely soft and it has a nice fragrance, too.  All in all, I could not be any happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Amazing- I love it! Great purchase! Great exchange- fast, easy and would definitely buy again!  Thanks so much for a great product</li>
    <li> I love it! I like the bronzer and it leaves a shimmer. Smells nice too and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot tanner using this product</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite lotion of all time. Must try for anyone who tans often or looking to get tan faster.</li>
    <li> Amazing , would 100% buy again. I&#x27;m german very pale light skin and I got an amazing deep natural looking tan. So worth the money!</li>
    <li> For dedicated tanners this by far the best lotion I have used my skin never feels dry and my tan is uniform.  I am hooked on this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing rave reviews and I have tried all of the best tanning lotions out there. This didn&#x27;t give me any color, smells horrible, not at all moisturizing, actually drying a little, and streaked!! I would do better without any lotion in the tanning bed. I also want to add that I tan very easily and lay in the highest quality beds offered at the salons so I know that isn&#x27;t the reason for not getting results. I thought this would be as good as the Kardashian line or Obsidian but doesn&#x27;t even compare! Worst bronzer I&#x27;ve ever bought! Will probably throw the rest of the bottle away and I NEVER do that!! Sticking with my Obsidian and Cypher black and Kardashian line.</li>
    <li> A great tan lotion if you want something good, and works out t make an awesome tan !&lt;br /&gt;I would tell anyone to buy this product if your a seriouse tanner, and want the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good to.</li>
    <li> I used to own a salon and this is by far the best lotions</li>
    <li> I love Designer Skin brand tanning lotion but this one is horrible. It stained my hands like a self tanner would. I&#x27;m turning out orange which is what I absolutely hate. What is the point of paying for the tanning beds if I&#x27;m gonna turn out orange like I would with over the counter self tanners? I&#x27;m going back to my other tanning lotion which are Designer Skin&#x27;s Queen &amp; Bellezza. This one costs more and isn&#x27;t even worth it. Too much bronzer in it. Beware. Say no to orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update. The bottle I received is a fake. I compared it with the real stuff and there was a clear difference between the real one and the fake one I got from Amazon. It is by no means a poor product when it is real. Please order from a reputable seller/website or buy it from a salon. Please be careful when ordering.</li>
    <li> Bought this in my salon for about $150. MUCH better here. I bought this after my other bottle ran out. It is the exact same product I bought in my salon. Great quality. Perfect for girls that are much more pale and want to get tan without it looking fake.</li>
    <li> This is the very best indoor. Tanning lotion. I use it every year. Smells good and your tan is dark.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> this product is very amazing, i love this because it leaves you smelling good and not burnt smelling i was scared to order it offline i was worried i about get a fake but i have a bottle i got from my tanning salon an it was the real deal i paid 60  for it at the tanning salon an got it on here for 40$ so i&#x27;m very happy a must have if you are  tanning a lot leaves your skin silky smooth...</li>
    <li> This lotion is so great you get super dark fast and it&#x27;s so lightweight and not sticky or smelly like other tanning lotions...and you do literally gloww with healthy bronze skin you luminate!&lt;br /&gt; It is the best and its more than half the price here!!! Compare $120 to $40 , get it , it is one of the best from designer skin if not the best!!!!</li>
    <li> It was old  the first time I got a bad bottle. I have used this tanning lotion for years love it. But this time it rolled up like dead skin. That means the lotion has got hot somewhere in shipping or in storage</li>
    <li> Used it for seven months and became shades darker (like passing out from giving blood pale to dark enough for a Pocahontas  costume). I like the subtle smell it gives off while my boyfriend prefers to grab my arm and inhale me when I get home. The review didn&#x27;t lie about getting darker hours after coming out from the light and I never turned orange, not even my palms. So only buy it if you like hearing how great you look :D</li>
    <li> This is a great bronzer! It may not be as dark as some but it doesn&#x27;t stain my hands afterwards. Some other lotions do even after wiping my hands with a baby wipe. Plus it smells good.</li>
    <li> Luminary is no lie! It&#x27;s a fast-acting bronzer that brings you to your darkest in about 5 to 6 tanning sessions. Great for both indoor and outdoor use. The bottle is beautiful and literally lights up when in use.&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer is very dark, so if you&#x27;re beginning to tan, be careful! The bronzer solution can be a bit overwhelming at first!</li>
    <li> I used to want this lotion so bad a couple years ago but I never did because it was so expensive. Well now I finally got it when it was a lot cheaper and it works awesome. It smells like Tommy Hilfiger. (yummy) and it always made me have a great tan!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It smells awesome and I feel it did a good job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years, this is my first time buying from this buyer, it seemed a little runnier then usual, but it still works well.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and received my order on time!</li>
    <li> Ok...So I have only used this once but I&#x27;m impressed by the scent and the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave me icky feeling afterward. Its smooth and absorbs like you have nothing on. The light shimmer is a nice touch as well. Not sure if it will get me darker but I do love the scent and feel. Would def recommend.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and i LOVE the product! After years of searching for a tanning lotion to do the job, i finally found Luminary Bronzer to exceed the job! HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> Seriously one of the best indoor tanning lotions I have ever use! This is my first time using designer skin and it is crazy how well it works. I got dark so fast and it smells amazing, I don&#x27;t even smell like cooked flesh when I get done either (with the Australian Gold Wicked I always smelled like burnt flesh after getting out) Defiantly recommend trying this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and I love it. Gives me a beautiful tan quickly and smells nice.  The price is great for the product.  I haven&#x27;t found it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
    <li> It was either fake or really sucked. Smelt awful and rubbed off after applying it. I was disappointed by this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a different color from the stores and it made my face break out and my moms...... other than that it leaves a good color</li>
    <li> After using the Luminary for about a week, I began to wonder if my product is fake.  After issuing it a month I&#x27;m convinced it is. It doesn&#x27;t work like the Luminary sold in the salon. I think they keep some of the luminary in the bottle but mix it with god knows what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with this.</li>
    <li> I think this product nourishes my skin as I tan.  I will keep alternating with othemr products and I will keep this in the rogtation.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom we like to lay out in the pool i prefer the pink kardashion but she liked this one and it does tan pretty fast but after awhile i got nautious from the smell of the luminary..</li>
    <li> Love the mild scent. Not overpowering like other lotions I&#x27;ve used. Love the slight sparkle it leaves on my skin. LOVE the price! Holy buckets! This same bottle goes for over $100 at my tanning salon!!!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the sparkles but the color and smell is great</li>
    <li> Has almost a perfume smell. One of the best products I&#x27;ve used. Has a dark tint to to the lotion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion before,and had horrible luck with it. So a year later I&#x27;m going to try again, this time from another seller. I really want to like this lotion it gets such good reviews, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake last time. So I&#x27;m hoping this time I get the real thing like others have. Besides that, the lotion smells really good, and the texture of the real thing is great! Anyone order from theetanman at all? Let me know :)</li>
    <li> It appeared to be the same, but the results were not.  I don&#x27;t know if  I got an old product or a knock-off formula.  I purchased this online so I didn&#x27;t have to spend 3x as much.  You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it smells fantastic and gets me dark within a few uses. I will be purchasing this every time I run out.</li>
    <li> awesome product awesome price</li>
    <li> This lotion is ok. I don&#x27;t know if it is the bed I am tanning in or the lotion but do not feel as though I am getting dark like I normally have.</li>
    <li> Scent--It&#x27;s definitely not what I expected, but after using it a couple times I really liked it. It doesn&#x27;t smell super girly, and because of that I think it&#x27;s a good unisex lotion. It reminds me of a perfume, or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Results--I&#x27;m very happy with the color I got from using this lotion. I was already pretty tan to begin with, but I noticed even more color after using Luminary. And I get so many compliments on how dark I am. I love that this lotion has silicone in it. The silicone makes your skin so much softer. My only complaint is that I&#x27;m not a fan of shimmer, this lotion has a slight shimmer in it. But overall it&#x27;s a great lotion!</li>
    <li> You need a base tan first or this lotion will make you look like fake bake. Lots of instant bronzes! Nice instant tan though. Just don&#x27;t miss a spot!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two weeks now and my fair skin has a nice, natural looking base tan.  Lotion feels rich with moisturizers and does not dry the skin.  I do not like the flowery scent though.  It&#x27;s quite strong, and although it fades after a while, it never really goes away.</li>
    <li> I was worried it was going to be fake, but it&#x27;s the real stuff. Awesome. Saw results after one use indoor tanning. Leaves your skin sparkly.</li>
    <li> This product is advertised at my tanning salon for double what I paid! It smelled nice and I tanned quickly! I was not aware this came with shimmer in it.. I did not mind I was just surprised. I went back too work with shimmer all over..</li>
    <li> I only tan to get a base tan so that I don&#x27;t burn for summertime. When I saw this lotion online, I figured it was the same price as what I normally pay so why not?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this lotion twice so far and I love it! It is not greasy and smells amazing. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and had make up on at the time and it did not affect my make up at all.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome purchase, will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the real stuff! Has a beige color and lots of sparkle! The bottle actually light up when you touch it, not necessary but it&#x27;s cool. It leave me with a great tan and it smells like a nice perfume. No burnt skin smell!</li>
    <li> I couldnt wait to try this lotion as I have read all the positive reviews about it. It did get me significantly darker the first time i used it and even darker the second time which were a few days a part. I was reaching my \\&quot;tanning plateau\\&quot; and this is such an awesome break through lotion. I really recommend it to anyone who is having difficulty getting a draker tan. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because the perfume scent can be a bit overhwelming when youre putting it on. But otherwise, this really is a great product! Gives u a deep tan, broze color, no orange here &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I just received what was supposed to be luminary 25x bronzer in the mail on friday (9/7/12). It came in a priority mail envelope,like the kind the u get a the post office,not a box or even packeged at all. Anyone can put lotion into a big envelope with bubble rap. That was the first &#x27;red flag&#x27;. Then i took the cap off the bottle of lotion and on the rim of the lotion there was dark brown crust on it and inside the cap as well. The color of the lotion was a dark brown color and anyone that is familiar with luminary knows the it should be a light color with a slight tint to it like (Designer Skin Black or and Black Noir) with noticeable shimmer to it. The lotion i received didn&#x27;t have hardly any shimmer to it when i tested it on the top of my hand. The smell should be kind of a strong perfume smell as the lotion i received didn&#x27;t have that much of a smell but could still see that the smells where in a way the same. Not sure how the managed that seeing as how the two are every different. The only thing that i can see how, is they left just enough in there to make it smell the same in a way. Even if it was out of date or sun damaged it would not look dark brown because i have had lotions that were left in the car and forgotten about or lost under the seat and it never changer the color in anyway. at least not for me. Also i noticed that the bottle wasen&#x27;t even all the way full!! I have never had a problem with amazon before but i guess in a way its sum what my fault for using a second party seller that looked like it was coming from someones house rather then (MARKET SOLUTIONS) when i received it but then maybe thats just how they do things, That&#x27;s why i had to rate it 1out of 5 stars. But as for the real luminary tanning lotion, great stuff but i felt their are other lotions out there that can get u darker faster. so rating the real stuff 4out of 5 stars.  I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS IN SOME WAY. HAPPY TANNING</li>
    <li> Love the silicone bronzer, leaves your skin feeling it&#x27;s softest not oily. Bronzer continues working after you leave the salon for up to four hours, unless you wash it off. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting the bronze natural color instead of fake looking tan. Does not turn hands orange after application. Price and delivery was exceptional as well.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, not oily, and works perfect.  We used this after using other Australian gold lotions and love this one.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have ever used by far. Now, I don&#x27;t need to tan as often, and my color is amazing.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this lotion. Just like many people said it has a nice smell to it, unlike a lot of indoor tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. Luminary gives great results fast with a very pleasant fragrance. Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the glittery effect but then I&#x27;m a guy. Oh yea, the badge on the bottle lights up when u turn it over so don&#x27;t squeeze it or take it apart like I did.</li>
    <li> I love the results w/this lotion but especially the smell. It smells great before AND after tanning which is the best!</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product! It is FAKE! It arrived in shrink wrap. I used it twice and both times it flaked off of my skin on my clothes after. You could literally see it flaking off. The bottle is real but the lotion inside is what is fake. I then bought the real stuff at my tanning salon to compare, completely different! The real stuff actually works. Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Luminary bronzer for several years...  I have always purchased it at the tanning salon I go to, But of course they charge double the price. So I bought it for less from this company and it seems as if they put a different kind ( cheap) in a Luminary bottle. The smell was terrible, I compared the color of it to the stuff they sell at my salon and it was a completely different color... The real stuff is a light tannish color the stuff in this bottle was orange/brown.</li>
    <li> I read all of the other reviews and one person said they didn&#x27;t understand why everyone was giving it good reviews when they didn&#x27;t think it was that good.Well I ordered anyway and I&#x27;m like the other reviewer I don&#x27;t get it.I used it and seen no change but I&#x27;m all ready brown so maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t see any difference.May be if you just started tanning you could tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion! It smells great even after you tan! and you get really great and even color</li>
    <li> great lotion. I love designer skin!  The lotion has silicon so it&#x27;s soft instead of greasy.  Has a light bronzer to help your color.</li>
    <li> I started using this last summer and I immediately regretted not buying it sooner.  So this year, after learning my lesson, I bought the lotion first thing and tanned more in a week with this one lotion than I did in 3 months with the other stuff, and I am only using the Ultimate Tanning Bed on 7 minutes a day!  Hands down the best on the market!!</li>
    <li> The absolute best, and believe me I have tried them all. This will make you soft, and dark quick. Has shimmer which I love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion at the tanning Salon and it came out to $100. It&#x27;s and awesome lotion, but I can&#x27;t afford to pay that each time I run out. When I purchased this item on amazon, the lotion looked practically identical to the lotion from the salon. The lotion is just as good as the more expensive one. If I as you I would buy the lotion on amazon opposed to the salon. It&#x27;s the same thing, you might as well save the 60 or so dollars.</li>
    <li> It smells really good, but when I put it on there is a hueg shimmer/glitter to it.  I tan a lot and I dont notice that this lotion makes a huge difference in how dark I get.  Does smell really good though.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> Product is nice, easy to apply and moisturizing.  Bottle is bulky to bring to tanning spa and the first thing you want to do is tear off the light on the bottle</li>
    <li> Not as good as it&#x27;s said to be........would work for beginners I think. I to use to tingle this bronze doesn&#x27;t help on my fair skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good starter lotion to get a really nice base. The smell is a little strange. But overall I really like this lotion!</li>
    <li> I know for some buyers, they received the actual Luminary tanning lotion when purchased on here. The problem---mine was NOT real. Not even close. I had purchased a sample from a well-known salon in my area, and fell in love with Luminary. It smells really good, not too perfume-y, but still covers up that after-tan smell. And it gave me a really nice color even after using it one time. It also keeps your skin moisturized even after you wash it off. I LOVE LUMINARY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad part...the lotion I received was disgusting. It had a similar texture to most Designer Skin lotions (silky and light) but the smell was awful and heavily perfumed with stinky, syrupy smelling crap. It was also basically self-tanning lotion that you can get at Walmart for 4 bucks. It had tons of sparkly glitter pieces in it and did not help me at all after tanning. My skin was so dry afterwards and the after-tan smell was still there. It was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy online at your own risk. This bottle costs around $120 in a salon, but that&#x27;s the only way to guarantee that what you are getting is the real deal. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> amazing always gets me dark fast feels good on your skin and smells nice. got delivered fast the project was in perfect condition when it arrived. I</li>
    <li> Only b/c the front label came off as soon as I opened it up.  Lotion is good but was surprised bottle wasn&#x27;t put together better.</li>
    <li> Ok so I just got this in the mail.... I open it up and SURPRISE! It lights up with little LED lights sparkling, every time u touch it.. BLING! Now I look either totally crazy or totally cool at the tanning beds lol! Used it for the first time in the bed for 15 minutes and I&#x27;m soooo brown! It looks natural too! It smells really pretty and feels silly smooth going on:) 100% happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for the past two years and I love it! I get great color in a short amount of time. I&#x27;ve bought it on Amazon several times and it&#x27;s always been &amp;#34;the real stuff&amp;#34; for a quarter of the price you pay in tanning salons! I tried Black by Designer Skin and I didn&#x27;t get the same dark tan. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and I would tell anyone who might be considering this lotion to give it a try! :) It doesn&#x27;t leave your sticky and it smells great.</li>
    <li> this exactly what I bought in the salon for less money. works well, made my skin feel hydrated and smooth</li>
    <li> I am personally ABSOLUTELY THRILLED with this lotion. My tan is even with my face and darkened very quickly. I lay in the large beds and was very noticable on my 1st session and by my 3rd , it was like my usual 7th session. Needless to say I&#x27;m pleased with my lotion and the fact that I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This Lotion is amazing.  It smells super yummy  and it tans really well without turning you orange... I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff its amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> love this stuff! it&#x27;s the real deal too looks and smells exactly like the stuff at the salon</li>
    <li> I always tan during the summer or when it gets close to it, for like a month and then I can&#x27;t ever stick with it because of my busy schedule. BUT, I am pale and I do not tan easy....I absolutely LOVE this tanning lotion and it will always be my number 1 lotion to buy when I ever get more time to go tan. It makes my skin soft, it has a pleasant scent unlike some others I have tried. I start off tanning for 5 minutes a day for a week then bump it up, I have not burned this way and I have gotten color with this tanning lotion within 2 weeks. After, a month I was really dark ( I was also out in the sun a lot at my house besides tanning, which helped a lot.) So if you have fair skin, this will work. It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange or leave streaks, very good buy!</li>
    <li> The one I bought from the tanning salon was better. It was more expensive but this one made me break out into a rash. Ingredients are the same but something is different.</li>
    <li> Poor bronzer, not worth cost</li>
    <li> It was a good product- It didnt get me as dark right away as Im used to with the tingling bronzers- It smells great &amp; definitely works but if you&#x27;re used to a tingler that gets you bronzed right away- this wont do it- This take a bit more time.</li>
    <li> It was ship very fast! It arrived a few days early. The lotion smells really good!!! You can see the difference after using it about a week! The bottle does not last long.</li>
    <li> great product and great price. I needed to tan before a trip and at my salon this was $120. I love Designer Skin products for indoor tanning.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal and the product is well worth the money .I would recommend this to anyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product was very highly reviewed so I was pretty excited about it. I have used many lotions and this one was just ok. It did tan my skin well and you definitely don&#x27;t spell bad when you get out of the tanning bed. But I just didn&#x27;t like the perfume like smell about it. I felt it was too strong and then the day after I could still smell the bronzer chemical on my skin. I honestly stopped using this lotion and switched to a different bronzer cause I really couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Works wonderful. I could tell a difference right away. Husband commented how good tan looked second time I used this. The plastic over the lights like to pop off but has nothing to do with product.</li>
    <li> When i first bought the product i thought i would like it it isn&#x27;t as thick as a lot of other bronzers and it doesn&#x27;t come off orange on a towl as much as other bronzers but useing it for almost a month now it hasn&#x27;t really made a difference in my tanning and the smell is more like an antibiotic then a lotion.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and my store doesn&#x27;t carry this particular lotion, so I decided to order it from here for a much cheaper price than you would find in a salon. It arrived very quickly, but it made my skin break out terribly. Red itchy bumps covered my entire body. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just allergic to something in the lotion or if it was a cheap knockoff. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty fantastic! I didn&#x27;t want to spend $40 on a lotion. But it was WELL worth the money. This tanning lotion shows color right away and I normally don&#x27;t take a shower for 4-6 hours after, to let it develop. And let me tell you, the color i get after letting it develop shocks me. This product is amazing! My favorite tanning lotion by far. The smell, smells good but you still have a little after bed smell afterward. Will buy again. The only problem I found with this lotion is, afterwards it irritates my hands, i try to wipe it off the best I can. But I still get a little rash on my hands, nothing too big. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but still love the product! I recommend!</li>
    <li> Completely inferior product, not the original, smelled odd, paler, less-sparkly in color than the genuine product.  Also I burned the first time I used this product and I had been tanning without any redness with the genuine product prior.  Buy for your enemies.</li>
    <li> Great price. Much more $$ in the tanning salon. Smells really yummy and accelerates the tanning significantly:):) I would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion always have!!! I dont know if I received an old bottle or what but every time I put the lotion on and it starts to dry. It rolls into tiny balls and comes off!!!??? I&#x27;ve use this lotion for YEARS and its never done that. Wish I could&#x27;ve gotten a refund or a NEW bottle instead of an expired bottle.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this product. I&#x27;ve spend about 13 minutes over 2 sessions in the tanning bed and already see a big difference. I&#x27;m very curious to see how dark I can actually get with regular use... I guess that means i&#x27;ll have to post an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is walking around with such a stupid looking bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It doesn&#x27;t leave brown streaks on my skin when I tan and smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> I like it but I wish I had a smaller bottle.  By the end of summer it will barely have a dent in it.  Price was fantastic and as always PRIME was fast in delivering it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing designer skin luminary. I ordered through Amazon from the seller Solarium. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed to the point I wonder if the product is authentic. First, I don&#x27;t notice any bronzing effect or sparkle/glitter others have mentioned. Also the smell when putting it on is ok but not exactly pleasant. However, when I get out of the tanning bed I smell like nasty BO and I typically am not a person with a lot of BO. As for the tan itself, I don&#x27;t notice any significant difference in results using this vs any regular body lotion.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever. I have amazing color it smells great and it leaves your skin sparky if you need to go to an event after!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Top tier no tingle lotion that produces EXCELLENT results without the tingle. I&#x27;m a more seasoned tanner &amp; need the tingle to get dark, but this is a nice maintenance lotion during the winter months.</li>
    <li> fast shipping.  product smells very good</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I feel that my tan lasts longer and the smell is not over bearing. Better than the kardashian line that I used to use. As it claims, it provides a little bronzer and glimmer to the skin.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research, And decided to give this lotion a shot. I&#x27;m a huge Designer Skin user, I&#x27;ve used almost every lotion. The shipment came fast, And the first thing I noticed was the bottle. It was beautiful, sparkly, And well designed (didn&#x27;t seem cheap And bendable like other lotions). There was a tab I pulled out unwrapping it, And the lotion bottle had little stars on it that lit up blue! The bottle looks super cute at night, even the tanning salon worker was jealous.&lt;br /&gt;I put a sticker on to try out the lotion, And it went on super super spreadable, soft And smooth. It smelled delicious, like a high -end elegant perfume.&lt;br /&gt;After tanning, I was at least 2 if not more shades darker! Not only that, but I had a beautiful, rich brown color that Designer skin Obsidian didn&#x27;t even give me. The salon worker was impressed at this,  Also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase, this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used. Absolutely No after tan smell, a drop dead gorgeous color, And a cute bottle. Save yourself $80 (this retails at most salons for over $100) And buy this lotion!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on a Friday and received it the following Monday. I was so impressed with how fast I got it and the packaging was great! I could clearly see that it was a brand new bottle. I&#x27;ve used a sample packet of this lotion before and loved how dark it got me! I&#x27;m naturally tan and most products don&#x27;t do squat for me, but after the girl at the salon recommended it, I tried it out and could see results after one tanning session. I love to be super dark and this lotion worked amazingly. Not to mention it smells great! You won&#x27;t be disappointed at all with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Made me go from pale white in february to super dark by may to the darkest richest tan ive ever had by august!!!! i love this lotion. its got a very distinct smell to it almost like a perfume smell so thats how i could tell its legit. i feel like the 2 bottles ive ordered were the real deal. I cant remember who I ordered from but I do know it was 2 different places and both didnt disappoint!</li>
    <li> provides a nice bronze color. Saw results after 1 session on a level 3 bed. great smelling and feels velvety soft!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described! brand new in packaging! Very fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. It smells good and works great!</li>
    <li> Expired. Flakes off of skin</li>
    <li> Authentic product.  Item came sealed and is the real deal.  Entire purchase and shipping was timely, as it should be.  Will definitely recommend to others as well as purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Perfect every time :)</li>
    <li> I love most of the whole line of Designer Skin, but this is the best!  And the flashing tag is kind cool too.</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is fake. It&#x27;s really liquidy and I didn&#x27;t get ANY tanner when I went to the tanning bed. My kardashian dark bronze one works 10 times better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this scam</li>
    <li> Great bronzers.  Smell is nice which is unusual for a tanning lotion.  Will definitely order again. Has a nice bronzer.</li>
    <li> I am a pale white, freckle-faced, redhead of Irish decent. I do not tan easily or fast. HOWEVER, I have used this three times so far (over a 2 week period) and have already noticed a difference. The best part is that it isn&#x27;t orange, it looks natural. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not really anything special, didnt really show any results for me,,  no tingle which is ok, I have used better lotions</li>
    <li> This lotion immediately boosted my tan and smells WONDERFUL! My boyfriend told me I smelled amazing after tanning, and lets be honest, that never happens... It keeps my skin so smooth and moisturizes as well. Best tanning lotion out there!</li>
    <li> if you want your woman to get dark and look good for you than buy this. smells great and works great. must buy if you want her to look good.&lt;br /&gt;easy maintance for you!!</li>
    <li> Works amazing to help tan my extremely fair skin. The smell is slightly odd but not offensive. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS TOP OF THE NOTCH! IT WORKS VERY WELL. IT&#x27;S THE STRONGEST TANNING LOTION THAT I&#x27;VE USED. THANKS</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion. Works great, smells amazing and there&#x27;s no burnt after tan smell. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was that it&#x27;s glittery. Other than that it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> I worked in a tanning salon for many years and know that it&#x27;s important to have a good lotion to tan well.  This was the first lotion I bought online and was super nervous to see how it would turn out. I was pleasantly surprised with the lotion for the price I paid. I&#x27;m no lotion expert but I thought it was a good lotion, it helped boost my tan, left my skin feeling super silky, and the scent is nice. I know now not to get robbed paying hundreds of dollars for the same lotions in the salon!</li>
    <li> This lotion does bronze your skin, applies evenly without streaking.  Expect after tab odor, but not the worst.  That being said, I would probably try another kind before repurchasing.  I liked it, didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several tanning lotions and this by far is the best.  Gives me the best color and holds color best</li>
    <li> MUCH cheaper here than buying at a tanning place.  (Over $100.00!)  Soft and silky, smells pretty good, works well! Cool bottle too.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. The bronzers aren&#x27;t overwhelming, just wash your hands after applying to prevent orange fingers! The fragrance is perfect and makes your skin soft and smooth--also gives a great color immediately after tanning sessions. Very pleased and will purchase another bottle as soon as I&#x27;m out of this one.</li>
    <li> It goes on very nice.  Keeps my skin soft. Color is not as immediate as other lotions I have tried. The smell for me is too perfumy.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion EVER!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful bottle and fun to use with the lights too. It smells wonderful and a great price</li>
    <li> Im very white but going to tanner this really helped, my skin  is getting nice color and retaining it love it.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this was just another one that would not work. Boy was I wrong. The first time out of the bed and I could see the difference. I could tell my legs and arms were a shade or two darker. It make my skin feel so soft and even after taking a shower it still was soft and smooth. The smells is great to.  I would recommend this to everyone. Well worth the money. Thank you</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I tend to switch it out with intensifiers, though, so I don&#x27;t look too dark during the winter months. Designer Skin is my preferred brand and Luminary has the right balance of bronzers and skin supplements.</li>
    <li> So I just got my lotion and was so happy with how fast it shipped. Almost didn&#x27;t order it for fear of getting a fake. I&#x27;m not sure if tanning salon owners are leaving fake reviews to try and scare people into buying their product or what but I&#x27;ll never pay for marked up lotions again. Thanks theetanman!!! I can finally get the lotions I want now</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!!! I have fair skin and it&#x27;s very hard to get a tan but I can honestly say this stuff works and its worth the money. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Like this product pretty well. I go back and forth with a couple others.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews and a large majority of buyers recommended this bronzer.  It&#x27;s perfect!  It&#x27;s light, not greasy, has a nice scent but not overpowering and leaves my skin feeling moisturized.  I have fair skin and this was one of the lotions recommended.  I will definitely purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells nice, goes on smooth &amp; adds nice color.  I wish the bottle was a little more stream-lined so it would be easier to handle but all in all, the lotion is great.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it smell great too</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ITEM. AWESOME QUALITY - GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
    <li> This has and always will be my bronzer. It&#x27;s really the best out there....in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
    <li> Not the real designer skin brand!! I worked in a tanning salon for years and this is NOT the real product. You have been warned.</li>
    <li> I wasnt super impressed with this... i guess i had high expectations based on the other reviews, but ive tried many lotions this summer and this one did not perform as well as most others I tried.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion!  I tan after work, and if I forget to put this in my purse that day, I won&#x27;t go.  I don&#x27;t go tanning without this anymore.  It truly does make a difference.  Not only in the intensity of color, but the evenness of it as well.  My feet aren&#x27;t as pale compared to the rest of my body anymore.  I use it on my face as well and I don&#x27;t break out (however, the only time I break out is a pimple once a month for my period, so I can&#x27;t speak for those with skin problems).  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few samples of lotions, looking for one that tans and also covers up that &#x27;burnt&#x27; after-tan smell.  This is the only one where I don&#x27;t smell burnt.  I&#x27;m done searching.  I&#x27;m sticking with Luminary</li>
    <li> The product that arrived in the mail for $40 was the exact same thing as the $120 one they sell at the tanning salon. This stuff is great, I have fair skin but tan really well once I have a base. After 1 session I noticed a difference as opposed to the other lotions for $10 or $20. I like the fact that it smells good and has a ton of moisturizers in it. I do not like the fact that it comes with cheesey LED lights. In my opinion they should have left that out and pass the savings onto the consumer. Either way, I do not regret this purchase and am happy I found this lotion. Try it, what have you got to lose?</li>
    <li> I bought Luminary when I started tanning again, and it worked pretty well for about a month. As I got darker, the lotion kinda stopped doing anything for me, though. I think this would be a great lotion for fair skinned people or someone who wants a beginner bronzer to speed things up. Designer Skin bronzers are just way too light for my taste. The smell got really old real fast, and the lights on my bottle stopped working within a few days. I also ended up taking the label off, because it was a hassle.</li>
    <li> I love using tanning beds. I think tanned skin looks good but the real reason I go is for the deep warmth. I have fibromyalgia and I accidently found tanning seems to relax stiff muscles better than a prescription muscle relaxer and sometimes I get desprate for relief. From fall to spring I go about 3 times a week. I found most tanning lotions directed at females is often scented with some sweet candy smell. Designer skin&#x27;s Lunimary is different. It&#x27;s supposed to smell like strawberries and champagne but I have to say it&#x27;s less berry sweet smell and more fresh and light champagne. A little goes a long way. Maybe it&#x27;s the silicone that makes it so silky. The bottle has a neat feature. I don&#x27;t know if you can see it in the picture but the little name plate hanging on the bottle actually lights up and twinkles when the bottle is bumped or knocked. So I guess if we are going to pay for minutes to use a tanning bed or booth, we should invest in a good tanning lotion. I can say that Luminary is the best lotion I have discovered so far. I am not orange. My skin is hydrated and the color is even and dark. I don&#x27;t have to leave the salon smelling like candy and one bottle lasts me about 3 and a half months. Happy Tanning :)</li>
    <li> One of our top lotions. Awesome smell and coverage. Has a slight glitter to it but not&lt;br /&gt;Over powering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY brands &amp; so many lotions...THIS IS IT. Beats Conceited &amp; It Factor HANDS DOWN. I&#x27;m a die hard tanner. Talk about SILKY SKIN &amp; a great after scent! Love the ease of application &amp; the color results. Buy as a package with Luminary face lotion. AWESOME. You will be happy!!</li>
    <li> The only tanning lotion I will use! It works so well every time I tan there is a noticeable difference in skin color. The smell is kind of like cologne so it&#x27;s not an overwhelming sweet smell like some other lotions.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion goes on smoothly, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty after smell.  However, for the money, I&#x27;m not convinced.  I love the Millennium Solid Black 100x, which is much cheaper.  It works just as well.  Actually, my mother and I both agree that it works better for a deep color in a short time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion after plenty of debate as to what tanning lotion to get for my first ever bottle. The reviews were positive and raving about luminary and now I&#x27;m raving too!&lt;br /&gt;Luminary is amazing, it has helped me build a base and beyond it in less than a month. My legs and arms were harder to tan but that goes for slot of people,so I did have to use a tingle for a few days mixed with my luminary. Now I&#x27;m all even and dark golden brown which is amazing for me to be this dark I&#x27;ve always had trouble tanning in the sun and am very white with no tan. Luminary has help me achieve this tanning in a level 2 bed/ stand up for 7 to 10&lt;br /&gt;mins a day.&lt;br /&gt;Luminary has very nice perfume scent which smells just like Tommy Hilfiger but is unisex very pleasant not overwhelming. And not much ATOM and none at all with stand up bed.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion glides on like a dream and a Lil goes a long way, no breakouts even on face, the lotion has settled between my fingers if I don&#x27;t wipe before tanning but after tanning doesn&#x27;t stain if you wipe. The shimmer I think is huge factor maybe y this is so great catches more uvs but isn&#x27;t very noticeable if you leave them on I think it completed this lotion as a female I love shimmer. no streaking or orange! Just all around even tan.the bottle was nice some people dont like the light up effect i think its  unique.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I just got it in the mail a few days ago, and I&#x27;ve been to the tanning bed twice. Previously, I had not been tanning in over a month and I was very pale, but this lotion works better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried before. I&#x27;m getting tan very quickly! Also, it arrived in the mail within 2 days of placing my order! It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. I will order it again when I run out.</li>
