### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have learned over time that coconut oil is one of nature&#x27;s best medicine for people who suffer from atopic dermatitis/eczema.</li>
      <li>I am so impressed that I will will order it again!!!</li>
      <li>It does a great job cleaning</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>

      <li>The coconut fragrance is wonderful and I love the fact that it is grown and harvested fair trade.</li>
      <li>The scent was nice and the price was great, I just prefer a foamy shower cream or gel.</li>
      <li>The body wash itself is good though.</li>
      <li>In fact, it is amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been impressed with their products and, particularly, their no animal testing ethos.</li>
      <li>This is why I love it so much more!</li>
      <li>I love coconut, and I liked the sweetness of this product in the bottle.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love The Body Shop&#x27;s Coconut shower cream.</li>
      <li>I love all things that remind me of the beach.</li>
      <li>Smells so good and fresh</li>
      <li>but I guess I was expecting more of the scent of you find in suntan lotion.  </li>
      <li>It is ok</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe it.</li>
      <li>love the smell of this, and I started using it on my hair, leaving it in for about 3 minutes and washing it off, add some leave-in conditioner and</li>
      <li>and I like them better.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I love the smell of this stuff...</li>
      <li>I prefer a more foamy shower cream.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite shower gel/cream.</li>
      <li>, the smell is amazing, it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>In fact, I seem to be breaking out more along my body.</li>
      <li>This did smell like coconut and did clean and did leave skin nice.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a really strong coconut smell, it could be much better.  </li>
      <li>I love coconut scented things, so I was particularly excited about this one.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t foamy it is rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>does not suds so no harsh chemicals, is like putting lotion on your body and it smells AMAZING, like coconut cream pie</li>
      <li>The body wash smells delicious and makes my skin feel quite soft, however, I really don&#x27;t feel like it is actually cleaning.  </li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and light not harsh and strong.</li>
      <li>This product is so creamy and gentle and rinses away so smoothly.</li>
      <li>So, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve tried a body wash/shower gel that I like more, but I can&#x27;t completely ignore the cost.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite product on the market because it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft without any residue.</li>
      <li>The bottle is pretty large and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it at a time which in turn makes it worth the money.</li>
      <li>I absolutely luv it!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used this product.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good all day long, even without using lotion.</li>
      <li>If you want 2 or three plunges, it&#x27;s a frustrating wait for the bottle to reset, but the shower cream smells good and seems fine.</li>
      <li>But now that anything and everything is available online, their products are just as accessible as any other company&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It has a natural coconut smell not artificial.</li>
      <li>I would much rather have this in a lotion...not the body wash.</li>
      <li>and I really have to give it to the farmers who hand picked the coconut and then pressed it by hand</li>
      <li>Doesnt lather very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not hydrating or moisturizing any more than other body washes I&#x27;ve used, either.</li>
      <li>Smell is ok but not fantastic (ironically, their glitter moisturizer smells absolutely fantastic!).&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
      <li>Or in a smaller size, I don&#x27;t think this bottle is worth the money, I would rather have a squeeze bottle than the pump</li>
      <li>I definitely wish I&#x27;d purchased the smallest bottle, but I expected this to work better than drug store body wash.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and suffer from eczema.</li>
      <li>This so so creamy and lush!</li>
      <li>The Body Shop contains natural oils from coconuts from sustainable resources and I also know a portion of the money helps those communities who produce the product.</li>
      <li>Very creamy and the fragrance last on your skin</li>
      <li>This product smelled really old and it was separated in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>the combination of them both make my hair SOO soft.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s side- with the lid on completely sealed, and it still leaked everywhere...</li>
      <li>This allows the products natural ingredient to do</li>
      <li>Of course, I bought a giant bottle at a decent price, but now I&#x27;ll probably wind up giving it</li>
      <li>It is gentle and non-drying and smells fantastic!I&#x27;ve been using it for several years!I use the entire line of Body Shop coconut products!</li>
      <li>So, it will probably have to sit at 2nd place on my list of favorite body washes (behind Alba&#x27;s Midnight Tuberose body wash) once the value aspect is factored in, but from a pure enjoyment perspective, this would likely be #1.</li>
      <li>It has an unbelievable, rich, coconut scent.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot use regular soaps without getting a skin rash.</li>
      <li>It barely popped up, however.</li>
      <li>This is a great product but a little difficult with the pump because of the thickness.  </li>

<li> It has an unbelievable, rich, coconut scent.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use regular soaps without getting a skin rash.</li>
<li> It barely popped up, however.</li>
<li> This is a great product but a little difficult with the pump because of the thickness.  </li>
<li> However...it did have a strange waxy?</li>
<li> Definitely not the creamy coconut I expected.</li>
<li> But I&#x27;ve never really considered their products as something that I&#x27;d use on a regular basis because I don&#x27;t find myself at the mall all that often.</li>
<li> To get this on a sponge or anything other than my hand, I have to tilt it because the pump is so short.</li>
<li> It is far too small for this bottle</li>
<li> I expected some as a shower gel, but there is none at all.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely not easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not pleased with the sudden price gouge...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other brands that have a stronger coconut smell</li>
<li> but when you factor in the $5 for shipping, it does become pretty expensive.</li>
<li> /&gt;That&#x27;s not my only complaint, though.</li>
<li> so you have to pick the bottle up and tilt it before pumping or the body wash just squirts down the bottle.</li>
<li> Bought this product less than a year ago for about half the price.</li>
<li> The Body Shop occupies this odd space in my mind.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried their products on occasion, and usually it&#x27;s the result of an \\&quot;occasion\\&quot; when I find myself at the mall looking for presents, and end up at The Body Shop.</li>
<li> I would recommend putting a thick layer over the body and allowing the skin to absorb the oils for a few minutes before rinsing off.</li>
<li> If I had to come up with a negative, it would be price.</li>
<li> It has practically no lather and it doesn&#x27;t remove my old deodorant :(  </li>
<li> It wears away VERY fast...and the packaging is AWFUL!</li>
<li> Something in addition to the coconut that was unpleasant.</li>
<li> Even after shaking the smell was too bad to use.  </li>
<li> Body Shop products haven&#x27;t ever disappointed me.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed because there is no fragrance at all.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
<li> This product is absolutely horrible at lathering, so I wind up using quite a bit every time I shower.</li>
<li> The smell is disgusting while I used it, and I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great product but a little difficult with the pump because of the thickness.  Smells so good and fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to choose products that don&#x27;t test on animals and, out of curiosity, I&#x27;ve been making a point of trying products that I haven&#x27;t used before as much as possible. The Body Shop occupies this odd space in my mind. I&#x27;ve tried their products on occasion, and usually it&#x27;s the result of an \\&quot;occasion\\&quot; when I find myself at the mall looking for presents, and end up at The Body Shop. I&#x27;ve always been impressed with their products and, particularly, their no animal testing ethos. But I&#x27;ve never really considered their products as something that I&#x27;d use on a regular basis because I don&#x27;t find myself at the mall all that often. But now that anything and everything is available online, their products are just as accessible as any other company&#x27;s. So, I couldn&#x27;t resist when I saw their Coconut Shower Gel. I love coconut scented things, so I was particularly excited about this one. And I have to say that it did not disappoint. In fact, it is amazing. It has an unbelievable, rich, coconut scent. It&#x27;s not often I use the word \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; but I can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe it. It does a great job cleaning, the smell is amazing, it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be price. It&#x27;s not exorbitant ($15 for a 25 oz. bottle), but when you factor in the $5 for shipping, it does become pretty expensive. So, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve tried a body wash/shower gel that I like more, but I can&#x27;t completely ignore the cost. So, it will probably have to sit at 2nd place on my list of favorite body washes (behind Alba&#x27;s Midnight Tuberose body wash) once the value aspect is factored in, but from a pure enjoyment perspective, this would likely be #1.</li>
    <li> This is a great body wash. It makes you feel like you are at the beach in the middle of summer. It has a natural coconut smell not artificial. Very creamy and the fragrance last on your skin</li>
    <li> Not pleased with the sudden price gouge... Bought this product less than a year ago for about half the price.</li>
    <li> I prefer a more foamy shower cream.  The scent was nice and the price was great, I just prefer a foamy shower cream or gel.</li>
    <li> The body wash smells delicious and makes my skin feel quite soft, however, I really don&#x27;t feel like it is actually cleaning.  It has practically no lather and it doesn&#x27;t remove my old deodorant :(  Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> Ok, I love the smell of this stuff...in the shower..but once you get out of the shower, you don&#x27;t smell like anything! It wears away VERY fast...and the packaging is AWFUL! My pump was faulty, and it wouldn&#x27;t work. I had to take the lid off anytime I wanted to use it. And I left the bottle on it&#x27;s side- with the lid on completely sealed, and it still leaked everywhere...all over my belongings. I would much rather have this in a lotion...not the body wash. Or in a smaller size, I don&#x27;t think this bottle is worth the money, I would rather have a squeeze bottle than the pump</li>
    <li> If you want 2 or three plunges, it&#x27;s a frustrating wait for the bottle to reset, but the shower cream smells good and seems fine.</li>
    <li> The pump design needs some work. It is far too small for this bottle so you have to pick the bottle up and tilt it before pumping or the body wash just squirts down the bottle. The body wash itself is good though. No complaints there.</li>
    <li> I love all things that remind me of the beach.This is my favorite shower gel/cream.It is gentle and non-drying and smells fantastic!I&#x27;ve been using it for several years!I use the entire line of Body Shop coconut products!</li>
    <li> does not suds so no harsh chemicals, is like putting lotion on your body and it smells AMAZING, like coconut cream pie</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this product.  I am so impressed that I will will order it again!!!</li>
    <li> This product smelled really old and it was separated in the bottle.  Even after shaking the smell was too bad to use.  Definitely not the creamy coconut I expected.</li>
    <li> It is ok and I really have to give it to the farmers who hand picked the coconut and then pressed it by hand but I guess I was expecting more of the scent of you find in suntan lotion.  This scent is more of coconut combined with stale lard.  I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good all day long, even without using lotion. Body Shop products haven&#x27;t ever disappointed me.</li>
    <li> This so so creamy and lush! I absolutely luv it! As a matter of fact I gotta re-up!!! Try it!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed because there is no fragrance at all. I expected some as a shower gel, but there is none at all.</li>
    <li> This is a coconut shower gel. Doesnt lather very well. Smell is ok but not fantastic (ironically, their glitter moisturizer smells absolutely fantastic!).&lt;br /&gt;Wont buy again. Gave the rest to a friend....</li>
    <li> I love coconut, and I liked the sweetness of this product in the bottle. However, it smells nothing like that in the shower/on my skin. I&#x27;m reminded of clay of play-dough. The smell is disgusting while I used it, and I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off. Of course, I bought a giant bottle at a decent price, but now I&#x27;ll probably wind up giving it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not my only complaint, though. This product is absolutely horrible at lathering, so I wind up using quite a bit every time I shower. The body wash in the largest container has a pump, which took quite a bit of effort to unlock. It barely popped up, however. To get this on a sponge or anything other than my hand, I have to tilt it because the pump is so short. It&#x27;s definitely not easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not hydrating or moisturizing any more than other body washes I&#x27;ve used, either. In fact, I seem to be breaking out more along my body. I definitely wish I&#x27;d purchased the smallest bottle, but I expected this to work better than drug store body wash.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a really strong coconut smell, it could be much better.  I&#x27;ve used other brands that have a stronger coconut smell and I like them better.  This may have set on a shelf for awhile before it shipped to me because it seemed like it should have had a stronger coconut smell.</li>
    <li> I got this coconut shower gel, plus over goodies on christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this, and I started using it on my hair, leaving it in for about 3 minutes and washing it off, add some leave-in conditioner and the combination of them both make my hair SOO soft.</li>
    <li> This did smell like coconut and did clean and did leave skin nice. However...it did have a strange waxy? smell, as well. Something in addition to the coconut that was unpleasant.</li>
    <li> This body wash is a find! I have sensitive skin and cannot use regular soaps without getting a skin rash. This product is so creamy and gentle and rinses away so smoothly. The coconut fragrance is wonderful and I love the fact that it is grown and harvested fair trade. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and suffer from eczema. I absolutely love The Body Shop&#x27;s Coconut shower cream. It&#x27;s my favorite product on the market because it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft without any residue. I have learned over time that coconut oil is one of nature&#x27;s best medicine for people who suffer from atopic dermatitis/eczema. The Body Shop contains natural oils from coconuts from sustainable resources and I also know a portion of the money helps those communities who produce the product. This is why I love it so much more! It isn&#x27;t foamy it is rich and creamy. I would recommend putting a thick layer over the body and allowing the skin to absorb the oils for a few minutes before rinsing off. This allows the products natural ingredient to do it&#x27;s job adding back the needed moisture. The scent is fresh and light not harsh and strong. I always get out of the shower or bath feeling totally refreshed! The bottle is pretty large and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it at a time which in turn makes it worth the money.</li>
