<ol>
      <li>So happy to have found this on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Very pleased :D</li>
      <li>Effective Eye Makeup Remover Lotion is absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>It was a good price and it works great.</li>
      <li>I saw all the good reviews and decided to purchase three bottles.</li>
      <li>Good stuff one or two sweeps and the mascara and eye makeup is gonezo.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I found it best if you lightly moisten your cotton pad/ball first before adding this product to prevent peices of the cotton from sticking to your lashes.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite eye makeup remover for more than a year, I like that it is creamy</li>
      <li>It removes most of my waterproof mascara, but there&#x27;s a bit more residue than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>Better to use with a tissue to wipe off.  </li>
      <li>Like the product, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and just love it.  </li>
      <li>It does not make my eyes sting like most eye makeup</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years to remove my eye makeup at the end of the day, and it&#x27;s gentle on the eyes and very effective at removing even the most stubborn mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better solutions, but this is fine.  </li>
      <li>The eye makeup comes off easily.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s going to happen and easy to wipe away.  </li>
      <li>It takes the makeup off easily without rubbing you eyes out.</li>
      <li>Without a doubt, the best makeup remover out there, hands down!</li>
      <li>It would be great if this product came in larger sizes.</li>
      <li>This eye makeup remover does such a great job with no irritation or discomfort.</li>
      <li>Smooth, lotion-like.</li>
      <li>The eye makeup remover is gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite mascara remover!</li>
      <li>This remover takes off even the most stubborn mascara with ease, and it is very gentle on the eye.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super gentle and very quick to use!</li>
      <li>and I never have to worry about it getting in my eyes since it seems to be safe and so gentle.</li>
      <li>Love it because it&#x27;s not greasy but takes my mascara and eyeliner off completely with a tissue.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need too much to do the job of taking off your makeup and it leaves a nice soft feeling when you are done.</li>
      <li>For the money and softness, it is well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>it is very gentle.</li>
      <li>Ive have tried many different eye makeup removers.  </li>
      <li>but if I had purchased this at a store, I would have done exactly that.  </li>
      <li>I will certainly recommend it and buy again.  </li>
      <li>I then dabbed a tiny amount of this product on it, and with a quick wipe of a paper towel, wallah!</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>What I do like is that it&#x27;s very gentle--no stinging.</li>
      <li>This also works really well on waterproof mascara and eye liner.</li>
      <li>This works VERY WELL and does NOT get that film in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It was getting hard to find my previous favorite mascara remover, and most of them don&#x27;t work well, or they create a \\&quot;film\\&quot; on my eyes.  </li>
      <li>After squeezing out a little dot on my finger, I&#x27;d rub my eye lids gently using a circular motion and wipe it clean with a cotton pad.</li>
      <li>No matter how heavy I have the makeup caked on or however strong the waterproof is.</li>
      <li>Recently, I tried a couple of drug store brands (just out of last minute-convenience) and both brands (that were marked as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;) burned and irritated my eyes--and really didn&#x27;t take my mascara off.</li>
      <li>I recommend buying at least one more than you think you need.</li>
      <li>The price was right, but the product turned out to be a white milky lotion, - I thought the white was just the container.  </li>
      <li>This is the first lotion remover I&#x27;ve tried, and I think I&#x27;m partial to a liquid.</li>
      <li>This Avon product not only removes my makeup but also leaves the skin around the eyes feeling soft and not wrinkly.  </li>

<li> This eye makeup is my wife&#x27;s favorite and since we moved we have been unable to find an &amp;#34;Avon Lady&amp;#34;!</li>

<li> It does leave a little risidual goop in your eyes</li>
<li> I have been using this for a few years now.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and it never disappoints.</li>
<li> It has always removed my eye makeup without tugging or leaving oil behind.</li>
<li> I was so stupid</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes blurry which I hate.</li>

    <li> The eye makeup remover is gentle but effective. I use it in the shower. It is lotion-y, so you can massage it over your eyes. I wish it came in a larger volume even though a little bit of it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It has always removed my eye makeup without tugging or leaving oil behind. No matter how heavy I have the makeup caked on or however strong the waterproof is. Smooth, lotion-like. Does not irritate skin and does not hurt if you get it in your eyes. I found it best if you lightly moisten your cotton pad/ball first before adding this product to prevent peices of the cotton from sticking to your lashes. That is Not a defect of this product, just a suggestion. Avon, please dont ever stop making this product!</li>
    <li> Wish they&#x27;d take down that $.0l price down.  I was so stupid I thought it was $01 Cent.  I purchased 2 bottles and they charged me $5.00 for each bottle for Shipping/Handling.  Cost for two bottles of  Avon eye makeup remover $10.02.      Good stuff one or two sweeps and the mascara and eye makeup is gonezo.</li>
    <li> A little bit of this goes a long way. After squeezing out a little dot on my finger, I&#x27;d rub my eye lids gently using a circular motion and wipe it clean with a cotton pad. This also works really well on waterproof mascara and eye liner.</li>

    <li> The price was right, but the product turned out to be a white milky lotion, - I thought the white was just the container.  I used it as directed, but it left a residue in my eye.  Didn&#x27;t burn, but I had to blink quite a few times to clear my eye.  Not what I wanted.  It&#x27;s not worth returning but if I had purchased this at a store, I would have done exactly that.  Learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite eye makeup remover for more than a year, I like that it is creamy but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and take off all the makeup. Too bad they have it only available in this size.</li>
    <li> This remover takes off even the most stubborn mascara with ease, and it is very gentle on the eye. I just rub a little bit on my eyelids and lashes and then wipe with a damp cotton ball. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product today and immediately wanted to test my skepticism. I took my darkest black eyeliner and put it all over the back of my hand. I then dabbed a tiny amount of this product on it, and with a quick wipe of a paper towel, wallah! Like I never put any eyeliner on it. Very pleased :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and just love it.  Without a doubt, the best makeup remover out there, hands down!</li>

    <li> I have been using this for a few years now. Recently, I tried a couple of drug store brands (just out of last minute-convenience) and both brands (that were marked as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;) burned and irritated my eyes--and really didn&#x27;t take my mascara off. I will never stray again. Avon Moisture Effective Eye Makeup Remover Lotion is absolutely perfect. It&#x27;s super gentle and very quick to use!</li>
    <li> but it arrived with no cap.  It was sealed but as soon as you open it, you&#x27;re left with an open bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does not make my eyes sting like most eye makeup removers-- it is very gentle. The eye makeup comes off easily. It would be great if this product came in larger sizes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and it never disappoints. It goes on smoothly and I never have to worry about it getting in my eyes since it seems to be safe and so gentle.

    <li> Like the product, don&#x27;t love it. This is the first lotion remover I&#x27;ve tried, and I think I&#x27;m partial to a liquid. It removes most of my waterproof mascara, but there&#x27;s a bit more residue than I&#x27;m used to. What I do like is that it&#x27;s very gentle--no stinging. Definitely recommend following the direction that you use a damp cotton ball to apply. Using a dry one just doesn&#x27;t cut it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Everything else makes my eyes burn and/or skin red.  This Avon product not only removes my makeup but also leaves the skin around the eyes feeling soft and not wrinkly.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have to scrub to get the make up off.  I had a lotion based remover from sephora so thought I would try this, but just does not work well.  Get Mary Kay instead!</li>
    <li> Ive have tried many different eye makeup removers.  What I like about this one is that it&#x27;s not oily.  It makes taking the the makeup off less messy.</li>
    <li> I really like it.It was a good price and it works great.It takes the makeup off easily without rubbing you eyes out.Will get again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years to remove my eye makeup at the end of the day, and it&#x27;s gentle on the eyes and very effective at removing even the most stubborn mascara. I recommend buying at least one more than you think you need.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup is my wife&#x27;s favorite and since we moved we have been unable to find an &amp;#34;Avon Lady&amp;#34;! So happy to have found this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I saw all the good reviews and decided to purchase three bottles. I do not like it at all. By the time I rub off all my eye make up, the product is swimming in my eye. If I shut my eyes really tight, it doesn&#x27;t get all the make up but if I don&#x27;t shut my eye all the way it gets into my eye. I regret buying this product</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover does such a great job with no irritation or discomfort. Once I found it I have never even attempted using another brand.</li>
    <li> Better to use with a tissue to wipe off.  I&#x27;ve had better solutions, but this is fine.  Creamy type of lotion.</li>
</ol>
