    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> I bought it to my wife as a present. She likes the scent and the name on the box. I like the scent as well</li>
    <li> I used to wear Gucci Rush all the time and got many complements. It seems to work with my chemistry. It&#x27;s a good winter scent although I wear it whenever I feel the mood strikes me.  It&#x27;s not a light or airy scent so not for everyone but if you like warm, rich, spicey fragrances, this is the one. I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s still available online.</li>
    <li> a Gucci Rush Woman;} Oh I am still Loving the scents of White Floral um love it, Patchouli yes love this one a lot, Aromatic this one is just what the name and the aroma says and oh my how I love it, Vanilla is a Big FAVorite of mine and I Love me some Vanilla this one is sooo loved, next is Fruity &amp; floral loving it, loving them all together,  Gucci Rush has the scents to fit all of my moods!</li>
    <li> This is one of most favorite colognes. It smells great and the price is tolerable. I thought I&#x27;d lost it for sure when mine ran out then I remembered the internet !!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell the same</li>
    <li> rica fragancia , me encanta</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume (5 stars) but the packaging leaves much to be desired (1 star). Almost seems as if they are placing a sample sized tube in bigger packaging to make it look substantial. I have to pump the spray several times every time to make anything come out. Very disappointed in an otherwise wonderful scent. One ounce should look like one ounce.</li>
    <li> Probably the greatest smelling perfume EVER!!!</li>
    <li> Was interesting in purchasing the body cream but not able to find anywhere so I decided to give the Eau De Toilette try again.  I have always loved the scent.  Wish I ordered the larger size instead. The delivery was quick and packaging was excellent.</li>
    <li> This product lamantablente neck and made me get me a refund. I had to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy.    I first encountered this fragrance when I was interning at a creative ad agency in high school. I was flipping through magazines to get inspiration for a project.   One ad in particular, and I still remember it vividly, albeit as vivid as an ad that is all red can be.   It was a very attractive woman on the dance floor,  the photo was edited to be in shades of red.  The ad just screamed sex.    And as a teenage boy at the time, and well, to be honest, not any less so now, I was intrigued.  I flipped open the sample fragrance tab, and oh my goodness.  The scent was unique.  And if the olfactory senses could put together words, it would say &amp;#34;sexy, mysterious, classy&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t encounter women who wear this fragrance very often.  And when I do, I just feel the need to make conversation and feel every need to break down her veil of mystery.  And every time, I would get shot down.... but hey, I guess it stayed true to the classy, sexy, and unobtainable qualities of the perfume.</li>
    <li> Awesome....simple as that</li>
    <li> Of course perfumes are very individulistic, but this perfume has been a favorite of my wife&#x27;s for years and it continues to be.  And of course it is not cheap!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product.  Some say its for an older women, 50+ and at times I do have to agree... watch the size before you order.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Mom who raved on and on about how good it smelled. After seeing how expensive it was in dept stores, amazon.com had the 1 oz for a great price. When it arrived, I sneaked a spray and smell and it was delicious! I bought one for myself the next day.</li>
    <li> I am so picky and dislike most fragrances for one reason or another. Discovered this years ago. Fell in love with it. To me is smells so delicious, like candy. It&#x27;s divine. So happy to find it again on Amazon. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> it came with bad condition</li>
    <li> This is one of Gucci&#x27;s fragrances that is not available in many stores.  I am happy to say that I know I can get it through Amazon.</li>
