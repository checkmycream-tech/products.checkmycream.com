    <li> Brushes work great, but when I opened the package it smelled strongly like fresh paint. Although the the brushes are nice the fumes are STRONG and don&#x27;t seem to fade.</li>
    <li> I really like this set. The brushes are very soft!!</li>

    <li> Arrived way earlier than expected which was a huge plus. They are a very good quality for the price. I use them everyday without any problems. I&#x27;ll definitely order more in the future!</li>
    <li> i LOVE the brushes but..... mine has a manufacturing issues the brushes are separating from the metal pieces but i&#x27;m just gonna hot glue them because the brush pick up so much pigment my brushes a&#x27;rnt shedding on the bright side</li>
    <li> These seem like good brushes. I got them sooner than expected and I am excited to use them. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars, because once I opened the package there was a strong chemical smell. Then I sprayed some daily brush cleaner that I had and the smell was gone. Another con, is that some of the brushes look the same &amp; don&#x27;t know which is which. But over all they are super soft and I recommend you purchase these brushes! :)</li>
    <li> One of the brushes broke off of the handle, but they were really soft and there was minimum shedding! Pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I just recieved ny brushes today and I&#x27;m surprised they are thick soft and very pretty I love them you cannot go wrong with these brushes especially for the price!I will order more!</li>
    <li> Real brushes that don&#x27;t shed! I loved them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I use them to highlight &amp; contour everyday! So soft &amp; amazing quality. Fast shipping &amp;&amp; great seller!</li>
    <li> They are so soft I just love my brushes💕 I would recommend them! Good price for the quality of the brushes &amp; also I got them way before the expected shipping date.</li>
    <li> Several of the brushes broke within a week of buying them. I constantly have to screw the top of the brushes to the ends with every use. Not worth the money even though they were inexpensive.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The brushes are awesome for the price. They&#x27;re so soft and from what I&#x27;ve used them for so far, they work pretty damn well. As others have said, there is a strong smell to them but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed with a good washing. I would definitely recommend buying these instead of laying down some serious cash on high end brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they came about two weeks before the expected delivery date, which was pleasantly surprising.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these brushes.</li>
    <li> good material for the price, it does have a very strong chemical smell, but after you wash it with shampoo it&#x27;s ok, very smooth.</li>
    <li> This product came really fast ....they are very soft and fluffy. Buy them !! U won&#x27;t regret it trust me I love makeup like my second child I wouldn&#x27;t lie to you .....I&#x27;m a real customer and was not paid to write this review . I plan to use the brushes tomow when my makeup from beautylish comes....will update. But realm great brushes!</li>
    <li> the product looks very good but the use of it isn&#x27;t so much. the brush is so dense that when you put powder of foundation of it, it will cling and not come out. also when you first get it it has a stink</li>
    <li> I truly recommend these brushes for someone who don&#x27;t want to spend too much money  in high-quality brushes I think these are very very nice &amp; soft brushes for the prize and they&#x27;ve really do a good job, ever since I got them I can&#x27;t stop using them I love them! You can use the for foundation and powders.</li>
    <li> Life changing. These brushes are amazing</li>
    <li> One of them broke, but it was fixable. Good quality and very soft.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best brushes that I have ever used.  They are so soft and durable.  I have not had any bristles fall out and that is amazing to me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected! love them</li>
    <li> best purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon so far. The quality is great. So in love</li>
    <li> Have only tried the brushes a few times but I really like them! They feel great on the skin</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING LOVE THEM 😇💘</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for the price! Mine arrived very quickly and were packaged very well. Each brush was individually wrapped. The handles feel sturdy, the bristles are unbelievably soft and the brushes have a nice appearance– they look much more expensive than they are. The only downsides to these brushes are 1) The brushes smelled of paint when they arrived. However, I suggest buying a daily brush cleaner (elf has one for cheap) and to spritz the brushes down before use so that they&#x27;ll smell nice. That&#x27;s what I did with mine and they smell pleasant now. 2) One of mine is shredding like crazy (see picture) Luckily, none of the other brushes seem to have that issue. All in all, I still give these brushes five stars simply because you can&#x27;t get brushes like these for this price anywhere else. I highly suggest buying some to anyone who is hesitant!</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> DONT BUY THEY THEY&#x27;RE CHEAP</li>
