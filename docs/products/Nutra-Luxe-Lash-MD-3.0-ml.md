    <li> Lashes get long but not thick.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I stopped using it for about a year and have been so sorry I did!  You have to use every day forever(like face cream) but it&#x27;s worth in eyelashes and eyebrows grow like crazy.</li>
    <li> Be patient with this product. It takes a while to see good results. I use once a day at bedtime and my lashes are longer and thicker than they have ever been. It took almost 2 months for me to start noticing the length. My lashes are also darker. Good value.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product. I am shocked on how well it works. my lashes are longer, thicker and fuller!! love my new eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> Great product,  takes a while, but worth the wait!!!!</li>
    <li> It really works. I have tried so many that were somewhat cheaper and Im comming back to this one. It does make your eyes red  at the beginning more than later. But it goes away. For me, it is totally worth it. Everyone ask me if I have fake eyelashes because they are very very long!&lt;br /&gt;wait a week you ll see results like no other. I have tried several, like rapidlash and others that claim to work but they actually made &#x27;em worst.&lt;br /&gt;I would not trade this product. They should come up with some kind of eyedrop that stop the redness tho.&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2-3 times a week and when they get as long as I want just every other week. Works and the 3ml tube last for eeever!.</li>
    <li> Of all the eyelash/brow serums I&#x27;ve used over the years this one is by far the best!</li>
    <li> only a very slight irritation... I think it is working... slow but working</li>
    <li> Works but you have to use it for at least a month or so to see results</li>
    <li> Read a lot of reviews before purchasing and was skeptical. However a girl I work with uses this product and her lashes are crazy long. So I tried the product &amp; I LOVE IT!! I am a redhead with blonde eyelashes so it&#x27;s hard to tell the difference until I wear mascara, but when I do, WOW! Took about 2 1/2 months of using every night before bed to notice a difference. Now I use NutraLuxe every other or every third night for maintenance. My lashes are long and somewhat thicker. I recommend this product. but be diligent when buying and make sure it is the real deal. There are several fake brands on the market. NUTRALUXE MD should be all capital letters on box &amp; tubing.</li>
    <li> This product. I have never used a prescription lash product, but I think this works great!</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite products. Have passed it to family and friends. Well priced and extremely effective. Love it.</li>
    <li> Best product!People ask me how do I get my lashes so long.I am 56 and just using mascara just doesn&#x27;t  work!You will see a difference  after a few weeks.The price is so much less on amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> It really makes your eyelashes noticeably longer but if you get it in your eyes your eyes turn blood shot for a while</li>
    <li> My lashes are growing and I have been using it for about a week and a half...maybe two. I can see the difference when I put my mascara on for sure. I gave it a 4 star only because it did cause me some eye redness. I used it at night before I went to bed and woke up with bloodshot eyes...lasted the day. So, I decided to apply in the morning before I put my mascara on and it stopped the redness. You have to wait for it to dry before applying your mascara.</li>
    <li> I think I have had it a little over a month, and still haven&#x27;t seen much change. Hopefully it will start really working.</li>
