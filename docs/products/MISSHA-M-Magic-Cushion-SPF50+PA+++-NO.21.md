      <li>; however, M Magic Cushion is the best.</li>
      <li>i love this product its reall works and its flawless look when i used this everyday&lt;</li>
      <li>, the package comes with one cushion and 2 refill cushions, so it&#x27;s a really good buy for the price.</li>
      <li>I really love this one!</li>
      <li>It covers blemishes and makes me have a more even skin tone!</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love this product its really good</li>
      <li>this one is good :)</li>
      <li>It is very easy to over apply and to look caky.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing and has a very light scent that does disappear</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re wavering about trying it, and you have fair to light skin, I think you should go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a nice case better than innisfree</li>
      <li>cheap, good coverage than most cushions</li>
      <li>I love this foundation, it is very easy to apply and gives a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>it looks very light and neutral.</li>
      <li>This cushion makes your skin look so beautiful and vibrant and just glow</li>
      <li>But Better CC Cream</li>
      <li>contain to make more moisturizing benefits.</li>
      <li>product is very easy and smooth to apply.</li>
      <li>I would say the color is too white for me but the cushion foundation itself is very good</li>
      <li>so now I know I fit 23 more than 21.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply and reapply.</li>
      <li>I opened up the compact it came in, which is cute in itself, and the product was incredibly orange and DARK.</li>
      <li>It feels light on the skin even in 90F, 52 percent humidity weather (as the picture shows).</li>
      <li>but it is too light for my skin</li>
      <li>Will upload the pictures when I&#x27;m free</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and covers well with every stroke.</li>
      <li>It spreads over the face incredibly smoothly after I use a primer.</li>
      <li>but it is tricky to apply make sure to dampen the cushion first</li>
      <li>I was excited to try a cushion</li>
      <li>Also, it seemed to run out quickly.</li>
      <li>I love that it stays on most of the day and that it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>For me personally, i don&#x27;t even need to reapply because coverage is amazing</li>
      <li>At first, I thought it was a shade or two too dark and better for those with warm undertones</li>
      <li>If you look at the photo they provide of the model with the product on - who is very light skinned like me - you&#x27;d think your product would do the same thing.</li>
      <li>The color really matches me!</li>
      <li>Its too dewy.maybe its too hot now.</li>
      <li>This is my first bb cushion and now I know what&#x27;s the hype about it.</li>
      <li>this product its so pretty look</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll melt off your face, pretty much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just what I expected, enjoyed it very much.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply without need of finishing powder (I just spritz some Urban Decay setting spray for all my makeup).</li>
      <li>I already used two packeges and now ordering new one with refiel!!</li>
      <li>I really like this cushion.</li>
      <li>It is unclear from the product description and reviews, but there are NO REFILLS with this BB cushion unlike most of the other cushions that are sold.</li>
      <li>the product is better than other brands.</li>
      <li>It is true to skin tone with no orange or outrageously yellow undertones.</li>
      <li>Good idea, but not good.</li>
      <li>I really like this so far, but I did notice that if I don&#x27;t use a primer, it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well -</li>
      <li>Searching for something with high protection from the sun and not melting in summer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>have cool undertones and as long as I don&#x27;t layer it with another tinted cream, it works well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it was last all day despite the hot ( almost 95▪f).</li>
      <li>If you have cool undertones, be careful about what you layer underneath.</li>
      <li>Kind of dry and heavy.</li>
      <li>At least one or more of the reviews for the product lead me to believe it would include refills.</li>
      <li>The compact is a sponge that when pressed on exudes the soft cream.</li>
      <li>For color comparison, I&#x27;m a Lancome Ivory 110, a Bare Minerals R110/R150 and this product was ever so slightly too yellow and a bit dark for me, but with blending, it matched just fine.</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t had it long, but I would guess it will need a few touch-ups during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> It is just like the Amore Pacific IOPE Air Cushion Sunblock, but for much less.</li>
<li> In my quest to find the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of foundations, I&#x27;ve wasted a bunch of money trying drugstore classics to It</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no more blending foundation to match neck color.</li>
<li> The amount of product is so little!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m quite sad because I thought I might find my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; pale skin foundation.</li>
<li> Coverage was not great.</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed in this.</li>

    <li> I will get this again. the product is better than other brands.</li>
    <li> totally love it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> In my quest to find the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of foundations, I&#x27;ve wasted a bunch of money trying drugstore classics to It Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC Cream; however, M Magic Cushion is the best. It is true to skin tone with no orange or outrageously yellow undertones. There&#x27;s no more blending foundation to match neck color. Easy to apply without need of finishing powder (I just spritz some Urban Decay setting spray for all my makeup). It feels light on the skin even in 90F, 52 percent humidity weather (as the picture shows). It has ingredients to protect you from the sun and nourish your skin&#x27;s appearance. It is just like the Amore Pacific IOPE Air Cushion Sunblock, but for much less. I purchased color no. 21 and this matches Amore Pacific IOPE in C21.</li>
    <li> just like other bb cushions i&#x27;ve tried. this one is good :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected, enjoyed it very much. If you ask me if any improvement for this product.  I would like to have the color even lighter, and also increasing water- contain to make more moisturizing benefits.</li>
    <li> i love this product its reall works and its flawless look when i used this everyday&lt;br /&gt;i love this product its really good&lt;br /&gt;i used missha bb cream and this product its so pretty look</li>
    <li> This is my first bb cushion and now I know what&#x27;s the hype about it. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and reapply. For me personally, i don&#x27;t even need to reapply because coverage is amazing and it stays on. It&#x27;s WAY cheaper than any other bb cushion, but it works just like any other high end product.</li>
    <li> I really love this one! The color really matches me! Consider to buy it again!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try a cushion but I&#x27;m not that impressed.  It is very easy to over apply and to look caky.  I&#x27;ve already ditched it and gone back to my regular BB.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed in this. I opened up the compact it came in, which is cute in itself, and the product was incredibly orange and DARK. If you look in the photo at No.21 it looks very light and neutral. I applied the product to my face and it came off as expected, really yellow and darker than one would think. I&#x27;m quite sad because I thought I might find my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; pale skin foundation. If you look at the photo they provide of the model with the product on - who is very light skinned like me - you&#x27;d think your product would do the same thing. It claims to be whitening, which makes me shake my head. This is so yellow beyond repair, there&#x27;s no way I can ever use it - even if I&#x27;m tanned. Good idea, but not good. Imo.</li>
    <li> This cushion makes your skin look so beautiful and vibrant and just glow it&#x27;s amazing and has a very light scent that does disappear I do recommend this but it is tricky to apply make sure to dampen the cushion first</li>
    <li> It is unclear from the product description and reviews, but there are NO REFILLS with this BB cushion unlike most of the other cushions that are sold. At least one or more of the reviews for the product lead me to believe it would include refills.</li>
    <li> I would say the color is too white for me but the cushion foundation itself is very good</li>
    <li> If you have cool undertones, be careful about what you layer underneath. At first, I thought it was a shade or two too dark and better for those with warm undertones but it was actually layering it over my CC Cream from Etude House that caused the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cool undertones and as long as I don&#x27;t layer it with another tinted cream, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very easy and smooth to apply. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> def not for oily skin. Its too dewy.maybe its too hot now. I can not use it. It starts melting on my skin when i go out. Will try in winterr. Searching for something with high protection from the sun and not melting in summer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello,whant to update my rewiev!! I am absolutly in love with this product!!! Now weather is colder so it stays on place. Corrects color, gives a glow and in 30 minutes after applying adopts to your skin like you wear nothing!!! The only thing that i dont like is that it runs out so quicklyy!!! The amount of product is so little!! I already used two packeges and now ordering new one with refiel!! I loke to wear it even if i stay home and not going out!! I recomend it!!</li>
    <li> Very good stuff, it controls oil. I used it when I went camping last week and it was last all day despite the hot ( almost 95▪f). I am very happy. Will upload the pictures when I&#x27;m free</li>
    <li> Coverage was not great. Also, it seemed to run out quickly.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! The compact is a sponge that when pressed on exudes the soft cream. It spreads over the face incredibly smoothly after I use a primer. I love that it stays on most of the day and that it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It covers blemishes and makes me have a more even skin tone!</li>
    <li> No real coverage made me kinda oily (combo-t zone oiliness)</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation I have ever bought. Goes on smoothly and covers well with every stroke. Color is perfect for my fair skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation, it is very easy to apply and gives a healthy glow. It doesn&#x27;t give me dry patches on my skin but I definitely do not recommend this foundation for anyone with oily skin. It&#x27;ll melt off your face, pretty much. I use powder with mine and it stays on all day. I bought this color but it is too light for my skin so now I know I fit 23 more than 21.</li>
    <li> cheap, good coverage than most cushions but it is matte and I dont like it so I returned it. It has a nice case better than innisfree I was so impressed</li>
    <li> I really like this so far, but I did notice that if I don&#x27;t use a primer, it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well - it literally starts to melt off my face.</li>
    <li> I really like this cushion. For color comparison, I&#x27;m a Lancome Ivory 110, a Bare Minerals R110/R150 and this product was ever so slightly too yellow and a bit dark for me, but with blending, it matched just fine. It leaves a dewy, youthful finish (which is not overwhelming/too shiny, but YMMV, as I have mostly dry skin). I haven&#x27;t had it long, but I would guess it will need a few touch-ups during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the package comes with one cushion and 2 refill cushions, so it&#x27;s a really good buy for the price. If you&#x27;re wavering about trying it, and you have fair to light skin, I think you should go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First heard about it after seeing it recommended on /r/AsianBeauty and I definitely recommend it too.</li>
    <li> Kind of dry and heavy.</li>
