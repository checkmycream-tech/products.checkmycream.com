    <li> I was charged the same amount for the 8.5 oz container that I previously  paid for the 33.8 oz container.  My fault for not noticing but I won&#x27;t order from this company again.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for years and though the company has changed hands, the products are still excellent.</li>
    <li> Great product (&amp; price!)</li>
    <li> I have used Pureology products for about 8 years and would be hard-pressed to use any other product.  I have colored my hair for 17 years and this shampoo does help tremendously with dryness and the frizzes.  The conditioner seals the cuticle of the hair to prevent that wire-brush look.</li>
    <li> Great product for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for colored hair. A little &amp;#34;dab will do ya&amp;#34; as it is uses such great product you don&#x27;t need a lot when washing your hair. The product always come in a well packed bubble wrap and it is always less expensive than what you would buy at the salon.</li>
    <li> Love pureolgy, smells great, makes my hair very touchable and soft. Seller sent pretty quick. The price was good compared to what you would pay at a store.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is fine. The conditioner does its job well, but the smell is noxious (like menthol or medicated shampoo).</li>
    <li> I am a blonde who has used  L&#x27;Oreal &amp;#34;shampoo in color&amp;#34; for many years.  Pureology is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever found! It is even better than the brand my hair stylist uses.  Yes, It is pricey but worth it! Incidentally, I have long hair and a little dab is enough. You don&#x27;t need to lather the shampoo twice, once is just fine but let it stay on your hair for about 2 or 3 minutes before rinsing. My hair is so silky. It shines! . I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.  I purchased it through Tempt Beauty on Amazon. They sent it priority mail and I got it in two days!  I am very happy</li>
    <li> Am I the only person who thinks that the shampoo smells like dog, flea medicated shampoo?!? It&#x27;s gross. My hair looks and feels magnificent though.</li>
    <li> Great product for my dry color treated hair. Very smoothing.</li>
    <li> your hair will love it</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner for fine dry chemically highlighted hair. The conditioner has a minty tingle - love it.  The shampoo has a lovely scent and doesn&#x27;t strip.</li>
    <li> I swear by this shampoo. I have super fine hair and this does not weigh it down at all. My hair also isn&#x27;t as damaged anymore and it keeps color long.&lt;br /&gt;Even good for non-colored hair</li>
    <li> Terrific product. My wife loves it.  Really gives her hair body and lustre.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase sulfate-free shampoo after getting a keratin treatment and this product was great. It has a bit of an earthy smell, but it still makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I have naturally wavy hair that is hard to style. This set softens my hair and gives it lift to make it easier to style. And I love the tingly feeling from the condition. If you don&#x27;t like menthol, the conditioner is not for you.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. My only complaint is the price for these small bottles. I checked my salon and for this price I could have got cover the size</li>
    <li> Great products and I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for years.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Smells amazing (like you just left the salon) and works good too.  Expensive but worth it for the smell alone.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Leaves my dry, wiry hair soft and manageable. Nothing else has been able to do that, even the really expensive salon stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo. So nice to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 4 years, it leaves my hair healthy soft and shiny, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and what it does for my thick curly hair. I took off 1 star for the smell of the conditioner. It&#x27;s ok to me, but it&#x27;s like a menthol and not as pleasant as other products. But it does a great job! This is my go-to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was great, but the conditioner had real strong herbal smell.</li>
