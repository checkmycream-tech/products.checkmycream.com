<li> This product made my skin look dull to the point that other people noticed.</li>
<li> Since it was a small sample (7 capsules)</li>
<li> at least it moisurizes</li>
<li> all the other beauty product fails.</li>
<li> and my mom was not happy.</li>
<li> I understood there would be at least 7. :(</li>
<li> You will be disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed...</li>

<ol>
    <li> Feels great...love this product!</li>
    <li> This product is not for me came with 7 capsules that were so tiny I wasn&#x27;t able to cover my whole face never mind my neck .These capsules are a cream I didn&#x27;t notice anything special that would make me want to order these again.Waste of money .I will add the seller was great arrived on time that wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> Great Product line!  have been very happy with it so far.  Can see a marked difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Item was received as expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> MIracle in a bottle, works immediately and started removing my wrinkles the second day!</li>
    <li> it was okay I didn&#x27;t seen any change and I used it for a year.</li>
    <li> My wrinkles are instantly &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; away, or at least that is how I describe it. But, it does not last more than a few hours, and I doubt using this long term would ever reach a &amp;#34;lasting&amp;#34; effect. But if you want a quick fix, this works great on crows feet! The beads are very small, and this only comes with 7, but I can make 1 bead last for up to 2-3 uses. (If you use it sparingly) Also, not everyone will see identical results, this rings true with any type of skin product. So, if you&#x27;ve never used these, it&#x27;s a great idea to try a small amount, so you&#x27;re not stuck with buyer&#x27;s remorse and the hassle of trying to return, or throwing into a case with all the other beauty product fails. It works for me so I gave it a perfect score!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> This made my skin soft, but I did not see a reduction in fine lines. Since it was a small sample (7 capsules) I used it for only 7 days - and that may be the issue.</li>
    <li> I got this to help with my puffy eyes, I do not have many wrinkles at the age of 48.&lt;br /&gt;It only comes with 7 of them. ( I did know this) it was creamy and felt nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would not sell only 7 when you buy the other products. They last for 30days and so should this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been buying it from Amazon, I think for a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes around my eyes look and feel. I must say I don&#x27;t have to many wrinkles around my eyes (this could be the reason). My oldest daughter introduced me to the product and I have been using it every since.</li>
    <li> probably a hoax, but we&#x27;ll see. at least it moisurizes</li>
    <li> I order this for 11 bucks plus shipping and when it came in it was a little bity bottle that had 5 little beads. It didn&#x27;t even last a week  and my mom was not happy. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> There are better products...don&#x27;t buy it no more!</li>
    <li> If you use this product, it works.. Not like a miracle but it does make your skin smoother and more radiant.. Love the capsule lotion its like silk, even got extra surprises..Love it!</li>
    <li> Love how it smooths my skin out. Not sure if it actually reverses aging, but it does act as a great primer! Worth the money to try before you commit to the larger size products. will probably buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> D5 IS LINKED TO UTERINE CANCER. MY SISTER USED THIS AND DIED OF OVARIAN CANCER!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great .. I love it ..expectedmore in the bottle ..but guess I shouldve read description better rather than looking at tge picture provided</li>
    <li> This is such a rip off</li>
    <li> There were only 3 of the tiny capsules in the jar. I understood there would be at least 7. :(</li>
    <li> I thought Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty was just alright.  It does feel smooth going on I will say, maybe if I get another jar of the capsules it will build up in my system.</li>
    <li> Product was very irratating, I purchased these, as well as the starter kit. Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I bought a series of these for many weeks. They do not show any change. Don&#x27;t waste your money. You will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that something was in my face since I started to use this product. I guess I have found a great for I have a very sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Worker wonderful...and no one calling requesting you to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love these !I use these along with cindy glow serum and my face look like a million dollars !!! I will never leave home without using this product !! A must have !!</li>
    <li> This product made my skin look dull to the point that other people noticed. I never had a skin problem therefore stopped using and went back to Loreal products and skin is back to normal.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this little jar to see if I noticed a difference.  The capsules had enough in them to cover my entire face and I put the excess on the top of my left hand.  Today was day 7 and I asked my husband if he noticed a difference between my 2 hands.  There was a difference.  The left hand had less fine lines on it.  Husband had no idea that I was doing this!  I bought the bigger jar immediately!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  It really does what it says.  It is so soft going on and keeps my face soooo soft while reducing the crows feet  and laugh lines.  I cannot say enough about this beauty line.  Fast shipping.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far I noticed some difference in my face.  I guess I have found a great product! however I need to wait and keep using it to find out if it works. I have  a very sensitive skin, so I have to alternate days.</li>
