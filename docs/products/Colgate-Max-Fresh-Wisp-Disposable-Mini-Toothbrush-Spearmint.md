<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are really refreshing! They are very, very minty and they are useful to leave around in various places you might not be able to use a traditional toothbrush.  If you hate the minty puck in the middle, I think it is possible to pop it out...</li>
    <li> Carry these in my purse all the time now that I have invisalign.  When dining out, you can do a quick brush and pop your trays back in.</li>
    <li> These are super handy. The price is comparable to in store and it is something I always forget to buy. Definitely gets your teeth cleaner than popping in a piece of gum!</li>
    <li> Fresh breath any time you want/need it. This is a great price too. I wisp everywhere I go. Not only do they freshen my breath, but the pick end further cleans my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to buy these. You probably have horrible halitosis and would likely benefit from these little gems. Be careful though, I have yet to find a support group for this new addiction of mine.</li>
    <li> I love having these, I am running around all day and don&#x27;t have time to brush my teeth in the sink.  These work great to keep my breath fresh and I know that others appreciate my efforts to keep them from passing out from my foul breath.</li>
    <li> Great product but these do not come individually wrapped like most of the other Wisp packages. Because they are not individually wrapped, it makes it hard for them to be easily portable and carried around.  If you are ok with that, these get 5 stars and would be great to have in your car for when you need them. I purchased these based off of other reviews that they are individually sealed because I have Invisalign and always need a way to brush my teeth when I go out for dinner.  I&#x27;m kind of grossed out by putting these bare in my pocket so I&#x27;ll be buying the other Wisps that are packaged differently.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Colgate Wisps!!  These little guys work great when you&#x27;re in a pinch.  You can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s pricing and fantastic service!</li>
    <li> Works very well for cleaning teeth when you are away from the home or office.</li>
    <li> I LOVE WISPS!!  They freshen you up and make your teeth feel so smooth</li>
    <li> Good product for those times when you need a quick refresh and a basin is not available.</li>
    <li> My walmart stopped selling these and I was devastated. I have invisalign and have to brush my teeth after everything I eat or anything I drink that&#x27;s not water. I brush my teeth around 5-6 times a day, and I&#x27;m not always around a sink with water (such as in the car). That&#x27;s when these things really come in handy. They are very refreshing, and with the pick on one end they do a pretty good job of clearing my teeth out to replace my invisalign. They, however are NOTHING like a good brush! When I&#x27;m in a pinch though, they&#x27;re perfect! They were about $5 for 24 of them and I thought that was a great price! They can get kinda pricey.</li>
    <li> When you break down the cost of these, and the hassle of carrying the pouch around, you might as well just carry a toothbrush/floss, and a pack of mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue ball in the middle of the brush is basically a gel capsule filled with a mint liquid. The brush isn&#x27;t that great at getting stuff out of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Tough to find on the shelves, so I ordered them online. Only regret is that they don&#x27;t come in a pack of 365...Great for the after-coffee quick brush.</li>
    <li> thought they might be mini toothbrushes with imbedded toothpaste.  they are just toothpicks with a brush  nothing special if you ask me....</li>
    <li> Great value compared to grocery store pricing!</li>
    <li> Its not individual wrapped,, i thought it is 👎 , I like the individual wrapped</li>
    <li> The new packaging costs less and is easier to carry. The foil was too sharp on the original packaging too. No more bloody fingers!</li>
    <li> I should have checked the ingredient list before I bought these; they have gelatin in them.  That was just an oversight on my part, though.  I&#x27;m giving these things three stars because they just didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
    <li> My favorite mini brush to go! Works better that normal manual brush</li>
    <li> This is great, tiny toothbrush, no rinsing required, now I can brush my teeth after lunch at work !</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I can use them whenever I am.&lt;br /&gt;Not water need.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does not substitute a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> + Excellent to carry a few around when on trips, running to meetings after lunch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Surface area a bit small to do any actual/tangible cleansing</li>
    <li> These things are amazing when you are on the go.</li>
    <li> Love these.  They keep my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Good for on the go if you REALLY need to brush, don&#x27;t live on them.</li>
    <li> We use wisps while camping - they pack small and work great.</li>
    <li> Wow! How convenient and tasty. Not as effective as a toothbrush, but small enough to carry in case of a need when you&#x27;re out. The brush also has a pick on the other end. One flavor was significantly less expensive. Check the prices on the different favors before buying.</li>
    <li> Love the wisps - I keep a bag in my car for mornings when I stop for coffee and I can freshen my breath up before I get to work. They work great to freshen your mouth in a hurry, without a sink, toothbrush, and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Excellent on the go portable toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> Great if your running and kids or you have forgotten to brush...Drop shipped these to camp and they were a hit. Kids use them and toss.</li>
    <li> These were so cheap. I wish they were individually wrapped but It seems like that&#x27;s what increases the price. We will just baggie them in snack size baggies from the dollar store. Good deal!</li>
    <li> Great to keep in the car, or your purse-great on the go!</li>
    <li> These are handy to have around. I keep a few in a small plastic container in my bag, and on the ambulance where I work for those middle of the night or extended runs.</li>
    <li> Love these things, great for camping or to keep in your car for when you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush and toothpaste handy.</li>
    <li> I use them when im traveling or in a picnic some times at work if I take my lunch with me.</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of these things.</li>
    <li> They are small and hard to hold on to.  It is convenient not needing water and easy to carry in my purse.  It tastes OK but I am not sure if it does that much to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> Very convenient in the car when anyone accidentally forgets to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> Small but do the job.  The bristles are not quite as soft or as dense as I would like, but at 4¢ each, what do I expect?  I keep a package of them at my desk to use at lunch and after snacks.  My dentist would be proud.</li>
    <li> Convient mini-tooth brushes are great! The only problem is that they are not individually wrapped, as they are when you buy them in the stores, so I had to place a few in a zip lock to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> These are so helpful.  Freshen your breath, get the stuff out from between your teeth, and give them a brush.  Been sold on the convenience of these since I first found them and continue to use nearly every day.  I&#x27;ve spread the news about these little brushes and have found quite a few others who feel that they are as helpful as I have found them to be.  Give them a try--they are boldly flavored, but I think you will like the results.</li>
    <li> Good product and handy!</li>
    <li> I use them on field problems, you can&#x27;t beat the convenience.</li>
    <li> These are awesome to just keep in my car or purse with me for when I need a little quick refresher.  :)</li>
    <li> These are so cute! I brought them to work and use them for dental &amp;#34;emergencies&amp;#34; such as food stuck in the teeth or post-garlic meetings.  They do a great job.  They are packed loosely in on bag, so they are not something that you would share with others.  But, if you keep the bag closed tightly, they are great for one person.  I love having them in my drawer.</li>
    <li> Nice and compact with a great little brush and toothpick.  I&#x27;m very pleased with these and will order more.</li>
    <li> Really comes in handy when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
    <li> I get these on subscribe and save - I will continue to buy these because they are convenient and do the job in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do not &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have them in my car and lunch bag.  I like the convenience of freshening up after a meal out or mid day.  The brush is stiff, not perfect for the gums, but does seem to clean the teeth.  The other end is pointed perfect for the spinach or seed stuck between the teeth. The tooth paste is refreshing, I like the taste.&lt;br /&gt;These come open in a bag, not individually wrapped.  I would prefer that, but like the price of these better.  If you want to carry one around in your purse, you&#x27;ll need to bag it or wrap it.&lt;br /&gt;I started using these when I walk the Susan G. Komen 3 Day.  We are out on the trail for 20 miles and this was honestly a welcome treat after our lunch.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you give them a try for yourself.  Oh, and my 25 year old son carries these in his glove box, too.</li>
    <li> handy little things if the price is right - and it is.</li>
    <li> I keep these nearby at all times. Good for the purse or for keeping at work when you don&#x27;t want to brush your teeth in the stinky bathroom.</li>
    <li> Work great. Wish they were individually packed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these things! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> You get less of a super fresh feeling after brushing than with actual toothpaste and rinsing.  If there is nothing else, I guess it will do.</li>
    <li> Great to use on the go</li>
    <li> These items are great. They are an easy way to brush your teeth in a hurry or on the road. Not for everyday use, but it is perfect in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;The blue dot has a toothpaste flavored drop and will leave your breath fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Keep in car &amp; in wife&#x27;s purse. So handy for that clean feeling on teeth.</li>
    <li> Like them handy to toss in glove box have when in a rush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of wisp, I&#x27;ve used the ones that are sealed and wrapped individually. It comes in 4, individually sealed and you can just break off one to put in your purse for whenever you may need it. I purchased this because I thought it would be the wisp I buy at Target etc, but it&#x27;s in one bag and all unwrapped/unsealed. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable having to place this in my purse with a napkin to wrap or ziplock, it&#x27;s not like I plan to use this every time, it&#x27;s only for those days when needed. It kind of disgusting that once you put it in your pocket or purse, it&#x27;s exposed to germs and if you don&#x27;t want that, wrap it in ziplock or paper towel? That&#x27;s not so convenient and discreet/handy. Meh...</li>
    <li> Ideal for lazy teenagers with stinky breath.</li>
    <li> The mint blast is terrific for times you may need a mouth/teeth cleaner right before a meeting.</li>
    <li> These are exactly as described.  Great for grabbing to brush your teeth on the go.  I only wish they were individually packaged.</li>
    <li> I love these mini toothbrushes.  I keep them in my car and brush my teeth on the road in between appointments.  I hand them out to the kids.  They are a great go between the regular daily toothbrushing.</li>
    <li> I keep it at my desk at work for the times I drink coffee. It tastes away the coffee breath instantly and leaves your teeth feeling smooth. It also has a toothpick at the end of it to get in those hard to reach spots. They are not bagged individually, but as long as you&#x27;re not dumping dirty hands in there you should be fine. I hand them out to people at work before dentist appointments and I become their hero of the day.</li>
    <li> How great are these!  I keep this pack in the car because we are always eating on the fly and I hate going places with food all stuck up in my teeth.  These work perfectly for cleaning your teeth and freshening your breath.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  Small and easy to use to clean between your teeth after a meal.  There are similar products out there,&lt;br /&gt;but nothing quite like this.  Like the mint flavor too!</li>
    <li> Love these for convenience.</li>
    <li> Love these. Saved me when I was in the hospital and was unable to get out of bed. I also keep a couple in my purse. I am a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I like these. I keep them in my travel bags, purse and around the house. I can find them cheaper in stores, but sometimes it&#x27;s easier to get it here. These are just a quick way to freshen your mouth throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great, but with no individual wrapping on larger size, need to figure out how to carry them around?</li>
    <li> I never find these cheap, and when I do &amp; name brand of Colgate, I snap them up like no tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We fly A LOT, on very very very long trips, from one content to the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from having your toothbrush, these are nice when you run into the restroom &amp; just want to freshen up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They leave your mouth wanting more!  Not because it feels dirty, but because cleanliness never felt so great as it does when you&#x27;re rushing through the airport &amp; want to make sure the coffee breath hasn&#x27;t hit in :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL buy again!</li>
    <li> I drink coffee on the way to work and keep a bag of Wisps in my car so after my coffee i can wisp away my coffee mouth! Im kind of obsessed. no more weight inducing snacking while driving home, either. WISPING is my new favorite habit!</li>
    <li> I have Invisalign and have to brush my teeth at least 10 times a day, and with my husband having braces, we needed a solution that was easier then carrying a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush around; these are perfect! Small enough to carry in a purse, wallet, or leave at work or in the car, and quick and easy to use.  I tried my first one, and for a various reasons you should give your mouth a swish before you use to get chunks of food out. It worked really well to clense the leftover food before I put my Invisalign back in. There is a little pocket in the middle of the plastic brisels the dissolves as you brush leaving a fresh taste in you mouth that is not overwhelming. I purchased six packages and will be back for more! 24 per a pack for a great rate!</li>
    <li> My wife keep these with her all the time. She is called on for meeting at the last second. They help to keep fresh.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my purse and in my glove box in my car, it is healthier than gum and you feel clean like you just brushed your teeth, because you have!</li>
    <li> Not the same as the wisp that come individually packed.</li>
    <li> Love these handy toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I love these little mobile&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrushes, so effortless and easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> I keep them in my purse, my car and my computer bag for travel.  They are good for getting a little bit of something out from between your teeth and for freshening up if you aren&#x27;t at home with your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> An essential for travel- I keep them in my car, desk at work and purse at all times.</li>
    <li> This set did not work as much as expected. I didn&#x27;t feel it cleaned my teeth as much as the other kinds of Colgate wisps.</li>
    <li> I keep these in the car for when my kids tell me they forget to brush their teeth after we&#x27;ve already left the house.  They&#x27;re also good for cleaning around my braces after eating.</li>
    <li> Super convenient. They just work. It&#x27;s like a little toothbrush with toothpaste on it. Can they make one of these with deodorant on it too?</li>
    <li> great for when i&#x27;m driving or on the rig and can&#x27;t get to my toiletries. peppermint taste is good and the pick is great. My Fiancee wants me to bring her a bunch of these when I return to Russia because she loves them also.</li>
    <li> I would get these 5 stars if they came individually wrapped.  They are all just in placed in the package unwrapped.  It will be hard to carry them around now because I need to find some sort of small compact plastic container the put them in.  I would never have ordered them if I would have known they were not individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> Great to toss in your car, purse, or tote!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these for those times she has forgotten to brush her teeth at camp (he cabin has no running water). She trades them with her friends, too. They work fine (you would not want to give up regular brushing, obviously).</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Love these, they&#x27;re a lifesaver when there is no toothbrush available.  Totallt worth it.  Leaves your breath fresh and your teeth clean and free of debris.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush head small and hard to use for front of teeth.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I knocked one star off because I feel they are a little bit expensive, but a good investment to be assured of fresh breath and a healthy mouth, even away from home and away from a sink.  I like that they have a brush and a toothpick end, and the fresh gel in the brush isn&#x27;t too strong at all.  I carry one on my purse and keep a couple in my car and desk drawers.  A great idea!</li>
    <li> These cute, little, disposable brushes seemed like a great idea so I decided to try it out. Turns out, these little toothbrushes are a lifesaver! It&#x27;s great for travel so that your not carrying around a big wet toothbrush with its bulky toothpaste to pair with. Also, it&#x27;s great to have around when you forgot to brush your teeth. Unlike using a mint, it REALLY feels like it&#x27;s cleaning your mouth without that nasty, stinky breath to follow. Those who complained that the little bead in the middle didn&#x27;t burst, they didn&#x27;t use it right. You need to press firmly into your teeth (preferably your front teeth) and slowly it WILL burst and it WILL completely dissolve.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to be able to find these on-line!  I used to be able to find them in local pharmacies but no longer.  These are perfect for anyone anal-retentive about your oral health or your breath.  They are tiny and fit anywhere - the car, your purse, your pocket.  They have a pick on one end and a tiny toothbrush on the other with a hard-ish bead of minty freshness!  And you can recycle them!</li>
    <li> Great for camping with kids. I use these to avoid the hassles and hygiene issues of having to schlep kid&#x27;s toothbrushes on camping trips. For some reason, they also find them a novelty. As a dad, it avoids me having to find and inevitably forget or lose, my kid&#x27;s toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Great for travel. Keep one in your purse or brief case for unexpected events.</li>
    <li> Flavor was a bit strong, but they did exactly what you expect. It may be because I really don&#x27;t care for peppermint.... I am a spearmint girl, but this what was on special at the time. Great for freshening up on the run.</li>
    <li> Great for on the go. I keep one pack in my car and one in the office at work. Great to have after meals. Don&#x27;t want to have yuck mouth at work or when going places</li>
    <li> Wonderful for when you&#x27;re on the go,  I use them when traveling and they work well, gets rid of that morning breath!</li>
    <li> These are great for having in your purse or keeping a bag in the car.  They really give you a nice clean feel.  Won&#x27;t replace a regular toothbrush, but it makes your teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase. It was delivered brand new exactly as the one you buy from the store but at half the price. This was definitely a good deal!</li>
    <li> Thanks for doing a great job at getting the stuff to me early you have great prices on your products</li>
    <li> Carry in my car and purse...they are great for touh up for teeth and breath.</li>
    <li> The bag is pretty small, you can easily stick the whole thing in your backpack. They are not individually wrapped, but you could wrap it up with a tissue and carry it with you anywhere.</li>
    <li> Very useful at work or on the go during the day. Makes my breath feel fresh and helps get stuff out of my teeth. I usually use after lunch or before meeting with clients. I would not recommend using this as a replacement to brushing, just a supplement when you are unable to.</li>
    <li> These little brushes are GREAT! Hard to find and amazon has the best price.  They freshen your mouth by releasing just the right amount of toothpaste - great for after lunch.. I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> I love these things! I always have a pack in my purse or car. Works so much better than a mint or gum or even mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I love these so much I put them on a subscribe &amp; save plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started the subscription in late July, the price was $4.99. The shipment I received today was $7.99. I get that prices change, but this seems like a ridiculous price jump for a pretty stock item. I cancelled my subscription.</li>
    <li> Super item to carry as a spare in the car...purse or pocket.  Great for a quick brush after that meal out.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my car and office, such a huge thing to be able to freshen up anytime, anywhere without carrying a toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> A bit light on the amount of toothpaste.  Otherwise, great!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great to use at work or while travelling.</li>
    <li> Love the bag. Used to get these in the cute little plastic packs of four, individually sealed--more expensive and take up more space. By the bagful is way cheaper and requires way less space, not to mention less trash disposal. I keep them in the car and hate to be without them!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the flavor I ordered, but the price is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I keep these amazing little things in my car to brush when I&#x27;ve forgotten to brush or for the kids when we run out of the house without making sure they brushed their teeth. Super handy and they love them!!</li>
    <li> I like the flavor, I got peppermint. They&#x27;re really nice and they really whiten your teeth. The toothpick like end on the other side is handy for getting food out from between your teeth.</li>
    <li> I love these for traveling. Teeth feel cleaner than using an actual toothbrush. Can&#x27;t find these in store&#x27;s anymore! Will be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> With houseguests and sleepovers, I like to keep a basket of extra overnight supplies they might need!  I keep the Colgate Portable Mini-Brushes in my basket and our guests help themselves to fresh breath and clean teeth!  I hate to sound like &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; person, but I also keep a pack in my &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; bag in my car.  With two of my children being asthmatics, we were always caught off guard with emergency trips and inpatient stays in the hospital.  It gives me peace of mind to know that I have enough of my own things to be comfortable in an emergency.&lt;br /&gt;  5 stars in my book! Sure beats the cost of me buying new toothbrushes for my supply kits!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t beat the price, but next time I&#x27;m going to go a different route.  I&#x27;m not really into throw away items.  However, if you like disposable single use toothbrushes, there are much better out there.</li>
    <li> Awesome item!!!! It is awesome to use after eating!!!</li>
    <li> these are a quick and easy solution to being away from home 70%of the day.</li>
    <li> have ordered before....a must have for the job...can&#x27;t get to brush teeth at work...this is the next best thing....</li>
    <li> I use these all the time~ they are wonderful for quick in-between brushings or for a more detailed cleaning anytime.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really brush your teeth with it, better take your regular brush and a small toothpaste with you.</li>
    <li> nice to have along , brush your teeth anytime you need to.</li>
    <li> Disgusting!  These are not individually wrapped! Why would anyone put filthy unwrapped, unsterile things in their mouths? Do not purchase!</li>
    <li> This product is invaluable for ill persons who are having their teeth brushed by an aide or someone else, and would also come in handy for travelers and people who want to give their teeth a quick brushing while away from home.</li>
    <li> Incredible! A flosser on steroids! Keep these in your desk, car, anywhere - they&#x27;ve come in handy many times. A dissolving mint leaves your whole mouth fresh!</li>
    <li> These used to be individually wrapped!  What happened?  I tried to return them.  Also, I was forced to buy something I didn&#x27;t want and this product was my \\&quot;add-on\\&quot;.  Why?  I have bought these before.  We use them in our office for clients.  Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a great product.  Edit: Ordered again and will be ordering more in the future.  This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Used for my dying husband to provide mouth care and it worked well.</li>
    <li> These are the best invention since peanut butter! I use this instead of regular toothbrush, and I brush my teeth after every meal, my dentist says my teeth are healthier than they ever have been, and I carry one with me wherever I go, I grandkids don&#x27;t mind brushing their teeth now I could go on anon. Just go out and buy some for yourself</li>
    <li> Quick travel option for me when I am on the plane.  There is not always a chance to brush properly, so this is a great option to at least get you some fresh breath after a long flight.  Both me and my wife use them, and like them.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for travel, but disappointed that these were not individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> These things are great!  Easy to clean your teeth on the goal.  Wish they were individually wrapped, but they do come in a ziplock bag.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I love these and my kids love these. I keep them in the car now!</li>
    <li> They are just  great and handy at any moment, good flavor, does clean your teeth and disposable without having to rinse off so it is perfect for an &amp;#34;Emergency&amp;#34; or when traveling, the only con is the brush bristles are too soft.</li>
    <li> Handy little brushes with a gentle toothpick on the other end.  Minty breath afterwards.  24 per pack.  Great on-the-go item.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Love these!!  Will purchase again...!</li>
    <li> Really like these for on the go &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; and freshening, but it would be ideal if they were individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> LOVE having these around fro  sleepovers when kids forget their toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> these are purfect for work, the road, or trips. they can be carried into places where full size tooth brushes and toothpaste just are not conveniant. also they come in several flavers.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit how much I love these. I keep some in the car, in my purse, in my desk. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> Handy to have around and carry in your purse. They work well and taste nice and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a trip. They are very fresh tasting and excellent for a quick clean up when your toothbrush and paste aren&#x27;t handy. I keep them in my purse now that I&#x27;m home.</li>
    <li> Great for on the go breath freshening. Didn&#x27;t realize they aren&#x27;t individually packaged, but I probably overlooked that detail.</li>
    <li> super handy loive the flavor - gives fresh breath when ever you are in need</li>
    <li> Love these little guys! Freshen up anytime! I keep a pack at work and in my car.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Hard to find in local stores, especially in this quantity.  Always keep a couple in my purse, and in my car.  Great for camping, and for visitors who forget their toothbrush!</li>
    <li> use them all the time</li>
    <li> I took this on a travel trip to a foreign country where tap water isn&#x27;t drinkable.  They are extremely tiny, so if you are a person with a larger mouth, these are not for you.  The brush is pretty small and the tooth paste portion comes in a ball that is stuck to the middle of the tooth brush which gets crushed when you brush.  I would need atleast 2 to completely brush my teeth.  I would almost just recommend taking your chances with the unsafe water.</li>
    <li> Love the concept! They work great for on the go or if your starting to feel ill and don&#x27;t want to use your regular toothbrush so your sickness doesn&#x27;t ruin your 20$ toothbrush lol. I however didn&#x27;t like the flavor it was a bit strong, but it got the job done!!!!</li>
    <li> These things are fabulous.  I travel about twice per month to the Doctor and it ends up being an all day event.  By the end of the day on the way home, my teeth feel disgusting.  These work!  I bought a travel pack and forgot i Had them.  I&#x27;ve used them twice.  They could not replace regular brushing but they get your teeth clean (not your tongue) when they feel gross and that is my objective.  They also have a nice soft rubbery tip to clean out between teeth!  They are fab!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other versions of these where they are individually wrapped so you carry carry a single anywhere.  These are just 24 unwrapped in a big bag...how is that even remotely useful for the intended purpose?  Easier to carry a toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
