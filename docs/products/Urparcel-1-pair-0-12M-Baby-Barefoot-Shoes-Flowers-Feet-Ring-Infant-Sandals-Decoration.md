    <li> Absolutely adorable! Pretty good quality and easy to put on your baby</li>
    <li> not as shown in picture</li>
    <li> Looked absolutely NOTHING like the knit flowers in the picture.  Had 2 wide straps for the foot.  Gaudy white backing. And the flowers!  They were a scarfy fabric (think somewhat shabby chic, but like 3 inches tall) and very odd looking.  Not cute.  I contacted the seller.  They sent me new ones - exact same thing again.  Now my baby is walking and it&#x27;s fall - too late now.  :(</li>
    <li> Red flowers nothing as expected from the picture, they were disjointed at the edges, very disappointing. Also kind of big for a 3mo baby. But for the price, I&#x27;ll keep them.</li>

    <li> Chose because recommended by relative.  Love the red toe blooms, but the others didn&#x27;t look like they did in the pictures.</li>
    <li> Not at all what the picture was. Also was very big to where the flower swallows my babys foot. Do not waste your time go to hobby lobby and get the same thing.</li>
    <li> They are so adorable.  Will have to order in different colors.</li>
    <li> super cute, but way too big. Bought these like 8 months ago and they are still too loose to use</li>
    <li> China being sarcastic! I opened these and they went right in the trash. They were frayed and looked like pieces of garbage left over from something else. Would say more but it&#x27;s probably inappropriate as they have my info (angry face) KEEP THE CHANGE!</li>
