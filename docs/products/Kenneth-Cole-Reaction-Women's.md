      <li>I hope Kenneth Cole didn&#x27;t discontinue this because it is my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soooooo fresh and captivating.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s fresh, without being too girly or fruity (at all)</li>
      <li>Love the light and fresh fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I am happy to have a new source when I finish the 2 bottles I recently purchased.</li>
      <li>It is a sensual fresh but not over powering scent that lingers which often receives compliments.</li>
      <li>What I love about this perfume is that the scent isn&#x27;t very noticeable unless the person is very close to you.</li>
      <li>This order came sooner than expected, which is always a good thing.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find in stores and this was a great bargain compared to some of the online perfume stores.  </li>
      <li>It was the first time I purchased a Kenneth Cole perfume.</li>
      <li>So its for you and your significant other to enjoy (as well as anyone who hugs you).</li>

      <li>iT&#x27;S JUST VERY HAR TO FIND.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite scent and was sad to find out macys, where i first fell in love with the scent</li>
      <li>I met my now current husband and it holds a special place in my heart.</li>
      <li>Scent is not long lasting, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>

      <li>First off, i received my order earlier then expected :-)</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the high price</li>
      <li>I highly suggest this product.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S A VERY SOFT AROMA.</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t like perfumes that are so strong that people can smell it when sitting next to me, much sitting/standing several feet from me.</li>
      <li>It has a very chic smell, not too dark or too light and stays for a day unlike most of other perfumes which fade off in matter of few hours.</li>
      <li>I love Kenneth Cole Reaction for women-had a hard time finding it.  </li>
      <li>When I found it hard to purchase more bottles this year, a friend told me to check out Amazon.com</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s sexy enough without being too overpowering or heavy.</li>
      <li>Product was delivered exactly as if bought in the store but for much less money.</li>
      <li>This spray may not last the whole day, but it lasts long enough.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely loved this perfume! It was the first time I purchased a Kenneth Cole perfume. I did it to support them after all of the negative publicity they were getting. The only thing I wish was different is that I had bought a much larger size. I could wear this 24/7.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find in stores and this was a great bargain compared to some of the online perfume stores.  It is my favorite scent and was sad to find out macys, where i first fell in love with the scent no longer carries it.  Hope there will still be some when I need  my next bottle.</li>
    <li> I have others, but almost always reach out for this perfume.  It is a sensual fresh but not over powering scent that lingers which often receives compliments. I was wearing it on the night I met my now current husband and it holds a special place in my heart.</li>
    <li> Love it, recommend it</li>
    <li> Love the light and fresh fragrance.  Have used this scent exclusively a few years, my acquaintances associate this fragrance with me.&lt;br /&gt;Makes me feel kind of unique.</li>
    <li> This order came sooner than expected, which is always a good thing. It is unfortunate they discontinued this perfume, but luckily I can always count on Amazon whenever I&#x27;m running low. :) I LOVE the scent. It&#x27;s soooooo fresh and captivating. It&#x27;s one of those smell that leaves you wanting to take another whiff. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I love the fact that it&#x27;s fresh, without being too girly or fruity (at all) and it&#x27;s sexy enough without being too overpowering or heavy. This is one of those perfume you can wear day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I bought this bottle (back in 2003-4), I was a little disappointed the smell didn&#x27;t last long, but when I repurchased it again in 2010, I was proven wrong. This spray may not last the whole day, but it lasts long enough. Even when I try out other perfumes, I find myself coming back to this one. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> First off, i received my order earlier then expected :-) which is always nice. I love the smell of this perfume! Great price for it too. I highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> Oh my God!!! This perfume is to die for. I sprayed 2 times on my clothes and it last all day. Everytime my husband passed he had to stop and sniff me. I sure will reorder!!!</li>
    <li> I love it.. grapefruit, mandarin, orchid, sweet pea, lily of the valley, musk, votive mist, cottonwood and white amber.... Anytime wear, and one of my all time favorites!!!</li>
    <li> Scent is not long lasting, but it&#x27;s ok. It was not what I expected. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Met my girlfriend&#x27;s expectations. She has been looking for years for it since they took it off the shelves at the department stores. Made her very happy when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I receive compliments every time I wear it about how great I smell. Product was delivered exactly as if bought in the store but for much less money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the high price but my daughter loves the scent</li>
    <li> I brought this perfume for my cousin as a gift and she loved it. It was a great buy. It has a nice fragrance making it very good for girls :)</li>
    <li> I started wearing Reaction approx. 2 years ago and truly receive compliments and \\&quot;what are you wearing and where can I get it\\&quot; responses everytime I wear it (which is usually 5 out of 7 days a week). I was drawn to the fragnance because it has a softness in the smell, not overpowering but just enough to get your attention. People tell me that drew them to it also. Reaction is a fragrance you can wear day or night and get the same response.  When I found it hard to purchase more bottles this year, a friend told me to check out Amazon.com and I am happy to have a new source when I finish the 2 bottles I recently purchased.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SMELL AND MY HUSBAND LOVES IN ALSO. IT&#x27;S A VERY SOFT AROMA. iT&#x27;S JUST VERY HAR TO FIND.</li>
    <li> Came o ti e and was perfect</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance and when I ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore! I hope Kenneth Cole didn&#x27;t discontinue this because it is my absolute favorite! There are only 2 other fragrances that I can put in the same category as Reaction and those are &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; (Clinique) and Bombshell (Victoria&#x27;s Secret). I&#x27;m going to have to order from here.</li>
    <li> I really loved the fragrance and my husband too.</li>
    <li> I gave four stars because the box was  very battered, this was a gift and I was very disappointed with the box, but other than that everything else was good.</li>
    <li> Hard to find product. Not in stores anymore. Was very pleased to be able to purchase this item as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s one of my favorite scents. Sometimes perfumes start to smell terrible as the day progresses, but that is not the case with this one. This is a perfume that you can wear for formal events and more casual ones. What I love about this perfume is that the scent isn&#x27;t very noticeable unless the person is very close to you. So its for you and your significant other to enjoy (as well as anyone who hugs you). I personally don&#x27;t like perfumes that are so strong that people can smell it when sitting next to me, much sitting/standing several feet from me. I understand if you prefer it, and if that&#x27;s your thing then this perfume is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love Kenneth Cole Reaction for women-had a hard time finding it.  So glad you stock it. Will buy it from you when I need more.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see that the delivery of the product was so fast! The product was packaged well so there was no damage to the glass bottle whatsoever. I have always been a huge fan of Kenneth Cole reaction perfumes and its one of my favorite! It has a very chic smell, not too dark or too light and stays for a day unlike most of other perfumes which fade off in matter of few hours. Great for work or college or even school! All in all a great product! :)</li>
    <li> I love kc reaction,it has a great smell</li>
