    <li> product was shipped and received on time and met all expectations.  was the best price I found.</li>
    <li> I have had a couple of Braun razors before this and they have lasted at least 5 year without fault.  The rechargeable battery in both just stopped holding a charge.  I like the cordless feature, so I upgraded after battery failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the quality of my other Braun razors and also the design, I chose another Braun to upgrade to. I have tried some other brands, with different cutting styles, in the past, and they just didn&#x27;t cut as well as Braun razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very similar to my older Braun 7526 razor(lasted about 7 years, before the battery died).  There are four main differences though.  First, this razor has a fancier and more elegant look to it.  It has a nice silver exterior and a fancy LCD screen(I barely looked at it).  Secondly, I noticed there are different shaped holes on the foil.  Next, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the speed or quality of cutting my beard, despite the supposed more advanced technology.  Finally, this razor was about twice as much as what I paid for the Braun 7526, about 9 1/2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor broke twice in 2 1/2 years.  The first time it broke, I couldn&#x27;t get the foil, or any other foil, to clip into place.  I sent it in to be fixed under warranty.  They replaced the whole head.  Yesterday, I was shaving and when I tried to turn the razor off, I was surprised to find the switch wouldn&#x27;t turn off!  It&#x27;s out of warranty and I figured that it would probably cost me almost as much as a new razor to have it fixed.  Therefore, I attempted to try and fix it myself.  I took it apart to try to fix it, to no avail.  It&#x27;s too complex and has a lot of small parts.  I don&#x27;t think it is possible to fix, without replacing the switch or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some money and buy this.  It almost identical to the 7526. [[ASIN:B00006L9CA Braun 7680 Syncro Pro Solo Shaver Refurbished]]  There is no difference in the cutting quality, in my opinion, between the two.  The cutter block is exactly the same.  Maybe the newer tech Braun razors cut better, but I doubt it.  I think I&#x27;ll just get the refurbished 7680 that I linked to above.  Maybe I&#x27;ll think about buying another model Braun in the future, but my experience with this model has ruined my trust in Braun quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for a better and faster electric razor and willing to pay for it.  I once spent over $300 for a Grundig razor out of the Sharper Image catalog, back around 1996.  It broke soon after I got it. I don&#x27;t think there has been significant improvement in cutting quality of electric razors in the past decade or more.  There&#x27;s a lot of hype and marketing for the newer razors, but it seems that they aren&#x27;t any better.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is excellent. I highly reccomend this one if you are looking to try one.</li>
    <li> To keep my son from \\&quot;borrowing\\&quot; mine all the time, bought him his own! Great shaver at a great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun electric shavers for almost 20 years now and have been happy with every one - until this one.  The Series 5 has really been a let-down for me.  I&#x27;ve had it now for 10 months.    1)  Most importantly it just does not shave as well as my prior Braun&#x27;s.  I used to be able to shave once every other day with no issues at all.  But with this Braun if I skip a day it&#x27;s a painful undertaking complete with annoying pulls and even cuts.  My previous Braun shavers never had issues getting to though spots but this one flat out can&#x27;t get these (such as the neck line).  Even after a shave with the Series 5 I don&#x27;t feel smooth.    2)  The station is set up so that if you want to charge, you have to use the cleaner.  This is a way for them to ensure that you keep having to buy cleaning cartridges through the life of the razor.  This is annoying and a blatant money grab from Braun - especially considering my previous Braun had the option to charge but not clean.  Note that with the Series 5 you CAN charge but not clean, but you&#x27;ll need to pull out the cleaning cartridge to do so - a needless hassle.    Overall I am very disappointed with this razor and growing impatient with Braun and their attempt to force us to use their cleaning cartridges.</li>
    <li> The Braun Syncro System shavers debuted in the US around the spring of 2000 with the 7000 series. They made quite a splash, looking quite different from the predecessor, the Braun Flex Integral (6000 series).  I bought the 7526 model and used it for about 4 years before moving up to the 8000 Activator series.  The model I actually have is the 8595.  The 8995 is essentially the same model, only renamed with a different model convention (now 5 series instead of Activator system 8000 series).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find the 8595 Activator for less money, get it instead of the 5 series 8995.  The differences from the 8995 are only cosmetic, and minor at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MODELS&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 5 Series line consists of several models: 8975, 8985, and 8995. The top of the line is, naturally, the 8995. I suggest you go to [...] to see the spec comparison, as this site does a good job of showing you the differences. In a nutshell, they ALL have the same motor and cut exactly the same. The differences are in the number of indicators (the 8995 has an LCD screen, while the 8575 and 8585 use LED lights), some additional chrome trim, and the inclusion of the cleaning system (the 8575 does not have it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LCD INDICATOR&lt;br /&gt;I chose the 8995(8595), because I wanted to have the LCD indicator (my prior model--the 7526--did not have one).  The 8995 LCD will show you exactly how much charge you have left, how many minutes until fully charged, how many shaves your shaver has performed, and how many minutes you&#x27;ve spent shaving.  Do you really need to know all this?  Not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD will also tell you how many shaves you&#x27;ve done.  It makes a count after about 1 minute from shut-off.  So, if you shut off the unit for a moment to do something then go back to shaving a minute later, your counter will now have 2 shaves logged.  It&#x27;s not very useful information.  What Braun should really do with the LCD is display a total hours operated counter and then show a warning for changing the foil/cutter once 12 months has been reached (you&#x27;d then have the option to reset the warning).  I don&#x27;t care how many shaves I&#x27;ve taken!  Incidentally, the new 5 series model that replaces the 8995 has done away with the LCD (Braun went back to using just LED indicators--cheaper and they probably realized the LCD is not all that useful anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGING&lt;br /&gt;The unit fully charges in about an hour.  That&#x27;s quick.  And once charged, it goes into a trickle charge mode so there&#x27;s no danger of overcharging.  The voltage control mechanism is very sophisticated and can take a wide range of voltages, worldwide.  Braun perfected these electronics over several decades, so it has to be good.  With models lacking an LCD, a red light will start to flash when the shaver charge is getting low.  At that point, you&#x27;ve got about two shaves left.  That&#x27;s not bad.  So, in essence, once it starts flashing you plug it in after your shaving is done.  A full charge should last about 10 shaves.  Compared to other shavers, this is quite competitive, especially given that it takes only 60 minutes to become fully charged.  If you plug in for a few minutes, you can get about one shave without the cord, if the unit was fully discharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOTOR&lt;br /&gt;The motor is supposed to be one of the fastest on the market.  It does operate well and it&#x27;s relatively quiet compared with previous Braun shaver models.  Braun designed it so that it also vibrates from side to side, essentially providing 4 cutting directions.  In actuality, I do not think the side-to-side is very effective.  I haven&#x27;t changed my shaving stroke patterns and the time to complete my shave is always about the same (5 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTERIOR&lt;br /&gt;The exterior of the 8995 is a sleek satin look silver, and has a very smooth touch.  Braun did away with a lot of the \\&quot;grip pips\\&quot; that were found on previous models, leaving only a few in certain key areas.  I think this was a mistake.  The shaver gripisn&#x27;t quite as good as it used to be--if your hands are wet, you might very well drop the shaver.  And that silver skin is delicate.  Mine dropped into the sink and suffered an abrasion (just a cosmetic issue).  You might notice that there is a new 5 series model out (the 590cc replaces the 8995) which features a very prominent side grip design--this is much better.  But that model is quite a bit more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CASE&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the 8995 comes with a case that holds only the shaver (no cord).  My 8595 came with a hard plastic base and a flimsy plastic hinge that eventually broke off--useless.  My old 7526 came with a faux leather pouch that holds the cord and shaver neatly.  I don&#x27;t know why Braun abandoned it (I now use it for my 8595).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING SYSTEM&lt;br /&gt;I find this device very ingenious, for a variety of reasons. First, it really does clean the shaver well. Second, it isn&#x27;t overbearingly loud. And third, it has indicators to show when cleaning and charging are done. The fourth is revenue. Braun was very clever about this. If men are only going to spend money once every two years on the foil and cutter block, how could they make more money? Well, this cleaning system is the key. If the cleaner is used the way Braun recommends, you end up replacing the cleaning cartridge every month. The smart thing to do is buy the \\&quot;value pack\\&quot;, which brings the cost down to about $5 per cartridge. How do you know when to change it? Well, the cleaning system will tell you. It detects when there is a high amount of particles in the solution, or if the solution is too low to flow through, and will flash the red cartridge light while simply not running until you replace the cartridge. The cleaner unit itself is slightly big (about 7\\&quot; tall x 5\\&quot; round), but smaller than its predecessor (which was 12\\&quot; tall with a flimsy lock that would break). I don&#x27;t recommend bringing the cleaner with you when traveling (but you don&#x27;t really need to clean everyday anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I found a trick that Braun will probably shoot me for.  I have been able to use a single cartridge for 1 full year before replacing. How did I do this? Well first of all, after each shave I dump my \\&quot;whisker debris\\&quot; down the sink, like you would normally do with the Flex Integral. It doesn&#x27;t take long--simply pop off the foil, tap it in the sink, blow on both sides of the cutter block, replace the foil, and you&#x27;re done in 10 seconds. This reduces the number of particles in the cleaning solution. So, why use the cleaning system at all, you may ask? It does do an excellent job of cleaning the cutter block, and whisker dust that is stuck on it and within the head and foil holder. A tedious task, even once or twice a week. When do I use the cleaning system? Well, usually whenever the shaver needs to be recharged. At this point, I take out the cartridge from my drawer, remove the top plugs, and slide it into the cleaner. Then I slide in the shaver and let the cleaner do its work. When the cleaning and charging is done, I remove the cleaning cartridge, reseal it with the plastic plugs, and put it away. This way the solution level does not get low from evaporation! Clever, eh? The only catch is that if you try to charge the shaver while mounted in the cleaner without the cartridge, it will not work. But you can always plug it in directly, without the cleaner. Anyway, that&#x27;s my trick for getting around one this somewhat minor drawback. Some have said it&#x27;s nice to have a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shaver to use each time, but I find the cleaning process works well enough to use once per charge (just dump the whisker debris after each shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPETITION&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s biggest competitor is Norelco, with their triple floating head system that has been their mainstay technology since the 1970&#x27;s.  And it&#x27;s rather surprising that they haven&#x27;t improved it all that much over the course of nearly 40 years.  Although the motor tends to be quieter than Braun, the Norelco cutting action seems to fall a little long.  Plus, the Norelco heads are more expensive to replace.  But you have to give it to Norelco--the Arcitec design looks amazing, more sophisticated than Braun&#x27;s old foil shaver design.  And you can thoroughly rinse out the heads using water, so no bothersome cleaning base (and cleaning solution purchase) is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;If price is no object, get the 8995. Otherwise, I recommend getting the 8985 or previous 8595 if you find it priced low enough.  And don&#x27;t forget the technique for extending the life of yourngle cartridge for 1 full year before replacing. How did I do this?

    <li> Used Braun Flex Control (6550 model) for the past 6 years.  Recently switched to Braun 8995 360 Complete.  What a difference 6 years make in shaving technology!  Best shaver that I have ever owned.  The shave is so close and precise...  Wonder if any shaver can get better than the 8995.  Well worth your money.</li>
    <li> Just to agree with one of the other reviewers, shaving with a blade is almost always better when you really, really, really need a close shave for a really big event (like your wedding or something like that). But for everyday use, my skin is sensitive and can&#x27;t take shaving with a blade that often. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have owned several Brauns in the past and they have been very good, though this is the first one I have owned that cleans itself. As an electric shaver goes, this thing is pretty close to perfection. It is true though, that you need to shave with this for a couple of weeks to see the real benefit of this shaver. It gives me the closest shave with ann electric I&#x27;ve ever had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I resisted getting a self-cleaning shaver because I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary, but it is so very convenient. The shaver always comes out sparkling clean and the cleaning solution leaves a pleasant (but faint) citrus-type scent on the blades. (I don&#x27;t believe it stays long and doesn&#x27;t compete with any fragrance I wear.) I have had this unit for more than a month now and have yet to change the cleaning cartridge and I clean it religously after each shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The hard plastic case is a nice touch for travel purposes. The only small complaint I have is that the footprint of the cleaner is kind of large and its not really the kind of thing that you can use and put away, so you really need to have the counter space for it to stay out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as electric shavers go, I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I don&#x27;t imagine it could get much better than this.</li>
    <li> I have owned my 8595 for about a month. Before I bought this shaver I used to shave with a Sensor Excel razor. First the good news about this Braun. It takes me about a third of the time to shave now as it previously did. I also don&#x27;t risk cutting myself every time I shave. Now the bad news. In a month&#x27;s worth of shaves the quality of the shave has gotten better but it&#x27;s still not very good around the neck area. When I try to get a closer shave around the neck I end up with very irritated skin. Also when I first started shaving with the Braun I was not very careful around my upper lip and I found I would end up with a scraped lip. It didn&#x27;t hurt but it felt like I had chapped lips. I finally figured out what was happening and now keep the shaver from contacting my lip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am still debating whether to keep shaving with my Braun. I love the speed and the convenience but I don&#x27;t like irritating my neck to get a semi-close shave. One last note: If you take the time (less than a minute) to shake the razor stubble out and do a quick brush as recommended in the owner&#x27;s manual, 9 times out of 10 the eco cycle will be selected which saves cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> I have a really tough beard. It cut through with no fuss, and made my face really smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband for Christmas this year.  He is absolutely thrilled with it.  He claims it is the closest shave ever with an electric shaver.  One of the reasons I chose this shaver was the fact that it practically maintains itself.  It alerts you to when it needs cleaning and tests the charge automatically.  After shaving you literally set it and forget it.  My son-in-law had one and loved it as well so I took his advice when chosing this gift.  While the price tag may seem high for an electric, have you looked at the prices of manual razors lately?  This is well worth the money spent.  He is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, who can basically grow a beard in a day.  He has probably tried every other type of razor. The ones with the coils that basically pull the hair out of your face and all sorts of traditonal razors.   &lt;br /&gt;It definitely takes a couple days, maybe even a week or two for your skin to get use to this type of razor.  But once it does, it givs the smoothest and long lasting shave.  And its fast!</li>
    <li> Discussions of shaving preferences sometimes seem like religious warfare, mostly because every face is at least somewhat different from any other face.  That means there&#x27;s really no such thing as a perfect razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for me, this Braun 8995 is very close to perfect.  For many years, I&#x27;ve shaved with a blade-- most recently the Gillette Fusion system-- and I&#x27;ve used a cheap Remington when I travel.  Two things happened:  The price of the Gillette blades has increased sharply with each new model, and my Remington died.  I decided to go with this top-of-the-line Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple of months, I&#x27;m very pleased.  It is clearly a well-engineered machine that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;ve found that my shaves with it are just as close as the shaves I got with the Gillette Fusion.  I suspect that as the years go on, the total cost of shaving with the Braun will actually be less than the Fusion would total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of hints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, don&#x27;t wash your face before you shave with any electric shaver.  Washing causes the beard hairs to swell up, and they don&#x27;t fit well into the tiny slots in the electric razor&#x27;s head.  The razor won&#x27;t be able to shave you very close when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the instructions with the Braun say to run the automatic cleaning cycle every day.  I can&#x27;t detect any performance difference between doing that and cleaning it a couple of times per week.  In addition, the cleaning cartridge will obviously last a lot longer with less frequent cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.  It isn&#x27;t cheap, but it works very well.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and I&#x27;d do it again.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of electric shavers but I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with the quality of a shave compared to a blade until I tried the Braun 8995 360.  As a guy with sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with electric and blade systems.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with this shaver.  The no-hassle cleaning feature is wonderful.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the 8995.</li>
    <li> I am entirely satisfied with this product. Shaving is clean and close.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a blade razor for over 40 years.  Back in the 60&#x27;s I just didn&#x27;t feel an electric shaved as close as a blade and back then they all required cords and a hassle to clean.  For two reason&#x27;s I just now considered using an electric razor.  I have disabilities I can&#x27;t shower every day and soaking my face with a hot wash cloth to soften my beard with water dripping everywhere it became a chore.  Reason number two is razor blade \\&quot; sticker shock!\\&quot;  The price of blades has sky rocketed over the years. Sure blades are better then they use to be but not in proportion to the cost.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m retired and have a lot of time to do research so I started looking for the best electric razor I could find.  I read every review for all the major razor manufactures at Amazon and other web sites.  I came to the conclusion that the Braun model 8995-360 stood out above the rest. The price is high, more than I really wanted to pay. Considering how easy this razor is to maintain I decided to purchase one from Amazon and as usual Amazon shipped it very fast with standard shipping.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Braun razor has exceeded my expectations. Trust me on this one folks I am delighted with the performance of this razor.  For me it shaves as close as a hi tech blade.  I can happily report that I have experienced no irritation I am really surprised  I thought it would take a while for my face to adjust.  The razor is ecologically perfect in my hand medium sized hand.  The on/off switch also controls locking of the head and side burn trimmer. I have always had a problem shaving my upper lip I have a mold required me to be so careful shaving it with a blade. No problem at all with the Braun I lock the head of the razor and shave it in a flash.  I am using Williams Electric Pre Shave before shaving.  It seems to make the razor glide over my skin a little better and again I am getting a really close shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go into the multitude of features this razorhas except to say it is so easy to use. On/off switch on razor and  start cleaning button on the docking station.  That is really all you have to deal with. I shave every other day and clean after each use. The cleaning cartridge last for 30 cycles so the cartridge should last two months.  Amazon has the best price for replacement cartridges and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really expensive to replace them when you consider the hassle they save you cleaning and they lube the head to.  I am so glad I bought this razor. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I really like the 360 Shaver.  I have used many triple header shavers in the past and it normally takes me one half hour to get a close shave.  With this product, I can have a close shave in half the time.  The cleaning mechanism is also nice, although I have not used it for traveling.  I am worried about taking it on a long trip because of the need to use the big cleaner for a thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have this Braun and also the Panasonic arc ES8168. &lt;br /&gt;The Braun is quite heavy and solid with good battery life and giving a reasonable result in about 3 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;I have quite a heavy beard and travel a lot for work so wanted to still feel fresh at the end of a long flight so I tried the Panasonic,  it is quite a bit closer and faster too. &lt;br /&gt;Compare the reviews of both products then decide.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an electric razor. The product is very nice, it comes with a travel case that has a brush, it comes with a cleaning cartridge, the base charger, a power adaptor (that plugs into the charger or directly to the razor). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first, it did give me razer-burn, but that went away after a couple days of use (and im told up to 3 weeks for some people). Cleaning it is super easy. I dont clean it using the full clean like it suggests you always do after every use. Typically i shave once a day so its only small hairs, and i just loosen the guard and turn it on over a trashcan, then blow on it and its perfectly clean.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning with the base is actually pretty loud, so its not something you do at night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Remember: this is a dry razer, dont get it wet! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, i love it.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this shaver. It gets super clean every day, he gets a better shave than before and it&#x27;s low maintenance for him. Perfect for my husband.</li>
    <li> I had given up on Electric shavers, having tried the wet/dry, 3 rotary, and older designs. I was then left to wet-shave which is not as convenient all the time. I ended up purchasing this unit with negative expectations. I am pleasantly surprised, have had no issues with shaving burn or missed hairs, the cleaning base is efficient and performs well. Whatsmore, it shaves as well and as cloase as the wet razor did.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product in general. Especially like the cleaning feature. Blades against the skin are smooth. A slightly closer shave would improve the overall performance.</li>
    <li> Let me start with the fact that the auto-cleaning function is really neat. This shaver also hasn&#x27;t harmed me in any way, nor has it ceased to function. So, for those reasons, I believe it fully merits both of the stars I&#x27;ve given it.    Now for why it can&#x27;t get any more.    1. Shave quality. This shaver can&#x27;t hold a candle to my dear and departed 12-year-old Norelco 5863XL. It takes many more passes to achieve a close shave, and even after that it leaves low stubble where the Norelco left me truly clean-shaven. And that&#x27;s just on my face. On my neck it leaves the hair basically untouched when shaving up the neck, requiring me to perform manual acrobatics and hold the shaver sequentially in various positions to get any kind of shave at all. Overall, I&#x27;m now spending about 8 minutes where I used to spend about 4, and I&#x27;m getting a substantially worse shave.    2. Noise. The last 3 shavers I&#x27;ve owned are the aforementioned Norelco, a cheap Panasonic wet/dry, and a $5 Vidal Sassoon hair clipper. The Braun is easily louder than the clipper (I ran them both to check), and probably louder than the Norelco and the Panasonic running at the same time. It&#x27;s insane. It&#x27;s louder than my cordless drill. Just as bad, the cleaning function makes the same noise (it runs the shaver on and off), so I can&#x27;t run it overnight. I don&#x27;t even like to run it while I&#x27;m in the house. Too bad I have to be in the house while I&#x27;m using it.    Suffice it to say that at this price point, I am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> It is the most complete shaver I have ever owned.  It is smooth and shaves very close.</li>
    <li> I have only owned this shaver for a month, but I like how it feels against my skin. It gives me a close shave on most of my face, but it leaves some stubble along my lower jaw line. I believe I can live with that, but I did pay over $150 for this shaver. Come on Braun, you can do better (or is it the Gillette blades??). I am also hoping that my face will get use to the Braun and maybe solve that problem.</li>
    <li> Works great! It has totally eliminated the irritation and redness that I would get when I used disposable razors. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after using several of the much lower priced 3612 shavers for the past 10 years or so.  I always struggled to get a good shave with the 3612 - frequently missing hairs on my chin and neck and then annoyingly finding the long whiskers on my drive to work.  I was a skeptic about whether the 8995 would be worth the extra $$$.  I&#x27;ve been using it for around a month now and feel that it was well worth the money!  The shaves take less time and I have yet to find any rogue long whiskers.  Plus, the clean shaver has been good for my marriage - my wife has found far fewer whiskers on the vanity top.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a year, and I decided to write a review because I am very disappointed in the performance, it does not give a close shave. I even changed the foil and cutter in the time frame specified but the shave is mediocre.    This was my Grundig replacement which I thought was going to be better because all the new features and technologies it had, and also mainly because it self-cleaned, but after a year of use, I really can say that the best feature it has is the self-cleaning base that is why I gave it a 2 star rating, but without the self-cleaning base I would rate it 1-star.    I am going back to the Grundig brand</li>
    <li> My most favorite shaver. Liked it so much I bought one for my boss as a group birthday gift.</li>
    <li> This shaver rocks.  I hate to shave, I hate razors, especially over priced razors.  I have tough hair, every other razor I have ever used could not shave my face close to the skin.  They always left hairs and I would have to go over my skin with a razor to clean it up.  This shaver, has always given me a perfect shave.  I have nothing bad to say about this thing at all.  It self cleans itself, which is great.  The cleaner tends to dry out quick in the summer, especially if you have no AC.  I pour rubbing alcohol into the container to make it last longer.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as the main component in the fluid is alcohol.  I would recommend this one as to the new ones out there, they are much more expensive and I can&#x27;t see how they could get any better than this one.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have long been a fan of Braun shavers after using most of the other brands. Bought this to replace one that has served me well for about 15 years and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> works good, cuts close.  if you wait for your facial hair to grow long, it still cuts it, but it also pulls.</li>
    <li> I have used a rotary shaver AND a blade (when I&#x27;ve needed a close shave) for many many years. I read about this shaver (as the best) in Consumer Reports magazine and decided to give this one a try. Wow! It is well worth the money and gives as close a shave as my trusted blade. I would highly suggest you spend the bucks and actually get what you pay for.    The additional plus for me, the ability to buy a new head without having to buy a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> I bought six months ago the Braun Series 5 Type 5646 and have been using since then two or three times at week.  When I read the Manual I noticed that the 2 year limited warranty excludes the shaver foil and the cutter block, I also notice that the manual recommends replacing every 18 months (18-hole golf course).  Last week after only six months of use the shaver foil got a loose part while I was using, exactly is an exterior little steel segment that goes side to side securing a cobalt blue part.  I went to Target to buy a new shaver foil and I notice that is sold with the cutter block included and that makes this part expensive (US$39.99 + tax)and that is when I realized that Braun does not include that part in their warranty. The company advertised this part will need to be replaced after 18 months and it only lasted 6 months which I consider an expensive product because when I bought the shaver I thought it would last 18 months as they advertised it.  I think the company should sell the shaver foil without including the cutter block, reduce the 18 months claim and that will make less expensive the shaver maintenance and better information to the consumer.

    <li> The series 5 (8995) shaver produced a very close shave for me.  I used a Norelco shaver for thirty years.  I thought that I would try the Braun to see if it would be a closer shave.  I believe that it is.  I wanted the series 7, but went with the series 5 due to price (about $60 difference).  I am very pleased with the function and feel of the shaver.  It is much easier to handle and maneuver around my face.  Don&#x27;t know if it needs to be cleaned as often as the shaver displays.  Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This expensive electric razor was a gift I received Christmas 2007 and actually worked pretty well until the base station started falling apart.  Since the stand broke I can no longer use it at all.  Braun support was useless and wants $60 for another cheap plastic stand.  After shelling out $$$$$ hundreds for the razor, new foils and cutters, cleaning solution (twenty bucks a month), etc. etc. it is obvious that Braun is a terrible money-grubbing company that makes cheap crap.  Stay away, I know I will!</li>
    <li> The Winner Is...    The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely. Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver. The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave. However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.    This is a review of three Panasonic models; ES8243A (4-blade), ES8109S (3-blade) and ES7109, the Remington MS2-390, the Norelco 8260 CC and the Braun Series 5 8995 (8985 &amp; 8975 only differ in displays and cleaning). I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years. The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned. It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave. This means recharging every 4-5 days. Gels/oils do make the process easier - not faster - and I have reviewed six of them on their Amazon sites.    ES8109S: This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work. It does give off a higher pitch &#x60;whine&#x27;, while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy. Nor is the cleaning operation noisy. Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design slows shaving (see discussion, below).    ES8243A: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave. As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face. It makes cutting in the areas where you don&#x27;t have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult. In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design makes it even slower (see discussion, below). Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced. What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil? All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.    ES7109S: The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; (see below). Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.    Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago. My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick). I think the reason is that Panasonic&#x27;s older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic&#x27;s newer cutting blades (including replacements). This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting. Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so. Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area. Unfortunately, Panasonic puts their better motor (13,000 RPMs) only on these ill-conceived \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; designs. Battery time on the Panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here. The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt. You will have to re-position the trimmer to get what you missed. This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.    The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that thePanasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not \\&quot;Arc Foiled\\&quot;), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades. As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter. This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles. Using a pre-shave oil/gel will gum up the blades, as with any shaver, but these blades pop off with even the slightest brushing so be prepared to watch them fall into the sink with every cleaning attempt. A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver. Remington did a poor job with the details.    The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave. The Braun can also leave burn marks and even cuts (nose and lips) that will bleed. Odd: you would think that, with it getting so close as to actually burn the skin, it would also give a closer shave. I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better. Additionally, the design of the handle is inferior, making positioning more difficult. It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    The Norelco 8260 CC: I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s. I switched to foil and found I could get a closer shave. This is still the case. Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup. However, this is the quietest shaver.    PS: don&#x27;t accept the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. If you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy this, that&#x27;s good because it does give a quick shave. It shaves very fast, but that&#x27;s only the good news. The bad news is that it irritates my skin beyond belief, and it gives a poor shave. Not close at all, I give up I&#x27;m gonna throw this thing away.</li>
    <li> I used this model for over 6 years before the battery failed and would not hold a charge.  It&#x27;s a great shaver that cuts well and has a nice pop up trimmer for sideburns.  This was my first electric shaver and I would recommend this model to anyone considering an entry level purchase into electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I had reviewed the Braun shaver on Consumer Reports, and then investigated any online reviews.  I have been very pleased with the performance.  I have a rough beard that grows very quickly.  Basically, I usually have a 5:00 shadow by noon.  This shaver gives me a smooth comfortable feel, with a close shave that lasts me the entire day.    One of the concerns I had read in other purchasers&#x27; reviews was the frequency and cost of the cleaning component.  I am more than happy with that function, in that I think preventative maintenance is a necessity with most things.      I must admit, though, that I am only pressing the button to initiate the cleaning function in the middle of the week and on Sundays.  My process is that I clear out the shavings before placing the shaver back in the base unit. Then, regardless of when the base unit&#x27;s indicator says it needs an intensive cleaning, I am only doing it twice a week.       I am in my 40&#x27;s and this is probably the 4th electric shaver I have had in all of this time.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x60;t used an electric razor in quite a while.  For the price and quality 4 stars max.  I1ts not a blade and I have tough wiskers.</li>
    <li> I have used a blade shaver since I started shaving and that is over 50 years.  For reasons unknown I decided it was time to try an electric razor.  After lots of research I chose the Braun&#x27;s series,5.  It turned out to be one of  the best decisions I made.  The Braun&#x27;s razor and cleaning system is amazing it by far surpasses my expectations.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver several years ago.  For the first year or so I liked it a lot.  I agree with most of the pros/cons of the other reviews, in brief, pro: close even shave, long battery life, cleaning stand is handy, can use corded or cordless, can clean manually; con: cleaning cycle is long and loud, shaver is loud (not so much at first, but more on this later).    But there are some downsides that you don&#x27;t see in the reviews.    * I get maybe 4-5 months of use out of a head.  Some original reviews said they&#x27;d last a year.  New heads cost a fair amount.  * The cleaning refills aren&#x27;t cheap.  They last only about a month at best, and shipping costs are significant w.r.t the overall price of a package of three.  * The floating heads tend to come apart.  They&#x27;re held in place by two black plastic pieces that fit on either side of the head.  After a month of use or so, these tend to come off when the head is released.  They aren&#x27;t so easy to fit back in, and tend to keep loosening. It becomes difficult to either cleanly release the head, or snap it fully back in.    And the main thing is, the older the razor gets, the shorter the life of the cleaning heads.  They don&#x27;t fit as securely, and they tend to jam, and they start snagging on your beard or stalling, so you have to go really easy in order to ensure they keep cutting.  So the overall life of the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem so great.    The end result is I pretty much have to replace this shaver after about three years.  My previous shaver I had for over ten years, and while it didn&#x27;t shave as well initially, it shaved decently all of its life.  Basically I only replaced it because the rotary heads were getting more and more difficult to find.    These are things you don&#x27;t appreciate until after a year or so of use.  The reviews I had read before buying the shaver were from people who&#x27;d had the shaver a few weeks, and were pretty effusive.  And I liked it too, when I first got it.  But you need to keep in mind whenreading the reviews that by and large, these are people who&#x27;ve been using an old shaver who are now using a new one.     So I can&#x27;t really recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> My fourth Braun shaver in the last 20 years - they are the best.  This is the first time I paid the big money ($180)for a high end unit with the cleaing unit.  Honestly do not see a big difference from the $100 unit.  Good shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor when it first came out.  Thought for $180 it would be the best ever.  Its a piece of junk.  I had to have it repaired at my expense 3 times.  The entire unit is designed poorly.  In the fixed position, you need to tug and pull your skin to get it shaved.  In the flex setting, you get nothing.    The people that gave it good reviews must be the few lucky ones.  I HATE it, and would urge you to read many reviews before you buy this.    Panasonic makes a much better product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Braun 8995 with the automatic cleanser on 7/1/2007. Shortly thereafter, it wouldn&#x27;t charge. It was repaired on 8/8/08. In less than  months it was already beginning to malfunction. Currently (7/28/09), it won&#x27;t turn off, charge, or clean.                                            For the price I paid ($157.59) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless the the warrantly would be AT LEAST 2 years. Now (7/29/09) a day later), I learn the repair center is out of business and Amazon won&#x27;t accept for return the liquid-filled cleaning cartridges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different electric shavers in the past and I&#x27;d have to say this is my favorite. The shaving is quick and smooth over most of my face. A couple of spots on my neck are a lttle tough but with a little attention it buzzes through them as well. I originally thought the cleaner might be kind of stupid but it does do a good job cleaning the razor as well as completing the charge.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor 6 months ago because of the concensus by so many with tough beards and various dysfunctions, that this was the holy grail - well, I&#x27;m here to tell you, it is not - I have a $30 Norelco from Walgreens that does just as well - the hair on my neck grows in different directions near my adam&#x27;s apple, this razor doesn&#x27;t do a thing to them, even when I move around at different angles - so, if you&#x27;ve got ingrown hair problems or hair that isn&#x27;t straight North/South, this razor isn&#x27;t going to do anything for you that a razor costing $100 less won&#x27;t - it&#x27;s great for an easy shave, and nothing more, definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> had to call on the phone and then got the runaround and was told &#x27;because of christmas 90 days will be used in this case and had to provide receipt b/c i could be misrepresenting the facts of my case or i could have stolen this item.  let&#x27;s see if my money back guarentee is any good or if they really give my money back and also have to pay shipping and insurance to even qualify for a refund!</li>
    <li> Alrighty, I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he doesn&#x27;t like it.  That&#x27;s not to say that it isn&#x27;t a great shaver, it&#x27;s just that he doesn&#x27;t react well to electric shavers.  He found it works well with an oil shaving product that you can also buy on &#x27;Amazon&#x27;, but I can&#x27;t remember the brand name.    It&#x27;s a great product from a great brand, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work well with certain types of skin.  The oil definitely helps though.</li>
    <li> The is the best, closest shaver I have used. I used a Philips Norelco Arcitec 1060 for 10 months before buying the Braun. The Arcitec shaver stopped working after 10 months &amp; I was able to return it to Costco &amp; pick up the Braun.    I have a medium beard growth, so I shave just before going to bed at night. I thought the Philips Norelco was good before getting the Braun. I have used this shaver for 2 months. It is just a great, super close shaver. And fast too.    I was a little worried about the expense of cleaning solution. After doing some research online, I found others who suggested only using the cleaner every 3-4 days. Others have suggested cleaning every 7-10 days. The other days, you clean by following the Braun instructions for cleaning when you don&#x27;t have the shaver base with you: pop the head off, tap it out &amp; run the shaver for a few seconds with the head off to shake debris off. You can stretch the cleaner to last a couple of months.    Key Hint:  Do not wash or wet your face before shaving. If you do you will not get a close shave.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely THE WORST shaver I&#x27;ve had in quite a while.  I paid a premium price for it and it never saved decently from the beginning.  I had to go over and over several spots and I would still find hairs sticking out when i was done.  I went back to my used and much less expensive Norelcos and they still did a better job than this razor when it was new.    Recently purchased the Panasonic ES8249 and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Finally!  A razor that actually does the job and with no fuss.  Don&#x27;t mess with the Braun!  Go for the Panasonic!</li>
    <li> This is my second one I keep one in the car and one in the BR. I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver for my husband.  He loves it.  He thought it was such a good razor he recommended to our son who purchased the same one.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It took me a long time to decide between the series 3, 5 0r 7. I finally went with the series 5 and could not be more content with my decision.</li>
    <li> I have had this for almost a decade now and love it.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This my fifth Braun shaver and this one might be the best. Right now, it&#x27;s running nice and quietly and smoothly and giving me a close, fast shave. The new cleaning process senses when it needs cleaning or charging when you lock it into a plugged in cleaning station and it comes out clean. I say, that if you have been using Braun shavers then this one will be a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I never trusted electric shavers to be a close shave, but this one has been working very good for me, my skin adapted in only a couple of days. &lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning system works good. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I forked up a lot of money for what was hyped as the best razor on the market. Yes, it gives a close shave, but no closer than any of its cheaper competiters. In addition, I have tried to find the cleaning cartridges in my local drugstores, (CVS, Duane Reade, Rite AIDE AND Walgreens), and have been told by all that it is being discontinued, and that they would have to special,order it!!!)That sucks and is not a good omen. It tells me that Braun is about to bury the product.Good luck!</li>
    <li> BRAUN ACTIVATOR W/SHIPPING $200 BUCKS,AFTER ONE WEEK THE STATIONARY HEAD POSITION BROKE,THE SWIVAL HEAD POSITION NOW HAS TWO SWIVALS,,SELF CLEANING NOT GOOD HAD HAIR LEFT INSIDE EVEN AFTER ALL THE NOISE  CLEANING,,MISSES ALOT YOU HAVE TO GO OVER AND OVER SO THE HEAT BURNS YA  FOGGGGET ABOUT STICK TO RAZORS !!!</li>
    <li> The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but not perfect. Even though my face feels smooth afterward, it still shows some shadow. I&#x27;m not sure if any shaver can completely remove my tough beard. The Braun does an excellent job especially on my neck, which I have never been able to shave to my satisfaction.  The unit is powerful so time spent per shave is short. The cleaning system is superb and doesn&#x27;t involve too frequent fluid changes. The refills are inexpensive anyway. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase. Too bad the cleaning system is not easily portable.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Braun 7000 series shaver for 4 years and it gave a great shave!  I still keep it for travel.  The 8000 series 360 is just as good.  While I can&#x27;t tell much difference in shave quality between the two, I like the 360&#x27;s cleaning system better - the low cleaning soution indicator and auto cleaning cycle selector are a slight improvement over the 7000 series.  I also like the fact that they both use the same cleaning cartridges. I had to have a new motor put into my 7000 series Braun after 4 years - I wore it out!  Not the motor actually, but the edges of the frame at the sides of the cutting foil where it rubs on your face as you shave.  I actually wore holes through the naterial from all of the shaving I did!  The motor itself was still working.  But I found that the repair costs were very reasonable at a local shaver repair facility and the shaver is once again like new.  I expect the 360 to be just as good on reliability and quality.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8995 provides a close, easy, and responsive shave. You will not go wrong with this product. The cleaner is very effective and may \\&quot;shave off\\&quot; a minute or two of your morning shaving routine.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Comfortable shave in short time. Not quite as good as a blade shave but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun razor in about 15 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun 8995 360 is giving me a closer shave than the previous two. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone, as I get a clean, close shave every time! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I recommend NOT cleaning this razor every day.  I have experimented with the interval, and I can&#x27;t personnaly tell a difference between daily, and twice weekly cleanings.  However, I do recommend changing the foil and head unit (usually sold as a &#x27;package&#x27;) every 6 months.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Best shave I ever had with an Elec razor. Get hairs I used to have to shave with a reg razor after using a elec razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station will give you an on going cost, but! after cleaning it&#x27;s like having a new shaver out of the box again, anyway you can find good buys for the cleaning cartridges online just do a search. Each one is good for about 33 cleanings.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A good tip I got out of the owners manual was shave dry, before showering or washing face. Water will cause swelling and your won&#x27;t a close shave. I splash on some Lectric Shave before and get a smooth shave.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think a better shaver can come out after this so this will be the last shaver I will ever buy.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It shaves closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve ever had. My only complaint is that it indicates that it needs to be cleaned after every shave. I wonder if this is really the case or if they&#x27;re just trying to get you to buy more of the expensive cleaning solution. Overall though, this was money well spent.</li>
    <li> Shaver works very well.  Seems like the cleaner may be a bit expensive if used daily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through quite a few razors over the years, and went to a blade for two or three.  I&#x27;ve also owned several earlier versions from Braun.  This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  I can&#x27;t say that it is blade close, but is not off by much.  This has more power than my last Braun, runs quieter, and cuts through two to three days of growth easily.  I had to make several passes with my previous razor due to my heavy beard.  This unit cuts the time in half.  The shave is comfortable, and the cleaning/charging unit works great.  Though the included paperwork says to run a cleaning cycle after every use, I&#x27;ve been doing fine with every three to four day cleaning.  I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row without recharging with no noticeable decrease in battery power.  Battery power, cleaning reminder, and length of time of your last shave are displayed on the LCD screen which is easy to read.  Looks great, though it does take up a bit of space on the bathroom counter.  Not cheap, but definitely delivers.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the 7000 series Braun shaver...I made the decision to upgrade to the new 360 shaving system...and yes, there is a difference...A must closer shave for [[ASIN:B000G1EQ1W Braun 8995 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver]] the cutting heads are different...the shave much closer...also, may I say the cleaning system is superior [[ASIN:B000FPAG0Y Braun CCR2 Syncro, Activator, Flex XP, 360 Complete cleaner refill kit]]...J...Balboa, CA</li>
    <li> Really works well.  No more shaving rash.  No more clogged blades.  I don&#x27;t care that I am spending $3-5 a month (actually less - 1 cartridge lasts 6-8 weeks) as it rinses and lubricates the blade to keep the system working well.  Took it on vacation for a week and cleaned it out manually and it did well also.  Would do two things to modify it to improve (but not major things) 1) the head is wide and sometimes neck hair runs sideways and hard to fit sideways and 2) I don&#x27;t think that the razor needs to charge every time it is cleaned to help battery life</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for many years, but this is the finest shaver I hae ever experienced.  It took NO time to get used to it.  Babies butt smooth.  It keeps a charge for a very long time and the cleaning is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shaver I have ever used.  The charging base and cleaning station is the also one of the best I have used.  I rarely have to clean it with the brush, but it comes in handy when traveling.  It took about a week for my face to adjust to it, but now it cuts as close as my Gillette Fusion.  I love this and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good shave.  Its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver before I decided to give this product a try. The difference between this product and the Panasonic shaver was a full days worth of shave. If you like a close shave this product is not for you. Plus, you can&#x27;t use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> love the shaver, but I was offered a 50 dollar Amazon coupon that I never received. Is this a amazon plot to make people buy?</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised and it was brand new.   Works like a charm. My husband and I are both happier now. :)</li>
    <li> Upgraded to this shaver a few months ago from the previous version of this same one (I believe, can&#x27;t remember the exact model number).  My previous shaver lasted several (5, I think) years before the battery stopped holding a full charge.  Hopefully this one will last at least as long.    Cleaning base is much better on this model than my previous one because it doesn&#x27;t have the clip over the top that many people complained about breaking.  You just set this one in and it will start charging automatically without having to hit any buttons or attach anything (unless you want to clean every time).    I agree with previous reviews that state you don&#x27;t need to clean it every time.  Once or twice a week should be adequate.    I recommend using a \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; gel or similar stuff.  Like after-shave, but designed specifically for electric shavers and you put it on BEFORE shaving.    One negative: The cleaning base ALWAYS has two lights that are lit.  One showing the cleaning cycle that it recommends, and one showing the volume of cleaning solution remaining.  They are bright little LEDs, and I had to put tape over them since I keep this on the bedroom dresser and they annoyed me at night.</li>
    <li> The first thing to know about ANY electric shaver is that you really need to give your face about two weeks of daily shaving with only the electric to truly get a good idea of the performance of the device.  The second is that it probably won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, despite any advertising the manufacturer might put out there.  That said, THIS one will probably give a closer shave than any electric on the market.    I have used primarily electric shavers for about 35 years, and I&#x27;ve run the gamut from the basic Remington, to the new-fangled (for its day) Schick Flexamatic with its first-of-its-kind foil screen head, to the triple head Norelco.  I replaced the Norelco about 9 years ago with a top rated Braun, liking what I read in the reviews, and what I saw when I looked at it in the stores, and was very pleased with its performance, as it gave me the closest electric shave I had ever experienced.  Mind you, no electric will give you the baby&#x27;s-butt-smooth closness that you would experience with a Gilette blade and Edge Gel, (my personal closeness benchmark) but that puppy came damn close!    So when it started to die after a long and faithful life, there was no question in my mind that another Braun was in my future.  The only question was which.  Not much thought went into that decision, as I figured why not get the top-of-the-line model with the auto-cleaning feature.  Although it is rather pricy when compared to other brands of electrics out there, believe me, you get what you pay for.  Right out of the box (after a quick charge) the 8995 worked flawlessly, and I was a bit surprised to note that even though I had been using a Braun for years, it still took several days for my beard to get set up to the new foil head technology on this model.  Once my personal break-in was over, I was blown away to find that this latest model was even better than my venerable 9 year old Braun which I had held in such high esteem.  Even the tricky spots under the lower lip and at the base of the neck (where the hairs seem to grow in whatever direction they damn well feel like and even that seems to change on a daily basis)were no match for the contortionist-like head of the Braun, and the pop-up trimmer made short (no pun intended) work of the sideburn/mustache trimming tasks.    As far as the cleaning/charging base goes, this is one of the more interesting features.  The shaver goes in upside down - in one piece, nothing to disassemble - on roughly a 30 degree angle, and an automatic cycle analyzes the cleanliness of the shaver. (though I have my theory that it pretty much assumes the level of cleanliness based on how long the shaver has been used since the last cleaning/charging cycle and determines a commensurate cleaning accordingly) Then, using an alcohol based cleaning solution in a replaceable cartridge, (the shaver comes with one - they say it lasts about 30 cleanings, and the cleaning/charging base LED will let you know when it&#x27;s circling the drain) it flushes and cleans the shaver head, and then automatically dries it, in a total time of about an hour.  While this is happening the shaver is also charged, too.  It comes out in a like new state of clean, with a pleasant lemon scent to boot.  And after cleaning, the first shave seems smoother, as if the cleaning solution left a lubricant on the foil.  Braun claims no memory effect on the shaver&#x27;s battery, so theoretically, you could charge and clean daily.  Not a bad idea, especially for those with heavy daily beard growth.  And if you&#x27;re on the road, you can still clean it manually with the included brush, and refresh the battery by plugging the charging cord into the bottom of the shaver.   Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, Braun.  German engineering.  Guys, need I say more?</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelcos for 30 years. Recently, my three year old Norelco stopped working properly. I read the user reports on Amazon and decided to bite the bullet and go for this highly rated and expensive Braun shaver. The shaver is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER SYSTEM THAT I HAVE EVER USED. I really look forward to shaving every morning. The cleaning system is extremely easy to use and keeps the shaver in top condition each time. I highly recommend this product to all. Thank you Braun and thank you Amazon for bringing this product to my attention.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used the 8995 for 3 months, I&#x27;ve determined a few things:  - Not quite as close as my Remington triple microscreen I have been using for the last 10 years, but close enough  - Shaves quicker, with fewer missed hairs than my old Remington  - Auto-clean is nice. Saves a little more time  - Sometimes a stray long hair escapes the cutters and you have to engage the sideburn trimmer. It&#x27;s pretty sharp and uncomfortable on your neck, but patience works best. The Remington had a better long hair solution, but then again it allowed more long hairs to escape.    Is it worth 2-3 times as much as a top Remington? Maybe, but it&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8995 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver is without a doubt THE BEST shaver I have ever owned.  It charges itself, cleans itself, lubricates itself, and comes with an array of features that just blow the competetion away.  I purchased the top model with the digital display (as opposed to the next model down with just indicator LEDs) and beleive me it was a good choice.  The display really makes it easy to se the condition of the shaver&#x27;s status.  It shows the battery charge level, how long you used it, and how much use time you have left before the battery goes dead.  One of the best features is without a doubt the re-chargable battery.  Most rechargable batteries will only ever run for as long as you used it before you re-charged it that very first time. This shaver&#x27;s battery DOES NOT DO THAT!!!  I have also looked into the cost of the cleaning solution that you will occasionally need to buy throughout the life of you shaver.  They are not expensive at all!  Especially if you buy them in the three packs.  Like I said earlier, this is without a doubt the best shaver I have ever had, and most likely the last one I will ever have to buy!</li>
    <li> The razor is great.  Nice close shave without pulling.  Cleaning is a little noisy and takes awhile.  I have found that cleaning once a week is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month now. It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. I&#x27;ve cleaned it everyday and cartridge still shows a level of full. There&#x27;s no need to press hard. I used to get rashes with other electric shavers but not so with this one. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a followup to a review I previously posted about this product.  It has become obvious that the foil on Braun 8000-series shavers is defective by design and/or manufacture because the foil goes bad WAY too often.  I have used Braun 6000 and 7000 series shavers, and never had the bad experience I&#x27;ve had with the 8000-series shaver.  I treat all my shavers carefully; nothing but my face, or tissue, touches the head.  Here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct 14 purchase a new Braun 8975&lt;br /&gt;Dec 15 hole appears in foil&lt;br /&gt;Dec 21 replace foil+cutter (from Braun customer service)&lt;br /&gt;Jun 02 hole appears in foil&lt;br /&gt;Jun 03 replace foil+cutter&lt;br /&gt;Jun 17 hole appears in foil after only 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, at $28-$40 for the 8000FC foil &amp; cutter assembly (you can&#x27;t buy the foil separately), this product has become way too expensive to maintain.  I&#x27;m going to take a clue from CR, which rated the Remington Microscreen a best-buy in Jun 08, and try the Remington.  Hopefully it won&#x27;t nickel-and-dime me to death.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 5 Braun shavers over the years. I like this one (the 8995) with the digital info. showing how much of the charge is available-nice. That helps a lot when traveling too!  However, I now use (after trying them all) the \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; shaving head (replacement foil &amp; blades) with this shaver-good price on Amazon.  The \\&quot;Activator\\&quot;, in my opinion, is by far the best shave-closest with less irritation. Combined, this makes a great-great system.  Highly recommend this. I also own the Pulsonic and frankly think this (with the Activator foil and blades) is closer.  This is also lighter and takes up less space when traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this item less than six months ago, i.e. it&#x27;s still under warranty. Last week the cleaning stand stopped working. After finally reaching Braun \\&quot;Customer Service\\&quot; today, I was informed that  1) I would have to send it to a service center in another state  2) It would take \\&quot;at least\\&quot; 2-3 weeks.  3) A temporary cheap replacement would take 2-3 weeks to arrive  4) I have to pay shipping to the repair location and make a long-distance call to them ahead of time to tell them it&#x27;s coming. Who knows what&#x27;s going to happen if/when I reach them.    Try another company. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> What can I say other than it&#x27;s the best and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It is also as close a shave as any blade alternative on the market.  Not only do I use it on my face everyday, but additionally I use it to shave my head bald twice a week, and it&#x27;s always smooth afterwards, and quite a bit of stubble grows on my head between shaves.  It&#x27;s as sleek and as powerful as advertised, and with the daily cleaning and recharge, it&#x27;s like using a new razor every morning.  One thing the ads don&#x27;t tell you: the charge/cleaning system occassionally refreshes the battery automatically by completely discharging and then recharging it so it will always have as full a charge as it can handle -- this is a good selling point that Braun should advertise on the package label.</li>
    <li> We bought this razor for my 85 year old father-in-law for Father&#x27;s Day. He absolutely loves it. I was concerned that he might have difficulty understanding the cleaning system as his vision is not good, but he figured it out and can&#x27;t stop raving about it.</li>
    <li> I have the previous model shaver, I believe its the 8895 or something to that effect and this one is pretty much the same thing except it has a neat lcd screen. I have to say the screen is really handy as it tells you if your foil is clean or not, how full your battery is, how long you have left and how long it takes to charge. This shaver would be a great gift as I gave it to my dad for fathers day. He loves it and hes not even technologically inclined, hes been using straight edges for years.</li>
    <li> I have found the braun Series 5 8995 Men&#x27;s Shaver to be the best electric shaver I have ever used, far superior to Remington and Norelco. Prior to this purchase I had been using a blade because of dissatisfaction with previous electric shavers. It took about a week to adapt to electric shaving again and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I love the cleaning and recharging base. This is a feature no one else offers. It keeps the shaver very clean and automatically maintains optimum battery health. This is, without a doubt, the best electric shaver on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl Olsen&lt;br /&gt;Puyallup, Washington</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for two years and it still cuts perfect. I had upgraded to the newer style 9595 and still prefer the 8995 over that model due to ease of use, rock solid build quality and a great cleaning system. I have had zero issues in two years. I shave / use it every day while driving into the office.     The newer 9595 model I have; the trimmer broke. I don&#x27;t even use that function and one day I found it to be broken. I use the cases always and handle with kid gloves and it just suddenly broke. There&#x27;s a mechanical issue where it will not retract into the shaver body any more. My quess is a spring let go and has jammed thus preventing the mechanism from closing.    I have had issues with the 9595 where it would not clean and it burns due to higher cutting speed. The 8995 runs cooler, has less vibration, can be held at any angle, shaves at any angle, has a better side trimmer that is lined up with the cutter head for popping a lift and cut type of system, has super long battery time, and produces a more comfortable shave than the new model. I still love my Braun 8995 model and still use it every single day.     Cleaning: This 8995 model / base works the best out of the all three that I have had. This includes the newer 9595 model. The LED remains lit to let the user know what the status is vs. the newer one. The newer one is designed so that all the LEDs go out after a period of non use and, I have had it NOT clean my shaver and nothing indicating whether it had been cleaned or not.    Shave quality: Darn close, easy to manipulate, very close shave, great trimmer and it just works. Really good shave quality. Just as close as the newer one that boasts the improved cutter head. In fact, I find that when going along the length of the cutter head, it really comes in super close. It does take longer to shave as it is a slower speed cutting shaver than the newer one but, both perform equally as good as far as shave quality is concerned.      Summary: Best shaver I have owned hands-down is the 8995. I own three Braun, two Norelcos and the Braun are built like tanks and produce a fantastic close shave. You won&#x27;t be let down by this older 8995 model vs. the new one. This is based on two years of shaving with this model and one year with the new 9595 model.</li>
    <li> very good product, better than I had thought. Came fast and was brand new when it arrived. Product will definately last me for the next few years</li>
    <li> I am a Braun Shaver user.  I tried the new Norelco shaver, what a disappointment.  I actually returned the Norelco and bought the Braun shaver.  I never should have tried any other shaver.  The only negative is that I have sensitive skin under my neck and it doesn&#x27;t shave completely under the neck</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and exactly as described. It is a replacement for my old Braun razor of 15 years. It works very well, very close and smooth shave, no irritation, does the job right and has nice features. I clean it manually every day and it works fine like that. Ah, and the price from this retailer is very nice too!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and he loves it. He used to take up to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 minutes with his old shaver...now it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;down to 3 minutes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used braun shavers for several years along with norelco. This Braun 8895  gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.the cleaning method is superb!!!  A very easy razor to hold in your hand and exceptional close shave as long as you stretch your skin while shaving.  I highly recommend it to all you electric shaver users!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Its too early to review a product (Shaver) such as this. I&#x27;ve only used for 2 weeks - - ask me how good it has been after 2 years of use.</li>
    <li> I reluctantly replaced my dying electric shaver and can&#x27;t believe how much happier I am.  The new technology on the Braun 8995 is fantastic.  I shaved 3 days growth in no time.</li>
    <li> I received my 8985 shaver this week.  Like most of the other people-- I was amazed that the head cleaner was so expensive.  So guess what?  I went to my good old standby store- WalMart.  They have a shaver head cleaner manufured by Remington for electric shaver head cleaner.  An 8 oz. bottle is only 5.00.  It is 96% denatured alcohol, and a couple other ingredients that are too difficult to spell or read along with some seed oil (they tell u what kind)  I figured if it worked for a Remington Electric shaver-- it would surely work with a Braun.  It has a fresh lemon scent. I ordered two (3pk) refills from Amazon and the total was 27.00 which included shipping (didnt see any free shipping) the shipping was a whopping $9.30 and the refills were $8.80- a real rip off on the shipping.  The 8 oz bottle should last a long time.  I love the razor and finding the Remington Head Cleaner makes it the BEST.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever had.  I converted from a Norelco rotary type and am kicking myself for not using this type of shaver earlier.  Close shave, comfortable and the self cleaning feature is really nice.</li>
    <li> Used the Braun Shaver 8995 and did not like it. Sent it back after 5 days because it kept Shutting off and did not charge right in the clean and renew system. Had to use to much pressure on the face to get a close shave causing Razor Burn especially on the neck. Also they say to clean Renew it everyday which is ridiculous and will hurt the battery without letting it run down low before charging. &lt;br /&gt; Norelco suggest&#x27;s to rinse clean every day under faucet and use the jet clean system every 2/3 weeks when the battery is at it&#x27;s lowest so as to get the best perfomance out of the Battery.  &lt;br /&gt; I always used Norelco rotary shaver 5865 and now ordered out the New Norelco 9170XLCC and can not beleive the closeness of the shave without so much pressure on the your face.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun Razor that I have owned like the first one this is a very good razor. Shave is close, pulls the hair up to cut it with out irritation Self cleaning feature works well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving being 17 so I don&#x27;t have experience with my different shaving systems. The only other system I\\&quot;ve used is the Gilette Fusion system. It was ok but the blades have to be NEW to keep from giving me razor burn. New being less than a week old. That was getting extremely pricey. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I saw the reviews this thing got and I liked the fact that it was German engineered, as well as made in Germany. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I shaved with it today and I have to say it worked GREAT. It&#x27;s still only the first day so my skin hasn&#x27;t had any time to get used to it but my face is smoother than it ever was with the Fusion system already. Not to mention this was much quicker, easier and less of a mess. It did happen to nick some of the razor burn that I went over and make it bleed - something which my Fusion never did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I just have to wait and see if my razor burn goes away with using this. If so I will definitely be keeping it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The CCR solution seems like its awesome as well. It&#x27;s great for someone that is lazy like me. I&#x27;ll follow up after I&#x27;ve used it a few weeks. Definitely 5 stars for now though.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s better than my razor and i&#x27;m sticking to Braun. Enough said</li>
    <li> Definitely the best electric shaver I have so far.  The cleaning is very convenient, but you have to pay for the liquid refills every three months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am glad I chose this, even though the price is high.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long and I&#x27;m sure my face is still adjusting to a new shaver, but I do really like this product.  I love the self-cleaning feature and my face feels really soft after I shave.  My old shaver used to really dry out my skin and I don&#x27;t get that with the Braun.  The digital display really doesn&#x27;t do much for me and isn&#x27;t necessary, but it does tell you your shaving time (if you really need to know that) and if the charge is full.  I definitely recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> After thirty years of not shaving ... my wife bought it for fathers day and I now shave every other day. I have a close shave and I am very happy with my new shaver!  Bob Gossard</li>
    <li> My husband likes the product but I was disappointed to find it at Sam&#x27;s Club for $50 less after I purchased it.  When Target was listed at a sell of $210 and Amazon had it for $154, I thought I was getting a good deal.   I may not be recalling the prices just mentioned exactly but I think they are close.    My husband has a very heavy beard and it works better than other electronic razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used rotary head electric shavers for the most of my shaving experience.  Before that I used a regular razor up until i could afford an electric one.  My skin is very sensitive, and I could only take the razor shave once a week (twice if I really had to).  When I switched to Norelco, i thought it was the best, my skin didn&#x27;t get irritated as much; I could use it upto 3 times a week.  About 2 months ago I&#x27;ve switched to -Braun 8995 360 Complete.  With this one I have even less irritation.  The only difference is that it seems to take more time than the Norelco, to complete the task, perhaps I am not used to it yet.  Overall those are both good shavers with a close shave - almost like razor.</li>
    <li> I owned several phillishaves in  the past. The Braun is by far a much superior product. The sideburn clipper is in itself a good reason to switch. The phillips&#x27;s sideburn clipper is not very effective.  I am glad I switched to the Braun</li>
    <li> This is the best Braun or even the best electric shaver I have ever owned. The self-cleaning cartridges are worth the cost of $4.00 or so a month as the shaver really does feel like new everyday. A word of caution though... be patient! Braun says give your skin 21 days to adjust. I found the time period to be more like 6 weeks. I don&#x27;t know if any electric will ever shave as close as a triple blade razor but the convienence makes up for the use of a blade. All in all highly recommended. Great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver from amazon because I had read great reviews for it.  Upon receiving it however it would not charge or power up at all when the power supply was attached.  Seeing as it is not working I would like to return it to amazon but because the cleaning solution is flammable they will not accept returns.  I currently have brought this item to a local repair facility to which Braun has referred me.  I will update this review with any new information as it becomes available.    Update 9/19/07:  I took this item into the local repair facility referred to me a couple weeks ago.  This is an independent store that Braun uses to handle their repairs. They examined my kit and found that it is indeed a power supply issue.  They told me they had ordered the part and to call back in a couple days.  A couple days later I called and they said call back in a week, they still hadn&#x27;t received them.  I called back this week and they still haven&#x27;t received the power supply replacements and they don&#x27;t know when they will.  According to the employee to whom I spoke, the Braun company doesn&#x27;t even have these to send at the moment so I am stuck shaving with my old razor for a while.  The shortage (and perhaps the problem) may be due to the fact that the power supplies are supposed to automatically adjust between American and European voltage levels when necessary.  The repair facility has said they will call me when they finally get the power supply in and at that time I will again update this review.    Update 10/02/07:  I was called late last week and told they had the power supplies in stock.  Picked one up today.  I have not used it and according to the sticker that was on the razor when it arrives it takes approximately two weeks for one&#x27;s beard to adjust to an electric razor.  Therefore, I will update this review again in a couple weeks and perhaps change my rating, though first getting to use the razor more than a full month after I got it will prevent it from getting5 stars for sure.    Update 11/13/07:  After using this razor for over a month now I have to say I am quite happy with it.  I bought this product because I hate to shave.  I have a thick, fast-growing beard and shaving takes a long time, even if I do it every day.  And, I have to change blades every week or so, which gets expensive.  So, I wanted something fast and easy that cut back on the blade purchases and not give the nicks and cuts of everyday shaving.  So, the obvious answer would be to turn to an electric razor, right? Right, except that very electric razor I used in the past did a miserable job, especially around the neck.      I happened to read some great reviews for this product and decided to give it a try.  (Leaving aside the ridiculous amount of time I spent trying to get it repaired) I could not be happier with the results.  The shave is quick and easy and I have had no problems with reactions after shaving.  The shave on my cheeks is darn close to razor smooth but the 5 &#x27;o clock shadow does pop up a bit early.  The goatee area is a little less smooth but still good and the razor holds a good charge and comes with a carrying case so it could be toted around for a pre-meeting cleanup or what have you.  As for the neck, I have been pleasantly surprised.  For everyday use I have had no problems with shaving the neck, but when I take a couple days off, like on a weekend, there are the couple stray hairs that it can&#x27;t seem to cut and I ultimately have to touch razor to skin, albeit briefly.    The cleaning base is passably quick but I suggest you do the cleaning after your shaves so you don&#x27;t have to wait around.  You may not have to clean it after every shave but I recommend doing it somewhat often as it noticeably affects the quality of the shave (at least with my thick hair).    Final conclusion:  For the product itself I give it *****/***** (5 out of 5).  It is the most I could have asked from an electric razor.  The situation with the power supply is probably just an unfortunate anomaly and chances are your razor won&#x27;t have this issue.  Be warned however that if it does the product cannot be returned to amazon due to the flammable cleaning solution and you will most likely have to deal with an independent repair facility, assuming there is even one near by.  With this in mind, I have decided to keep the official rating at 1 star, so that people wondering about a possible down side to the purchase can check the one star reviews and read this.  (I do this expressly with the knowledge that my one vote will not effect the good overall rating of this item.)</li>
    <li> Very high quality shaver giving an excellent shave if used before washing your face (for whatever reason Braun recommends shaving in this manner and it works). The battery life readout is a very nice feature since it shows the degree of charge remaining in the battery.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after years of using a Norelco. It really does give an excellent shave, fulfilling all the promises it makes. No pulling at whiskers, a clean, even shave. It is a fantastic shaver. That said, there are two downsides: One, the shaver is loud, I mean loud like a set of electric hair clippers loud. If you&#x27;re shaving two doors down from where someone else is sleeping, they will hear the razor. Two, the prep time for this razor is immense. It does clean and charge itself, but the process is very time consuming. Expect 35 - 50 minutes of cleaning/charging time with this shaver. I like the way the razor is clean and ready to go when I want to use it. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it sounds like I have a bathroom full of bees everytime I clean it. Braun makes excellent products and this is a much better shaver than my Norelco was, I just wish they had figured out how to shave some time and noise off the cleaning part. I gave 4 stars because the shave is excellent, but the maintenance is fair at best. A good buy if you don&#x27;t mind the investment of time for upkeep and the noise level. Good price, good shave, high noise level and complicated maintenance.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000MVQJES Braun Complete 360-Degree Cord/Cordless Mens Shaver [ Model 8995 ]]]    Does not cut as near as other electic shaver I have</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for last two weeks. Every time shaving is better. I have very sensitive skin so I was afraid the process to get used to a new shaver would be more painful but it&#x27;s not! And this Braun is cool - not only a good shaver but also a great gadget!</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver about a month ago from Wal-Mart, used it everyday.    I&#x27;m an Asian, with thick beard, and mustache. I had to shave everyday before I go to work. I used to use rotary razors by Phillips, till I accidentally drop it in the toilet when I was shaving while taking a dump. :(    Anyway, back to the main topic/review.      PROS:    - close shave, but isn&#x27;t better than Panasonic&#x27;s shaver, I&#x27;d say just as good.    - auto-cleaning system, comes very handy, as I don&#x27;t have to clean it often as I shave everyday, when I&#x27;m done shaving, I can just leave it and let it clean itself while I take off and go to work.    - charges up really fast, 5 minutes for a single shave, and 1 hour for full charge. Since I shave a lot, sometimes I forget to charge my shaver, but I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait a whole day to have it charged before using it.    - options for wireless/corded shaving - if the shaver runs out of battery, I could still shave with the cords on.      CONS:    - hair doesn&#x27;t stay inside the system, which means, you can&#x27;t be shaving it if you&#x27;re not in front of your sink, unless of course if you wish to have hairs all over the places. I used to use my Panasonic shaver all over the places, in front of my computer, sometimes if I&#x27;m late for work or events, I shave while I drive (I know I&#x27;m not supposed to do this, as it&#x27;s dangerous, but I do it sometimes), but I can&#x27;t do it anymore with this Braun shaver.    - this shaver is LOUD and VIBRATES BIG TIME ... I really mean it ...    - cleaning solution didn&#x27;t last more than 3 weeks as I use it once everyday, the box says it&#x27;s supposed to last for 30 days.    - cleaning fluid is expensive - oh well, if you want auto-cleaning, you gotta pay for it.    - dried cleaning fluid stays on the shaver, which eventually stays on your face after you shave, and it tastes bad, bitter, and nasty.    - moving over from a rotary shaver, this shaver gave me a lot of razor burns, but after about 2 weeks of constant usage, I&#x27;m gettingless and less razor burns.    - can&#x27;t shave under running water, therefore unable to shave while in shower.      CONCLUSION:    I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this system, and I don&#x27;t think this shaver does the price-tag any justice, as it had way more cons, than pros. I&#x27;m returning this shaver and buying the top of the line Panasonic electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for almost three decades now, and till recently used the blade variety. Through my shaving years I tried to move to an electric shaver as I have a sensitive skin, but unsuccessfully yet, since I didn&#x27;t find the shave close enough, the shaver sometimes pinched, etc. During a recent visit to Singapore, I bought this Braun 8995 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver - another attempt to switch to electric. It took me about four weeks to get fully used to the razor, but man, right from go it was a satisfying experience! For once, my skin felt (almost) as smooth as after a regular blade shave, and no cuts/nicks. After about a month of shaving with this razor, my skin felt healthier too. I think that&#x27;s because with a blade, you not only shave your beard, but also shave off a very thin portion of your skin everytime. Here, I was only shaving hair, and looks like my skin grew back to healthy again.    My only regret in buying the 8995 360 is that the newer model with vibration, the Braun 9595CC hadn&#x27;t been released when I got this. Grrr....</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun electric shaver.  I retired my 10 year old one which I did not like to use because it was difficult to clean.  The 360&#x27;s cleaning feature combined with a very close shave (almost as good as a my 5 blade razor) is a huge step to providing a fast, close shave while maintaining a clean device.  It also seems like the shave lasts just as long as one from my blade razor.  I did, however, have trouble removing the shaver from the cleaning cycle even after it was done and ended up starting it over.  I like the 3 levels of cleaning which the shaver chooses automatically and it tells you in the message window when it needs cleaning.</li>
    <li> Review:&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for the fact that when it worked it worked.  Not as close as a shave as I would like but ok none the less.  However, one day the base just starting clicking and doing random things.  The base wasn&#x27;t charging right, cleaning right, and eventually the base altogether basically stopped functioning.  I also didn&#x27;t like the fact that I couldn&#x27;t replace the cleaning solution with something else like water or something more natural (I&#x27;m an organic kinda guy), but none the less I stuck with what the instructions said (as I always do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is Awesome:&lt;br /&gt;5 stars though for Amazon&#x27;s customer service.  THEY&#x27;RE THE BEST!  NO ONE BEATS THEM IN THIS CATEGORY!  Don&#x27;t listen to Howie Mandel in those crappy commercials.  I tried returning it through Amazon&#x27;s online return center but it said no flammable materials can be returned.  I called Amazon and explained my problem saying that I would just empty the flammable parts before returning it.  The Amazon representative was very thoughtful and extremely nice refunding my money on the spot and didn&#x27;t even require that I send the defective product back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I recommend EVERYONE avoid this.  Its very fragile and I&#x27;m the kind of guy who takes care of his stuff and still has a mint condition Super Nintendo from when I was 5.  Its ridiculous that this shaver broke so easily, but I should of expected it by how naggy the instructions were.  I didn&#x27;t even do anything to it and followed all the instructions to a letter T, and no I didn&#x27;t shove the plastic cap on the shaver in the base.  I kept it in a dry area, and at the temperatures that the manual itself specified.  Anyways now I gotta figure out a way to dispose of this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I&#x27;m back to the good &#x27;ol Razor, Cheers!</li>
    <li> Before I buy the 8995 for my husband (i live overseas and have to buy all accessories on line..can&#x27;t run to the local walmart or drug store) I am noticing you could also purchase the CCR3 Syncro cleaning refills. But, then I also see there is a CCR2. What is the difference between them? Can they both be used on the 8995 model?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned most brands and this is the razor to buy!    It gives me a great shave and keeps itself clean and ready!    What else do you need?</li>
    <li> I found it to be an excellent shaver. Easy handling, with an excellent travel storage box. The cleaning system works grate, keep the shaver clean and your skin does not suffers. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had been a Gillet Mach3 user for years, as well as just using a safty raser before that.  I was tired of getting cuts almost every day with the Mach3 and other various rasers. Because of this, I was ready to make the move to using an electric shaver.      I decided to purchase the 360, because it had the best reviews out of all the electric shavers.      For the first 10-14 days of shaving, I was getting little nic&#x27;s and cuts with this raser, along with some after effects of raser burn. But that was also because my face had been used to using a safty raser for 16+ years, and my face was not used to an electric shaver.  Overall it took about 15 days for my face to get used to the 360.    Now 6 weeks later I am glad I made the switch.  I have not had a nic or a cut in 4 weeks, and my face feels much better after shaving. I would highly recommend this electric raser as long as you have the patience for your face to get used to shaving with it.</li>
    <li> The Braun is an improvement over my old Norelco rotary shaver.  It isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, but it is a step closer. I also like the cleaning system. Cost may be a consideration.</li>
    <li> My son did the research on this product and picked this model.  He is very happy and the cleaning solution lasts a reasonable amount of time and keeps the machine perfect for everyday use.  It provides a clean shave, has a reasonable weight and charges quickly.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> The thing simply does not shave.  I have top go over the same stretch of skin several times in different directions, never had this problem with cheaper Norelcos.  The result?  Constant skin irritation.    To add insult to the injury, Amazon is refusing to take it back.  My wife bought it for me as a birthday gift, so it sat there for a week before I used the shaver.  The instructions say to give it three weeks to get your skin to get used to it.  As a result, the month return period was up, and now I am stuck with this horrible thing.</li>
    <li> Does not give as good a shave as the past Braun&#x27;s I have owned. First time that I have had razor nicks with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> After years of experiencing skin irratation caused by shaving with all types of double and triple edge razors, I found the Braun Series 5 electric razor. Within one week, the skin irratation was gone! I have been a faithful Braun shaver for three years.  This purchase was a gift for my 17 tear old son so that he can shave without the bumps, redness, and raw feeling of razor burn.</li>
    <li> In the first instance, this razer does not shave all that well.  When my old razer died, I bought a $25 dollar Norelco as an emmergency replacement.  After upgrading to this...and giving my face time to adjust...and doing several variations of side by side test...I was suprised and dissappointed to see that this razor takes longer and doesnt shave as close as the $25 Norelco, particularly for day to day use.  (The Norelco seems to do poorly if days are skipped, as on the weekend, while this doesnt seem to matter as much with the Braun.)    While the side-by-side tests might warrant one star alone, consider how you would feel if you tried to use this thing to shave your bald head and 80% of the hair taken from your face immediately dumped on your head.  Not a one time thing, it just doesnt hold shavings properly.  Even in routine facial use it does leak some shavings, which isnt cool for a razor in this price range.    Avoid.  Dont get sucked in by the hype.</li>
    <li> I give this Braun a 2 out of 5.  It&#x27;s not junk, and does a half-decent job, but it takes a long time to shave with, isn&#x27;t as close as you&#x27;d want, and is more expensive. And so are the replacement foils and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned today that the cheaper Norelco beats this Braun hands-down.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-7310-Shaving-System/dp/B001AJ6YS2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Braun product for 8 months.  I gave it a fair chance.  Unfortunately I was never really completely happy with it.  It took so long to get the job done - probably 10-15 minutes or so.  And never got as close as  blades.  BUT....I discovered a big upside to electric.  Less annoying and painful ingrown hairs (angle of cut).  So I stuck with the Braun and sacrificed my time and shaved with this product and planned to get new foils and blades when necessary, sure that I&#x27;d save money in a few years, plus enjoy less ingrowns.  I lived with the other downsides of this product, constant mess (hair in/around sink), cost of cleaning fluid, and noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came time to replace the worn foil and discovered the I&#x27;d give up another 43 bucks.  Shoot...a new Norelco 7310 was 5 bucks cheaper at $38....so I stood there and contemplated.  I&#x27;d read some good reviews of the Norelcos, plus the replacement blades were 25% cheaper than Braun&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give it a chance.  I took it to the car and shaved in the parking lot.  It was hands-down a faster, closer, and more pleasing shaving experience.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer.  Braun&#x27;s marketing might fool you....but the reality is that the cheaper Norelco is what you want to take your wallet out for.</li>
    <li> Works great on face, but Im still using my Schick on my neck.   This is absolutely useless on the neck.  It is great for guys with sensitive skin, and those with problems with ingrown hairs.   I&#x27;ve had it 4 months, and only one ingrown hair.  Worth the money if you deal with shaving your neck by other means.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this very well be the best razor money can buy.  Why? Because its the most expensive.  It is a very novel approach to shaving indeed and i dont mind letting my buddies use it when they come over, as all I have to do is put it into the cleaning\charging station and 2o minutes later it has been cleansed and disinfected; smelling quaintly like citrus and like new- for use again on my own skin.  I have had it a month so far and I do not shave every day, maybe 2-3 times a week depending on how I feel because i think stubble is sexy.  Anyways, it shaves my face just fine, but the problem is around my collar line on my neck.  As human necks do not seem to be a straight level surface, I have a tendency to go over certain spots just under my chin and curve on my face quite a few times to get an even shave- where it is just impossible to shave some of the low lying to the skin hairs.  My average shaves so far have taken anywhere from 7-15 minutes with this machine in order to get a good job and even shave.  Much longer then i would like to spend shaving, and I have fought myself to reach for my blade to shave under my chin and around my neck.  I figure thru more use, my hair will get used to the machine and I will get used to the grain that my hair gros on my neck which seems to be from the center of my neck outwards and not facing down like on my face.   The first few times i used it- their was some razor burn on my neck and maybe a light rash on my face, but with the use of a quality after shave lotion- (I use Neutrogena), this problem has been eliminated.  I think the best shave is done when slowly moving the razor over your skin and applying slight pressure to allow the blade to slowly cut all the hairs evenly on its own.  It is a powerful shaver indeed, and the LED lites on the charging station give my bathroom a quaint glow at nite.  I figured if I was going to make the move to an electric, why not buy the best that money can buy.  I made the move from an old school Deppresion style flat double bladed razor that you screw into the top of the handle type of razor.  Oh- and I was using bar foam with a brush too.  SO I have to say- I have moved from one novelty to another.  This will be something that I know that I will use and keep for years to come.  I also purchased a Braun\Oral B electric toothbrush at the same time after having used Braun coffee makers and recently recieved a Braun Tassimo expresso machine that I have been flagalantly happy with.  Braun is an excellent company and I think they have some of the nicest, most hi-tech gadgets on the market.  If you dont mind spending the money, I would say, treat yourself to the best and get one.  Entertain your friends with it.    Synopsus added 10-16-06:  After several months of use.  My 1st cleaning cartridge is finally getting low and it is time to purchase another one online.  I have also discovered at the recomendation of my barber; who also uses an eletric shaver- that a preshave is a wise choice.  A preshave acts as a lubricant for your face and helps the razor glide right over and eliminates any pulling you would experience by making your hairs stand out.  It cut my shaving time in half almost.  Use a preshave facial product.</li>
    <li> I was quite please with the self-cleaning system. Didn&#x27;t shave as close as Remington Intercept I had before, but was ok. Unfortunately broke after barely a year of use! Now, I&#x27;m not sure what to do. I think it was battery, since it&#x27;s not charging anymore. Shame, paid too much to see this happening...</li>
    <li> I had a previous Braun system that lasted me 5 years and was working great until an unfortunate, prolonged water immersion occured. So, I started looking at new razors and kept coming back to Braun. The system is very simple and easy to use and you don&#x27;t lose any of the good stuff. You have a durable, fantastically well made German razor that uses Gilette blade technology featuring an interactive LCD screen that reminds you how much juice you have left and when you should clean/oil the razor. Not to mention the revised docking system which communicates with the razor to determine the appropriate cleaning intensity, charges your razor for you and leaves it smelling lemon fresh! This is the creme de la creme of men&#x27;s facial care products, don&#x27;t miss out!</li>
    <li> For many years I Couldn&#x27;t use a electric shaver because it was always a incomplete shave, so after each Christmas when I received a new one I would try it and would go back to a manual razor, THEN came along the freeglider and yippy it did a reasonable job that I would call satisfactory, the over the years That razor went obsolete so I started to look for a new replacement. I read some of the reviews. I read \\&quot;the refills are costly  ... hello... 4$ a month?, then I read doesn&#x27;t do a good job, Well let me report to you all this is the best darn razor, Its like magic each time I use it(cleans itself each time\\&quot; its quick, comfortable , quiet, the cleaning process is so cool and I for one love the concept of a clean razor each time I use it, this razor is 10 times better then the freeglider which I loved, what a joy shaving now is , I can even shave twice (I go to work sometimes at 3am then later that night if I&#x27;m going out I can shave again and it doesn&#x27;t irritate.. what a magical razor they have designed ..     PS. The cleaning solution is not expensive (under 12$ for 3ea, that&#x27;s 4$ apiece and lasts a month).    thank you to the designer     I highly recommend this  2 thumbs up    cons    none I can see as yet .. John    update: on march 27th 07 I will write a 6 mnth review of this razor ... John    update, Im reporting how I rate this razor after 6-mths,     It has taken the hassle out of shaving, 3min of effort-free shaving and still a close shave, No complaints, no regrets, no problems, still feels like it is brand new, is quiet, clean, quick. I rate this razor as a ten on a scale of ten . John</li>
    <li> This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I guess after trying Norelco&#x27;s best and then trading up to this Braun, I am not an electric shaving fan.  I have to go over my face again and again to get it close, and even then find stubble 2 hours after shaving as compared to 4 hours or more with a Gillette mach 3 and shaving gel.  I thought I would save time but I actually spend more time shaving with this unit than wet shaving.  Oh well, after a couple week&#x27;s use it&#x27;s going on ebay.</li>
    <li> Not only do I use my shavers to shave my face, but also my entire head.  This shaver is so fast!  It used to take me 30 minutes to shave with my Panasonic Linear shaver, but now with the Braun I am completing my shaves (including my head) in less than 8 minutes!  This shaver also saves me time with the automatic cleaning!  My only complaint is that it does not shave *quite* as close as my Panasonic Linear, but it definatley shaves close enough in much much less time!</li>
    <li> Received this for Christmas 2006 from my wife and was apprehensive to use it given the cost.  I currently use a Mach 3 Turbo (non-battery).  Years ago I used the Norelco \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; rotary system which turned me off to electrics.  The Braun was a pleasure to use.  My hair type is considered thick but not real heavy.  Like most it will take about a week for my skin to get truly acclimated to the unit, but the first shave was a pleasure.  A dry shave is more convenient but not as \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; as a shower/blade shave.  The Braun shaved about as close as my blade.  If you shave after getting out of the shower, your face is \\&quot;plumped\\&quot; by the moisture and *feels* smoother initially.  After you&#x27;ve been out of the shower for about an hour, you will notice your face is not as smooth because it dried out from the shower -- unless your an obsessive moisturizing dude.  Dry shavers are designed to NOT be used after the shower because your skin needs to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  I did have a few stray hairs left over that it just could not get to.  I used the trimmer to hit those hairs (causing them to stick up more) and then the shaver head which took care of it quickly.  So it wasn&#x27;t that hard or long to shave.  I did use &#x27;Lectric pre-shave splash and Neutrogena post shave which helped avoid razor burn.  I still feel a bit of it (nothing major), but hopefully it will subside after a week and my skin is used to the unit.  Overall, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Does not burn the skin.  Cuts very close and leaves very few hairs that are missed. &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to most men.</li>
    <li> Bought after comparing several other stores and site.  Amazon offered both the best price and service.</li>
    <li> So, i&#x27;ve been using an old Remington shaver for about 5 or 6 years now, and I was just accustomed to it taking forever to get a decent shave. Never thought twice about having to go over and over the same area numerous times before I actually saw any difference. I have to tell, I&#x27;ve \\&quot;seen the light\\&quot;. Now I actually enjoy shaving. The old Remington is the only one I have to compare this with, but so far, I&#x27;m extremely impressed. I actually enjoy shaving now, and don&#x27;t have any problem doing it every morning. I have had this shaver for about a month and have noticed little to no razor burn, and I do like the cleaning feature. However, just don&#x27;t turn it to clean right before you fall asleep, as it is a little loud and makes some clicking noises that even made my dog jump right off the bed! But other than that, I highly recommend this shaver...use and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I do not see any difference in this razor than My other brawn razor which I had for years ( brawn 7550 ) I realy wanted to see a big improvement but I did not for the price of this item I expected alot better.</li>
    <li> I bought this razer as a replacement for my Nerelco (the one that dispenses cream).  I simply love it.  It took a bit getting used to as far as the design goes, but I am very happy with the shave I get.  My norelco was very hard to clean and always seamed to have a musty smell to it.  Not with the Braun.  I just drop it in the cleaner, press the button, and in about 1/2 hour, the razer is clean, oiled and nearly like it came out of the box.  While not a complaint, I see a few areas they could improve this.  First, the AC plug adaptor is VERY obtrusive.  It sticks out from the wall about 4\\&quot; and in my small bathroom gets in the way.  You would think they could make more of a flush mounted design.  Second, as the cleaning fluid ages (they say you should replace it every 30 days) it looses it&#x27;s freagrance.  While the scent during the last two weeks is not nearly like my musty old nerelco, it is still not as \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; as the first few weeks.  Maybe they could work on the formula and make the formula last the whole 30 days.  EIther way, these are not complaints, just suggestions.  I would recommend this razor highly.  If the price is too high, you might consider its younger brother, the 8985.  The only difference I found is the lack of the LCD screen, which is replaced by several lights that indicate the charge, etc...</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for thick and thin growing hairs. I am very happy with my purchase, and would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> I got tried of paying around $3.00 for one fuson razor baldes.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome after the 3 first shaves, due to machine adjust to the curve of the face, after that is just awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been thinking about purchasing an electric razor for a while, but was hesitant in doing so because I have never bought one for myself and because of the pricetag.  But because I was tired of putting razor to water and was looking for a quicker solution, I decided to go ahead and purchase one.  Before giving Amazon my credit card info though, I did some research and found that this Braun razor received a lot of good reviews.  After a little hesitation, I went forward and made the purchase.  As usual, Amazon shipped the product quickly and I was anxious to get started.  Setup was extremely easy, putting in the dispenser was a cinch, and all I needed to do was let the razor charge before the first usage... Much to my surprise, the Braun shaved pretty darn well.  It&#x27;s not as close as using a razor blade, but it&#x27;s close enough.  You can get a close shave by \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; up your skin (they give you tips in the manual).  All in all, I&#x27;m glad that I made this purchase because I can get a clean shave really fast.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I bought the 8995 after being happy for years with my 8595 (problem with the recharging base).  The 8995 feels a little lighter and more precise than the discontinued 8595, but I recommend buying whichever you can find cheaper.  The 8995&#x27;s recharging base works for both, so now I have 2 excellent shavers. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter design of this model is the best yet.  The unit is quiet and the new cleaning system is great with it&#x27;s ability to sense the cleaning time needed thus conserving the cleaning solution.  Well worth the additional cost.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and he loves it.  He says his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is not as noticeable (at 5 pm) as when he shaved with a traditional razor.  He loves it so much he convinced his father to go buy one.</li>
    <li> I had a 3 blade rotary shaver years ago. It tore my face up so bad after I stopped using it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver, however, is awesome. I never broke out once or got razor burn one time. I used to shave at best twice per week because I didn&#x27;t have the time. This razor is easy, fast and reliable. I shave everyday now. It takes me about 3 minutes (I know because the shaver has a timer) to shave. It cleans itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I clean the shaver everyday. It normally requires an economy clean. The cleaning cartridges last about two months which is better than advertised. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wish I would have bought this razor sooner. I would recommend it to anyone interested and would pay full price anytime for it.</li>
    <li> This is my second complete system Braun Shaver. I can&#x27;t say enough about the product. It&#x27;s hands down the best shaver I have ever owned, and the closest shave. I also have a few travel size Braun&#x27;s that are excellent.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best shaver I have ever used. I have a really tough beard so it&#x27;s not the closest shave, but it is the most comfortable and still as close as I need. I finally found a razor that I can shave with everyday without getting razor bumps. The cleaner works great too, and it holds a charge for about a month for me - even shaving everyday without charging it.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!  After just 2 shaves, this shaver has given me the most comfortable and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced with an electric shaver.  And I&#x27;ve had several Braun shavers previously, as well as some others, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers almost exclusively for nearly thirty years, and the 8000 Series of the Braun 360° Complete is by far the most advanced, best shaving shaver I have used so far.  I switched to Braun from Norelco when Braun came out with the Flex Integral, having also used a Sunbeam and a Remingtion. I have progressed through the Braun line, using the Activator and now the 360° Complete as each shaver neared the end of its useful life.  I usually replace a shaver when the battery fails to hold a charge for a full week, and the Brauns last for five years or more every time.  I am so pleased with the quality and performance of the Braun shavers, I never even consider another brand when it comes time for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  What impressed me most about this new shaver is the new technology in the blades.  I have a beard that grows in many directions and I have always had to shave and reshave each area of my face in order to cut the hairs growing in the different directions.  Because of the new style of foil and the sharpness of the blades, a couple of passes over each area of my face is all it takes to get a nice, close shave.  My beard is fairly coarse, and even with a blade it has always begun to feel somewhat rough late in the morning after an early morning shave.  With this shaver, my face still feels smooth early in the afternoon.  It has also literally cut my shaving time in half, from six minutes to three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would also like to mention the quality of the motor in the 360° Complete.  It is by far the quietest and most powerful motor I have ever used.  I can barely hear the motor running while I am shaving, but I can tell that the blades are moving faster than any other model of shaver I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased, and am using the Model 8995, because I like the digital readout on the shaver.  The more inexpensive models, however, use the same blades and the same motor.  If the fancy readout doesn&#x27;t matter that much to you, you will certainly be happy with any of the other models of the 360° Complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I realize that the expense of a top-of-the-line shaver could make a person wary of spending that much money just to try one.  I have never had any qualms about purchasing the latest Braun shaver, and I have never been disappointed.  I would only caution anyone using an electric shaver for the first time to not judge the shave he gets until he has used the shaver regularly for at least three weeks.  Also, never shave right after washing your face.  The drier your skin, the closer and more comfortable the shave will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Braun has brought electric shaving technology into the twenty-first century with its latest model, the 360° Complete.

    <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric razors.  While they&#x27;re safer, they rarely cut even close to the bladed razors.  I&#x27;ve gone through 2 Remington and 2 Norelco razors in 15 years.  I got sick of the top-of-the-line Norelco not getting the hair from under the jawline.  This one, though pricey, shaved my face perfectly smooth the first use.  When paired with William&#x27;s Lectric Shave, you&#x27;d swear you were 10 again (facial follicaly speaking).  There have been complaints that the cleaning is loud and I can attest to that, but I only noticed it the first few cleanings in the morning.  I live with 2 light sleepers, one who sleeps with with door open and one with door closed and after a month they were never bothered.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best razor I have ever owned and the least grizzled the non-goateed part of my face has been since girls stopped being icky.  That&#x27;s German engineering for you.</li>
    <li> When my old Braun expired after 5 years (batteries) I decided to opt for the 8995 360.  This unit arrived promptly and was packaged well. Little chance of any shipping damage.  The shaver had a nice feel in the hand and was balanced well.  It was slightly heavier than my old unit.  It comes with a protective hard case for travel.    WOW! Shaving technology has made huge strides in the last 5 years.  This shaver makes my face feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.  Fast, clean and smooth, even the toughest parts of my face and neck shaved cleanly and with much less time than my older Braun.  This is the best shave I have ever had.     I also like the fact that the shaver gets immaculately cleaned after every use.  The shaver is in like new cleanliness after the cleaning cycle.     I expect to get a month of cleaning on a cartridge of cleaner but It has only been a couple of weeks since I started using it and so far it still reads full.      I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
    <li> Have used an electric shaver for some 50 years and this is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful shaver for all men. It is solid built and easy to use, and easy to clean after use. The battery is very strong after the first charge for almost a month. A bit pricy but worth every single penny. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver about 15 times so far.  It works great.  My hair is thick and hard to cut.  This shaver cuts 95% which is fantastic for me.  I follow through with a regular razor and my shave is excellent.  This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever purchased.  So other shaver has cut this close.</li>
    <li> Perfect razor!  He can shave in a fraction of the time and still be just as smooth.  It also doesn&#x27;t hurt for him to shave twice a day to get rid of the 5&#x27;oclock shadow...very quick!</li>
    <li> The Braun 8995 is definitely &#x27;the best of the best&#x27;.  Most consumer report-type documents list the Braun 8985 as being the best value in electric shavers today.  However, the 8985 has the limitation of being strictly corded.  Both the 8985 and 8995 are self cleaning and very close shaving, but the 8995 has the additional advantage of being used both as a corded and uncorded shaving instrument.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  I have been using Braun shavers for many years and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.  This one was a bit pricey, but I have grown to like the ability to clean it like it is brand new. I don&#x27;t put it in the cleaner after each use.  Instead I run it through the cleaner cycle once a week on the weekend. Would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> i needed something that would get all that I needed to make for a smooth shave and this Braun is the truth. I could sit and look at every aingle in my mirror and make sure that I had it all smooth and this did the trick. all faces are different and different shaver&#x27;s operate differently from face to face ,but this one just did it all the way right. this is very full and complete and does the Job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun electric razors since college - my dad bought his first one when I was a kid. My second Braun 6520 had reached the end of its life a few months ago, replaced the foil and cutter but the battery was depleted and wouldn&#x27;t hold any charges. After reading some mixed reviews, and seeing the $50 coupon I decided to purchase this. After letting it fully charge, I found that the shave wasn&#x27;t really worth the $150 cost. I did get a decent shave, but nothing better than my 6520 from 4 years ago (which I also bought from Amazon for a mere $59.88). I don&#x27;t clean it with every shave as I&#x27;ve heard this would shorten the life of the &#x27;clean and renew&#x27; refills (they are pretty expensive). Battery charges don&#x27;t feel to last too long either. Daily shaves only take 3:21 mins to complete (has a timer on it). The cleaning process is pretty loud and one way to preserve the fluid is to remove the refills and close them  tightly. Again, the 8995 is over priced and over rated.</li>
    <li> I really liked the razor, however the hair on my neck grows in odd directions and the razor couldn&#x27;t pick it up. But on the hair above my jaw the razor was amazing. It took one stroke and my hair was gone and my skin smooth. I wish it worked on my neck, so if ur hair grows in odd directions i dont think this razor is the correct choice for u</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and have not had good luck with electric razors in the past.  I am one hairy guy having to shave once a day (and probably should twice a day but never do).  I decided to try one again based on Consumer reports recommendation.  I have been extremely happy with the new shaver for the first month I have been using it (7 days a week).  It is almost as close a shave as a razor.  I use in the car on the way to work and it is fast and easy to shave. Cleaning is easy and you don;t have to worry about lubricating it since it is done automatically.  Pros: Close shave, fast, don&#x27;t need to go over same area more than 1 or 2 times, cleaning system, charging and battery life. Cons: Cheap plastic case that doesn&#x27;t stay closed well, brush in case not secured and falls out easily, sometimes when taking plastic blade guard off the head comes off with it. I also had it get stuck in the cleaning base one time but was probably user error- my fault not understanding how to release it.  Trimmer works well, but difficult to see for precision trimming. I highly recommend the shaver and would buy one again.  (One final question: As we get older why does hair grow everywhere you don;t want it and doesn&#x27;t grow where we do want it?)</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  I have been using electrics for probably 15 years and this is the closest shave I have gotten from one.  Just be sure to keep the head changed otherwise it gets dull and pulls more than it cuts.  Also keep the head clean with the base.  I was skeptical at first if the base was really worth it.  The lubricating properties of the cleaning solution really do enhance the shavers performance.</li>
    <li> Closeness of shave is excellent and well exceeded my expectations. Automatic cleaning process works well. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I had rotary shaver for years and was very happy with it.Then I read reviews about this one ,which suppose to be best electric shaver there is.I gave my old one to my son(he loves it) and got me this one.I really like it ,but I have hard time to shave really smoothly on my throat ( face is OK).</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!  I have sensitive skin and most electric razors would pull at my hairs and be very painful.  This shaver doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt at all.  I alternate every 2 days with this electric shaver and the blade razor.  I must say it&#x27;s worth every penny.  The only difference I see with cleaning it everyday compared to a couple times a week is that the longer you wait to clean it then the more time it requires to clean the shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have had in 20 years, and you can forget the olden days. This one is great, and the cleaning system is a bit expensive for refills, but easy, handy and effective. You will never get a shave as close as a blade, but this one gets as close as possible. I have put away the hassle of a blade.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver that gave me as close a shave as my blade shaver.  Easy to clean.  What&#x27;s not to like about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my father&#x27;s birthday, he enjoys it immensely. He has a very thick beard, so shaving would always be a chore for him. This shaver provides the closest shave that any electronic shaver has ever provided. He loves how it feels brand new everytime since it comes with a cleaner. Overall, GREAT product.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these approximately year ago one for house and one for corporate apartment.  Less then 4 months starting having problems with getting them to make contact in the cleaning charging station.  I used wide range of items to try to hold the shaver in place; and now nothing works.  They are not worth the money; plus you have to continue buy the cleaning solution.   Not long after I started having the problems with Brauns I purchased a Panasonic wet dry shaver for travel purposes.  I actually used the Panasonic more than the Brauns; it shaves cleaner closer and definitely a lot easier to clean and you don&#x27;t have to buy any cleaning solution-had zero problems with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my spouse for a \\&quot;just because\\&quot; gift.  He has really sensitive skin and shaving with a blade oft-times caused him major problems with skin eruptions, sore and irritated skin.  He&#x27;s never found an electric razor that met his standards - until I got him this Braun.  The first couple of times he used it he said it did an adequate job, the shaver cut the hair to where it looked good but it didn&#x27;t make him feel clean in that when you rubbed his face and head (he shaves his head) there was that &#x27;beginning of sandpaper feel&#x27;.  He&#x27;s had the razor 2 weeks now and loves it.  We don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing differently than he did the first few times he used it (and maybe his skin has just adjusted to the electric razor) but now there&#x27;s a totally clean feel to his face and head when he shaves.  You would be hard pressed to tell it wasn&#x27;t a blade shave.  He can now shave every day and he has no problems with the problems he had with a blade.  (He got a shaving waiver from the military because of the problems he had when shaving with a blade).  It&#x27;s simple to clean.  You don&#x27;t have to use the cleaning solution as often as is recommended and best of all, he&#x27;s happy with it!!  I can&#x27;t thank you enough for making a product that actually does what it says.  And the vendor I bought this product from was the best I&#x27;ve EVER dealt with. I&#x27;d give this product and the vendor more than 5 stars but Amazon won&#x27;t give me that opportunity!</li>
    <li> As my first electric razor, I&#x27;m sort of satisfied with its performance. IT does not give that close shave as you get from the traditional razor (Gillette Fusion or Schick Quattro). But I guess, it is ok for everyday purpose when you don&#x27;t need that close shave. Certainly, it is very convenient &amp; quick to use. I do get the smoothness on my face, but it is not that good on neck. I have to use it multiple times and move around in different directions after stretching the neck to make it work somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system does a good job, however it increases the operating cost, since you have to buy the cleaning liquid. I use the supplied brush to clean the razor and move it gently perpendicular to the blade to clean it. Depending on the usage, I try to optimize the cleaning fluid consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is very good and per the manual is to be replaced every 18 months. Mine is going pretty good since last 10 months..hope it does well for next 8 month too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplied travel box serves its purpose well when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is good to buy if you get it in $110-$130 range.</li>
    <li> This is my very first electrical shaver. I never used it before. Honestly, I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an electric razor. All the reviews are true about how it takes some time for your face to adapt to the foil head.  It&#x27;s not a close as a blade....because it&#x27;s not a blade.  But the time it has saved me and the fact that I can use it everyday without irritation has made it an overall good purchase.</li>
    <li> When I asked him what he thought of the Braun 8995 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver, my son answered that he loved it!  Anything negative, I asked. &lt;br /&gt;He answered \\&quot;No\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> First, I have never owned any razor other than a Braun.  So, for 21 years, I have used Braun.  It definetly cuts better, for me, than the Norelcos.  This Braun is just a slight bit better than the best they had previously.  Also, it does take longer for the cleaning cycle than my previous Braun.  Overall, though, I am still a believer in Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> For those of you who worry about razor burns. Worry no more. This guy will not do that. Unlike Norelco, this is by far the best. My Braun 8995 works great and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else.</li>
    <li> Once every ten years or so I try an electric razor. Up until now, I&#x27;ve always been disappointed and returned to wet shaving. This razor, however, is a different story. It gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had (including wet shaving with a single edge blade). Instructions for most electric razors usually warn the user that there is a two week period that is necessary for your skin to get used to the razor. In my case, this meant two weeks of a red and raw neck. Not with the Braun razor! Comfortable and close from the start. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with my new Braun 8995 360 shaver! I previously owned a Norelco 3 head shaver that I used for years. The Norelco did a fine job, but would leave me with moderate razor burn and would not get as close as a blade. My new Braun gets my beard as close as a blade, and gives me very minimal razor burn. I would recomend the Braun to everyone! Just keep in mind that it is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> For many years now I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors and loved them.  I decided to try a foil razor just to see how it compares to my Norelco 9170 XL Smart Touch.  Let me tell you, there is no comparison.  The Braun 8995 360 Complete is by far the best of the two.  It shaves much faster than the Norelco and I think the shave is closer.  It also seems to get the hair on my neck with much greater ease.  The automatic cleaning system is very quiet and leaves the razor looking like it has never been used.  It also lubricates the razor and leaves it smelling like citrus.  Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with this razor and I only wish that I had made the switch sooner.</li>
    <li> I have used braun shavers for the last 10 years and can assure this is the best ever available shaver. It is quiet, have a battery that lasts for a week, makes a very close shave and, besides all, it is a beautiful piece. The only negative point goes for the case, plastic made, that can easily open and let the shaver umprotected. The older models came with a leather case with a zipper.</li>
    <li> This new top of the line self cleaning razor shaves as close as a blade and twice as fast !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver. Better than previous models. Auto detect for recharge very convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for over 30 years, have a light beard and sensitive neck. My last shaver was a Norelco triple header that did an okay job if I shaved everyday, but tore up my neck and hurt badly if I didn&#x27;t shave everyday. Wanting to save my neck from future razor burn, I checked Consumer Reports and saw very good recommendations for the Braun 360. I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about 3 weeks and although it does an adequate job, I would not rate it as highly as CR users did. &lt;br /&gt;Shave is okay but you have to work at it, stretching the skin all over the place and making many passes in different directions. Again, I have a light beard so expected somewhat less effort with this shaver. Good news is it doesn&#x27;t burn my neck and is comfortable to use. As others have said it is noisy and, to me, somewhat awkward to hold after using the more upright triple header styles. It will handle two or three days growth very well, but has trouble with lighter stubble. The cleaning station is nice, but same comments apply as others have made; its noisy, slow and totally unnecessary to use every day. &lt;br /&gt;All in all a good shaver, but IMO overpriced and not as good as indicated.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver.  It is well built and has an excellent cleaning system; however the shave is not quite as close as the shaves I got from my Braun 7526. An expensive shaver, but one built to last many years.  I am very pleased with my 8995.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a couple of months now after receiving it as a birthday present.  Prior to this, I had been using a Norelco-brand shaver.  The ergonomics of this unit took me a while to get used to since this shaver is sort of rectangular shaped and the Norelco was more triangular (which I actually preferred).  This shaver does indeed give a very nice shave, and the self-cleaning base/charger is really slick.  However, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if it really is the shaver itself or just the fact that it has new blades in it and would my Norelco be just as good if I had gone out and spent $40 on replacement blades??  Either way, if you are looking for a good new shaver, this is definitely one to consider - although consider saving some money and try putting replacement blades in your current shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers for the past twenty or so years.  They are consistently of the highest quality and definitely give a close shave with no discomfort.  This newest model is the best of them all.  Absolutely outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace a Braun 7540.  This is my third Braun.  I had a low end Remington before that.  I like the Brauns because they are good quality, provide a good shave, have long battery life, and pack smaller than the three-headed rotary razors.  I have never tried the better quality razors from other makers so cannot make a direct comparison.      The Braun 7540 was a great razor.  I had it for at least 6 years and only replaced it because the battery or motor was beginning to wear down.  I read many reviews of the Braun higher end razors and a few competitors, and chose the 8995 for several reasons.  First, I was happy with my first two Brauns.  Second, it had strong reviews overall.  Third, it packs smaller than other brands.  And I can afford the more expensive razor even though I don&#x27;t NEED the fancy display and self-cleaning system.  I was sceptical of the cleaning system, including cost of cleaner cartridges, but decided to give it a try.      When the razor first arrived, I was a bit concerned about its build quality.  As I read in a couple reviews, it seemed a bit more plastic than I expected for the money.  Then I compared it to my old razor that I was happy with and decided it was good to go.  My one concern is the lock mechanism.  I am interested to see how long it lasts (my 7540 lock broke about 3 years ago; the razor still works, but I had to pull out the button and spring for the razor to work).      The razor works great.  It cuts closer and faster than my 7540, cutting my shave time down about 1/3.  I have to reshave my tough spots less times with this razor.  I did get minor razor burn (nothing visible) the first couple times I used it, but I quickly adjusted.      The cleaning system is nifty.  I don&#x27;t use it every day because I don&#x27;t think it is necessary and because it is actually a bit noisy and may disturb my wife.  I use it once or twice a week and it works great.  The cleaning time can be up to an hour, and it turns the razor on periodically, thus the noise.  The base still tells me the washing fluid is full, so I cannot comment on how long the cleaning fluid will last.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for over a month.      Some have commented that the cleaning fluid evaporates even if you don&#x27;t use it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed this.  If I do, I will remove the cartridge between cleanings and put the cap back on.  Braun does need to sell the cleaning fluid in bulk containers allowing us to refill the cartridges ourselves and reducing the amount of waste.      Overall, excellent razor.  Build quality feel is about 90% as good as my old 7540, but that is subjective.  Shaves great (average beard thickness, some tough to get hair on my neck).    3 year 6 month update: The razor is still functioning great.  I have noticed some deterioration in the battery, but this could be because I don&#x27;t store it in the charger so the battery gets cycled to near empty regularly.  I don&#x27;t have the counterspace to keep it charging.  Still, I go over a week or two without having to charge it.  I have not yet replaced the blade/screen yet and it still shaves well.  Also, I only clean it once or twice per month.  In between, I tap it in the sink and blow out the shavings every couple shaves.  The cleaning system is still working fine.  In order to keep the cleaning fluid from evaporating, I remove it from the base and put the cap back on.  It only takes a minute to do, and I&#x27;ve saved a small fortune (likely a hundred or two dollars over three years) by doing this.  When the battery gets low, the digital screen will give you minutes of shave time remaining.  It seems accurate - though I&#x27;ve never actually clocked it - a very handy feature.  Overall, still 5 stars.  Very happy with the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with the Braun 360. I&#x27;ve use Norelco previously. The cleaning unit while somewhat gimmicky works quite well. I have a tough beard and have been impressed with the closeness of the shave. To get a good shave it does take about 6 minutes but leaves my face feeling smooth and not irritated. I prefer not use any pre-shave and just shave dry. The shaver works as well as my old Norelco but feels of higher quality and workmanship. I&#x27;ve ordered for a long time from Amazon and this order like others arrived on time and error free. The reason for 4 stars and not five, is that this electric like others does not get as close as a blade but it&#x27;s approaching it and certainly it&#x27;s nice not to have to use a septic pencil. I&#x27;d recommend to others who are looking for an alternative to blade shaving.</li>
    <li> This is worst shaver that I&#x27;ve every owned.  The shaver has all these gadgets, probably why it costs so much.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t deliver as advertised. The shave was never close, no where near as close as my Gillette \\&quot;Fusion Power\\&quot; razor, and I broke out into a rash after every use.  I&#x27;ll never purchase another electric shaver.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I switched from using Mach 3 and Fusion razor blades every other day to this Braun and have been very happy with the shaves from it.  Of course it is not as close as a razor blade, but that is a good thing because if it were you would have the irritation you get from a razor blade.  Overall, an excellent electric razor.  Highly Reccomended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the $200+ retail price for this shaver.  Even at $160 I&#x27;m very disappointed. I&#x27;m a long time Norelco user and I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot as I wasn&#x27;t happy with how the Norelco did around my neck area.  I&#x27;m thin, so my face/neck doesn&#x27;t have extra skin, so it&#x27;s tough to get the hair in certain areas.  This shaver does really well on my face, a much closer shave then my old Norelco shaver.  Also, this has the best darn trimmer I&#x27;ve ever seen, 10x better then Norelco.  However, I think it does worst on my neck.  If I ever want to look extra clean I use a regular shaver for my neck.    Advise to make your cleaning solution last much longer.  First, clean your shaver every 4 times you shave, no need to do it everytime.  Second, manually take the foil off and shake the hair out of it so you don&#x27;t get your solution dirty.  With this method you can expect about 3-4 months out of 1 solution.    Bottom line: I can get a top end Norelco off eBay for about $75. At 2x the price, it&#x27;s simply not worth it.  If money isn&#x27;t an issue, then by all means.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin on my face, and I have gotten tired of my electric shavers leaving my skin red and irritated! I had heard many good things about Braun shavers before I started looking for a new one. In the process of doing research, this shaver came up as being considered best in class by the reviewer that I read. I began looking into how much it would cost. I also read reviews like this one to see what other people thought of it. It sounded good, so I bought it.   I do not regret that decision!! Yes, it was a bit more expensive than my last shaver, but unlike my last shaver, I am not in pain when I finish and I don&#x27;t have embarrasing red splotches on my face and neck! This shaver is without a doubt the most comfortable shaver I have ever used! It also gives me a closer cut than any other electric shaver I have used. I don&#x27;t believe it is possible for an electric to cut as close as a razor, but for those of us who can&#x27;t use them, this is as good as it gets! Even my wife commented on how smooth my skin was after a shave!  The cleaning system that comes with the shaver is nice. I was a bit skeptical about it when I first read about it, but after using it for over a month, I believe it really is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to. I opened up my shaver after a cleaning cycle just to see if it&#x27;s really getting the clippings out. It is! I have read other reviews that say the cleaning solution doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;ve been using it over a month and it is still going strong. One thing I recommend doing to help extend the life of the solution is to clean it only every other day (or even more if you like). This seems to be extending the life of my cleaning solution. The only downside to the cleaner is that it takes up a fair bit of the counter space on my smallish bathroom counter. Not a problem if you have a large counter top, but something to consider if yours is small like mine.  All in all, I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone, especially if you have sensitive skin or if you are tired of not receiving the closest shave possible!</li>
    <li> The Braun is certainly better than electric razors of years gone by.  It&#x27;s great for week-end touch-ups and as a travel convenience.  While it does shave pretty close, I don&#x27;t think ANY electric razor matches the close shave of wet-blade razor.  I use the Braun for every day, quick touch-ups and convenience, travel and such and the wet razor when I need a really CLOSE shave.  The cleaning system works well too. While it may be the best electric razor out there, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t beat the blade for a close shave.  It&#x27;s a great addition to a good grooming arsenal.</li>
    <li> Good delivery from Amazon of my Braun shaver, but I quess I didn&#x27;t do the order correctly because I did not get my $50 coupon for buying Braun product in October.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver a year ago when my Panasonic electric shaver stopped working.  I immediately noticed that the Braun gave me a much closer shave, without any irritation.  I have a very heavy beard, which is especially difficult to remove along my jaw and under my chin, because the hairs grow in every direction.  I use the Braun twice each shave, once to reduce the thickness of the overall beard and the second time to remove those stubborn hairs in the jaw and chin areas that are not removed after the first pass.  For me, this product works as well as a disposable razor, without the need to steam up my bathroom and apply creams and gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was somewhat hesitant about having to use the cleaning system that is built into the Braun, but I experimented shaving with and without the cleaning system, and I can say that the cleaning system works as described.  It definitely sharpens and lubricates the blades, which makes for a closer, less irritating shave.  I have to replace the alcohol-based cleaning fluid about every two months, but the cost of the refills is reasonable.  Recently I had to replace the foil and cutter system because I was prompted to do so by the shaver and I also noticed that I was getting annoying nicks when I shaved, something that had never occurred before.  The manual says that the foil and cutter system needs to be replaced every eighteen months, but for me it was necessary in twelve months.  I attribute the early purchase to a thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several weeks ago, I had the occasion to try the Norelco 1090 arcitec electric shaver, but after a week of using the Norelco, I was back to the Braun.  Unlike the Braun, the Norelco simply did not give me a close shave.  I have used various electric shavers for over thirty years, and I believe that they are a matter of personal preference.  This is borne out in the reviews; they vary greatly because the users&#x27; experiences with electric shavers vary greatly.  Moreover, the major manufacturers (Braun, Panasonic and Norelco) are constantly upgrading their products, and it is difficult to know if the upgrades are gimmicks (and justifications for higher prices) or real improvements.  Therefore, the selection of an electric shaver is largely trial and error, and comparison shopping is a must.  For me, based on price and results, the Braun 8995 is an excellent product which I recommend unconditionally.or manufacturers (Braun, Panasonic and Norelco) are constantly upgrading their products, and it is difficult to know if the upgrades are gimmicks (and justifications for higher prices) or real improvements.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 25 years.  This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It does not approach the closeness of a blade, but you also aren&#x27;t bleeding when you are done shaving.  So, there is a trade-off there.      Two items to consider before purchasing.  1)  It has a large base that needs to be plugged in to work.  This takes up bathroom counter space.  2) The shaver uses consumable cleaning cartridges.  You are going to have to be buying these consumables for as long as you own the shaver if you plan to use it as recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought these (two of them) as gifts for my sons.  They have used it for the last month or so.  They tell that they are completely satisfied with them. They get a close shave and the cleaning mechanism is excellent.</li>
    <li> This shaver is smooth on the job. The results are good &amp; should be even better if the booklet with the shaver is correct. The ability to have the shaver clean itself is good for me. I disliked taking the others apart &amp; trying to get all the pieces back inside correctly. This one just GRUNTS &amp; GROANS as it does its tasks. Well worth the money to me.</li>
    <li> absolutely love the shaver, it is so good, that my girlfriend now compare my chin to the infant&#x27;s chin;  recommended!</li>
    <li> My wife bought me Braun 8995 shaver for father&#x27;s day (although I hinted I wanted one).  Some consumer ratings said it was the best and I totally agree.  This electric razor has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 50 years, always with an electric razor.  Now, as age has taken my hair, I shave my complete head every day.  This razor shaves much closer than any of the other rotary and non-rotary razors I have purchased over the years.  Another impressive feature is the cleaning cycle you can choose.  I usually am prompted to do a normal cleaning every day but only do a cleaning cycle every other day.  For an easy, close shave with no messy cleanup, I highly recommend the Braun 8995 360 Complete!</li>
    <li> I went from a Remington to this Braun about 6 months ago. Immediately noticed the clipping blade/mechanism is not as powerful or effective as the Remington&#x27;s. Now I rarely need to shave every day so it is often the case I will use the clipper to trim it down. With this shaver it was simply not possible and i have anything but a thick beard.    I find the shaver is adequate if the hair is standing straight but if you have irregular facial hair at all (growing along skin or flatter) it completely misses the hair, even the clipper does not get it all.    Thankfully Walmart takes anything back and i was able to exchange for the Remington Titanium for less than 50% the cost of the 360 and for my face it is twice the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have one of these Braun 8985 systems and it is absolutely the worst shaver I have owned, way behind a Remington and a Norelco. The active foil doesn&#x27;t extend to the end of the head instead there is more than a quarter of an inch of gap to the end of the head. Consequently it will not shave up close to the ears around the jaw line. This shaver continually misses hair and requires me to \\&quot;Scrub\\&quot; my face with it to do a ho-hum job or resort to a blade for best results. I had a Wahl shaver before I got this one and it does a first class job the first time and only cost me a little more than 10% of what I spent for this beast. When I&#x27;m not particular how I look, I use the Braun, but if I want a good close comfortable shave I reach for my Wahl. I certainly don&#x27;t want their newer model. When this Braun thing goes toes up I&#x27;m going back to my Wahl, sorry I left.</li>
    <li> Great product! The intuitive cleaning sensor aids in appropriate cleaning of the razor for the \\&quot;dirtiness\\&quot; of the blades and foil. This aids in conservation of the cleaning fluid. The razor works well and shaves close, closer than prior models IMHO.</li>
    <li> This item is the series 5 590cc not the 8995. The 8995 is a completely different than the 590cc. 590cc is a smaller shaver. Not very happy that they didn&#x27;t fix my problem, twice in a row.</li>
    <li> Received as a Christmas present, I was going to \\&quot;make myself like it\\&quot; if it didn&#x27;t fully measure up.  No worries.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, from early Shick, later Remingtons, Norelcos &amp; even Braun&#x27;s, though they [Braun] were the best up to this point.  Fresh-out-of-the-carton shave was just plain fantastic.  Really, REALLY close - without taking any particular pains.  Subsequently, I have been using Williams \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; with it, hoping to extend the life of the shaver head, but it shaves fine either way.  Haven&#x27;t yet tried its cleaning station, having been on the road.  Can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity, yet - but I sure am happy on the honeymoon.  I never expected a shave this good from an electric razor.  Put me down as \\&quot;amazed\\&quot; and exceedingly pleased.  Post Script, July 2011 - Cleaning station works as advertised, and is very convenient.  I alternate the electric with regular Shick Quattro shaves, so the Braun hasn&#x27;t had tons of use, but it still shaves \\&quot;like new\\&quot; after 2 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about two months now, and (according the the shaver) I&#x27;ve shaved 35 times.  This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, and before I bought this I researched and read many reviews, and was pretty sure this was one of the best ones. After I used it for the first time I was a little disappointed. It took me about twice as long to shave compared to a normal razor, and afterwords I could feel a lot of little hairs it would miss. In order for me to get a decent shave I would have to use one hand and stretch my skin and go over spots a lot with it, but could still see it missing some of the ones that were laying flat against my face.  I finally got the hang of it, and can now get a pretty good shave, but it still takes quite a while and sometimes can&#x27;t get them all. If I ever need to get somewhere quick I always reach for my manual razor and shaving cream.    Another little annoyance, is the self cleaning thing. It has 3 different cleaning modes (eco, normal, intensive), and I figured it would select the mode based on how clean/dirty it was; This is not the case. I would clean it pretty good manually after every shave because I was hoping to save money by not going through the cleaning solution as fast. So after one shave and putting it back in the charger it said it just needed an \\&quot;eco\\&quot; clean. If I would shave, then clean it manually, then not put it back in the base and shave again, and clean it manually again, then put it in the base it said it needed a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; clean. So it&#x27;s not based on how dirty it is, it&#x27;s based on how long it&#x27;s used between cleans. So it&#x27;s probably better to just let it clean itself using the \\&quot;eco\\&quot; clean after every shave, because I think three \\&quot;eco\\&quot; cleanings is less time than an \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; one, meaning less cleaning solution used.    After 2 months and 35 shaves; According to the base, the cleaning solution is still full, so I&#x27;m happy with that. But the other day the display on the shaver said to replace foil and cutting head, I only saw it once, but I was hoping that would last for at least 6 months, we&#x27;ll see..</li>
    <li> I had been using the top of the line Braun model of about 5 years ago and decided to upgrade to this model.  I can tell no difference in the closeness of the shave between the two despite the hype and whoopla about the 360 degree technology cutting head.  One drawback of the 360 technology is that the cutters cannot be cleaned with the brush and therefore you have to use the supplied cleaning device with the circulating liquid more frequently. This will increase the operating cost of the shaver.  Also, the cutting head refills are about twice the price of the previous model ones.    This is not to say that the shaver is not to be purchased, just wait until your older model quits.      I get the impression that companines have people search reviews on websites and vote against the ones that say their product is so so or even bad.  And even worse, write favorable reviews.  You can spot these by their style being like an advertising brochure.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this product. He was very pleased with the quality. Great elecric shaver!!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun for years.  Maybe I&#x27;ve had an old one (5000 series) but this new shaver is great.  The shave is very close and the shaver picks up those annoying random hairs that don&#x27;t seem to want to be cut.  Even my wife noticed the difference.  I thought the automatic cleaning system would be a pain but I really like it.  One warning, don&#x27;t clean the shaver if a light sleeper is near by.  It does make some noise while cleaning the shaver.  Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this shaver.  I actually look forward to using it every day.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very nice.  It is easy to handle, and solidly constructed.  I have used it now for three weeks, and I have no complaints.  It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but as I use to also shave my head, it doesn&#x27;t nick/cut/slice open the skin.  The self-clean feature is wonderful, as it smells great, and all of the clippings are removed.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric shaver.</li>
    <li> It cuts the beard, easy,and smooth,no pulling whiskers. Easy to use, fast clean-up.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall a great razor. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver. The base cleans it thoroughly, and since I started using it I&#x27;ve been getting a close shave in 1/3 the time it took me using a regular razor. The shave timer is quite handy to estimate the time that it&#x27;ll take me to get ready in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great close shave is what you can expect from the 8995 shaver.  I had a previous Braun shaver for about 10 years and was a bit slow (hesitant) in purchasing another, but since I had a great experience with my previous Braun, I thought it was time to upgrade to a newer model.  Even with a 2-day stubble, the 8995 shaver had no problem.  I find that I am not having to go over shaved areas repeatedly to get a close shave - maybe once or twice in an area and that&#x27;s it.  I would highly recommend the Braun to all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use this shaver over nearly a month, now; my first electric razor.  I can&#x27;t find any reason for wanting to replace this it any time soon.  Before purchasing, I considered many other models, including other lower-end Braun series, Philips, and higher end Norelco and Remington models.  From what I gathered, I considered the Braun brand to be top of the line.  Buy it if you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Form&lt;br /&gt;The 360 is rather aesthetically pleasing.  The commercials last year were awesome, as it displayed an electric razor that literally washes itself when placed on its charger. The footprint of the charger itself is relatively large - nearly 5\\&quot; in diameter - it will fit nicely on a sink with a long countertop.  Every shave leaves a light citrus scent.  Although it weights a bit more than the average electric razor, it is still fairly light.  It fits well in averaged-sized hands, and when you turn it on, the sound, the feel, and the quality: it instills the confidence knowing that it will leave a fresh, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things that stand out is an LCD screen that frequently informs one of the battery levels and its &#x27;thought processes.&#x27;  Although I do not feel that it is a necessary feature, it&#x27;s nice.  When turned on, the razor is loud and smooth enough to let you know it will cut.  When it goes about your face, you need to run it at different angles in order to get all the hairs.  It does well when the hair is less than 3 mm; longer, and the trim feature (which works well with sideburns) should be used prior to getting a close shave.  The neck of the razor bends up and down to fit the angles of the shave; the blade end is a bit stiff; however, the metal itself does not flex to the contours of the skin, but still manages to get everything.  The closeness can be compared to razor blade quality.  It is that close.  The advantages include very little chance at nicks, and no need to carry shaving cream.  The cleaning feature works well: after you put the razor back in the charger it assesses how dirty the razor is, and adjusts its cleaning settings accordingly.  After you hit the clean button, it goes to work, taking approximately 30 to 50 minutes to clean.  If you don&#x27;t press the clean button and let the razor sit for a few days, the charger will update to a brisker cleaning setting, as it will take note the increased amount of debris collected along the razor.  It also knows not to clean if you&#x27;ve just removed the razor, turned on, but not used it, and then replaced it.  One can charge the 360 directly, if they must travel, instead of hauling the entire charger.  The batteries last quite a while uncharged, and for a week&#x27;s trip, the power chord is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Form and function were difficult to separate in this razor, because the two were so closely tied together. You need give your skin a few weeks to get used to the electric razor, also.  The first shaves feel very close.  Often, you need to pull your skin so that the razor can reach everything.  My only concerns were replacing the cleaning fluid.  It&#x27;s been a month and the chamber is still full of fluid, but I wonder how often it will need replacing.  I recommend this razor if one intends on switching from a razor blade-equipped razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (4/08/2010):&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this electric razor for more than 2.5 years, now.  Since then, my opinions about it have not changed.  I&#x27;ve replaced the blades as recommended, however I have noted that they were still very sharp when I took them out.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I can make the cleaning solution last longer if I shaved every day to prevent long hairs from accumulating along the blades and in the solution.  As a result, hairs don&#x27;t collect as quickly under the foil and the solution remains cleaner, longer.  This last bottle of solution is \\&quot;half full\\&quot; at even two months, amazing.  ***One important issue I need to point out, however, is that I&#x27;vehad to replace the charger once.  The problem here was that the connecting points between the charger/cleaner oxidized as time passed, so after a year, the charger no longer recognized the razor.  I replaced the piece, and have had no other issues since.***  On a final note, I recommend buying the cleaning solution straight from Amazon&#x27;s website.  Amazon has the option of subscribing to a service where the solution is automatically sent (at a discounted rate) every few months (as you decide).  Not a bad deal, since it costs less on Amazon than at a store, for me.blem here was that the connecting points between the charger/cleaner oxidized as time passed, so after a year, the charger no longer recognized the razor.

    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned and I have owned quite a few.  It is very easy to clean after using and the lcd display at the base of the shaver lets you know when the appropriate time to perform that function occurs.  This product is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many shavers and this is by far the best one I ever had... I recommended it is truly a great product.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time reviewing different shavers and this one had, by far, the best reviews.  It was also the most expensive, but I thought I would try it anyway.  I was very disappointed with the performance of this shaver.  I had high expectations based on the reviews.  The Braun 360 doesn&#x27;t shave near as close as the $80.00 dollar Remington that I had been using previously and the Gillette Blade Technology doesn&#x27;t seem to work as advertised.  The shaver is comfortable and light weight and the cleaning system seems to work well but overall the quality of the shave is not even close to that of a razor or the Remington I had been using.</li>
    <li> I have been using rotary-head shavers for many years and I was tired of the \\&quot;red neck\\&quot; syndrome and the harshness on my face.  On a whim I switched to this Braun linear shaver and have not looked back since.  I have owned the Braun for about for a little over  amonth now and I love the recharging/cleaning/lubrication station that it comes with.  The manual says to insert your shaver into the base every day, but it seems to be quite adequate to clean &amp; charge every other day.  I was also pleased to see in the manual that the charging base will, at some point in the future, decide that it needs to conduct a full discharge/recharge cycle automatically to keep the battery in a healthy state.  Bravo Braun!  It seems that you have taken care to automate everything!  I am also pleased that I do not need to use shave-talc on my face before shaving except when the humidity level gets quite high.  With my old rotary shaver I needed to use something on my face every time I shaved.</li>
    <li> I have never really liked electric razors.  I prefer the close shave of a blade.  However, upon reading the literature on this shaver I felt that I finally could get as close a shave (well maybe not quite)as a blade.  Given the cost of the shaver, I cannot sufficiently express my disappointment.  It is no closer in shave as any other shaver I tried years ago at a substantially lessor cost.  Yes, the self clearning feature is convenient and nice.  But, what good is that if the shaver sits in its cradle and is not used because it doesnt live up to the hype and the blade is still best.  If you really prefer an electric razor there are alot of cheaper alternatives that will give you just as close a shave.  Dont waste you money on this product like I did!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice shave (In about 6 minutes) and more than a week of battery life.  It begs for a cleaning each time, but I only do it about once a week.</li>
    <li> The ease of use and hopefully the durbability of the recharging stand for the 8000 series is a tremendous improvement.  Not having the telescoping arm means not having to lift the unit out of the medicine cabinet with each use.  Had two 7000 series shavers and both recharging stands broke just after one year of use (just after the warranty expired)--problem with both was the latch that kept the telescoping arm engaged with the shaver.    I get a nice, close shave with the 8995 and it seems excellent in catching those longer whiskers that evade most electrics and keep on growing.      Very pleased with the shaver and the pricing with Amazon&#x27;s $[...] rebate was very attractive. [...].</li>
    <li> Great shaver! It gives a good, close shave and I especially like the self-cleaning feature. Honestly, it really does a good job...</li>
    <li> I have to say I am disappointed in the quality of this shaver. After 2 weeks of use the foil on the shaver broke. And it was not due to the type of use. So after examining the foil I saw that it was just to thin to do the job without breaking. So I was able to change it with a foil head from my old braun shaver which foil is thicker. So I fixed one problem! Next thing which is acting up is the digital LED. It is indicating different things which it should not. If it goes I will be returning the shaver for something else!</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco for years. I tried this Braun because of the reviews and the product known for the quality. After using the razor, I must say I&#x27;m disappointed. I found the razor to be heavy, loud and worst of all, didn&#x27;t provide a good shave. I was also disappointed in the design of the body. I am average height &amp; weight (6&#x27;, 180#) but found the width of the razor to be wide and uncomfortable to hold while shaving. I must admit that I only gave it a couple of weeks but went back to my Norelco because of the issues noted.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Braun shaver I&#x27;ve used, beginning with one bought in Germany 30 years ago, and each has been better than the last.&lt;br /&gt;  The shave is closer and quicker than the earlier models, and the self-clean mechanism is a real convenience.&lt;br /&gt;  Highly recommended, and the price was the best I found.</li>
    <li> I purchased and started using the Braun 8995 in January 2008. I love it because it gives me a great shave. I find it takes about 4-6 minutes to get it done right. I can also redo something I missed with ease. The unit is solid enough but could use an all metal body. It is big enough for those with dexterity issues, though it would be better for me if it was slightly smaller.    I used to use Mach 3 and Sensor razors with my Conair lather heater. They worked but I tired of hot sticky lather on my face everyday after showering. I never really got them to shave my neck well unless I re-lathered and that was too time consuming. If you do shave like this though, use a lather heater. You will be glad you did.    I can get a fair amount of ingrown hairs on the sides of my face, usually they do not get too inflamed or go very deep but they seem less numerous with the Braun. I have fine curly/wavy blond hair that seems to want to get near the surface and then go sideways. I have ended this problem by using 1 crushed UNCOATED aspirin in 1 oz. of water and dabbing it on with my fingers after exfoliating with a bath cloth and after I have finished shaving.    Braun usage info:    You will likely need a few weeks to get used to it.    Use it with a clean, dry face (at least 30 minutes after showering) or you will bring out the \\&quot;intensive cleaning needed\\&quot; message. Never try and blow matter from the cutter block for the same reason. When refill gets closer to running out, let razor dry out after cleaning then pop foil off a look for nagging droplets. Blow them out from the inside to the outside. They can trigger the &#x27;intense cleaning&#x27; warning if not removed.    I pop and \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; the cutter/foil after use and clean it using base every other day (24 hours clock time) an and usually it always comes up \\&quot;economy\\&quot; cleaning (I suspect it will become \\&quot;normal\\&quot; after 36 hours.)    The cleaning stand does work well but I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time. I am covering it in a plastic grocery bag (closed and draped around base with the handles tucked under the cord stub protruding from base) to slow evaporation of the solution. Higher room temperature will in IMO be the biggest factor in how long it lasts, though some is &#x27;cooked off&#x27; the razor in the cleaning process. Refills in cooler months can last up to 10 more uses than refills used in warmer months. Lowest is 29 uses and highest is 39 so far.    I tried using to clean razor for a week or two without the base using brush and manually oiling it. The Braun is better with the alcohol. It irritated my skin somewhat to use oil or becuase it was not cleaned by alcohol and the razor did not shave as close. Clippercide (I do not know its active ingredient) or Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver silicone based spray might work.    I think the shave counter is annoying in that it should only count shaves of 2 minutes or more as shaves. I often shave for 2-3 minutes, wash my face, dry it a few minutes and then shave any spots I left half finished which only takes 30 seconds but counts as another shave on the master counter.    I have had no issue with making holes in the foil. I try not to press it too hard against my face.</li>
    <li> I really like the 8995 razor, it does a very good job shaving.  The problem I have, the foil tends to break every 2-3 months.  When I add that expense in, it tends to be very expensive.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I can&#x27;t get this shaver to do a clean shave on my neck. It simply can&#x27;t follow the curves of a neck very well. It does a great job on my face however. I continued to try it for about 3 months, and still couldn&#x27;t get a clean shave on my neck, and when I came close, I had to run it over my neck so many times that it causd irritation. Guess I&#x27;ll go back to my old shaver and just replace the foils.    The cleaning fluid seems like a gimmick. I never needed it before...</li>
    <li> I know it seems expensive for a shaver but you cant spend 50 dollars and expect a great shave consistently,i say consistantly becouse i have had cheaper shavers and their ok for a little while then they get dull or dirty cause you get tired of costantly cleaning them.This shaver does all it says it will do,cleans and lubricates itself(very well),it also has the closest shave i&#x27;ve found on an electric shaver any closer and it would take your skin off.You will feel good about this purchase,its high dollar shaver but well worth it,i guess its a personal choice how important is a good shave day in day out to you,if you like to stay well groomed with not alot of razor burn and can afford it buy all means get this one.</li>
    <li> My husband said it is a very good shaver. It took a few days to get used to the shaving head because he has always used the Norelco shavers with three rotating heads. The Braun is a closer shave. The cleaning system works very well and it is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a $120. dollar Phillips/Norelco shaver for about a year and I changed the rotary blades once. My skin was becoming irritated to the point of, hell with shaving I think I will grow a beard. Well to make a long story short I was told by my wife and son that I looked about 10 years older. That was all it took to push me to look for a better shaver. The Braun 360 Complete is like night and day comparing it with rotary shavers. It shaves alot closer in half the time! Plus it cleans itself and tells you (by the LCD)at what time you should put new foils and cutters, ( about 18 months). Absolutely tears up rotary shavers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have always shaved with a razor.  However, after years of frustration with shaving I finally decided to try an electric when I saw the advertising for this razor.  I can say that after about a week of using the razor, I think it is fantastic.  It isn&#x27;t quite as close as a blade, but it is very close.  It is barely a noticeable difference.  It was extremely fast and comfortable.  I found that I need an after shave lotion, as I think it dried my skin a bit.  However, it says in the manual that it should take about 3 weeks for your skin to adapt.  Once I used the lotion, it was fine on the first day.  After using a blade for so many years, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Do to it size and weight it is difficult to use. a smaller and lighter model  would be better</li>
    <li> Upon opening the box, and unpacking the unit, there is a sticker on it that says that it&#x27;ll take your beard up to two weeks to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to this unit.... So I&#x27;m already skeptical... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I shaved with the unit once it was charged.  My beard is light to begin with, and only had approx. 12 hours growth.  I must say the shave was as close as it would been with a fresh razor - maybe better...   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And now my wife won&#x27;t have at least two things to crab about - \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t you shave more often?\\&quot;  \\&quot;You shaved... So clean that stubble out of the sink!\\&quot;  She&#x27;s actually the love of my life...She just keeps me on the straight and narrow..... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco triple header product line for over 30 years. I usually purchased a middle of the line razor (under $100) and have been reasonably happy with them.    I decided to buck the trend when my current triple header started to go downhill. I checked Consumer Reports and decided the try out the Braun because it was rated higher than the triple header. After about a week&#x27;s adjustment time, I am much happier with the Braun. The shave is definitely closer and smoother than my triple header, and the time to shave seems to be a bit faster.  The Braun is noticibly noisier, but that does not bother me.    I got the model (8995) with all the bells and whistles because, well, just because.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband.  He absolutely loves it!  He said it is the best shaver he has ever used.  It leaves his face very smooth and it causes no irritation to the skin.  And he loves the ease of the daily cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for 20 years, and this is the best shaver I have ever owned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of problems with shaving due to ingrown hairs and razor burn on my neck.  My previous two shavers were Panasonic Linear Shavers (also a great shaver) and before that several Norelcos (even had the Norelco with the lotion that used to spurt out - it was pretty gross).  I decided to try a Braun, because the Panasonic was not shaving close enough and I still got minor razor burn on my neck.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shave I get is incredibly close and there is NO razor burn AT ALL.  The only drawbacks are (i) it&#x27;s difficult to clean without the solution, (ii) I still find clippings after I take it out of the solution, and (iii) it&#x27;s not wet/dry (one of the most attractive features of the Panasonic).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all - I&#x27;m very happy about the switch and highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I own two units and both failed to stay down when the shaver required charging. Braun was good enough to send me two charging units that stayed down for a while and then failed. I now have two expensive discharged Braun shavers that are the most expensive I ever purchased and the least productive. If Braun sends me two durable charging-cleaning units I will raise their one-star evaluation. I hate it (times two).</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor because I read a lot of good reviews about it, and now that I own it, I know I have wasted my money.  I was tired of using regular razors and wanted to give it a try to electric models.  It left my skin very irritated, the manual instructed me to use it for at least two weeks so my skin could get use to it, but even after that period my skin still gets irritated.  Now am using the old razors and that works better for me.</li>
    <li> I never thought shaving could be fun but this is a great product to use. It gives a nice shave, is comfortable to use. When you hold the shaver in your hand you can just feel that you have a well-designed piece of machinery.   It is great at catching longer hairs that other shavers miss.  I especially like the information displays on the shaver and the charging/cleaning unit.  The cleaning system works like a charm.  They recommend cleaning daily but I do it every second or third day to save money on cleaning supplies.  They have a \\&quot;quick clean\\&quot; mode where you loosen the shaver head and run the motor for a few seconds and the clippings fall out.  It just takes a short time and I do this daily.  I feel this keeps the clippings out of the cleaning solution and perhaps extends the life of the solution.</li>
    <li> The Braun 360 gives me a nice close shave.  I like the cleaning system to clean and charge my shaver after every shave.  It charges the shaver and cleans it at the same time.  It gives me a closer shave than my Braun 8597 Activator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 360 for about a month now and it provides a close shave, I am entirely satisfied.   Previously I bought TWO new Norelco&#x27;s.    The tiny trianglular tip of a rotor broke off each one.    There is no way to get it fixed.   Braun uses the Gillette foil methodology and it works just fine.    It is substantially built and easy to use.    I recommend it.    Jay Stevens</li>
    <li> Although I bought this product for my boyfriend for Christmas, I did get his opinion on it. He stated that this razor provides an extremely close shave! He also said it was the first foil razor that he has owned that is not painful to shave with. He really likes the cleaning feature, as well as the digitized display that provides information like shaving times, when to clean, etc. He said this is the best razor he has owned. I am so happy that I purchased this and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using an old Braun Electric shaver for a few years now and this new one is much better.  I have no burning sensation when I am finished shaving.  The packaging is better as well.  I am shaving more often now than I was with the old shaver.</li>
    <li> The best feature is self-cleaning.  Auto-charging is nice, but not essential.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t get those whiskers that lie flat, any better than my old Braun electric razor.  And today I saw that Braun has a new, revolutionary \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; razor.  Oh well...   ;^)  If this razor were stolen tomorrow, would I buy it again?  Probably.  Would I look at Panasonic&#x27;s new razor, perhaps a bit closer?  I think so.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, close, comfortable shave, Reliable. I purchased the Braun 4775 electric shaver about 7 months ago and the \\&quot;18 month\\&quot; cutting block would get a hole in the foil and jammed with hair about every 6 weeks. The Braun 8995 has not done it yet. The shave is much more comfortable and closer. Great self cleaning mechanism, It does require oiling about once a week, I shave everyday.</li>
    <li> I thought $157.59 was a lot to pay for a shaver, but I would say it was definitely worth it.  Previously, I shaved with a Braun 6520, which wasn&#x27;t anything special except for its brandname reliability.  I cleaned it (by hand) after every use and enjoyed a clean shaver with a closer shave every time I shaved.  Now with the 8995, I don&#x27;t only benefit from not having to clean it by hand, but it smells nice and fresh and lubricated, making each shave feel as if I am shaving with a brand new shaver every time.  The Clean&amp;Renew feature is worth the $41 increase over the Braun 8975, which lacks that feature.  I have shaved with it about 9 times now and have no regrets.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor system with the cleaning and charging station. It will take you some time to adjust to it if you are using a rotary shaver like I was. Once you are familiar with it it will be your favorite shaver very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mostly other electric shavers in the past and I&#x27;d say this is the best shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric.  It&#x27;s easy to use and cleaning is done by itself when putting the shaver back in the unit.</li>
    <li> At least for my beard it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to go over and over and over again for it to shave some hair off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I took advantage of the prior reviews at Amazon to check this shaver&#x27;s quality among previous purchasers and agree that it performs as recommended. Close shaves, ease of handling and the cleaning feature is rather unique to this class of shaver. I would also recommend this product to future customers. My previous shaver was a Norelco, which was good but over the years it loss its battery&#x27;s ability to recharge and it was time to buy a new one. A deciding feature for me was also the fact that you can&#x27;t over charge this brand of shaver versus the Norelco, where over charging does damage the battery. I considered another Norelco but given the excellent reviews of this Braun, I bought it instead. I believe this product offers closer shaves than my previous brand as a result of the finer shaving head and the thinness of the foil. Packs easy for travel and can be charged with or without the cleaning container when traveling.</li>
    <li> This shaver does not shave anywhere as close as an old Braun I had. All the fancy cleaning bells and whistles do not make up for a good close shave. It is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It was rough the first couple of times.  After a couple of weeks, I got used to it.  Not exactly the result of a blade but close enough with much greater convenience and shorter time to shave.  May need to shave everyday instead of each other day with a blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a month now and downgrade it from 5 stars to 4 just because of lack of value.  Previously I used the Braun Synchro for several years and was happy with it.  This new shaver is fundamentally the same, except that it is dramatically more expensive and has a bulky cleaning base that is of dubious value.  If you can find the model 8975 at a better price than the 8995 then I&#x27;d recommend to go for that one.  This shaver is still quiet, has a long charge life, and perhaps does a slightly better job on necks hairs than my old shaver.  It&#x27;s definitely quieter and gets the job done faster than my previous Remington.</li>
    <li> I have used several different electric razors and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Even so, it has a tough time with the hairs under the chink and on neck, but even there does a better job than any I&#x27;ve ever used.  Mightly price, but well worth it to me.</li>
    <li> the neew braun shaver is the best electric shave i have ever gotten! &lt;br /&gt;i have been using an electric since 1968. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased the braun for my boyfriend.  He was using an older braun style with poor results.  Now with the new braun 8995 360 he can&#x27;t wait to shave in the morning because of how smooth his face feels. No kidding... he keeps touching his chin through out the day.  We are both surprised with how close the shave is.  The shave is actually smoother than when he uses his razor.  His skin is also very sensitive and he hasn&#x27;t had a problem with it.  He also likes the automatic cleaning unit.  It turned out to be the perfect christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. He said it shaves so close. He is thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> After buying numerous electric shavers over the years,I finally found one that actually works. I have a disabled brother who has a tough time with the various blade models. When he first tried the Braun 360 Complete he was pleasantly surprised. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about him cutting himself. I&#x27;m very happy I gave this one a shot!</li>
    <li> After trying Norelco and some others, I strictly buy Braun only!  This is an expensive shaver, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.  I&#x27;ve never had a closer, smoother shave than this, even with a traditional razor!</li>
    <li> This was my very first purchase of an electric shaver and I am very pleased with its performance.  My skin needed around 2 weeks to get used to it, but now it works like a charm.  I will say that it is not as close as a regular razor.  However, it&#x27;s close enough to look professional.  The main reason I purchased this razor is so that I do not have to keep on purchasing the MACH 3 Turbo razors at $13 bucks a pop and last me for one month.  This razor will do the job just fine and if I need a closer shave one day, then I could use a regular non-electric razor.  It&#x27;s the best quality electric shaver in my book and it will save me money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Best versatile shave from an electric shaver.........But the cleaning system is complex and costly for refills that evaporate in 30 days........You need a mini room just to set up this system unless you are a bachelor and can keep it on the kitchen  table or take up the entire vanity in the bathroom......  technology is superb but all I wanted was a good shave not a sound and light show....</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric shaver for over 40 years and I have used all types and brands.  This shaver gives the best shave I have ever received from an electric razor.  The cleaning system works like a charm and provided a fresh and very clean razor ready for each new shave.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver was a circular head shaver that lasted about three years before it died. My next electric shaver was a Braun corded model, and it lasted through 17 years (!) of daily shaves! In fact it STILL operates as good as the day I bought it, having only replaced the shaver block and foil screen a handful of times. When I decided that I wanted to have the convenience of a rechargeable, there was no mistake which brand I would choose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I liked the idea of an automatic cleaning system. I was pretty particular about how clean I kept my first Braun. With the cleaning activator of the 8995, the shaver is as clean as new every morning. That I must purchase the solution every few months is of little regard for that level of satisfaciton. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave can&#x27;t be beat. It still gives me the closest shave that I have ever received and leaves me with smooth skin after a year of shaves and I am just now going to replace the cutting block and foil screen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you currently use a rotary head shaver and are considering a switch to the Braun, you should plan on an adjustment period (a week or so) for your beard to become accustomed to the new shaving pattern of a NON-rotary head shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Very often, I purchase a product for which I have lofty (even unrealistic) expectations. Very rarely are those expectations surpassed. The Braun 8995 has clearly eclipsed the expectations that I had for the product.</li>
    <li> My wife did a lot of research to find the perfect electric shaver.  She did great when she got the Braun 8995!  It&#x27;s sweet!!  Typically any time I use a new electric shaver, there&#x27;s an adjustment period when my skin needs to get acclimated to the new shaver.  But with the Braun 8995 there was none of that.  My first experience with the Braun 8995 was great &amp; has been ever since.</li>
    <li> My husband says it works very well and he likes it better than the Braun that it a little lower priced.  This is more of a bargain than the lower priced one</li>
    <li> I have used just about every type of razor and electric shaver on the market. This one gives me the most comfortable shave I have ever experienced, hands down ! I can&#x27;t say enough good about it. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Get a great shave every time provided I spend enough time using it to shave.</li>
    <li> After reading a number of reviews, here on Amazon and elsewhere, I thought that Braun 8995 would offer a significantly closer shave than the Norelco 8894XL which I had been using for a number of years. Despite being new, the Braun performance was no closer than the older Norelco. I&#x27;m not certain if the \\&quot;Clean &amp; Review station\\&quot; offers any real benefit. However, I have continued to use the Braun. I have been using the shaver for over 1 month.</li>
    <li> This model had long intrigued me,and i reasoned that if it was so expensive it had to be good to justify the price. I was also fascinated by the idea of auto cleaning feature, However after I read the reviews above I very nearly lost interest, but very fortunately I carried out an Advanced Search and found a very advantageous \\&quot;Buy It Now\\&quot; offer,  Having now had one for about 4 weeks I can state without any reservations that compared to all other electric razors from a variety of makers I have used over the last 50 years   The Braun 360 is by several orders of magnitude the best.  The way the foil glides oh-so-smoothly over your skin is unbelievable and coupled with the obvious removal of even quite short stubble makes every shave a relative delight,  And the auto cleaning appears wonderful too. So do yourself and your loved one a favour and get one soonest. You will not regret it. Need I say more??  I obviously have not yet had to consider getting replacement cleaning cartridges, which do not seem to be unduly expensive, but in line with the first reviewer&#x27;s comments I would be tempted to try making my own from  pure alcohol plus  a little light machine oil 3-in-one perhaps plus a small dollop of pure lemon juice. Has anybody else tried this? Obviously the manual says NO because Braun want to sell their cartridges , on the sound business principle that you can make more money selling shoelaces than shoes; I once ran a Culligan water softener franchise and marginally it was more profitable to sell salt than the original machine but only just!</li>
    <li> In general, I&#x27;m pleased w/ the Braun 8995 360 complete shaver.  It does require multiple passes on difficult areas like the neck and near the jaw line.  Even then, it doesn&#x27;t get a few stubborn hairs on the neck line.  For that reason, I&#x27;m disappointed.  However, I am pleased with its performance on the rest of my face.  The cleaning process is a little loud, like others have  mentioned, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never liked electrical shavers because of 1) their inability to shave close to the skin, and 2) I had to open and clean them it every time I shaved. I tried this one, and, now I am using it every day. It has solved both problems. One of the best shaving machines I ever had. It may occasionally miss a hair if it grows parallel to the skin but in general, it will give you an excellent performance. Always use cleaning cartridges, and you do have worry about cleaning.</li>
    <li> A bit on the expensive side but well worth it if you consider the cost of buying expensive replacement heads for traditional shavers. Very good product.</li>
    <li> My skin cleared up almost completely within about a week of using it. I don&#x27;t really get ingrown hairs anymore and its a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I have gone from blades to foil and have been using a rotary for the last 20 years. I read a consumers report on razors and they recommend the Braun. A little pricey but the best shave from an electric I ever had. They say your face has to get use to it. But on day 1 I got a better shave in half the time. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thing a few months ago and it will NOT give you anything better than a stubble shave. I went back to using my Remington triple header.    I wish I knew where I could turn this worthless \\&quot;razor\\&quot; in too.    I bet this will not be posted on the review site.    A totally dissatisfied cuatomer</li>
    <li> I have never owned a foil shaver prior to purchasing this shaver.  The Braun 8995 was recommended by my brother-in-law.  He said it was the best shaver he had ever owned.  I have to agree.  I have used Norelco triple head shavers for years.  The Braun far exceeds them in close shaves.    I was unsure about spending in excess of $100.00 for a shaver.  I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth with the Braun.</li>
    <li> For an electric it does a great job, but nothing replaces a blade.  I replaced an earlier and less expensive model Braun with this one.  There appears to be no significant difference in the quality of the shave.  This model is over-priced.  Buy a less expensive Braun and get results that are as good.</li>
    <li> Eventhough I do recommend that shaver, there are one or two negative aspects I have to mention right now:    1.) The shaver foil would not fall out as described in the manual for quick cleaning.    2.) The shaver does not shave properly in the area of the neck, thus long hairs have to be cut in trim modus.    Nevertheless there are a lot more positive issues:  It is light, it is quiet and it is of a very good build quality (extraordinary: Made in Germany - not China!).    So to sum it all up:  Nothing is perfect, but this thing nearly is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric shavers, and this is by far the overall best.  I sometimes go without shaving over the weekend, and other shavers had great trouble with several days growth of my beard.  This Braun combines a different cutter in the middle that is able to take care of the longer growth, so no need to extend a the trimmer for missed beard growth on Mondays.  Cleaning process appears to be more effective than other self-cleaning shaver kits, plus the cleaner doesn&#x27;t give me a rash like the supposedly hypoallergenic solution of one of my previous electric shavers.  Running time is great, but the trade-off is a slightly larger shaver than I&#x27;m used to.  For me, it&#x27;s a good trade-off though, as the shaver is easy to hold.  I will say it&#x27;s not the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s close too it.  It&#x27;s expensive for an electric shaver, but for me, it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Braun shaver.  The shaver itself is excellent and does everything and more that it advertises that it will do.  Unfortunately it is heavier than most other electric shavers.  My husband is paralyzed and it takes more energy for him to try and hold the shaver upright for the time it takes him to shave.  Hence he does not use it every day but alternates with his old electric shaver that is lighter.  I would highly recommend this product to any man that wants a good shave.  The cleaning and recharging process could not be easier.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver!!! After using it for about three weeks, I can definately say that I&#x27;d buy another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband. He likes it for it is efficient and easy to handle. Just feeling the size is a little bit big. If it can be smaller, would be better!</li>
    <li> My previous Braun was the 7000 series that served me very well for years. I have always been partial to Braun and have never regretted it.    My new 8995 shaver is everything I expected it to be and then some.    My son has a Norelco and is always using the Braun. I wonder why!!!    I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone in the market for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have had several other brands over the years and about 15 years ago I started using Braun.  This is my third razor and it is the best of the bunch.  The cutting head is made different and it really works.  It&#x27;s a little harder to clean.  You must be very carful of the screen and the cutting head but the inprovment in the performance more than makes up for the inconvience.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun Shaver for as long as I can remember, as far as I&#x27;m concerned it is the best shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and am still very satisfied and would highly recommend it. I have what I would consider a medium beard and shave every day. I changed the cutter and foil 2 years ago. I can&#x27;t compare it to regular blades because I&#x27;ve used electrics since 1965 when I began using a 2 blade Norelco. I stuck with Norelco until about 15 years ago when I switched to Panasonic because I got tired of the Norelco&#x27;s tendancy to give me razor burn no matter what I tried to alleviate it. The 2 Panasonics I had took much longer to shave and didn&#x27;t get as close as this model. Cleaning is easy with the automatic cleaning feature. I use it every 7 to 10 days when I recharge the razor and the cleaning solution lasts me about 2 months. I agree with other reviewers that you should not wash before shaving, it does make a difference. I will definitely purchase another Braun when I need another shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Braun 8595 electric shaver for three years. To my mind it has serious deficiencies.After three years of use (well past the suggested break-in period) I&#x27;ve found the following:     *There are some areas of the face that it absolutely refuses to shave...some longer hairs on the right cheek, under-the-chin hairs on the left side, under the chin centre, and the neck. For these I use the Schick Body Groomer, and that works well. The Braun cannot be made to deal with these areas no matter what I try. This is a very serious deficiency. Changing the head position from free to locked makes some difference, but it will still not deal with the problem areas I mentioned.    *Like so many other electrics, you will not get a close shave with just one pass. You will either have to press very hard (something Braun, recognizing its own deficiencies, suggests and which does not work) or go over and over the same area using one&#x27;s hand to make the bristles stand up. Even then, this procedure is ineffective with certain areas.    *Like other electrics which simply lop off the top of the hair, shaves with this shaver do not last. Expect to shave at least twice a day if you have a beloved.    I do believe that the inability of this shaver to cover all parts of the face without using an additional grooming aid is a serious deficiency of this and of all electric shavers, which use the same procedure. A razor blade cuts off hairs at the base. It does not nibble at them as an electric does. A shaver cannot cut below the skin line: a razor can.    What should be sold is not one shaver but rather a combination of shavers that would do all the jobs required.However, to do so would be to admit the failure of the principal shaver, which is where the big bucks lie.    I recommend buying the cheapest shaver in the line plus a Schick Body Groomer (which is a great idea, anyway!). The cheaper shaver will probably do as good a job as the expensive models with all their technological and useless doo-dads, which is what you are paying your $$$$ for.</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiance a couple of years ago thinking it would be easier for him to use rather than shave with a conventional razor every day. Not really. It&#x27;s nice that it self cleans but the things become empty and then what? I didn&#x27;t know if I could refill with alcohol or what. He barely used it as it didn&#x27;t give him the shave he was looking for. It&#x27;s been sitting under the cabinet for a year or so now. I would think you could get a better shaver for the money at this point in time.</li>
    <li> great product and since newer versions of this product have been launched, its available cheap. This is my first time of using electric shaver, I had problem in shaving couple of time initially, now its performing great.</li>
    <li> I bougt my first Braun shaver about 12years ago. The original battery finaly died when it was left on a day or more.so i bought this new one,great shave outstanding quality.</li>
    <li> The razor did a good job, but the cost of all of the convenient cleaning cartridges became prohibitive after a while and I eventually replaced it with a wet/dry razor you clean in the sink every so often.</li>
    <li> The first few times I tried to shave with the shaver it left a black oily substance on my face, even after I cleaned it twice.  After shaving with it I found that it works well, but no better than the Panasonic shaver that I had currently been using.  I cannot tell a difference after shaving between the $50 Panasonic shaver and the Braun 360 Shaver, which was purchased for $200.  Brauns advertising and website content was very convincing and that&#x27;s why I decided to give it a chance.  I also like the wet/dry feature that Panasonic offers in which I can run it under water and rinse it between strokes.  The Braun shaver is very similar but feels warm, almost hot to the touch after shaving with it for a few minutes and it cannot be run under water.  I also feel the sideburn trimmer is more effective on the Panasonic shaver than on the Braun.  To sum it up, it&#x27;s not a bad shaver but my feelings are that it&#x27;s not worth the $200 price tag.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8995 gives the best shave i could hope for. as with any shaver, a lot depends on your own personal opinion, but when i actively compared the 8995 to my braun Free Glide, the results where spectacular. typically it would take me 7 or so minutes to shave, but with the 8995, it take about 3 mins. It is truly a product that delivers on its promise. &lt;br /&gt;  Now that i praised it enough, let me tell you about possible draw backs. you cant buy this shaver expecting it to be worlds different from what you may have. in my case the Free Glider doesn&#x27;t have an oscillating head, better foil, or any of the bells and wissels that the 8995 comes with. remember that if you have the Braun Actuator  then there may not be a reason to spend so much to upgrade when you can most likely put the foil and cutter block from one onto another and save an arm and lag. Price is also a factor. $219.00 is just to much so if you decide that it is right for you, then find it on line and save yourself at least $20.00-$50.00 at places like Amazon.com or shavers.com.  &lt;br /&gt;    This is the best shaver Ive seen and i recommend it for ease of use, cleanliness, and capabilities, but not unless your really looking to replace a defective or out dated model, and not just as a fad.</li>
    <li> Rare is the product or service that lives up to the hype, but this razor is just that rare.  I have been a Braun dry shaver user for many years, with my last Braun in the 6000 series.  This 360 Complete 8995 shaver is fantastic.  It is razor sharp -- perhaps because of its unique Gillette blade inside (more about that later), or the unique open pattern of the cutter foil.  Bottom line: it shaves smooth and fast.  You know those 1/2-inch-long neck hairs that you can never see in your bathroom mirror -- and that your razor glides over in ignorant bliss -- well, this razor nails &#x27;em -- they&#x27;re history.  One of my gripes about my old Braun was how noisy it was -- while shaving and, especially, while undergoing its clean and charge cycle.  This razor is very quiet, by comparison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, about that unique Gillette blade inside. It costs more -- more to get it in the 8995 shaver, and more as a replacement blade.  However, it is worth it.  Combined with the unique foil, you cannot even feel the blade cutting the whiskers -- no tug, not fighting a thick patch of whiskers (such as on your chin, where other electric shavers tend to bog down). Check out the Braun web site for information on how this unique blade is engineered differently than all other dry shaver blades (including all others from Braun). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ok, so let&#x27;s talk about price.... Yes, this shaver is expensive.  The blade alone accounts for about $30+ of the overall cost.  Is it worth it?  In a word, yes.  How often do you shave?  365 days a year?  More?  Slightly less?  If your wife thinks this shaver is too expensive, tell her how much a raft of razors would cost for the 5-8 years you&#x27;ll get from this shaver (with blade and foil changes about every 18 months, of course).  Then, ask her how much she spends on razors for her.... Or, you could move the subject quickly to shoes.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You get the picture.  This shaver is special.  It&#x27;s unique.  And, it&#x27;s not made in China -- this model&#x27;s made in Germany.  Forget German engineering in your next sports sedan -- get it in your next shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought it new. After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I checked the manual before I used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower. I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Braun shaver I have owned, and this is clearly the best.  Yes, it is a bit expensive, but you use it everyday and my last shaver from Braun lasted over six years and survived year long deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq in 130 degree temperatures.  This shaver is the quietest I&#x27;ve used and cuts my beard in less than three minutes.  The cleaning system is much better than the last system and the shaver always stays fresh and clean.  I am not sure the message display is necessary, but it does tell you how long it took to shave each time and tells you how much battery charge is left.  The 8975 model is probably just as good as the top of the line 8995 model, but I liked the idea of the larger message center and knowing how much of a charge is left.  The Gillette blade is very nice and cuts through my thick beard like butter.  I am very satisfied with this shaver and will purchase other Braun shavers in the future.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift and he still hasn&#x27;t grown a beard so i guess it works well enough. He really does like it, especially compared to using a blade.</li>
    <li> The razor is not perfect, and I have to shave my face everyday now.</li>
    <li> I bought a rotating shaver about 10 yrs ago. I never felt comfortable with the closeness of the shave. I&#x27;m in the military so I guess that pretty important. However the battery died just before deployment so I went back to Gillete and stayed with them. Until we had a water shortage and cold shaving isn&#x27;t my cup of tea. So my wife got me this one for my Aniversary. &lt;br /&gt;I must say the new cleaning mechanism is a pretty good nerdy gadget that keeps it clean and charged. I will say the solution is pretty expensive so I clean it a couple of times a week. Remove the canister and place the top back on so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate. Its mostly alcohol anyway maybe some perfume to make smell good. I will say it shaves close as can be expected. I&#x27;m still in the 3wk window. I like the clippers in the center of the shaver that pick up the hard to get hairs under my neck and chin. Great Idea in motion I have to say. I remember pulling and stretching my skin to get the rotary blades to pick them up. I was never comfortable that I was done. I remember my brother telling me \\&quot;its an electric razor its not supposed to take that long\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t comment on the new foil. I&#x27;m not sure if the design realy works better or not. I will say I thought is was pretty darn close for an electric razor I will say the closest I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 different electric shavers and none of them has done much of anything for me.  This one is different.  It actually works.  A bit on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Background: I disposed my philips entry level rotary shaver (bought in 2001, it was a gift from my girlfriend, who in now my wife, when we were both college students in China.) in that its battery came to an end.  I used electrical shaver mostly for travel purpose and when I need to save time before rushing out.  I use a manual Gillette fusion shaver for regular shaving. I am traveling again and I need one.  Personally I like the linear motor shaver more than the rotary motor shave in that it is more powerful and shaves more neatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Considering its function, it is small and light weighted - comparing with those top level nerocle 3-head rotary shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It comes with a station, for charging and for CLEANING, that station automatically clean the shaver but examining how dirty it is - and clean it use the cartridge.  There is nothing to hassle - not brush, not blower, no water, no foam, all you need is to put the shaver into the station and press a button.  It will decide how economically to use your cartridge to clean the shaver - usually you will be on a cost of $2.5 per month for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The shave is smooth and perfect.  Compare with other linear motor shaver - the noise is reasonably low, and it shaves very neat, comparable to using manual shaver (not that good though, but ever best in the electrical shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Because I alters between this one and my manual shaver - for different purpose, it said it takes a while to get accustomed to this one if I am a manual or rotary shaver user, however, I did not feel much uncomfortable at the first time using it, and I feel it is not bad for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: easy cleaning, excellent shaving experience, reasonable price, this is the thing you want.</li>
    <li> I have used several different electric shavers over the years (Panasonic, Remington, Schick, Braun)and this one is the best so far.  No razor burn, shooth operation, and I love the self cleaning ability.  I recommend this electric shaver.</li>
    <li> In 1973 I received a Remington Micro Screen shaver as a gift. I have used it for 34 years. The A.C. cord failed. I decided to get the Braun 8995 to replace the thing. The Braun is much nicer in the hand, quieter, and cleans itself. Screens and cutters are easy to find. I found an A.C. cord for the Remginton and got it running. Here&#x27;s the deal. If I first shave with the Braun then go over with the Remington, I can feel and hear the cutters getting more beard. The shave is closer. If I first shave with the Remington the Braun gets nothing more, though the foil design is better and catching curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the worlds best electric shaver, the Braun Syncro, for about five years now.  Every so often Braun makes the razor better by improving the foil/cutter - first by making them stronger, then by releasing the honeycomb foil found on newer models.  My batteries weren&#x27;t holding the charge they once did so I decided to try the 360 Complete thinking that after five years Braun must have improved the already terrific Syncro - they didn&#x27;t.      The 360 Complete doesn&#x27;t shave as close nor as comfortably as the Syncro, the razor is physically bulkier, it makes a high pitched electrical wine sound while charging (I&#x27;ve seen several that do this so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me), and there are so many blinking lights on the handset and cleaning base while charing that it looks like the Disneyland Main Street Electrical Parade!    They still make the Syncro, now called the Syncro Pro, sold for considerably less than the 360 Complete.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different, but if you want the advice of someone with a tough beard and sensitive skin who&#x27;s tried them both, do yourself or your loved one a favor and buy the Syncro Pro.  Braun, please compare these two models and figure out what you&#x27;re doing wrong with the 360!      (Final thought:  After using it for a disappointing two months I returned the 360 Complete and had my local razor repair man put a new logic board and battery set in my existing Syncro for about $50 bucks - if I didn&#x27;t have that option I would have gladly shelled out for a new Syncro Pro).</li>
    <li> For an electric shaver, the Braun 8995 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver does a very good job, it is easy to use, has nice extras (such as the self cleaning feature and sideburn shaver).  I rate it highly in relation to other electric shavers.  But it just can&#x27;t perform like the Gillette Fusion shaver.  However, for a quick, not so close shave, it is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver and the best so far.  It feels solid in your hand and the shave is very close and comfortable.  Not quite as close as a blade, but much gentler on the face.  The off-on switch is configured so it won&#x27;t come on accidentally in your luggage and drain the battery.  Previous ones had a separate lock switch that was easy to forget to engage.  The self-cleaning feature is superb.  It&#x27;s an expensive shaver, but then you get what you pay for.  No regrets.</li>
    <li> I bought the 8995 model in December, 2006 to replace my broken 8595 Braun shaver and I have found no difference in the quality or quickness of shave between the old and the new model. Therefore, I believe that the 360 design is a lot of marketing hype. Braun seems to have spent more on advertising the  8995 360 shaver than they did improving its technology. Still the Braun 8595 &amp; 8995 360 are the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used. Compared to the Norelco&#x27;s, and Remington&#x27;s, the Braun 360 really does give a faster more consistent close shave, almost beating out good old regular razors like the Gillette Mach 3 and so on.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t receive the close shave as hoped. I ended up returning product for a refund</li>
    <li> I have to rate this 5 stars for closeness, 3 for the autoclean feature  4 for noise level. Im not sure how usefull the autoclean really is, I&#x27;ve used other brands of electric razors for years without autoclean with no issues. One caveat, the little cleaning brush they include is NOT for cleaning either the foil nor the cutter, instructions say it will damage them. alot louder than the norelco type razors</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shaver right out of the box, did a quick charge and shaved, smooth as any blade, it is really amazing and quick.  I do not have a heavy beard unless I don&#x27;t save for a few days, but after using my Norelco for many years, I wondered WHY I ever waited to get a new one.  It is a little noisier than my other, but then it was not near as close as this one is.  I would not have the cleaner base in the same room as I was trying to sleep, it works well also and it is really nice to have a nice CLEAN razor to shave with, even smells good!!  But, the down side and why only 4 stars, is it too is noisy but well worth it for the clean razor always.  Easy to set up and use, and at Amazons price it is a real bargan!!</li>
    <li> My 7680 Braun razor recently got a hole in the screen, after serving me faithfully for 2 years, so I took it in to Best Buy to cash in on my replacement plan.  As I thought it would be better to get a replacement razor instead of spending 30.00 on a foil and cutting block.  Best Buy at the time didn&#x27;t have the 8985 model and I didn&#x27;t want to pay the 199.99 for the 8995 Braun, because it was a good 60.00 more than I originally paid for the 7680.  So I picked up a Norelco 8160XLCC, and I have to say after 3 days of using a Norelco I gladly paid the 60.00 to get another Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 8995 just cannot be beat.  It has a very sturdy feeling to it.  Compared to my 7680 I get about the same shave on my cheaks, but the best improvement in my opinion has come from the shave I get on my chin.  Before I could always feel a little stubble, but now with a couple swipes of on my chin and it is as smooth as every other part of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to this razor, which really isn&#x27;t worth knocking a whole star off, is that it has very little documentation on battery charging.  The manual basically says don&#x27;t worry about maximizing your battery life because the on board chip takes care of it.  I don&#x27;t know about you guys but I like to have a little more information than that.  Because every time I put the razor in to the charger it starts charging, I have only had it for one day so maybe it learns from my shaving habits, either way more documentation would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product to everybody who wants a quality shave and the price is well worth what you get from the razor.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this shaver I was not impressed at all.  It took forever to get reasonably shaved.  It did a horrible job on my neck. Then after about two weeks of using it every morning something changed.  Whether it was how I was using it, my beard or the shaver I don&#x27;t know, but it just started working on my whole beard. On my cheeks and chin it has always worked well.  Not as well as a wet razor but within acceptable and much faster and easier.  My neck always broke out, hurt like no other and was \\&quot;splotchy\\&quot; until one day and the razor just seemed to work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I must say now I am really impressed and enjoy using this in the morning much more than my old three blade razor.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s good but could be better. It has some trouble shaving the neck completely, and sometimes you can still feel the stubble. But on the whole, it&#x27;s most definitely a good buy. Especially since it is self-cleaning and charging.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a high quality product and I am not writing a bad review it just is not for me.  I have a very difficult face to shave and over the years despised my Norelco for always eating my face, causing me to break-out on my neck.  This does the same in a less effective shave.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric I&#x27;ve owned that makes me not want to use a blade much. If it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, it&#x27;s damn close, plus it&#x27;s fast, takes me less than 2 min for a shave.  Even does a good job on my neck.  Battery life is good and the cleaning function works great. I only clean and charge about every 10-15 shaves though, I just  remove the foil and tap it a few times or brush it after each shave. I previously had a Braun 7000 series, and this unit is superior, it&#x27;s better at getting longer hairs and seems a bit closer.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after doing extensive research and reading a lot of online reviews. It&#x27;s driven me back to wet shaving, and now I wish I had returned it within the 30-day return window that Braun offers.     I&#x27;ve shaved with Norelco electrics for about 25 years. When my fourth Norelco died this summer, I thought it was time to see what else is available. The Braun came very highly rated, and foil-type shavers are widely said to offer closer shaves than rotary-style electrics.     I found the Braun to have a very awkward feel in my hand. And it really irritated the skin on my neck and chin. After two weeks of using the Bruan, the awkwardness started to go away and the irritation on my skin began to disappear. The shave may have been marginally better than I got with my Norelco. But it wasn&#x27;t good enough to make be that much happier with the Braun.     The Braun&#x27;s cleaning system was driving me crazy. The shaver seems to need cleaning about every fourth shave, and I can&#x27;t get over the feeling that the cleaning system is just a way for Braun to make money on consumable cleaning fluid. I resent having this big cleaning unit sitting on my bathroom counter, where space is at a premium.      My dissatisfaction with the Braun sent me back into research mode. I&#x27;ve taken up wet shaving again, starting with a double-edge blade and some luxurious shaving products from the Art of Shaving. Wet shaving with these products is so vastly superior to the performance of any electric, that the ritual of wet shaving has become an unexpected pleasure. I&#x27;ve gone back to using a double-edge safety razer and liked it so much I just ordered a straight razor and a strop. This setup will cost no more than the Braun, and its vastly superior in results.     Guys, it might be worthwhile to consider dumping electrics altogether and going back to wet shaving. If you&#x27;ve hated wet shaving before, maybe you&#x27;d benefit by using the Web to research all the resources for learning how to do it right. Inow keep my Braun electric for travel, and I find I can&#x27;t wait to get home for a good, close shave with my razor.</li>
    <li> Well, after many years of trying to find the perfect electronic shaver I think I&#x27;ve found it.  First, let me say that I don&#x27;t believe that any electronic shaver, including the Braun 8995, can come as close as a razorblade. However, the Braun comes damn close.  It even takes care of those pesky whiskers on my neck that other shavers were never able to cut. Even after several days of not shaving the Braun has no problem giving me a great, smooth shave.  In addition to the awesome shave the clean up procedure is great - just stick it in the docking station and voila! -   it&#x27;s like new every time I use it.    While some might consider it a bit expensive (I did) it&#x27;s well worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband last Christmas and we are ready to throw it in the trash. It makes his face really red and irratated. Sorry I ever bought it. 360, shaving, braun, electric razor, braun 8995, razor, electric razors, 8995, braun 8985</li>
    <li> I have had the razor for about 5 months now and I am still undecided about whether it is a good deal.  It does not really provide any closer shave than other models that cost far less. The extra \\&quot;holes\\&quot; in the screen sounded like a great idea but I haven&#x27;t really noticed they make a difference in closeness of shave.  Also, the screen gets hot pretty quickly and I have irritated the skin on my upper lip several times. I had high hopes for this product but I think my three year old Panasonic did a better job.</li>
    <li> My razor works quite well, it shaves very close (closer than the one I had).  I like the recharging and cleaning system and also the feel of it when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Gets the job done quickly and easily, and you can&#x27;t beat the easy cleanup with the Clean &amp; Renew system...just pop it in and it cleans itself.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Braun razors for at least twelve years now and this is my third Braun.  My previous Braun was the first generation of the cleaning products (the 5995, I believe?)and I loved it.  I got this one for Christmas from my parents.  They actually bought it at Target for $[...] and I saw it on Amazon for $[...] plus $[...] gift certificate so I returned the razor at Target and had them order this one for me.  The shave is fantastic compared to my previous Brauns.  My face is smooth and it cuts really close.  The razor is also very durable.  My 2 year old son saw the blue lights flashing on the cleaning base and wanted to inspect more.  He knocked the base over and the razor fell into the open toilet.  I was concerned about the LCD display because it got really foggy from the water and the condensation.  But after drying overnight the LCD display appeared and I was glad that it was not ruined after only one shave!  All and all it is very worth getting this razor....especially on Amazon.  I really enjoy the self-cleaning and it seems that I change the cartridges every 5 weeks.  This new cleaning system actually detects how dirty the razor is so it doesn&#x27;t waste the solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas.  He has always been a Braun shaver user and was pleased with the Braun 360.  We were a little disappointed that the new line of Braun shavers is not wet/dry because he likes to shave in the shower.  My husband is Asian so he has a light beard.  The cleaning system with this shaver is great and I think it will last a long time.  The manufacturer recommends changing the cleaning solution monthly.  But with his light beard, he has used the shaver every day since Christmas and now it is early February and the cleaning solution is still registering as full. The shaver works great and leaves his face nice and smooth.  We are both happy with this Braun 360 shaver, too bad it is not wet/dry.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave.  Love the fact that it automatically recharges when placed in cleaning station.  THe cleaning station determines the amount of cleaning the shaver requires.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8995 sure looks fancy and a few reviews led me to believe that I would recieve a super close shave.  Although that is not the case at all.  I would say it worked a little better when it was new.  I have had it for 10 months and I can honestly say it does not give me any closer shave than my $40.00 Norelco.  The blade is recommended for replacement at 18 months.  So that should not be the problem.  Looks can definetly be decieving. I would definetly not recommend this unit.  Oh, and the cleaning unit does not improve the closeness of the shave. I am not  impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after his rotary electric razor failed after many years.  Going from a $30 to a $170 razor raises your expectations however, he says this razor shaves no differently from the cheaper one AND it requires the continual purchase of cleaning solution.  In addition, shortly after receiving it the base unit would get stuck in cleaning mode and would run all night.  Its bad enough waiting 1/2 hour for the cleaning process to complete but all night?  We&#x27;re not performing surgery with this razor.  There&#x27;s no need for cleaning solution after every use.  The other razor worked just as well just shaking it out, and didn&#x27;t suck electricity 24/7.  Amazon wont let you send it back so we had to mail it, at our cost, to the manufacturer for a refund.  Have not received it yet.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a month now, and waited to write the review to give it time to perhaps not live up to the initial impression. My first shave with it just blew me away, and has each day since. I used to shave every other day with my Remington because my face (neck mostly) would be so red, bumpy and sore that I couldn&#x27;t handle it any more often. Now I can shave every day (even though I take Sat. off) with nothing but comfort. I have less ingrown hairs, and no redness. I have not had one pulled hair either, even with the multiple day growth. The trimmer even does a decent job with my sideburn lines. I used to use a disposable razor for that...not anymore. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shaver. Yes, it is expensive, but considering it gets used every day, I have no doubt that it will be worth it. Also, the cleaning solution is lasting longer than I was expecting from many other reviews. The level just went down to the middle indicator the other day. It does an economy cleaning almost always, and chooses an intensive cleaning only about 2 or 3 times so far. I think this cleaning system is well worth it too. There is not a single whisker in my sink...it catches everything. My old shaver pooped these out all over the sink and countertop, and I had to brush and blow it out all the time, and it still wasn&#x27;t nearly as clean as this shaver is daily. If you can deal with the price, I can&#x27;t see how you would not love this shaver. People&#x27;s faces are different, so who knows. But for me, this shaver has taken shaving from a dreaded, evil, torturous task to a short, little satisfying routine.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a new Braun Electric Shaver. I had been using a Braun shaver for many years. Although I was satisfied with the old one, the new shaver is light years ahead of the older one. I am getting shaves like I never have before.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun man for over 35 year&#x27;s. The 8995 is the best electric razor I have ever used. If you have never tried one. Do yourself a favor and get it.                             Brent</li>
    <li> Gives a realively close shave for an electric razor. The only other shave I like that is closer is a safety razor shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband and i cant say a bad thing about it. It was definitely worth the money, my husband says its the closest shave he has ever had. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun 8995 shaver for over a year now.  It shaves very well, and even does a pretty good job when I have been too busy to shave for 5 days :-)   It is well made and sturdy-  I like the charging stand and that it is self cleaning-  However, I wish the cleaning solution was less expensive.  It does add up.  I have always had shavers that had no expense once you bought them... every two or three years buy new blades and get a new one when it stops working-  It is nice that the charger/cleaner base keeps the shaver clean and nice, but the solution has to be replaced about every 5-6 months at $5 or so per container.  I am a little torn about the ongoing expense.  Also, the charger cord sticks straight out of the wall about 3 inches!  It would have been better to have a cord that plugs in and bends down closer to the wall- If you get this shaver, definately sign up for the \\&quot;Amazon recurring home delivery\\&quot; plan for the cleaning solution, it is the cheapest way to stay stocked-</li>
    <li> if you don&#x27;t mind buying the cleaning stations and the cheap charging unit the it is great.. One of the best shave i have had..but i won&#x27;t have another with this cleaning bull on it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a freshly charged shaver every morning. I could never get my skin to adjust to the foils, and give a clean, close, irritation free shave, especially on my neck. I bough the razor several years ago, and after going back and forth several times over the years have settled on the old safety razor and creme route. It&#x27;s the only way I can get a irritation free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin will adjust to it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be happy, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Yeah I bought this gift for my Husband for christmas and my husband loves it. The price I got it for on amazon was amazing, and the shipping is always great. He said the shaver work unbelievable, and it self cleaning it tells you when it needs cleaning, when it needs to be charged also when to replace the blades and so on... so yea i deffintly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver a few weeks ago.  Cleaning feature is neat.  Sheving is pretty good and painless.  Some neck areas are very hard to shave with this razor.  Still not bad overall.</li>
    <li> I have had just about every Panasonic high speed wet/dry shaver that has been on the market and this Braun blows them all away.  I have a think dark beard, and the Panasonics shave lasted me about 4 hours until i needed to shave again, this Braun keeps clean for about 6-7 hours.</li>
    <li> I researched this product all over the web and in the store, comparing it to similar screen shavers and the Braun 8995 was the by far the best on paper.  After purchasing it, I found out that it was not only the best on paper, but also in everyday use.  I have always used disposable razors, so I was a bit hesitant to spend so much on an electric (as I have had little success with them before).  The packaging says allow 2-4 weeks for your skin to adjust; you should expect this to hold true.  After this period of acclimation, I am convinced that this is the only razor I will own - hands down.</li>
    <li> I have been buying electric razors for years, and have had everything from the worst, a scary Remington, to nice Norelco&#x27;s and most recently the Braun 8595.  I have had my new 8995 now for about 5 shaves, and I am absolutely sold on this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Previous Braun&#x27;s including the 8595 always gave a nice shave, but it was never consistent.  Namely the neck hairs would always be a problem spot for the other razors.  This razor trims the neck hairs EFFORTLESSLY.  No pushing harder, no making multiple passes until my skin is red, just a clean, quick, and VERY CLOSE shave.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor just feels right, from the better grips on the body of the razor, to the powerful motor, it is clearly not a second plaze razor.  The clean and renew system works as before, no changes changes there.  I like it just the same, and it sure beats cleaning your razor manually.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the box comes the razor, a cheesy plastic travel case (if you had the 8595 it&#x27;s the same one...)  A brush to clean the razor, also a plastic cover for the blades to put on it when travelling.  Also it comes with a power cord that is used for the razor when travelling or directly plugging into the clean and renew base stand which is also included.  They give you 1 clean and renew cartridge.  The directions were easy, and the operation of the razor is straightforward.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I guess you could say I am now a fan of Braun for life!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor really is this good.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now before you think I am an employee of Braun, I&#x27;ll tell you the one thing that concerns me.  Like the previous 8595 model, this unit has the same plastic back on the back of the unit. (It looks like aluminum but it is just coated plastic of course like everything else these days.)  Anyways, the problem is that the plastic near the top of the razor body, beneath the swivel head begins to deteriorate with time due to the alcohol solution in the clean and renew base.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact my8595 is getting warranty repair for this very same defect and I am planning on the 8995 needing the same repair so I am making sure to save my receipt.  That alone is just cosmetic and perhaps Braun loses some points for durability here, but it does not and cannot effect the operation of the shave.  Did I mention the shave is the best ever? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy the razor if you buy this model.  I truly believe you would be hard pressed to be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for some time now (over 20 years). My most recent was a top of the line Norelco (the James Bond one). That was an excellent razor, but having recently replaced the heads I was still noticing a not great shave, and I never could get that area under the nose with it. I am not sure if my razor was losing some \\&quot;ooomph\\&quot; or what. In any case, I went to the local shaver shop and tried this new Braun. I had owned Braun shavers before and was very impressed with this one. It shaves easily and quickly (I am done in under 3 minutes). It is quiet, and the cleaning system is just fantastic. My shaves are getting closer and closer as my face gets reacquainted with a foil (versus Norelco rotary) system - don&#x27;t be afraid, it was an easy transition. I am getting the easiest and closest shave ever. Bravo Braun!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about getting this product. I never used an electric before and was doubtful if it would work well enough for me. I like a close shave everyday by razor. At first this product was horrible. Very bad shave for the first few days and I almost returned it. But there&#x27;s a reason they say you need to use it for a few weeks for your face to get used to it. After about 5 days I guess either my face became used to the razor or my skills improved because now my shave is as almost good as a razor. Yes, it really is as good as a razor, infact if you shave half of your face with this, and the other half with a razor, you can barely see or feel the difference. Next, the cleaning device. It&#x27;s excellent to just set it down, have it get cleaned, pick it up and have a fresh, disinfected, citrus smelling, slightly lubricated shaver every morning. Refills aren&#x27;t that expensive (around $4 a piece) they last a month if you clean everyday. But if you&#x27;re like me, i&#x27;d rather spend $4 on some cleaning solution than the $23+ on my old Gillette Fusion blades alone.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, this product is well worth it. If you haven&#x27;t tried an electric, this is a great product to be your first.</li>
    <li> Newest Braun just got better. Been using them for years and will continue.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a bad shaver. But after a month of owning this product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s noticably better than the 7000 series shaver that it replaced. There&#x27;s certainly not enough difference to justify the price increase (or the fact that replacement cutter block + foil packs cost about twice as much). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My verdict: stick with the 7000 series. They work just as well, and you don&#x27;t have to take out a second mortgage to buy one.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me for X-mas and couldnt resist giving it to me early. I havent used an electric razor in years - decades in fact. I&#x27;m one of those guys that doesnt have a face full of whiskers if I dont shave every day. It takes me a couple of days to grow what may even resemble a shadow, and what comes in is a little softer and [I thought] too tricky for another electric. Braun says it may take a couple of weeks of \\&quot;training\\&quot; your beard before you get a really close shave, but I dont find this to be true. This razor rocks, right out of the box. Very comfortable shave and probably even smoother than my Gillette Fusion. Thanks honey.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, from an estimated 20 shavers I&#x27;ve owned during my lifetime. Gives close shave, and is comfortable to use. Great shaver!</li>
    <li> I have had chronic razor burn and ingrown hairs since I began shaving many years ago.  When I first began shaving, I used a rotary electric shaver that tore up my face, so I switched to blades.  I used all the fancy three blade systems.  More recently, I tried the straight edge Merkur razors.  The straight edge were the best to date on my face (and the closest shave).  However, the razor burn and ingrown hair persisted.  A friend recommended trying a Braun shaver and let me use an old one that he had.  I liked it enough that I bought the 8995.  I still get an occasional ingrown hair, but this shaver is much easier on my face than a razor, even though I use it daily - whereas my face could only take the razor every two days.  I can also shave with all my clothes on.  It&#x27;s not quite as close a shave as the razor, but it&#x27;s close enough for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of electric shavers in the past. This shaver surprised me. It is really the very best shaver I have ever used. This shaver gives me the closest shave I have ever experienced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Armand Auger, M.D. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver on the market.  It even does a better job than a blade.  I use it to shave every other day without any problems or irritation.  I would definitely recommend it even though people have said it is expensive.  It is well worth it !</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  Kind of refreshing to see a company have a product work like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G1EQ1W Braun 8995 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver]]  I ordered this shaver from Amazon in Nov 2007. Very fast standard delivery - 4 days. I&#x27;m 62 and tried various brands of shavers over the years. Usually buying mid price models. Now retired and previous shaver on its last leg, I decided to \\&quot;buy the best\\&quot;. I read all reviews, Consumer Reports, etc. The 8985 has same cutting head and screen, but 8995 has more and better \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;, in my opinion. So far, I am completely happy with this shaver. It is by far the very best shaver I have ever owned. Initial \\&quot;high\\&quot; price is a thing of the past, now. This shaver shaves better, faster, closer, and cleaner than any of my others. I wish I had bought it sooner. Have experienced none of the complaints of other reviews, except the noise of the cleaning unit. Not really bad, but I did turn the cleaner on one night as my wife and I went to bed. After a while, she complained, \\&quot;Is that thing going to make that noise all night\\&quot; (it was about 20&#x27; away). I discovered that the best time to turn on the cleaner is just before we leave the house for a shopping trip. The end result makes both of us happy. Instead of cleaning the shaver every day, I learned that with a full charge I can get a superb shave for at least 4 days. At that time, I clean the shaver. So, I am still using the original cleaning fluid and the indicator light shows the fluid level has yet to drop to even half full. I guess only time will tell if this practice might cause the shaver cutting head and screen to ware out prematurely, but it is sure to be less expensive in the long run than buying cleaning fluid every month. Braun and Amazon both ROCK! Happy customer. Highly recommend both.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic. Before I started using Braun razors my wife wouldn&#x27;t let me get near certain parts of her body with my face. She always said it was too rough, but now, smooth sailing. We&#x27;re like dating teenagers again. Thanks Braun.</li>
    <li> Much better than my previous shaver(panasonic). The cleaning system works really well. I read an earlier review stating that the cleaning solution can be substituted with alcohol. I hope this is true(owners manual says -NO). Any more info regarding this would be greatly appreciated. All in all, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Quite nice indeed. I had been using a Mach-3 blade for the last couple of years as my old Panasonic had given up.  I won&#x27;t be going back to a Mach-3 after this Braun.     It&#x27;s slightly heavy in the hand and a bit too smooth. Still I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet and it worked everyday through a 9 day trip without needing to be recharged.     I was relunctant about the cleaning attachment, but figured what the heck, it&#x27;s my fathers day present. Turns out it works well. I use it every other shave and I&#x27;m over 1/2 full on the cartridge still.    Buy one.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace an older Braun.  This model is quieter and gives a much closer shave.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all I say.  Looks slick, and with a rechargeable base, I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting new batteries from time to time.  I shave about once every two-three days and the cleaning liquid has not been replaced.  It does leave your face very smooth and my razor burn has decreased tremendously, but after the shave it feels as if my face were on fire, but I guess its worth it.  Also, don&#x27;t plan on doing any exercise after shaving for a day since it will really make your face burn.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift--my husband loved it.  Works well, he gets a great shave. Also-I checked the price of this shaver at several other places on and off line, and the Amazon price was MUCH, MUCH lower than anyone that I could find.</li>
    <li> Very fast and easy to use.  A real pleasure and  well worth the money.</li>
    <li> After years of using a razor blade I was surprised at how close this electric shaver came to a blade.  And it does it without knicks or pulling.  The cordless feature is great too.  I can use it several days without recharging it.  I discovered that by forgetting to plug it in.  The cleaning cycle takes a bit long but I start it after I&#x27;ve finished shaving so it&#x27;s ready to use the next time.  It&#x27;s now my primary shaver.</li>
    <li> Great when I used to shave, now that I have a beard I use the trimmer for maintenance, for which it works splendidly. Long battery life, travel case/charger, and an excellent cleaning function are nice too.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this razor in January, I read with some concern the reviews that consistently complained about the cleaning solution and its longevity.  I read how Braun was screwing owners over, that the solution lasted less than three weeks, how expensive it was, yadayadayada.      So here we are, the end of August, eight months later.  I JUST replaced my 3rd cleaning fluid replacement.  That&#x27;s THREE in eight months, folks - with a cleaning EVERY day.  Lessee...at $5/replacement...wow..yeah, that&#x27;s hitting the ol&#x27; wallet.    Whatever.  The bottom line is that I don&#x27;t have to manually clean my razor, and to me, that&#x27;s a HUGE time saver.    That said, Braun&#x27;s statement that \\&quot;you should replace your cutter and screen every eighteen months\\&quot; is total BS.  After six months, the cutter wasn&#x27;t cutting, it was pulling.  Still, that&#x27;s three months longer than my Remington cutters lasted, so I can&#x27;t complain.    Bottom line, this is a GREAT razor at a great price.  Don&#x27;t listen to the cheapskates who probably can&#x27;t afford to buy this anyways, so they find a reason to whine about it.</li>
    <li> A local TV station did a test of all men&#x27;s electric razors, Braun, Panasonic, Norelco, etc., and the panel rated this 360 shaver as the best of all for closest most comfortable shave.  The test lasted 3 weeks and was judged as producing the closest shave, and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new Braun 360 Complete for about 3 months now - each day exclusively; haven&#x27;t used a blade razor since receiving it. And I intend to keep using it that way.     That said, for me it&#x27;s the convenience and the quality of the Braun razor that I like, not the closeness of the shave. It&#x27;s closer than a very much older Braun that I had, but still not as close as the blade razors that I regularly had used.     My theory is that no matter how thin the foil head of an electric razor is, it is still more of a space (between cutting blade and base of hair) than the fine edge of a blade razor. But for me, I like the convenience of shaving anywhere and any time I want.     A final thought is cost. This is the most expensive razor by far that I&#x27;ve ever bought - I&#x27;ll need to get many years of shaves from it to bring the cost per shave down to the blade razors that I had been using.</li>
    <li> Though a tad noisier than I&#x27;d like, this is the best electric shaver I have owned. Shaving includes no irritation, is fast, and comes the closest to a new blade shave of any electric I have owned including: Norrelco (several models), Remington, Grundig, Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation for this excellent shaver is enthusiastic.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great razor but the shave is not good. My old Norelco does a much better and cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> I must have bought this shaver around 2007, it&#x27;s Oct. 2013 and still keeps going. I always leave it plugged in and the battery is still good for 5 days on vacations. I threw out the expensive cleaning system and just remove the foil head and bang it on the sink to clean. I replace the head maybe once a year, maybe. Unbelievable. I keep thinking I want to buy an new shaver but many reviews claim this was one of the best shavers the reviewers ever had. If anyone has found a better shaver please let me know. I have a very thin beard and am looking for a shaver to get those pesky one or two hairs that won&#x27;t seem to cooperate. This shaver can&#x27;t last forever, or can it?</li>
    <li> very speedy shipping during the last week before christmas ordering.  son loves the razor, 1 month use now no problems great job very satisfied</li>
    <li> It is a bit pricey as the solution does have to be replaced after a few cleanings so I don&#x27;t clean after every shave.  I take of the foil cover and blow out the hair-dust and keep it on the charger.  Holds a charge for several shaves!  Excellent battery life!  The leaning solution leaves the razor with a very refreshing scent.  I don&#x27;t have a beard but the beard trimmer is great for trimming sideburns so should be equally effective for beards.  I use the beard trimmer before shaving if I have a few days growth.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband 7 years ago and it is still going STRONG!! The only thing we have ever replaced are the cleaners .. everything else still works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband only shaves once a week which may be why this shaver has lasted so many years but it is still a fantastic investment. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for many years and it works great!</li>
    <li> I love the digital read out as it gives the battery time left and it&#x27;s accurate.  It was stolen from my car and I bought another one.</li>
