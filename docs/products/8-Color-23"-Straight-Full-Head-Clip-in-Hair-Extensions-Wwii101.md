      <li>so this is a cool and healthy alternative.</li>
      <li>the clips keep it securely in place.</li>
      <li>But overall a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION</li>
      <li>The hair was very nice quality...easily curled and straightened back with irons.  </li>
      <li>Quick and easy snaps which have yet to break.</li>
      <li>These were ordered for a special occasion</li>
      <li>This hair extension is super fun!</li>
      <li>The length is nice it is cut in a way that is natural</li>
      <li>Their long &amp; gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I tried many synthetic hair curling methods and so far I haven&#x27;t even achieved a wave.</li>
      <li>It stays straight the whole time &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>They are fun for a one time use.</li>
      <li>Ordered Golden Brown and received Platinum Blond.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;Ordered the Golden Brown-</li>
      <li>Arrive in the mail pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>and it was the right color</li>
      <li>They felt stringy and were heavey and didn&#x27;t clip in right.</li>
      <li>If you want long straight hair then this is a good deal for you, just don&#x27;t curl it.</li>
      <li>Very soft and does not shed very much at all!!</li>
      <li>you hair will have to be pretty look already for it to look right</li>
      <li>The color is also more red than my hair, but it works.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s kind of expected when using synthetic hair extentions since you can&#x27;t use heat on them</li>
      <li>The color is exactly as shown-golden brown&lt;br /&gt;Length</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alright though, still works and the color is exactly like my hair color.</li>
      <li>The color was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>But the hair overall is so soft and nice</li>
      <li>A differant color slightly than pictured but still love them!</li>
      <li>you cant cut it or style it at all, the color is nice but is not worth it because you cant do anything to it.</li>
      <li>Its only one piece and the thing says 8 got tangle easy</li>
      <li>I must warn you, however, that when it says STRAIGHT, it means straight.</li>
      <li>but it is not the real deal.</li>
      <li>Very upset, and it doesn&#x27;t even wrap around my head so in the front</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to someone who doesn&#x27;t really do much with their hair being that these are synthetic.</li>
      <li>I ordered the golden brown expecting it to be a few shades lighter to where it would blend better...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty and silky soft, but I can&#x27;t wear it since my hair is always curly</li>
      <li>my 17 year old son said &amp;#34;ewe yuck that is real hair&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>its allot of hair in one place would be hard to blend with your own.</li>
      <li>I ordered two of the golden brown and got two of the opposite colors.</li>
      <li>They are super thick but they don&#x27;t tangle too easily and they are almost my exact same hair color</li>
      <li>As others posted they were a little thin all together, but as I have thinning hair, they were perfect.  </li>
      <li>after telling them my problem they said they would send me a new one.</li>
      <li>I have straightened it with a flat iron (only to see if it would burn) and it did just fine.</li>
      <li>I ordered a light brown extension and the one I received was almost black.</li>
      <li>The soft straight texture never came back.</li>
      <li>The only problem I seem to be having with them is the longer I&#x27;ve been using them they aren&#x27;t as straight as they came</li>
      <li>This was bought for my 14 year old daughter, the majority of her friends</li>
      <li>, only downside is it gets very tangled</li>
      <li>P.S it looks so natural</li>
      <li>it had a little bit of a reddish undertone but you can only see it under fluorescent lights they are super long and really soft not too shiny and comfortable to wear I</li>
      <li>but once i flat ironed it it looked like real hair.</li>
      <li>When you brush it don&#x27;t pull it, brush gently from the bottom up and brush on a flat surface.</li>
      <li>piece is a high quality, looks natural (very natural) and the length can be adjusted (just follow a you tube video on how to trim long hair).</li>
      <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t curl, it just stays straight and stretched when I tried to curl it with my curler.</li>
      <li>Wash with normal shampoo only when needed.</li>
      <li>If you want it to look like real hair, invest in the more expensive &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair extensions.  </li>
      <li>If you spray it with any flat iron heat protector it will prevent it from tangling, it tangles about the same as real hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long soft and looks natural.</li>
      <li>and then I ordered another one because it just looked unnatural and I got a complete different color</li>
      <li>I would not recommend ordering this product unless you are wanting black/dark brown because apparently that is all they send you.</li>
      <li>It is a healthy shiny which already matches my daughters hair, if you like it less shinny dust it with a little baby power.</li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT SEEMS SO REAL AND DOES NOT LOOK FAKE OR CHEAP</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s no long hair at all.</li>
      <li>The two extensions weren&#x27;t the same color AT ALL, too thin &amp;clips broke off easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There was nothing golden about this hair, but it looked really great and was smooth, just not the right color.</li>
    <li> They are fun for a one time use. You do get what you pay for. It matched the color of my hair purfectly, but not the texture at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all, you can&#x27;t even straighten it or curly it at all no good at all</li>
    <li> I love these extensions! I dye my hair plenty of times &amp; whatever color my hair is the extensions match perfectly. Their long &amp; gorgeous. The wait is definitely. worth it!! &amp; Now I&#x27;m waiting on my golden brown extensions!! (:</li>
    <li> For the price they were great. A differant color slightly than pictured but still love them! Will look for others in the future.</li>
    <li> I ordered two clip in hair extensions for them back in June and only received one about a month later! after telling them my problem they said they would send me a new one. I waited another month or so before emailing them asking where it was and i have not hear a word from anyone. Will not purchase anything from them ever again!!</li>
    <li> you cant cut it or style it at all, the color is nice but is not worth it because you cant do anything to it.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It&#x27;s long soft and looks natural. BUT IT TOOK WEEKS TO COME AND I EVEN PAID $3.99 for IT TO BE HERE THE NEXT DAY AND IT WASNT SO I SUGGEST THAT U DONT GO THROUGH UPS</li>
    <li> Pretty good materials! Except one clip was broken on the hairline. It&#x27;s alright though, still works and the color is exactly like my hair color.</li>
    <li> too darki  it was not golden at all  medium brown no blonde in it  misrepresentation  sorry didn&#x27;t want at all</li>
    <li> Its only one piece and the thing says 8 got tangle easy I just throught away i wont be buying this again wrong color to dark and was uncomfortable</li>
    <li> It was very long but it tangled a lot!! If it wasnt for the tangles would of kept the item :(</li>
    <li> I USE A WRAP BRAID AND INCLUDE THIS TO MAKE THE BRAID LONGER--LOVE IT!  THE PRODUCT SEEMS SO REAL AND DOES NOT LOOK FAKE OR CHEAP</li>
    <li> its allot of hair in one place would be hard to blend with your own. you hair will have to be pretty look already for it to look right</li>
    <li> Can we use heat on the extensions like curling them? Or can we not cause i need to know before i curl them</li>
    <li> This hair extension is super fun! I must warn you, however, that when it says STRAIGHT, it means straight. I tried many synthetic hair curling methods and so far I haven&#x27;t even achieved a wave. The color is also more red than my hair, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this extension is that it stays in well. I don&#x27;t even have to tease my hair at the roots--the clips keep it securely in place.</li>
    <li> The hair was very nice quality...easily curled and straightened back with irons.  As others posted they were a little thin all together, but as I have thinning hair, they were perfect.  Too much fluff would have looked un-natural for me.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what it looks like . It was ordered for my step daughter and I have to assume she likes it. It came on time .</li>
    <li> I ordered a light brown extension and the one I received was almost black. I decided to give it to my sister because it would match her hair better. I ordered the golden brown expecting it to be a few shades lighter to where it would blend better...nope! The new one was even worse! I just wasted a lot of my money and am not very happy. I would not recommend ordering this product unless you are wanting black/dark brown because apparently that is all they send you.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the golden brown and got two of the opposite colors. Very upset, and it doesn&#x27;t even wrap around my head so in the front there&#x27;s no long hair at all. I mean for the price I paid I understand.... But get it together please. At least send me the same color hair</li>
    <li> I loved the price on this hair. The color was exactly what I ordered. Quick and easy snaps which have yet to break.</li>
    <li> This hair was weird. I am a cosmetologist and I thought the price of hair was to good to be true so I ordered one to find out. It is not good quality at all. I am still unsure if it is human hair or synthetic. I&#x27;m 90 percent sure it&#x27;s synthetic (although I have seen some pretty bad human hair). Once I curled it, it was ruined. The soft straight texture never came back. So if you order this, I would not recommend using heat on it. If you want long straight hair then this is a good deal for you, just don&#x27;t curl it.</li>
    <li> Used Amazon Prime-Arrived in 2 days&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the Golden Brown-The color is exactly as shown-golden brown&lt;br /&gt;Length 23 inches-The length is nice it is cut in a way that is natural it is not a blunt cut (just like the image).&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;The piece is a high quality, looks natural (very natural) and the length can be adjusted (just follow a you tube video on how to trim long hair). It is a healthy shiny which already matches my daughters hair, if you like it less shinny dust it with a little baby power. I have straightened it with a flat iron (only to see if it would burn) and it did just fine. If you spray it with any flat iron heat protector it will prevent it from tangling, it tangles about the same as real hair. When you brush it don&#x27;t pull it, brush gently from the bottom up and brush on a flat surface. When you are not using it just put it in your closet on a shelve, weight the clip part down with a book or something and let the tresses dangle down that way they won&#x27;t crimp up. Wash with normal shampoo only when needed. let air dry. Buy a second piece as a back up or for fuller hair. Recommendations:  If you have short hair and want your hair to look longer then buy and use 2 (trim accordingly), if you have shoulder length hair and want it to look a bit longer and fuller but 1 and trim accordingly.  This was bought for my 14 year old daughter, the majority of her friends dye/fry their hair so this is a cool and healthy alternative. She has black hair and it is long (middle of her back) so this piece makes her hair look like she has added highlights to her hair, very cool indeed. As a result mommy (me) has ordered one for me (a dark one to match my hair). P.S it looks so natural my 17 year old son said &amp;#34;ewe yuck that is real hair&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like these period. As they say, you get what you pay for. It is what it is I guess.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. The bottom got frizzy after like a week. The weft is really wide. I do like the product though, I can wear it up or down. I would recommend this product to someone who doesn&#x27;t really do much with their hair being that these are synthetic.</li>
    <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t curl, it just stays straight and stretched when I tried to curl it with my curler. It&#x27;s really pretty and silky soft, but I can&#x27;t wear it since my hair is always curly and I was hoping it would curl like it said it would.</li>
    <li> Arrive in the mail pretty quickly. I&#x27;m sure the clipping on is a lot easier than I make it seem. But overall a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: YOU CAN&#x27;T CURL THIS PLASTIC HAIR. It stays straight the whole time &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> gets tangled easily they didnt have the kind to match my hair so it stands out from everything else and its kinda shinny but once i flat ironed it it looked like real hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually extremely upset, it&#x27;s not anything that has to do with the actual hair, but I bought a set awhilie ago and it was the right color and then I ordered another one because it just looked unnatural and I got a complete different color and I&#x27;m very disappointed. But the hair overall is so soft and nice, only downside is it gets very tangled</li>
    <li> Matched hair perfectly but got caught in rain and changed the texture of the hair</li>
    <li> Horrible, two of the clips fell off the day after I got this thing, and it&#x27;s only now piece, yes definitely not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter loves it..</li>
    <li> they were a waste of money. horrible! They felt stringy and were heavey and didn&#x27;t clip in right. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Love them! They are super thick but they don&#x27;t tangle too easily and they are almost my exact same hair color it had a little bit of a reddish undertone but you can only see it under fluorescent lights they are super long and really soft not too shiny and comfortable to wear I even wore them to sleep (on accident) and they are still perfect! The only problem I seem to be having with them is the longer I&#x27;ve been using them they aren&#x27;t as straight as they came but that&#x27;s kind of expected when using synthetic hair extentions since you can&#x27;t use heat on them :/ but they are still a really awesome product and mine came in 2 days! So I&#x27;m really happy with it and I&#x27;d reccomend this to anyone who wants nice extensions for a cheap price :)</li>
    <li> The two extensions weren&#x27;t the same color AT ALL, too thin &amp;clips broke off easily. Only lasted two wearings. :(</li>
    <li> so not worth it, tried to send it back, could not get answer from vendor</li>
    <li> Love it. well made. came with extra clips. well order more</li>
    <li> Ordered Golden Brown and received Platinum Blond. Not good... These were ordered for a special occasion and I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Recommend to anyone wanting to add length without commitment.  received these items in very good shape and quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Hair easily falls out. Can&#x27;t brush or comb. Gets tangle easily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great product. I was very satisfied with this and with the shipment. Received it way before I was expecting it to come. Very soft and does not shed very much at all!!</li>
    <li> We bought this to wear for a school play. Dumb me, didn&#x27;t realize the combs in the hair piece were clips, not just combs, so we at first thought it was defective, lol. Piece is good for a play or dress up but it is not the real deal. If you want it to look like real hair, invest in the more expensive &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair extensions.  It also tangles very easily so keep it stored in the plastic bag it comes with.</li>
    <li> Terrible at blending. The girl in the pic has a bun on top, making it appear better. It tangles within seconds. Honestly it&#x27;s a terrible,cheap product. My fault for falling for the trick. It even came in the package tangled!!!</li>
    <li> It was okay. But not necessarily the type of hair that you can reuse or use a hair iron with. It also came on time , which was great.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Its so cheap because it sucks so bad. Do Not Buy It!!!!</li>
