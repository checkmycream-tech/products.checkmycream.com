### Positive Reviews

      <li>i like the metal mania or the warm collection better than this one.   </li>

      <li>ok.  </li>
      <li>I think for the price it doesnt get much better.</li>
      <li>I love Laura Gellers eye&amp; lip spackle.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The colors are fantastic and there is a nice mix of shimmer and matte.</li>
      <li>I thought I was buying cheap, but it turns out, it&#x27;s a fav among the pros too!</li>
      <li>, I love the pigments.</li>
      <li>So glad a got it.</li>
      <li>These eyeshadows are much more powdery/chalky and do leave quite a bit of fall-out on the face.</li>
      <li>This is more for a neutral day look or smokey night look to me.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s more mattes in this collection compared to the others.   </li>
      <li>Also, I have the other two 88 palettes (the 88 color and the 88 warm) and this was a great addition to the collection!</li>
      <li>The colors are great - so many for fun bold makeup, and many others for more subtle/natural looks.  </li>
      <li>The colors are very pretty and there is a nice variety.</li>
      <li>The top 4 colors in column 9 are rich amethyst shades followed by 4 olive shades.</li>
      <li>I have found the best success with them when I use a primer beforehand because if I don&#x27;t, the color doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
      <li>As a professional photographer who works with makeup artists at every shoot, I was delighted to see many have this palette in their bag.</li>
      <li>The pigment is strong and oh so blendable.</li>
      <li>21&#x27;s love &amp; beauty shadows are super silky.</li>
      <li>makes a huge difference in pigment.</li>
      <li>I am a huge Coastal Scents fan.</li>
      <li>There are enough shimmers and mattes in it to keep you happy.</li>
      <li>I thoroughly enjoy the colors offered by this palette.</li>
      <li>I look forward to many fun creations with this product.  </li>
      <li>They go on easy and are super easy to blend.</li>
      <li>I am definitely excited about using this palette, it has so many pretty, vibrant, and warm colors.</li>
      <li>But so far I am very pleased.)</li>
      <li>I think of an oasis with rich earth colors like blues and greens, some browns but rust?.  </li>
      <li>Some of the lighter colors have a very light shimmer to them, which I love because they are great to add just a subtle pop to the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I experienced a lot of kick-up from the shadows, so be careful</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend this, specially as a good beginners palette because of the variety it includes.</li>
      <li>Other than that, great work,</li>
      <li>The shipping was super quick, i thought that it would arrive by Jan 3 ( that was the estimated time)but</li>
      <li>Yes it is very pretty</li>
      <li>My eyeshadows came unbroken and very pretty.</li>
      <li>First off!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will also admit that I have slept in this and had perfect eyes the next morning, but again, have a good creme base and you will love this palette.</li>
      <li>These colors are incredible and highly pigmented I use this palette everyday!</li>
      <li>( This is my first palette ever, I purchased this to learn how to do make-up</li>
      <li>It is named \\&quot;Mirage\\&quot; appropriately as it reminds me of a romantic Arabian desert adventure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty but just</li>
      <li>The downside when I first used it-- remembering which color I just used.</li>
      <li>The colors look like they do in the picture, and I thought they were pretty pigmented.</li>
      <li>My first order came damaged, one of the colors seemed to explode all over</li>
      <li>I would recommend putting this eyeshadow on first and then your foundation.</li>
      <li>well went to forever 21 and bought two palettes same size for 20$ and the colors are WAY more visible on the lid</li>
      <li>and it is pretty unavoidable.</li>
      <li>it came exactly when they sais</li>
      <li>The second order came back to me in fair condition, one of the colors came out of its setting</li>
      <li>Though it is not travel size and pretty large (aprx.</li>
      <li>It has all of the colors that I can use for a natural or bold look.</li>
      <li>If you like to wear bright colors but are shy about wearing them, you will enjoy this palette.  </li>
      <li>cause the colors are very pigmented.</li>
      <li>and I cant really compare it to any others.</li>
      <li>the far left are 2 columns of lovely cream and sandy shades;</li>
      <li>but I was able to put it back in its original spot with minimal damage.</li>
      <li>Nice palette of colors and long lasting wear.</li>
      <li>but i really feel like these colors aren&#x27;t nearly as pigmented as my last CS palette which is the original one.</li>
      <li>The case is a matte black, so it does help keep most fingerprints off of it.</li>
      <li>Love the matte and slightly shimmery shades.</li>
      <li>The pans are only dime-sized though, so if you wanted to use this palette every day, I would imagine that you would hit pan quickly.</li>
      <li>Columns 5, 6 and 7 contain olives and various shades of browns, golds and warm neutral pink shades, giving it a Moraccan theme.</li>
      <li>Colors blend well and are vibrant.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty colors, especially when seen in person.</li>
      <li>The colors are very pigmented and the only color that I truly like is the agua like color on the right side of the palette.</li>
      <li>So much so that just a small amount of dark in the corners of my eye made me LOL in shock.</li>
      <li>So soft &amp; very pigmented.</li>
      <li>the colors are beautiful and the only downside about this palette is the fact that by the time I got it one of my colors was broken.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So this is my first time ordering anything from Amazon, and I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed! From the actual product and the short time it took to ship was beyond all expectations. I am definitely excited about using this palette, it has so many pretty, vibrant, and warm colors. ( This is my first palette ever, I purchased this to learn how to do make-up so I wont be able to tell you in depth everything about this palette and I cant really compare it to any others. But so far I am very pleased.) The shipping was super quick, i thought that it would arrive by Jan 3 ( that was the estimated time)but to my surprise it came Dec 30 and I initally ordered it on Dec 27 so this was shipped in \\&quot;2DAYS\\&quot; Amazon is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors, especially when seen in person. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but looking forward to it. My first order came damaged, one of the colors seemed to explode all over so I exchanged it. The second order came back to me in fair condition, one of the colors came out of its setting but I was able to put it back in its original spot with minimal damage. Good luck if you get this palette all in one piece. The colors are all about the size of a dime.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend ordered this for me a couple months ago and i feel guilty because i&#x27;ve barely touched it but i really feel like these colors aren&#x27;t nearly as pigmented as my last CS palette which is the original one. i&#x27;m also fairskinned but after all the reviews and videos on youtube i thought maybe i made a mistake and this palette was to compliement darker skin. i&#x27;ve since been discouraged after giving it a go one month. Bright side there is a gorgeous pewter color that i loved i just wished the lighter colors could have been more pigmented they were so dusty... translucent... even when applied damp &amp;lt;-- which sucked, oh well went to forever 21 and bought two palettes same size for 20$ and the colors are WAY more visible on the lid and you don&#x27;t need to freakin&#x27; mess up your brushes scraping off the eyeshadow infact forever 21&#x27;s love &amp; beauty shadows are super silky.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty but just ok.  i like the metal mania or the warm collection better than this one.   there&#x27;s more mattes in this collection compared to the others.   one of the pots exploded and left a mess everywhere.</li>
    <li> First off! it came exactly when they sais it would. I was a little nervous about it being broken and in packed properly but to my suprise, it was wrapped with a good amount of bubbble wrap and nothing was broken! i love the colors and i am very excited to start expirementing!</li>
    <li> The colors are fantastic and there is a nice mix of shimmer and matte. The downside when I first used it-- remembering which color I just used. LOL. I would recomend an eyeshadow base-- makes a huge difference in pigment. So much so that just a small amount of dark in the corners of my eye made me LOL in shock. The good news is, these colors blend amazingly. But again, not anywhere near as smooth with rich tones if you don&#x27;t use a shadow base. I love Laura Gellers eye&amp; lip spackle. A little goes a long way and I have had no issues with shadow getting all over my face, as another reviewer complained about, but again I don&#x27;t put much on my brush, layer for darker color and tap off access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also admit that I have slept in this and had perfect eyes the next morning, but again, have a good creme base and you will love this palette. It&#x27;s all I need/use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. As a professional photographer who works with makeup artists at every shoot, I was delighted to see many have this palette in their bag. I thought I was buying cheap, but it turns out, it&#x27;s a fav among the pros too!</li>
    <li> Just got this palette yesterday and it showed up well wrapped and in perfect condition.  The colors are great - so many for fun bold makeup, and many others for more subtle/natural looks.  Some of the lighter colors have a very light shimmer to them, which I love because they are great to add just a subtle pop to the eyes.  I look forward to many fun creations with this product.  Also, I have the other two 88 palettes (the 88 color and the 88 warm) and this was a great addition to the collection!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but here in&amp;#34;Humidity Central&amp;#34; Aka South FLA, I need to reapply often and the palette is just too big to bring with me !</li>
    <li> Great palette!  Colors blend well and are vibrant.  Nice mixture of matte and shimmer.</li>
    <li> This palette looked better on the internet. Yes it is very pretty but most of the colors are browns and rust colors with a few grays, dark greens and black and light colors for highlighting. This is more for a neutral day look or smokey night look to me. The colors are very pigmented and the only color that I truly like is the agua like color on the right side of the palette. When I hear the word mirage I think of an oasis with rich earth colors like blues and greens, some browns but rust?.  I will not purchase this palette again because it will last me forever as I will not be using it much.</li>
    <li> Love this palette! So glad a got it. Though it is not travel size and pretty large (aprx. the size of an 11&#x27;&#x27; macbook), I love the pigments. They go on easy and are super easy to blend. The colors have a good variety and even though the quantity is small, a little goes a long way cause the colors are very pigmented. Love the matte and slightly shimmery shades. Would definitely recommend this, specially as a good beginners palette because of the variety it includes.</li>
    <li> So soft &amp; very pigmented. Love it. Just wish it were a little bigger. But for the price &amp; quality good buy.</li>
    <li> received product on time as specified. the ease of using this site (amazon) was an awesome experience and will in the future make more purchases here!!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow palette! It has all of the colors that I can use for a natural or bold look. It&#x27;s very thin which makes it easy to slip in my purse.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my Coastal Scents Mirage 88 palette and was mesmerized when I opened the case which came packaged securely in not only bubble wrap, but a thin paper box as well.  The palette contains a 5\\&quot; mirror and 2 sponge applicators which are held by snaps. It is named \\&quot;Mirage\\&quot; appropriately as it reminds me of a romantic Arabian desert adventure.&lt;br /&gt;To the far left are 2 columns of lovely cream and sandy shades; every color you&#x27;ll need for blending, priming and highlighting. The next 2 columns graduate into neutrals, browns and orange shades with a sweet, romantic \\&quot; dusty rose\\&quot; color included. Columns 5, 6 and 7 contain olives and various shades of browns, golds and warm neutral pink shades, giving it a Moraccan theme. Column 8 features deep, jewel-like greens and blues which remind me of an oasis.  The top 4 colors in column 9 are rich amethyst shades followed by 4 olive shades. The last column gives you a black, charcoal and two fun and flirty blue shades to play with followed by silver, taupe and gray shades.  If you like to wear bright colors but are shy about wearing them, you will enjoy this palette.  The colors are so rich and beautiful.  There are enough shimmers and mattes in it to keep you happy.</li>
    <li> Nice palette of colors and long lasting wear.</li>
    <li> The colors in this set are great. The pigment is strong and oh so blendable. I was happy with the price. The pots are small but the color selection makes this a fun palette</li>
    <li> Definitely good for beginners. However, if you&#x27;re like me and already have a plethora of makeup and different eyeshadows, DON&#x27;T get this.It&#x27;s quite big so you never end up reaching for it even though it has gorgeous colours. I always end up back to my naked or sleek palettes because they&#x27;re smaller and more convenient.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy the colors offered by this palette. I am a professional cosmetologist and also do hair and makeup for weddings, proms, etc. the colors are beautiful and the only downside about this palette is the fact that by the time I got it one of my colors was broken. Other than that, great work,</li>
    <li> The colors on the pallet were very nice, and the price was right,  however, when putting the shadow on with a brush, the powder flys everywhere on your face and, and it is very hard to remove, without taking the rest of your make off:(</li>
    <li> I am a huge Coastal Scents fan. I think for the price it doesnt get much better. They package everything so well, and I really have no complaint other than the product was chipped in some colors. Easy fix, but inconvenient none the less. Its just one of the disadvantages to buying make up online and it is pretty unavoidable.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully rich pigment, but experienced a lot of fall out. Still a good value for money and I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are definitely not the quality of a MAC eyeshadow, but they are great for the price. I have found the best success with them when I use a primer beforehand because if I don&#x27;t, the color doesn&#x27;t last all day. The colors are very pretty and there is a nice variety. I would recommend putting this eyeshadow on first and then your foundation. These eyeshadows are much more powdery/chalky and do leave quite a bit of fall-out on the face.</li>
    <li> One of the colors was broken when the palette arrived, but I am pleased with the rest. Good color payoff and range of shades.</li>
    <li> The majority of these colors are not very pigmented and super sheer.</li>
    <li> Is very good pallete.</li>
    <li> I was wary about ordering this from here because of all the reviews saying the eyeshadows broke during shipping. This was, fortunately, not the case for me. My eyeshadows came unbroken and very pretty. I like how there is a good mix of shimmer and matte shades to create perfect, unique eye looks</li>
    <li> This palette was a lot smaller than I had thought it would be. It comes in the Coastal Scents cardboard box, and is bubble wrapped inside. The case is a matte black, so it does help keep most fingerprints off of it. The colors look like they do in the picture, and I thought they were pretty pigmented. The pans are only dime-sized though, so if you wanted to use this palette every day, I would imagine that you would hit pan quickly. I apply these shadows with synthetic brushes, and they look best with a primer. I experienced a lot of kick-up from the shadows, so be careful if your eyes/nose are easily irritated--they are a little powdery.</li>
    <li> well its all arrive in good condition but you send me wrong amount well i ordered (  2 of Coastal Scents 88 Color Palette, Warm ) but you send me 3 and i order (  3 of Coastal Scents Mirage Palette, 13.1 Ounce ) but i receive 2 and that&#x27;s was so bad, the packing was good the delivery time every thing but this was very bad specially it wasn&#x27;t for me it was for a friend and they feel so upset about that !!!!</li>
    <li> These colors are incredible and highly pigmented I use this palette everyday! The colors are great for all eye colors</li>
