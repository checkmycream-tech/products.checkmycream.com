<li> This product was a new addition to my SM collection and it defines the softness of my hair and curls at the same time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a nice consistency, not watery but not too thick but thick enough to moisturize my 3C tresses.  </li>
<li> , I really have to tame it.</li>
<li> I know much has said a little goes a long way</li>
<li> I fell allergic to something in this (very sensitive skin) and I put the slightly used bottle on the garbage to throw it away.</li>
<li> this is a very good base product for black hair care when it&#x27;s used with coconut oil and eco styling.</li>
<li> After years of subjecting my hair to damaging elements such as heat and hair color, my hair had breakage and was nearly as dry as a tumbleweed.</li>
<li> I started using this leave-in conditioner when I went natural a few years back.  </li>
<li> All I have to do is flat iron my hair once it is dry</li>
<li> It also is long and wavy</li>
<li> My hair is soft, manageable, and less tangled!</li>
<li> I use it while my hair is wet and allow it to air dry.</li>
<li> I have only been using it for a few months, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I discovered it.</li>
<li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
<li> though I supposed it is an oil-based conditioner so this might be expected.</li>
<li> It softens his hair which was especially beneficial after using harsh hair dyes.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s creamy in texture and a little goes a LONG way</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m narrowing down what my hair likes and don&#x27;t like, and my hair likes this.</li>
<li> The conditioner is thick and once you get near the bottom it is hard to get out.  </li>
<li> I stopped using it everyday</li>
<li> I have used a few times</li>
<li> One bottle lasts me a few months (3-4), but I like to stock up</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit too heavy for roller setting by the way.  </li>
<li> Just a little too thick for my texture.</li>
<li> I am not sure about this product.</li>
<li> hair is really thick...</li>
<li> I used just a small amount and my hair seems dirty or weighed down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s good, better than most, but it&#x27;s not going to replace my favorite.  Earth Science, Deep Conditioning Masque for Hair, Olive &amp; Avocado (and it&#x27;s inexpensive too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really thick... I&#x27;m 55, so your hair gets courser as you age and I&#x27;ve got a lot of it.  It also is long and wavy, I really have to tame it. (Irish bar wench hair).  I have to wash my hair, ring it out and then put on the heaviest creamiest conditioner...then leave it on.  While it&#x27;s drying, which takes for ever, I apply argon oil.  Then and only then is my hair not a pouf ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would probably be to heavy for fine hair or a young person with more oils and hormones.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my natural do. Could no longer found it in stores. I&#x27;m happy Amazon has made it available for me again I use it daily to give my hair a lttle curl.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is soft, manageable, and less tangled! I know much has said a little goes a long way but I use a bit more recommended because I have such frizzy curly hair and I have no build up:):) I would deff recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when i received this shea moisture product. It leaves my hair so soft. it has become a staple product in my hair regimen. im sure to buy more this time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only three things I use to help style my hair and I couldn&#x27;t imagine what I would do without it now. I have only been using it for a few months, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I discovered it. After years of subjecting my hair to damaging elements such as heat and hair color, my hair had breakage and was nearly as dry as a tumbleweed. With just one application per wash, this product has helped my hair get its luster and manageability back. I use it while my hair is wet and allow it to air dry. All I have to do is flat iron my hair once it is dry and it leaves my hair silky and super straight. No need for a blow dryer anymore! My hair is extremely healthy now and has grown thicker and longer in what seems to have been overnight! The smell is nice and it absorbs really well. One bottle lasts me a few months (3-4), but I like to stock up so I never run the risk of running out. Great product for anyone who wants beautiful, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of conditioners,  and read alot of reviews and I agree with them this product is wonderful it really  keeps  my dry hair nice and so so soft. thanks Willie</li>
    <li> I fell allergic to something in this (very sensitive skin) and I put the slightly used bottle on the garbage to throw it away. I had no idea that it had dissappeared until I guess it ran out and I found out my husband had been using and LOVING it. It softens his hair which was especially beneficial after using harsh hair dyes.</li>
    <li> SINCE YOU CAN&#x27;T BUY THIS IN THE STORE, BUY IT HERE ON AMAZON. GREAT LEAVE-IN. MAKES HAIR MANAGABLE AND SOFT. GOT TWO AND HAD TO GIVE ONE TO MY MOTHER.. THUMBS UP</li>
    <li> this is a very good base product for black hair care when it&#x27;s used with coconut oil and eco styling.</li>
    <li> I love Shea Moisture&#x27;s products. This product was a new addition to my SM collection and it defines the softness of my hair and curls at the same time. Very pleasant scent and it is not greasy and easily absorbs into my hair and scalp. I love it and will be purchasing more. I prefer leave-in creams better than liquids, and had been looking for a while for a good leave-in until I found SM Leave-Inc Conditioner! Perfect! Simply love it!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time in my hair (relaxed, African American) and OMG, it left my hair silky smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s creamy in texture and a little goes a LONG way so I know I will have it for awhile.  It also smells soooo good. I am definitely ordering more to use when I air dry. It&#x27;s a bit too heavy for roller setting by the way.  I tried and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  I would definitely recommend buying this product.  I&#x27;m adding it to my staple list.</li>
    <li> This is my staple leave in conditioner for my natural hair.  It smells amazing and it really keeps my hair moisturized.  It&#x27;s more of a cream than an oil and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> I love this leavein. Very moisturizing,and it&#x27;s not greasy, this is actually the best product I&#x27;ve used on my hair since I went natural 8 months ago, and I&#x27;ve used a lot. But I&#x27;m getting better and I&#x27;m narrowing down what my hair likes and don&#x27;t like, and my hair likes this. I ordered two bottles by mistake because of two different ads on Amazon, the bottles looked different so I wanted them both it ended up being the same thing but I&#x27;m not complaining because I would have brought it again and from Amazon, who always gives me great service.</li>
    <li> I started using this leave-in conditioner when I went natural a few years back.  I really love how soft it makes my hair feel and my only complaint is the container it is in.  The conditioner is thick and once you get near the bottom it is hard to get out.  I have to cut the container and put the product in a jar to use all of it.  Aside from that, this is an awesome conditioner for natural hair.</li>
    <li> This has been some of the best leave-in conditioners ever for my extremely dry 4b hair. This will be my new staple. Leaves hair feeling so soft and detangled.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product. I read the great reviews and thought I would give it a try. I have used a few times and I do not like the results. I used just a small amount and my hair seems dirty or weighed down. Not really what I was looking for. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love all Shea Moisture product but this is my favorite. This product has all of the essential oils that I love in one and a great smell. I use on my hair and my son&#x27;s curly q&#x27;s. It leaves my hair soft and well mositurized. It acts as a good detangler and daily moisturizer. I wish it was available retail. Seller, please keep it in stock. Thank you.</li>

    <li> Just a little too thick for my texture. Maybe this is for someone with thicker hair. Gives good moisture though.</li>
    <li> I heard great reviews about this product on another site and had the shampoo, couldn&#x27;t wait to get the conditioner to go w/ it and I love it. Makes my hair feel so so soft, manageable and healthy.</li>
