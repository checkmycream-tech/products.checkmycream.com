### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great deal though</li>
      <li>but I was expecting it to work better.</li>
      <li>This soft baby hat works great.  </li>
      <li>Loved this for my 2 year old!</li>
      <li>This made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Meaning it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>Material feels cheap, not at all what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>and they are cheap</li>
      <li>The shipping took a long time and they need to ship in a better package but the product is good.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why this says child because it is too small for my great niece!  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Not made for babies way to big if I knew they wouldn&#x27;t fit now</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very upset</li>
      <li>Made of a thin foam, this is a temporary, good solution for smaller heads :)</li>
      <li>but my daughter is really sensitive to water in her eyes and she moves so much in the bath</li>
      <li>but after a few days they were fine.  </li>
      <li>Runs small and doesn&#x27;t fit my toddler&#x27;s head.  </li>
      <li>The material is very weak, so make hard to put on baby&#x27;s head plus baby&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t like nothing on the head doesn&#x27;t want to use it , big challenge to adjust the item on the head you really need to have good skills with your hands to hold your baby&#x27;s head and to tighten and adjust the clasps... wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting</li>

    <li> Does not work for toddlers! It&#x27;s made for tiny heads. Only for infants. Bad description and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Arrived with only one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this says child because it is too small for my great niece!  What a disappointment!  This is just what we had been looking for to keep the shampoo and water out of here eyes.</li>
    <li> Loved this for my 2 year old! It helps so the soap doesn&#x27;t get in her eyes! It is an inexpensive item that works!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time but my daughter is really sensitive to water in her eyes and she moves so much in the bath it&#x27;s hard to position her so it doesn&#x27;t happen.  This made a huge difference.</li>

    <li> I know it&#x27;s just foam but I was expecting it to work better.</li>
    <li> Does not work to keep the water out of baby&#x27;s eyes regardless of how tight you put it around her head. It is also hard to put over her as she freaks out. Cries because water gets in her eyes anyways</li>
    <li> I bought junk and I&#x27;m very upset, I waited a month for trash to come in the mail. These things shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to be sold on Amazon. Very disappointed. It does no justice in the bath. Water still gets all over her face. Don&#x27;t waste your time and your money.</li>

    <li> Not made for babies way to big if I knew they wouldn&#x27;t fit now I would of waited on the purchase</li>
