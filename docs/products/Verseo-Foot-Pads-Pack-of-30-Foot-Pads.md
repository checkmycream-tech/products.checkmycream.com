    <li> Verseo Detox Foot Patches work. This product is excellent and draws the toxins from the body overnight. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like the Verseo brand much better, seems to work much better than this brand from China. Also the adhesive pads are really hard to remove. Will not buy again, I would rather spend a little more and get higher quality in this product!!!</li>
    <li> Ok so you say these things don&#x27;t work.  Wrong.  Here is an example,  my husband and I both use them.  He eats more junk food then I do.  He gets a gummy black sticky issue on the pad the next morning.  I get a black brown powdery issue.  I though well just the heat of my foot and the sweat of my foot would cause this.  Wrong again.  I actually accidentally put on the wrong side.  Yes it was upside down.  I wear socks on my feet over them.  The one that was on correctly had the black brown junk on it the next morning.  The other one that I put on backwards.  Was clean and had no discoloration at all.  So if there is any way to get junk, poisons out of your body and this is one way. Just do it.  You will feel so much better after at least one whole week of using them.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, item as described.</li>
    <li> A pack of 30 is actually 15 patches since you use one patch on each foot and need an adhesive for each.  I think it is misrepresented and  too small and kind of cheap. not entirely satisfied as I usually am with amazon-backed products.</li>
    <li> The smell was enough to knock you off your feet.  I was so sorry I opened this inside of my home.&lt;br /&gt;Sent it back as fast as I could.  How anyone could wear these for anytime is beyond me.</li>
    <li> I put them on before bed, as instructed and fell asleep. At about 1 am, I awoke to a burning sensation in both feet. Probably the menthol. Any way, I ripped them off and threw them across the floor. I attempted to go back to sleep but my feet were burning so badly that it was difficult. Even after a shower and several hours later, one foot is still burning. I think I&#x27;ll save the rest of the pads for someone I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This product is horribly made and is made in China so it does nothing like the authentic ones from Japan does...........  I&#x27;m a daily user of foot patches and tried several different companies, when I came across this at such a bargain price, I thought to give it a try.  What a mistake that was, ended up throwing away the entire package, the stick pads are so sticky that it&#x27;s hard to take it off in the morning and leaves a nasty residue behind on your skin, the patch itself does not draw any liquid from the foot as it would normally would and all it does is turn black.  save your money and spend it on the real stuff made from Japan!!!</li>
    <li> experienced no benefit at all</li>
    <li> Although more expensive than most brands, I prefer these because they work. I like the cloth cover instead of the paper that other brands use and there&#x27;s less of the bandage and more of the product. I have also used them on my palms at night to pull toxins out of my joints, relieving hand and shoulder arthritis.</li>
    <li> this is a good product, I&#x27;m 52 years old and have never detoxed anything. Not only did the patches extract a considerable amount of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; from my system, it helped rid me of some foot/skin/rash fungus of some sort. it&#x27;s gone, after 10 years of bad feet.</li>
    <li> A friend convinced me to try this product!  It truly does work.  Actually does reduce inflammation in my arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> This product really works.</li>
    <li> Simple to use, works overnight and makes me feel that I have done something good for my body.  If you need an internal cleaning, this is a great place to begin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about toxins in the body and whether we should pull them out, but I do know that I love using these things. I use them when I have over-did-it at the gym or in the yard. It brings down swelling which in turns reduces the pain so I don&#x27;t have to take medicine.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.  They are GREAT at detoxing the body.</li>
    <li> It works and it turns dark during the night.  I have nerve damage in by feet, so I had to quit using it for awhile. It was keeping me up at night.</li>
    <li> The product perform as described.  However I cannot say whether or not it has made any significant change in my health.  I would still purchase it again since it appears to work as described.</li>
    <li> Good product. Carol Wright delivered on time and in good condition</li>
    <li> This product most definately works!!  I have been suffering from peripheral neuropathy for over two years and no matter which dumb doctor I went to not had a solution on how to fix the source of the problem and only prescribed medication which mad my problem worse. After two days my nerve pain pain is subsiding and also multiple  stinging pimples I had on my feet have complete dissapeared from toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I see some people rated this product a 1 star because of it&#x27;s smell which is rediculous because I couldn&#x27;t  smell anything unless I put my nose on the pads.  Even if the pads smelled like a skunk I would still use because it works!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> People that have never tried these need to because it amazed me when I realized the toxin output.  I&#x27;m glad I found them.</li>
