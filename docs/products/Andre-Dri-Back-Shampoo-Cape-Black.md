      <li>Easy to clean.</li>

      <li>It is a very nice and creative product, but as a senior hairdesser I found it a little bit heavier than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>

      <li>I keeps the client dry and is comfortable.</li>
      <li>It may work better for a less busy hair dresser.</li>
      <li>so if there is a drip it doesn&#x27;t go far (and will keep hair from getting lower on the body).</li>
      <li>This Cape still attaches with Velcro but it has an elastic collar which is very helpful since I could never get the collar tight enough on these Andre capes before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <li> Awesome cape it keeps the clients fro getting wet when you washem off in the shampoo bowl , it really good quality , if your a hairstylist you should really get one its great</li>
    <li> I bought this because I get my hair done at home, and it&#x27;s just like you&#x27;d get in a salon. It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d want in a cape, as far as I am aware.</li>
    <li> This cape was OKAY. Since it is fairly short in the back it left my butt SOAKING wet! the water just drips of the neck part straight onto your lower back/butt area, I have now turned the cape BACKWARDS to prevent this from happening. I may look into a different one...</li>
    <li> This is a great cape for the price!  I dye my own hair and this saves my clothes.  It has the standard neck closure with Velcro and slide hook so if there is a drip it doesn&#x27;t go far (and will keep hair from getting lower on the body).</li>
    <li> local Sally\\&quot;s didn\\&quot;t have a shanpoo cape with the flap to protect the neck and clothes. Amazon to the rescue.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for hair school, she loves it. I keeps the client dry and is comfortable.</li>
    <li> Works great. I cut my husbands hair here at home and it has helped keep the mess to a minimum</li>
    <li> Came on time as was what it was advertised to be. Good for the purpose it was purchased for. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for cutting my husband hair. It serves its purpose at a good price. Have used it numerous times and still in great shape.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice and creative product, but as a senior hairdesser I found it a little bit heavier than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not keeping this product, but my Junior hairdresser are.</li>
    <li> My Mom has someone come to her home to do her hair, this cape is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered the cape so that I could shampoo my mom&#x27;s hair while she sits in a chair. The cape has kept me from drowning her quite to much! Easy to use, clean, and store.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to help keep hair off clothes as I cut my family&#x27;s hair and this cape did that well.  It is thicker than what I found locally at a cheaper cost so I was very pleased with this product.  I have misplaced mine and am hoping to find it again to use as I missed it this past time cutting hair for my boys.  The velcro has kept its effect and no rips or tears yet.</li>
    <li> Best cape ever to shampoo older clients or people that cannot lean back into the bowl of the sink. That extra flap can hang down into the sink allowing the run off to drain even if they aren&#x27;t in the proper position. Much needed if you are a stylist.</li>
    <li> This cape is super cheap and works the best! It wraps around like a regular cape but falls down into the shampoo bowl and keeps ur client from getting wet!! I use it daily!</li>
    <li> The cape is a great price and works well for what I use it for.  My 2 main uses are cutting my kids hair and coloring mine.  The length is generous and the elastic/Velcro fit snugly around to keep hair off their necks.  It also keeps my back dry when I shampoo out my color.</li>
    <li> This Cape still attaches with Velcro but it has an elastic collar which is very helpful since I could never get the collar tight enough on these Andre capes before.&lt;br /&gt;This Cape is so lightweight you won&#x27;t even feel it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to color my hair at home. And I wash it in the washing machine on Delicate and hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;These capes are much more expensive at the Beauty Supply stores.</li>
    <li> Product is durable and great for haircuts. Easy to clean. Have not used it for shampoo, but i assume that will work fine also.</li>
    <li> Like description. Good quality for a good price. I use it at home when I dye my hair and it protects me very well. The length is generous and the elastic/Velcro fit snugly around to keep hair off their necks.I was  tired of using a towel and be concerned about making mess around. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> Quality is better than I expected for the price I paid.  I will definitely order again if I need more.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of this cape but it rips too easy. The packaging and delivery was great. I would buy from again. The price was good to try and see. It may work better for a less busy hair dresser.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair at home and she was tired of using a towel and making a huge mess. It&#x27;s a good material so it should never rip.</li>
