<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not the best tasting, but not bad, and has the ingredients I was looking for. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has no poisoned fluoride in it, or SLS which is used in floor cleaning products and is known to cause cancer.  There are very few toothpastes out there that are sold without fluoride and SLS.  I also like the Spearmint taste better than the peppermint.  My 6 year old and my 2 year old both like the taste as well, which is great since it is safe for them to use.  I hope they keep this toothpaste on the market forever!</li>
    <li> I have dermatitis caused by fluoride (I know right). I switched to this type of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste and it has helped so much. I actually think it tastes ten times better, and my teeth are actually less sensitive than when using the other brands I have had before. I have always had a problem with that. I usually feel clean afterwards, but not like I poured bleach in my mouth and scrubbed (that&#x27;s a good thing). A great alternative to the normal guys.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is great. It is made with natural ingredients, does not leave an aftertaste in your mouth and helps prevent and fight mouth ulcers.</li>
    <li> it is wonderful for my teeth, has not caused any cankers, and helps them feel wonderful.dentist does not know that i use toms, and im not going to tell him.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Tastes very fresh and cleans well. It&#x27;s good to know that it also does not contain any harsh chemicals int here dangerous for the health.</li>
    <li> I do my best to stay away from fluoride and SLS....this toothpaste has neither and tastes great.  Our whole family uses this toothpaste.  I love that I have a fluoride-free option for my 9 and 12 year old.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really leave your mouth feeling squeaky clean or minty fresh, but does help with rosacea problems, so you can&#x27;t really ask for more than that.  I&#x27;ve used this for about a year and it&#x27;s helped my skin issues immensely; just wish it tasted a bit mintier!</li>
    <li> This product was a trial item that did alright but did not make the favorite list. The product&#x27;s description is accurate and the contents in the tube tastes minty.</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite Tom&#x27;s of Maine flavor. I tried the toothpaste with fennel and grew tired of the licorice taste in my toothpaste. I haven&#x27;t had a dentist appointment since I started using it, so I can&#x27;t say whether it has helped my teeth and gum health.</li>
    <li> Love this product it doesn&#x27;t leave residue. It has a good taste. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel worried about fluoride since its has no fluoride. I hope groceries start selling at stores, its time for people realize that fluoride is toxic for kids and adults.</li>
    <li> Guys, don&#x27;t be fool. This product is selling for 5.99 in local Ralph&#x27;s store. The toothpaste itself is excellent. No SLS and fluoride. I bought two for my parents.</li>
    <li> I really like this version of Tom&#x27;s.  I tried a different one that left an awful aftertaste that lasted for hours.  You&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> The ad said each was a 2 pack/tube, so I believed I would be getting 8 tubes total.  When I only got 4 tunes, at a every high price per tube, I was very disappointed; but not enough to complain to Amazon at the time!  Love the toothpaste but, this last purchase was a tip-off on price.</li>
    <li> ...for those paranoid and unsure about science&#x27;s biochemical comprehension and skeptical of the thoroughness clinical trials feign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - -</li>
