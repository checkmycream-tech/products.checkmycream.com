    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite.  It seems like anything else, though:  A good thing gets discontinued.  Stock up before its gone.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand/shade I use. Been buying it and using it for years. Hope they never discontinued the shade.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Revlon doesn&#x27;t make this color anymore. It&#x27;s a good neutral shade that can be modified with lipliner. Please, Revlon, produce it again.</li>
    <li> This product was discontinued in the usual retail sources and I had unsuccessfully tried several different products  attempting to duplicate the color.  I am very happy that Amazon found it for me.</li>
    <li> I have worn this lipstick for the last 10 years. So disappointed that Revlon discontinued it. I hope to be able to find it when I run out again.</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for me and the formula is moisturizing. I was searching for this color. It was unable to find it in WalGreen or CVS. This color is nice for more mature women. I personally dont care for the new brighter or stand out lip colors.</li>
    <li> Looked everywhere for this discontinued color by Revlon.  So happy Amazon had a few hidden away so we could pick them up, as we really love this color and the lipstick&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is mauve with a copper frost.&lt;br /&gt;On me, an auburn head, I look like a zombie! I really can&#x27;t imagine this looking good on anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just plain nasty! Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture....</li>
    <li> It is disappointing when you finally find a color you like and then the local stores don&#x27;t carry it any longer.  I went to Amazon and thankfully they had my color in stock.  Made me happy....  When in the market to buy, always check out Amazon first.  Happy customer....</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick ! Have used this color for a long time . Couldn&#x27;t find In any store in my area.</li>
    <li> The lipstick at the store before being discontinued was 1/2 the price as this. Good quality but expensive. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love Revlon lipsticks.  It&#x27;s always high quality lipstick.  Also an amazing color selection.  I would buy again when I run out. :)  :)</li>
    <li> My favorite lipstick.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m told its been discontinued.  Another item I have to order online that I just love.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find a color no longer made by Revlon.  It came promptly. Was a little disappointed in how much it cost in relation to current colors.  I am all for profit but this was a bit  grasping.</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this seeing as you can never tell what the shade will actually be or if it will be for you, but the price was pretty good. Very smooth lipstick and beautiful color that I haven&#x27;t tried before. Now it is one of my favorite lipsticks. Feel that this shade would look good on just about anyone.</li>
    <li> I have loved this lipstick color and quality for years. Most other lipsticks dry or actually hurt my lips because of their chemical composition, but this Revlon Super Lustrous Pearl Copperglow lipstick has consistently worked well for me. I haven&#x27;t found a replacement and, up to now, I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on what turned out to be inferior replacements. Revlon, are you listening?</li>
    <li> I love this brand of lipstick and this has been my favorite color for years....and now they have discontinued it. I was very happy to find one on Amazon. Revlon lipstick  is very moisturizing and long lasting.</li>
    <li> copperglow berry is pretty much all berry and no copper. I wanted a copper color but this is almost purple. It does go on nicely and feels good but I don&#x27;t know how long it wears since I just got it and applied it.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It works with my fair, cool complexion &amp; whitens my teeth. I get compliments every time I wear it .</li>
    <li> I hate that Revlon is no longer carrying this color it is a good one and I will miss it so much</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this color for a while.  Now they stopped making the color so I found them online.  It came really quick too.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law swears by this lipstick, since she says she can put it on and it will stay on, with no dryness, all day.</li>
    <li> This color has been discontinued and the &#x27;hunt is on.  I have worn this shade for many years and always get compliments on the shade.  It&#x27;s not too dark, has a neat metallic shade to it and just can&#x27;t be replaced.  Why would Revlon discontinue it????  I was happy to find it on Amazon but it cost three times the original price.  In my book, worth every penny!!</li>
