      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
      <li>ok but not the best i would not pay 10 for this.</li>
      <li>but if I work it through my hair good and do it  before i go to bed</li>
      <li>Smell good too</li>
      <li>Works well and smells good.</li>
      <li>We both love it!</li>
      <li>but this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>it looks amazing in the morning.</li>
      <li>It works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>Scent is nice.  </li>
      <li>This is much more effective than any of the sprays I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>So far I like this one the best.</li>
      <li>I apply it the day after a wash, and can go at lease two more days with volume and no oil.</li>
      <li>It does not work immediately in my experience, but within an hour or so (or longer) it really does a great job.</li>
      <li>I love the design of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Best Dry shampoo I have ever used!</li>
      <li>It has a light to neutral smell, which is pleasing too, and is not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>It does go on a bit light in color</li>
      <li>I decided to try it because I was looking specifically for a cruelty free product.  </li>
      <li>A tip for reducing any ashy color residue -- lightly rub a damp wash cloth over the visible  surface of your hair style and over the scalp along part lines</li>
      <li>Of all the beauty products I am using right now this is the one I am the most excited about.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original volume.</li>
      <li>This is a great dry shampoo though it takes a bit of practice</li>
      <li>and this is definitely my favorite thus far.</li>
      <li>I love the simple, clean smell and LOVE that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really inexpensive compared to similar products and I love that Giovanni is cruelty free and that this product has no dyes or scent.</li>
      <li>It has virtually no scent which is important to me because fragrances are super irritating to the scalp, even if they&#x27;re pleasant to smell.</li>
      <li>I bought this at whole foods for about $12 but should have looked on amazon first!</li>
      <li>However it is more expensive and I don&#x27;t like breathing sprays (although Hair Play has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t overpowering).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed best results after a few hours or even the following morning, more so than with other products.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the better dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many dry shampoos</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>No to mention it is completely natural, no scary chemicals!</li>
      <li>and I find it works best if I sprinkle just a bit onto an open hand and then spread a little on both palms to apply, and repeat as necessary.</li>
      <li>If you want a spray, KMS Hair Play works really well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like, and it really absorbs oil well.</li>
      <li>works very well.</li>
      <li>It also smells really great--like coconuts.</li>
      <li>Really great--seriously soaks up the oil.  </li>
      <li>The smell is subtle but pleasant.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this dry powder works just as well and is more natural.</li>
      <li>It has gotten me out of several rushed situations, saving me from the embarrassment of greasy hair for 3-4 hours, when I did not have time for a full rewash.</li>
      <li>Which actually works better- no clumping and no greasy look later in the day.  </li>
      <li>My fine hair get oily/stringy quickly and it really sucks up the oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a little bit gritty if you use too much, which is why it&#x27;s a good idea to use a smaller amount and then build up as needed.</li>
      <li>thinking I&#x27;d find something worthy of 5 stars, but not even Klorane&#x27;s (powder or spray) dry shampoos work as well.</li>
      <li>If you use this correctly, you won&#x27;t see the white of the powder, and it works really well--helps remove the appearance of grease and gives you extra volume, especially if you don&#x27;t have time for a shower or want to freshen up quickly.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how well this product works.  </li>
      <li>But if that happens, all you have to do is get a damp cloth and gently dab the part line because that&#x27;s the only place it shows.  </li>
      <li>I try to avoid using near my face or try to brush it out to avoid the powder from showing.</li>
      <li>If you use too much it will make your hair look white.</li>
      <li>It does last a very long time too, and you can see exactly how much product is left thanks to the packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brands from Sephora that worked just a little bit better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to work into my hair and doesnt have the stiffness i found with the spray dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>No other product I have tried has worked as well as this does.</li>
      <li>and i can see what im doing, unfortunately for the top crown back of my head which gets really oily it doesnt work well</li>
      <li>I have used, what feels like a ton of it so far, and yet the bottle is only depleted by about a fifth</li>
      <li>I was really dubious about the idea of dry shampoo, in general, but a total convert to using it to augment hair care, now.</li>
      <li>This product allowed me to transition my very fine hair to an every other day wash schedule without looking like a wet rat for a few months.</li>

<li> This product allowed me to transition my very fine hair to an every other day wash schedule without looking like a wet rat for a few months.</li>
<li> I use it either when my hair gets greasy from too long a time space between full washes, or when I have absentmindedly applied too much heat protectant, or conditioning mask,  and thus caused my clean hair, to be nasty greasy looking.</li>
<li> I think this will last a lot longer than the spray dry shampoos i&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos four of which are sprays.</li>
<li> Klorane&#x27;s dry/powder shampoo is difficult to disperse without getting almost no product or way too much, and it&#x27;s highly perfumed.  </li>
<li> so if I don&#x27;t rinse it looks grey.</li>
<li> made me look like I had grey hair</li>
<li> I can go so much longer wearing my hair down between washes now!!!</li>
<li> and it instantly makes my hair less oily and definitely gets me through an day of two of washing.</li>
<li> I have dark brown hair, and do not find that it leaves any noticable white residue.</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first because I had only ever used the spray type dry shampoo</li>
<li> This little bottle is lasting a long time--</li>
<li> I have dark brown hair</li>
<li> If you have dark hair use it the night before.  </li>
<li> Also I have black hair and it works well on me.</li>
<li> my hair is black</li>
<li> it was a waste of my money</li>
<li> messy, didn&#x27;t make a ton of difference.</li>
<li> I usually dap some on and spread it around</li>
<li> I bought this at whole foods a while back and its horrible.</li>
<li> This works so well on my thick wavy hair!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how it works compared to others, but it is the least expensive (price per gram) that I could find on Amazon.  </li>
<li> So, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s besting the competition even though it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a well-known product for some reason.</li>

    <li> I was surprised at how well this product works.  A tip for reducing any ashy color residue -- lightly rub a damp wash cloth over the visible  surface of your hair style and over the scalp along part lines --does the trick!  I&#x27;m just hoping they&#x27;ll come out with a product for darker hair.</li>
    <li> I have blond hair, but the light-colored powder is still visible on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve tried to use this product several  times, and each time, I  wind up having to wash my hair to get rid of it.  I might as well have dumped baby powder in my hair!  It clings to my scalp and looks ashy in my hair.  I don&#x27;t understand why they say it adds shine.  It does just the opposite.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells good.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I was skeptical at first because I had only ever used the spray type dry shampoo but this stuff is AMAZING. The smell is subtle but pleasant. I put it on before I go to bed and it instantly makes my hair less oily and definitely gets me through an day of two of washing. It does go on a bit light in color but if I work it through my hair good and do it  before i go to bed it looks amazing in the morning. I think this will last a lot longer than the spray dry shampoos i&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s so much easier to work into my hair and doesnt have the stiffness i found with the spray dry shampoos. I bought this at whole foods for about $12 but should have looked on amazon first! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> This works so well on my thick wavy hair! I love the simple, clean smell and LOVE that it&#x27;s all natural! I&#x27;ve tried this brand as well as both Batiste and the Pssssst brands and this is definitely my favorite thus far. I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing this again.</li>
    <li> If you use this correctly, you won&#x27;t see the white of the powder, and it works really well--helps remove the appearance of grease and gives you extra volume, especially if you don&#x27;t have time for a shower or want to freshen up quickly. It also smells really great--like coconuts.</li>
    <li> Great product! works very well. I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day and it gets oily looking and this product fixes that! Smell good too</li>
    <li> messy, didn&#x27;t make a ton of difference.</li>
    <li> Purchased a bottle for myself and my teenage daughter.  We both love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great dry shampoo though it takes a bit of practice and I find it works best if I sprinkle just a bit onto an open hand and then spread a little on both palms to apply, and repeat as necessary. It does not work immediately in my experience, but within an hour or so (or longer) it really does a great job. It has virtually no scent which is important to me because fragrances are super irritating to the scalp, even if they&#x27;re pleasant to smell. I&#x27;ve purchased many dry shampoos thinking I&#x27;d find something worthy of 5 stars, but not even Klorane&#x27;s (powder or spray) dry shampoos work as well. Klorane&#x27;s dry/powder shampoo is difficult to disperse without getting almost no product or way too much, and it&#x27;s highly perfumed.  The only drawbacks of this product are that it probably won&#x27;t blend well with darker hair, though the powder look does fade after an hour or so. It&#x27;s also a little bit gritty if you use too much, which is why it&#x27;s a good idea to use a smaller amount and then build up as needed. I&#x27;ve noticed best results after a few hours or even the following morning, more so than with other products.  So, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s besting the competition even though it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a well-known product for some reason.

    <li> I love this dry shampoo! This product allowed me to transition my very fine hair to an every other day wash schedule without looking like a wet rat for a few months. No other product I have tried has worked as well as this does. It blends into my blonde hair effortlessly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue. No to mention it is completely natural, no scary chemicals! Of all the beauty products I am using right now this is the one I am the most excited about.</li>
    <li> I love the design of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;Returning</li>
    <li> made me look like I had grey hair it was a waste of my money</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I use it either when my hair gets greasy from too long a time space between full washes, or when I have absentmindedly applied too much heat protectant, or conditioning mask,  and thus caused my clean hair, to be nasty greasy looking. It works amazingly well. I have dark brown hair, and do not find that it leaves any noticable white residue. It has a light to neutral smell, which is pleasing too, and is not tested on animals. I was really dubious about the idea of dry shampoo, in general, but a total convert to using it to augment hair care, now. It has gotten me out of several rushed situations, saving me from the embarrassment of greasy hair for 3-4 hours, when I did not have time for a full rewash. I have used, what feels like a ton of it so far, and yet the bottle is only depleted by about a fifth it&#x27;s original volume. Rad!</li>
    <li> Really great--seriously soaks up the oil.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s light-colored, so it can be visible in darker hair, looking a bit ashy.  This is much more effective than any of the sprays I&#x27;ve used.  Wish Giovanni would make a version for darker hair.  I often use it for extra volume and texture.  Scent is nice.  This little bottle is lasting a long time--I keep thinking that I must be running low, but no!</li>
    <li> Best Dry shampoo I have ever used! I can go so much longer wearing my hair down between washes now!!! I have told all of my friends about it!! It is just wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos four of which are sprays. So far I like this one the best. The 50gm amount last longer than the spray cans. My fine hair get oily/stringy quickly and it really sucks up the oil. I do wish it came tinted in brown since it shows up on my brunette hair. I try to avoid using near my face or try to brush it out to avoid the powder from showing.</li>
    <li> I swim M-F.  I try not to wash my hair on Saturday and Sunday because chlorine dries and fades my hair color.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like, and it really absorbs oil well. Also I have black hair and it works well on me. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brands from Sephora that worked just a little bit better but I didn&#x27;t like their smell and they are much more expensive than this one.</li>
    <li> powdered this stuff all up in my hair, massaged it and then rinsed it out in the shower. no residue after rinsing and leaves hair voluminous after drying. my hair is black so if I don&#x27;t rinse it looks grey.</li>
    <li> Some here have suggested using corn starch instead to save money. So I tried it and found that it doesn&#x27;t come close to working as well as this product. I apply it the day after a wash, and can go at lease two more days with volume and no oil. With cornstarch, my hair still looked greasy and definitely did not have volume.  This is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried, so I don&#x27;t know how it works compared to others, but it is the least expensive (price per gram) that I could find on Amazon.  If you use too much it will make your hair look white. But if that happens, all you have to do is get a damp cloth and gently dab the part line because that&#x27;s the only place it shows.  If you want a spray, KMS Hair Play works really well. However it is more expensive and I don&#x27;t like breathing sprays (although Hair Play has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t overpowering). In my opinion, this dry powder works just as well and is more natural.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale for $2.50. I have dark brown hair it works well when i put it in the front of my hair and i can see what im doing, unfortunately for the top crown back of my head which gets really oily it doesnt work well it leaves it looking ashy and i can still feel it greasy and it feels sticky. I usually dap some on and spread it around it works ok but not the best i would not pay 10 for this.</li>
    <li> I bought this at whole foods a while back and its horrible. It leaves white powder residue all in my hair. At the time there were no reviews when I tried to look it up and just thought to review it now! It doesn&#x27;t work well for me.... at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I decided to try it because I was looking specifically for a cruelty free product.  If you have dark hair use it the night before.  Will keep you from needing it/seeing oil. Which actually works better- no clumping and no greasy look later in the day.  And, the white is totally gone by morning.</li>
