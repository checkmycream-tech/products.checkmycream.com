      <li>The best all round body lotion you will ever use.</li>
      <li>Get some and enjoy.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find it here after my local drugstore stopped carrying it (made room for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; lotion).  </li>
      <li>My son has eczema, so I have purchased several of your creams and lotions and they have been great for him, so I tried some of them.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is nice and light, not thick and creamy.  </li>
      <li>It does however, feel refreshing when u first put it on.</li>
      <li>The best lotion EVER especially if you have sensitive skin or eczema!</li>
      <li>It suds up (which is important to me), and the scent is light and fresh.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>Fresh scent, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a person greasy and keeps my skin comfortable all day.  </li>
      <li>and so this doesn&#x27;t quite give me the adequate moisture I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert and my skin felt better within 2 days of using just the product</li>
      <li>(I live in Illinois) and contacted MyMedExpress to see if they would be able to help.</li>
      <li>When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream.</li>
      <li>The only thing that works on psoriasis better than any prescription cream or pill!</li>
      <li>Fast Absorbing,soft and smooth after feel.love the scent.</li>
      <li>I am grateful to have found this product - well worth the price.</li>
      <li>A simple and highly effective product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This and non-soap facial and bath are best among other brands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wanted to do the right thing for my skin and use a lotion that was pH balanced.</li>
      <li>So this cost $16.48 right now</li>
      <li>yeah right.</li>
      <li>but it is absorbed very fast.</li>
      <li>However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US</li>
      <li>I have psoriasis and this helps me so very much.</li>
      <li>leave skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>you just have to be consistent with use.</li>
      <li>I am so very grateful!</li>
      <li>Although not cheap, it is really a good product.</li>
      <li>I also use the Sebamed face cream for sensitive skin and fragrance free hydrating gentle skin cleanser for the face and body.</li>
      <li>It spreads easily, soaks up very quickly so no sticky feeling and it makes my skin super soft and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly, and keeps your skin soft for hours.  </li>
      <li>and it really helps</li>
      <li>Healing your itchy skin fast.</li>
      <li>sometimes i put too much on my hand</li>
      <li>I think it was because this is such a light lotion, and my skin must have gotten drier as winter settled in.</li>
      <li>Plus it softens your skin very well.</li>
      <li>Skin feels really smooth the next day and improves over time.  </li>
      <li>I just like this lotion if I still feel dry on my legs before bed, but it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough on its own.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes very well almost all day long, and leaves a very nice subtle scent.  </li>
      <li>This product has taken my skin to a new level of health.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp;</li>
      <li>It leave&#x27;s your skin very soft and not oily.</li>
      <li>Far exceeded my expectations!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The skin looks completely healed,</li>
      <li>says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin,</li>
      <li>Keeps skin soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I really like it for my son who has really dry skin</li>
      <li>It spreads well and doesn&#x27;t dry up too fast.  </li>
      <li>Have dry skin and the lotion didn&#x27;t help it much.</li>
      <li>Finally my skin is back to normal again from head to toe.</li>
      <li>the other product I used during this period of healing is called MetaDerm and is also very healing.</li>
      <li>this works wonders in the dry climate I live in.  </li>
      <li>I live in Canada and weather is quite dry here.</li>

    <li> Fresh scent, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a person greasy and keeps my skin comfortable all day.  Terrible name for a great product.</li>
    <li> Have dry skin and the lotion didn&#x27;t help it much. It does however, feel refreshing when u first put it on.</li>
    <li> Item came as described</li>
    <li> Like the best stuff for your skin very made</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!! It is a body lotion but the only thing I use on my hands-non greasy &amp; non sticky.</li>
    <li> Really love this lotion, it absorbs immediately, not greasy aftereffect.  Plus it softens your skin very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6 years and it&#x27;s great. It leave&#x27;s your skin very soft and not oily. Love it.</li>
    <li> Fast Absorbing,soft and smooth after feel.love the scent.Not moisturizing enough</li>
    <li> I wanted to do the right thing for my skin and use a lotion that was pH balanced. I used this for a month and a half, and then developed eczema! I&#x27;ve never had that before in my life. I think it was because this is such a light lotion, and my skin must have gotten drier as winter settled in. I&#x27;ll save it for summertime. It&#x27;s light and smells nice.</li>
    <li> The best all round body lotion you will ever use. This stuff is liquid gold in a pump bottle. Get some and enjoy.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily afterwards.  Will be the only lotion i use from now on.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing I love sebamed! The only thing that works on psoriasis better than any prescription cream or pill! So satisfied!</li>
    <li> wonderful is all I can say. I live in the desert and my skin felt better within 2 days of using just the product</li>
    <li> Perfect, as described, when described!</li>
    <li> great product, my wife uses this all the time, and it helps her skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Very few stores hand this product in stock.&lt;br /&gt;  Mel</li>
    <li> Far exceeded my expectations! Would recommend without reservation&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I live in Canada and weather is quite dry here. My skin absorbs it very quickly, softens my skin, has a nice smell and ph 5.5 which is healty for the skin. I also recommend sebamed face and body wash. Love them both.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and this helps me so very much. I have it in every room of the house. . Thank you</li>
    <li> but it is absorbed very fast. leave skin smooth and soft. too watery sometimes i put too much on my hand it will drop to the ground....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It spreads easily, soaks up very quickly so no sticky feeling and it makes my skin super soft and healthy looking. I will keep on using this and nothing else for the body. I also use the Sebamed face cream for sensitive skin and fragrance free hydrating gentle skin cleanser for the face and body. Finally my skin is back to normal again from head to toe.</li>
    <li> This product has taken my skin to a new level of health.  I am a believer in the proper pH for our entire body, inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Moisturizing Body Lotion for about 2 months.  It has taken my dry, cracked heels to the best condition since I was a child.  They no longer snag on hose when I put them on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lightweight skin moisturizer with a very light scent.  I am grateful to have found this product - well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance. The lotion is very thin and doesn&#x27;t moisturize for very long. Over priced. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of this lotion, and I was impressed from the very beginning.  It moisturizes very well almost all day long, and leaves a very nice subtle scent.  Very impressed and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So this cost $16.48 right now but when i bought it was $19.94... and today I saw on rite aid that they sell this lotion for 12.99. :( Also the bottle is a little dirty.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing body lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used RainBath for years - I love how my skin feels with SebaMed.  It suds up (which is important to me), and the scent is light and fresh.</li>
    <li> I had to wait but I finally received the lotion.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; this works wonders in the dry climate I live in.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes immediately into your skin.  No greasy or oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Moisture for very dry skin without being greasy</li>
    <li> Too watery and had to apply a lot, the frangrance was too strong for me</li>
    <li> I really like it for my son who has really dry skin</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> I love this product. One problem is the dispenser is to short for the container.</li>
    <li> Always use this product, it&#x27;s great....My husband has a lot of skin problems and this is all he uses after his shower.</li>
    <li> smells great and goes on really smoothly</li>
    <li> I hate thick lotions that get sucked up or dry too fast, making it difficult to apply.  This lotion is nice and light, not thick and creamy.  It spreads well and doesn&#x27;t dry up too fast.  Skin feels really smooth the next day and improves over time.  A simple and highly effective product.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but I like this stuff anyway.  It&#x27;s become my year round lotion.  People with dry skin living in cold weather might choose something heavier in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have used Sebamed products for the past 7 years. I moved to the US a year ago and came with a supply of the products. When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream. I found Sebamed here but the packaging was different. I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of. However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving this 4 stars because it smells just a tad different than what I&#x27;m used to.  However, I admit that it could just be me. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema, so I have purchased several of your creams and lotions and they have been great for him, so I tried some of them.  I just like this lotion if I still feel dry on my legs before bed, but it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough on its own.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> seems to soak into skin and not coat it.  been using for several years.</li>
    <li> switched to sebamed to help with dry itchy skin, apply twice daily and it really helps</li>
    <li> The best lotion EVER especially if you have sensitive skin or eczema! I cannot go a day without it or I break out!</li>
    <li> Although not cheap, it is really a good product.</li>
    <li> Good lotion  does what they say it will do  you just have to be consistent with use.</li>
    <li> This product makes my feel skin wonderful, silky smooth. I wanted to share this product with my family so I ordered a couple to share with everyone. I wanted to share with relatives in Michigan (I live in Illinois) and contacted MyMedExpress to see if they would be able to help. They were very quick to respond and offer their help in making sure that this wonderful product was shipped to the right address. Now everyone gets to enjoy moisturized and smooth skin. Highly recommend to everyone. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was told this is THE best...not by me...maybe needs to be a little thicker. I am in a very dry climate.</li>
    <li> Just a bit over price. Healing your itchy skin fast. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and non-soap facial and bath are best among other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and conditioner, however, not good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for any sensitive skin.  I have been using it together with Sebamed washing fluid for more than 10 years and it works wonderful for my skin.  Keeps skin soft and silky.</li>
    <li> This is one of two products which healed my sever eczema attack in only 11 days. After burning, itching, painful skin with blisters and sleepless nights, Sebamed moisturizer and soap, soothed my skin and my symptoms are 95% healed. The skin looks completely healed, no more inflammation or the feeling of having fallen into a nest of fire-ants or stinging nettles. I am so very grateful! D.H.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. the other product I used during this period of healing is called MetaDerm and is also very healing. ( in case someone is suffering as badly as I did just 11 days ago.)</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  I was happy to find it here after my local drugstore stopped carrying it (made room for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; lotion).  It isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly, and keeps your skin soft for hours.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This wash burned my face....says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, yeah right. I am returning it to Costco.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Never greasy</li>
    <li> I could not stand the smell of this product.  sorry I ordered it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this wash</li>
    <li> Has a nice scent and really makes your skin feel good.</li>
    <li> I love the face and body wash and purchased the lotion to try it out.  I have really dry skin and so this doesn&#x27;t quite give me the adequate moisture I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s excellent for people with normal skin.</li>
    <li> During the cold Chicago winters, I would have a form of dry skin on my forearms.  I tried a few moisturizers, but Sebamed was the only one that restored my skin.  Now, I use daily and all over.  Its a wonderful skin care product -a little pricey, but it&#x27;s quality.  If you are having bouts of dry patches of skin, give this a try.  It&#x27;s not for your face, as this may be a bit heavy, but they have a product line especially for your face, too.</li>
