<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the second one that I have purchased.  The first one lasted over 10 years.  Yes, 10 years.  I have VERY thick hair and this is the only hairdryer that I&#x27;ve found that has enough power to do the job.</li>
    <li> excellent my clients love the way theirs hair look and so fare the best investment that I made this year</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this blow dryer and recommended it to me when I told him I did not feel mine was powerful enough. This dries my hair in a fraction of the time as it used to take me. I love the adjustable settings for heat and for power, and the Ionic blast button for cold shots is great, too.</li>
    <li> Works great! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer was broken when I got it. Small pieces of plastic were scattered in the box. It is not noticeable, and hair dryers works. I need to work so I did not return it. But I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great dryer, my daughter has lots of curly hair, I had keratin done in her hair and I can get the blow drying part done in half the time I did before with this blow dryer. I just wish it was less heavy.</li>
    <li> this blow dryer is good at first but it&#x27;s quite tricky. The blow dryer begins getting very smokey .. Something about the smell of the blow dryer doesn&#x27;t seem right . I wish I listened to the reviews because the blow dryer died after one month and a day. A lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer. Very scary . Do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up. Waste of money! Do not buy this item. Going to stick to the cheap blow dryers. This was expensive for no reason perhaps maybe the watts? ( 1900 ) only good thing about this blow dryer it speeds up your drying time a+ for that.</li>
    <li> The dryer works very well, but the controls beneath your fingers are easy to accidentally move to a different setting.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is wonderful.  Drys my hair much more quickly than the Conair dryer I purchased at Target.  Very sturdy.  Would recommend it as a great investment in hair care.</li>
    <li> to cut down the drying time. Even when it&#x27;s on cool my hair dries fast. I wish I would had gotten the ceramic one</li>
    <li> It has the same power as a salon dryer; in fact, this was my sylist&#x27;s recommendation.  I don&#x27;t know what 3200 refers to, but is certainly is more efficient than my previous 1875 watt ion dryer.  I am pleased and satisfied with its performance.  I would note that it is slightly heavier than my old dryer.</li>
    <li> As several other experienced, this blow dryer stopped blowing hot air after 2 months.  Only cold air now comes through. This defect seems to be pretty common from the reviews, so beware.  Amazon was great about the return.  The Conair I bought at the drugstore for 1/4 the cost is better!</li>
    <li> I am a hair dresser and this dryer (and the parlux) is all I will buy. They last a very long time, are super powerful and really get the job done. They have always come in this cheap dinky box, but I would rather the money I spend go into the quality of the dryer and not the packaging. Great dryer for professional use!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Amazon from Elephant Deals. I received it quickly. The blower is fantastic. It has a steady, hot flow. It doesn&#x27;t leave me with flyaways, and I don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron when I&#x27;m done. It is quick and efficient. I highly recommend this blower.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this dryer the first one lasted for about 10 years.  The newer model is great I would highly recommend it as I have to many friends.</li>
    <li> I actually got this dryer because my stylist used it and I was surprised at how fast she could blow out my hair.  It&#x27;s very windy which is great for those mornings when I&#x27;m in a rush to get to work, I can rough-dry my hair in 2-3 minutes or do an at-home blowout in about 15 minutes if I&#x27;m not so pressed for time.  The only negative I&#x27;ve encountered so far is that because of the switch placement, I sometimes accidentally change the temperature/power in the middle of drying.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer was fair, attachment falls off when drying.</li>
    <li> I have spent more than 2 decades of my life trying to straighten my thick, frizzy, curly, and often unmanageable Dominican hair. I have tried Keratin, flat irons, you name it, I&#x27;ve done it. I just want my hair to behave without having to rely on dozens of hair products or treatments. Then I met the Twin Turbo and for the first time in my life, my hair met its match. The drying time of this hair dryer is incredible (I can blow dry my hair within 1hr to 1hr 30 min and it&#x27;s past my shoulders, in layers) and with a ceramic rolling brush and wrist action, I have luscious shiny hair with no frizz. Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
    <li> Medium weight, not too heavy like other professional dryers&lt;br /&gt;Easy controls&lt;br /&gt;Dries hair fast!&lt;br /&gt;No tangle or twist power cord</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this hair dryer since 35 years I will never prefer anyone else  I trust this product</li>
    <li> This is my wifes second Turbo hair dryer. If you are looking for a dryer that will dry your hair fast, this is the dryer for you. The dryer is very hot and strong. You have to be very careful not to put the heat in one area to long.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this dryer, I love it it drys fast and if I use a round brush, my hair comes out straight hardly have to use my flat Iron.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve owned. It is worth the price. I had a similar one that lasted 6 years. Air flow is strong/fast.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer.  It&#x27;s lighter than my previous dryer and does a better job. The only minor drawback is that sometimes I accidentally turn it off while using it because of where the buttons are located.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a stylist for 10 years.  Best blow dryer i&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve had solano, fhi, T3, and elchim.  Buy this one.</li>
    <li> Love love love this blow dryer twin turbo is the way to go... It&#x27;s fast and it&#x27;s easy and it gets the job done ..... I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer I have ever used.  After going through so many blow dryers that would burn out after a few months a friend recommended this one.  I am so glad she did, it was worth every dime, in fact it has saved me money.  It is worth the investment, this dryer will last for years.</li>
    <li> Really very happy with my purchase. Prompt shipping and a great dryer. I have fine hair with a slight kink, and lots of it. Hairdressers always comment on how long it takes to dry my hair. This piece of equipment dries your hair totally, never left with any residual moisture, and it dries it straight, in a short time, I can now safely get rid of all the other dryers I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years, I&#x27;ve finally found what I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
    <li> Great, light weigh and super powerful love it</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a dryer that will get your hair real straight and dry your hair fast this is the dryer for you. The dryer is very hot and you have to be very careful not to put the heat on your scalp directly.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever purchased! It is extremely powerful, dries quickly and is pretty lightweight. The only negative thing that I find is that the nozzle attatchment will fly off the dryer every once in a while which is a bit annoying. Other than that I would definitely purchase this dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife replaced another hair dryer with this model. It is without a doubt the best she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;  she would definitely recommend this to you.</li>
    <li> It is fast and quiet - would recomment it for everyone.  Does a great job quick.  I had one in the past and it lasted over 6 years.</li>
    <li> My stylist kept telling me that I needed to buy a better dryer. Now I know why! I can&#x27;t write this review because the sheer force of this dryer blew me out the door and down the street. Whooooosh!</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many  dryers and can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this one.  I saw this hair dryer at my hair salon and was impressed with it&#x27;s ability.  It&#x27;s the greatest and does not disappoint as so many of the others I have tried do!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate this dryer until I broke it and I was without it for a few days.  It dries fast and gets really hot. Extra help is its long cord. I don&#x27;t have the frizz like I had before. Watch Carley Babel on YouTube on how to blow out your hair, she is such a help.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and daughter love this hair dryer. They use it weekly without complaining about it which for me sounds great.</li>
    <li> Tons of heat and power! Really works well to straighten my curls. Lightweight too.  I would totally recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a stylist for 15 yrs and I can tell you nothing compares to this dryer in terms of closing the cuticle with added shine however I do recommend getting the Twin Turbo/ionic for $30 more it&#x27;s worth every penny. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier and it&#x27;s made in Italy so the finest materials go into construction and you can feel it. The weight and the little kickback when turned on sounds crazy but this this is powerful.</li>
    <li> Works great. My hairdresser uses this kind and recommend I get it bc I have really thick hair that takes forever to dry. This def cuts down on drying time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser, so I can sometimes go through blowdryers easily. However, this one has lasted over a year! I&#x27;ve bought TwinTurbo dryers before, but this model is compact enough that I can transport it from work to home easily, but the quality is not sacrificed. I love the black matte plastic, too. It makes any scratches or dings practically invisible.</li>
    <li> Excellent blow dryer! I&#x27;m a busy hairdresser in Boston and I need something to work quickly on the thickest hair and this is it! It&#x27;s got plenty of speed and heat options, the cord is nice and long, and its not to heavy. The buttons are in the right place so I&#x27;m not accidentally changing the heat/power! Awesome dryer for anyone! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite blow dryer! It dries your hair super fast and makes it smooth. I would definitely purchase this for anybody thats looking for a top notch blowdryer</li>
    <li> This was the first time I spent  more than $40 for a hair dryer, so I was expecting it to be great. But after about a month the attachment nozzle kept following off. However the dryer works well, it is still aggravating for the nozzle to fly off while drying my hair. I should have returned it. Too much money for an okay hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I wish I had invested the $ on this dryer yrs ago. It&#x27;s the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned! I have thick Hispanic hair that takes forever to dry. This dryer not only dries it in less than half the time it use to take me but it leaves it smooth, silky and soft. I almost don&#x27;t use my flat iron.Since I spend less time under the dryer I dont get as hot doing my hair.The other thing that is awesome is that it&#x27;s not loud and isn&#x27;t as heavy as I excepted. I LOVE, LOVE this dryer!! Spend the $100 for this dryer, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer did not work at all and I called customer care and they&#x27;re telling me they cant replace it because its sold by a third party.  Dont waste your time.</li>
    <li> The only thing missing is the cool down button, other than that, it is a great size and lots of power. Drying time has been cut in half!</li>
    <li> I have never paid so much for a blow dryer, but I have NO regrets.  I feel as if it is so worth it and I get a quick and professional blow out.  I expect this to last a very long time, but I would buy another in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve owned. I simply love it and if it ever breaks, I am definitely buying it again. I have had it for 4 years and it still works perfectly. My hair does not frizz as much as it does with other cheap dryers and it takes less time to dry it. This is one quality hair dryer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Super awesome.  Dries my hair in no time.  Makes it shine and the style lasts for several days. Very good.</li>
    <li> It was a present for sis in law for her bday. She loves doing hair, she loved it. !!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dryer you&#x27;ll ever own. I have wavy, thick (not complaining), out of control hair that is usually best left to dry on its own. But this dryer straightens it without use of any additional hair products. I am impressed!</li>
    <li> Very powerful dryer! Worth every penny of my investiment! I have curly hair and normally takes an hour to straigh it and with this dryer only 20 min..</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer on the market. Extremely powerful which gets your hair dry faster without using too much heat! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have long, very thick, curly/kinky/wavy hair that isn&#x27;t relaxed.  I previously had another blowdryer from this same manufacturer, a higher voltage ionic/ceramic model that I chose because I thought it would be more powerful than this model which looks like the same model or voltage my Dominican salon uses.  When that died (my fault), I decided to get this model.  I use this blowdryer after roller setting my hair. This model seems more powerful than my old dryer.  I used it just once so far, but seems to make my hair even shinier than what the ionic dryer did.  If you have thick and/or curly hair (if you need a blowdryer to straighten rather than just dry), this is probably the only dryer which will get you excellent results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday she is a professional hairstylist and is very picky when it comes to blowdryers she said it saves her at least 15 20 minutes a day because it dries so rapidly and also straightens her hair the only downfall is that she mentioned it is a little bit heavy so she&#x27;s not sure if she would use it for her clients.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  I have used it now for more than half a year &amp; am so happy to own it.  The dryer is fairly lightweight &amp; quiet compared to other dryers I have owned with a cord that is a much more functional length than most.  Dries my hair in no time.  I would not hesitate to suggest this to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> So happy with this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s fantastic!!!  It drys my hair quickly and the style lasts so much longer than with other hair dryers.</li>
    <li> The heat and power is good, but in keeps shutting off in certain outlets of the house.</li>
    <li> The engine design is great, it&#x27;s been almost a year.  And it still works great.  The only thing I would add is a cool button.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was recommended to me by my hair dresser. My hair can be frizzy, and corse. This hair dryer while a little expensive to justify (at first) has changed my life!! This sounds a little extreme I know, but honeslly my hair looks &amp; feels better than it has in years. Good hair products &amp; this hair dryer are worth every dollar! I will never buy another brand. It&#x27;s sturdy and easy for me to use.</li>
    <li> great blowdryer, but the cap to put on the front part of the dryer, kept falling off from putting it down and up in my sink, while blowdrying my hair. i fixed this by gently putting it on a flat surface, resting it on the red circle grip. sucks i have to do this, but it is best blowdryer i ever owned</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve spent over $30 for a hair dryer. I was really looking forward to using this. I have had this hair dryer for 1 month, and I have to say that my biggest complaint is the nozzle attachment keeps falling off which is very aggravating.  Other than that I love how quick it dries my hair, and it does make my hair look more smoother.  I have thick wavy curly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was recommended by my stylist over and above the dryers sold in the salon. This hair dryer has not disappointed! I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly! Worth the $$</li>
    <li> I expected the somewhere heavier version I have used in professional settings before, so that was a bit disappointing.  BUT- it has the same power and heat I remembered so I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This twin turbo 3200 gets the job done but I&#x27;d rather get the twin turbo 3200 ionic dryer. The regular one doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough for me.</li>
    <li> Wife, LOVES IT. It has PLENTY of Power and Heat. My wife uses it every weekend. Gets the job done Quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good product, she loves it. Now she spend only 5 mnutes to have the hairs done. Before was a pain waiting 20 min using a standard no professional dryer. This is just awesome !</li>
    <li> Once you used this hair dryer, you will never use another one.  It is so powerful and cuts down significantly on drying time.  I have always have long hair and cuts my drying time in half.  I have had this model for 8 years and it is just a strong as the day I bought it.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different hair dryers and by far this is my favorite. Fast, powerful, and lite. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Buying this blower is a good investment this is the second that i buy. The first one lasted 14 years!</li>
    <li> Fabulous dryer! My hair has never looked so good!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST hair dryer I have ever used! Seriously. It is so powerful and my hair looks like I got a salon blowout after using it. I always use the hot setting but it isn&#x27;t too hot and since it is so powerful it doesn&#x27;t take as long so I don&#x27;t end up sweating like crazy while blow drying my hair. The only downside is that it is a little heavy, but it dries my hair so fast it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> No cool button. The packaging was torn and taped back together. I am pretty sure I was given a returned item. I had a different model of this same brand and it lasted 7 years. I was very happy with it. I used this one four times and it stopped working. I can not find any help with returns or exchanges. This company seems like a scam.</li>
    <li> Twin turbo 3200 is great . I bought it for home use . Best blow dryer have ever bought and owned</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this blow dryer! I&#x27;ve been putting it off to buy it due to it&#x27;s price. but once it reached a price I was ok with, I purchased it.  I was nervous about the box it came in at first since it looked a bit cheap and &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;-ish.  But once I held the beauty over my frizzy hair, magic happened.  I felt the heat and saw my hair go from Diana Ross to Kardashian straight. This is a great investment to save you money from going to the salon. most salons use the same hair blower! The heat setting were oddly placed but I got the hang of it after a few uses. The only thing that caused me to demote this rating to a 4 star is it&#x27;s nozzle.  This dryer came with two nozzles, but they are such pains! When I&#x27;m blow drying my hair, the nozzle keeps popping off. I thought maybe one was defective, but both of em have a habit of falling off.  Besides that flaw, this is a great blow dryer and i high recommend!</li>
    <li> this blower is really good. i&#x27;ve been using this brand since 8 years ago  and  they work well and they are durable.  great product</li>
    <li> I use it a lot, i am a stylist and use this with my really curly hair clients and it never disapoint me. great price, great quality, great buy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful dryer! I have had this dryer for 6 months and it is working great. I would recommend it if your looking for a dryer that gets really hot.</li>
    <li> It was a gift, and exactly what she wanted! it was a gift she is very very happy with it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first dryer I&#x27;ve splurged on, and I&#x27;m very, very satisfied with this purchase!  My hair looks fuller when it&#x27;s almost dry, then  polishes up when I style as I finish up.  It&#x27;s the closest to a professional blowout I&#x27;ve ever done.  My hairdresser has always said that an &amp;#34;investment&amp;#34; dryer is worlds better than one from Target and that&#x27;s true as far as this Twin Turbo is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basics are accurately described by the vendor.  The dryer, while not light, isn&#x27;t heavy either.  The weight is better distributed than the Conairs or Revlons I&#x27;ve used before, so it&#x27;s more comfortable to hold.  My purchase was cliched by the fact that the dryer is made in Italy and not China.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned but after 3 or 4 hair dryers in 10 years, I figured I&#x27;d pay a little more for hopefully a better product. A lot of people say they can get their hair dried faster with this - I haven&#x27;t noticed that. That may be because I have pretty straight hair to begin with, and while I have a lot of it, the strands are pretty thin. The biggest cons is the button placement - fine when I&#x27;m taking my time, but when I rush, I ALWAYS hit the buttons. Other reviews have pointed out no cool shot, but it does have three heat settings and I think the coolest setting is enough to set a style. I&#x27;ve used it regularly for a couple of months and it really does feel like a quality product so I hope I get years of use out of it.</li>
    <li> It works very well, I just wish it had more variables with the settings.  It has a lot of air (almost too much) or not enough.  It dries my hair quickly and it leaves it in good condition.  A bit expensive, but I did not want something from China I would have to replace in a year.  No good way to store the cord.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer but can get similar results with lower cost ones. Nozzle falls easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a hairdresser for 25 years and have had a twin turbo dryer for at least  10-15 yrs. After having it repaired several times it finally died and was time to purchase another and now I got to try the newer version and I love it even more than my 2600. It just doesn&#x27;t seem as hot but that&#x27;s probably better because I have burned my clients scalps a bit with the other one. The only thing I wish is that it had a cool button but other then that , I love it !</li>
    <li> It is a little heavy, but it is great for drying! All of my stylists use these!</li>
    <li> Compact size dryer packs a mean punch!  Definitely lots of air flow, it is one of my favorite hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! Great power!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect, I got the item on time.&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair dryer becouse its dry your hair very fast.</li>
    <li> I feel this is a very good product.  It is a bit heavy and doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  But overall it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Nice hairdryer but it was heavy to hold and the directional nozzles did not stay on well.  Beware of the 15% restocking charge - I was charged 33% restocking charge for the return.  I will not order from this company again</li>
    <li> As a cosmetologist, we all need a professional blower, shipped a lot sooner than what I expected and worked perfectly fine. Brand new product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist. I have tried many professional blow dryers and always come back to twin turbo as my favorite.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer on the market, my wife is very happy with this product, I would defintely buy this product again</li>
    <li> My T3 broke after a solid 8 years and I was open to trying something new. I did a ton of research and decided on the Twin Turbo. Not only is the price better than the T3, but the drying time is cut in half. It has taken me some time to get used to, but overall I&#x27;m extremely happy!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have long thick hair and I can dry and style it in half the time my old dryer took!</li>
    <li> Finally, I can dry my hair on medium heat efficiently, and not burn my skin!</li>
    <li> Took a chance on some random no name brand high priced, yet well reviewed blow dryer.  Its a winner with the wife and drying her long beautiful hair.  Cut down her drying time by 10 minutes, reducing the total power consumed by probably 30,000 kWh, and my wife&#x27;s overall carbon footprint.  It is quieter too.  The cord is super long and the switches are heavy duty and work nicely even with well lotion-ed hands ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - almost a year later wife says this is the best dryer in the world.</li>
    <li> I had this blow dryer a few years ago it lasted 6 yrs. I have since gone through the chi which broke in 6 months &amp; solano which has completely destroyed my hair....only because I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of my old dryer. It was just recently while asking a friend if she knew of a good blower that i was reconnected with the twin turbo. It is by far the best blow dryer I have ever had!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer blows.  (In a good way)</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this for my sister. She lives in the Houston area and has very thick, frizzy hair and all the hair dryers we tried locally really just didn&#x27;t do the trick. This dryer is hot (but not to hot) and blows very strongly and allows her to dry her hair quickly before she gets too hot herself. Good product.</li>
    <li> is 3200 but not is very hot I don&#x27;t know why</li>
    <li> I ordered my turbo on 9-10-14. Received it on 9-13-14. Was super excited.  The blow dryer is dope. It cuts my time by half. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> My mom had this blowdryer and I fell in love! It&#x27;s very powerful and dries your hair super fast!  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I received the item in time, however, it is defective - the hot air does not work, only blows cold air. I have to return it and buy another one. Very disappointed! Do not buy from Maitri Mega Mall.</li>
    <li> I hate having to buy a new hair dryer. After reading all the reviews AND finding this in Amazon warehouse I&#x27;m thrilled with the Turbo Power 3200-wish it was pink but oh well.</li>
    <li> I like the nozzle attachment, but it can fall off easily which can get annoying.  It has 2 levels of heat settings and 2 levels of cool blow dry settings so that is good, and it is not heavy.  But I recently used a friend&#x27;s Conair Infinity hairdryer and I actually liked that much better, it dried my hair in less time and it was less frizzy....</li>
    <li> Excellent! Can&#x27;t believe how smooth my hair is since using this dryer. Dries my hair in half the time. Love it!</li>
    <li> This medium size dryer is great.  It dries my medium length hair so fast it&#x27;s a real time saver.  It&#x27;s rather quiet compared to all of the other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Is really good, I like it so much, my hair is healthy and look natural, You need to try! .</li>
    <li> Man, every time I want to dry my hair upside down it makes this weird cutting sound inside, which freaks me out each time. ANd its so heavy too.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going to CVS and buying myself a wonderful dryer for 35 bucks that was light and made no noises like that AND was antifreezing .</li>
    <li> love this blow dryer had the red one before but the wiring was cut.. this one is stronger&lt;br /&gt;works great... good price</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer, definitely worth the money! Gets super hot, fast, making it so much easier to blow dry my hair since usually itll take an hour to dry but only takes about 15 minutes with this one!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LEFT MY HAIR SOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL LIKE IN THE SALON&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT OVER HEAT&lt;br /&gt;AND ITS SMALL LIGHTWEIGH POWERFUL BUT DONT LET THE SIZE AND WEIGHT MISGUIDE YOU ITS A POWERFUL THING LIKE A PLANE OR CAR OR BOAT....LOVE IT. I USE IT ON MY HAIR ON M MOMS HAIR ON MY COUSINS HAIR AND ON MY SISTERS HAIR AND ON MY 2 DOGS HAIR I WOULD USE IT ON MY DADS HAIR BUT HES BALD LOL LOVE IT.... GET IT ASAP YOU CANT GO WRONG</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new hair dryer!  It was a little expensive but worth every penny that I paid for it!! Now I have fabulous straight hair!!!</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer ever. Very powerful.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it....great blowdryer, lots of power.</li>
    <li> Well the subject sais it all.  I scored big on this.  I bought it because of the reviews and I hit the jackpot.  My wife spent at least 15 minutes drying her hair each day.  My daughter has reached the age of needing to dry her hair each day so sharing the $20 target special had become a real hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first morning my wife used it she was simply amazed how well it did.  She thought it might be a little hot for my daughter (age 11) but she was not sure.  We just gave her the cheap hair dryer and my wife is using this one.  I assume this will hold up well over time.  If we have any mechanical problems or anything negative develops then I will edit this review and add the updated information.  I give it 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> This dryer is amazing! I have thick curly hair that would take me forever to dry straight and then I would usually have to use a straightener afterwards. Not anymore! Now I can dry my hair in about half the time and no need for my flat iron. I love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this item. The heat control is amazing! Dries my VERY curly hair extremely fast &amp; leaves it soft and shiny. A must have!</li>
    <li> I have had the twin turbo 2600 for 26 years I have tried every blo dryer at no expense spared this is the best built and most powerful. I have changed the brushes more than ten times and give her a good cleaning runs like new every time most people through there hair dryer away when they Quit all you need to do on these is put a new set of brushes and its new again even nurmous drops over the years I did need a new case at the 22 year mark I orded it from twin turbo in New York the Importer the whole body was 10 or 15 dollars and looks as good as new I am going on my 11th set of brushes she still out performs any of the other blowers by far simple sweet I might buy the 3200 for the cold button other than that if you do not need that this is the one blowes all others away I started with salano tronic dryer all solanos switches burn out this dryer is as good as the day I bought it... 38 years in business it has never let me down it will or could be the last blower you will ever buy........&lt;br /&gt;Vincent R Pignotti</li>
    <li> Love it! Cuts my drying time in half.</li>
    <li> This baby is powerful. Several folks have complimented me on getting my hair fixed, but I did it myself with this dryer recommended by my hair stylist. The only drawback for me is it heavy, but I am getting used to it. Unless it breaks soon, it&#x27;s worth the money. My hair dried before getting the frizzies.</li>
    <li> My daughter requested this product as a birthday gift and she loves it.  She has past shoulder length hair and finds that it dries her hair quickly without making her hair frizzy or without burnt ends.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great blow dryer and actually the salon I go to the uses this dryer.  My hairdresser told me that it&#x27;s a very good blow dryer and it does not damage your hair like the other dryers.  This turbo 3200 dryer dries my hair very quickly and I am happy with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this dryer to anyone who is looking for a really good dryer.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but who cares if it&#x27;s going to give great results then it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer hoping that it heated up the way the dryers used in my local hair salon do, but unfortunately it did not and I could not see keeping it for the money that was paid if it wasn&#x27;t doing same thing.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Does everything a hair dryer should do. Sturdy, nice design, powerful, and totally blows. In a good way.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the power I expected and doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I have a lot of hair and half way through blow drying it starts to be cooler air. Takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it. Not to noisy. Not to heavy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s official, best professional blow dryer. Blows out the toughest hair.</li>
    <li> best blow dryer i have ever owned!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first blow dryer I have ever bought myself and I must say I love it. I&#x27;m not a professional hairstylist but I do love to do my own hair. When I saw the price I was a little iffy buying it but said screw it and still got it. Used it the next day and love love love how my hair came out. The cord is nice and long and it&#x27;s not to heavy. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5star is because for some reason the attachment falls off once in a while. Other than that I would definitely recommend this blow dryer!!</li>
    <li> Using for personal use; recommended by my hairstylist. Worth the price! Dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair. Noticable difference from any other hair dryer. I like to get my hair dried fast!</li>
    <li> I have tried others and this one is still the best. Drys my hair the fastest with the least amount of frizz...</li>
    <li> Powerful hair dryer, best one I  have owned.  I have owned many hair dryers including very expensive models but this one by far does the best job for thick hair. Absolute time saver.</li>
    <li> I think I got a dud it doesn&#x27;t blow hot heat, my old hair dryer blows more heat to dry hair faster</li>
    <li> Hairdryer is lightweight. Dries hair super fast!! Got this as a gift and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> LOVE this dryer!! I had the 1200 before this and I would never go back! My sister has the 1200 and she steals mine all the time!!</li>
    <li> My only frustration is this blow dryer is LOUD.  My four year old now shuts his door just to avoid the noise this dryer produces.  I used to have a T3 Tourmeline dryer which was good but it&#x27;d just run it&#x27;s course.  I wasn&#x27;t in LOVE with it so thought I would try what many reviewers claimed was a very professional dryer for a reasonable price.  I also wish it had a medium blow setting as well, as there is a really dramatic difference between the low and high and I have to be diligent to be sure the high setting doesn&#x27;t make my curls frizzy.  I will keep it, but just two things I wish I had known.</li>
    <li> I am a Professional Hairstylist and I am IN LOVE with this Hair Dryer. I have used an Elchiem for years (which I do not hate but is much heavier and takes more effort to dry the hair) and recently went through TWO Babyliss Ferrari Hair Dryers in 6 months... both ended up with a short in the cord. Don&#x27;t ever buy a Babyliss anything, its Conair repackaged.&lt;br /&gt;With this dryer, I can blowout someone&#x27;s hair in less than 20 minutes! It feels solid and well built. Great power and great heat.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy and fast results. love it!! Fast shipping.. I have curly hair and this product straightens my hair in about twenty-twenty five minutes.. and I am no professional.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more to say about dryer, except that you get what you pay for. It is quiet and fast, like a ninja. Maybe they should rename it, lol. I bought this for my daughter, but when she&#x27;s not around, I find myself &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it. Hey, I paid for it, don&#x27;t judge me :)</li>
    <li> The processing took a little long but I guess we&#x27;ve just come to expect everything immediately. As promised, item arrived and was exactly as promoted. Best dryer in biz. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love it very much.I recommend for anyone who is looking for a good hair dryer.  Roseli</li>
    <li> It is a really good and strong blow dryer which last a long time.It is a really good brand very good for long hair</li>
    <li> It dries hairs fast and with a silky look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes less time to get wonderful results and it&#x27;s low noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it</li>
    <li> Purchased this dryer on the recommendation of my stylist who uses the same one in the salon.  So happy with it.  Takes a few times to get all the settings correct for the way you dry hair vs a professional, but once you do, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has a nice variety of settings and excellent drying power.  It is a bit heavier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Ive worked in the hair industry for over 10 years and this is the only dryer I will use! nothing else compares</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and this was recommended by a couple of coworkers. It recently arrived, but I&#x27;ve used it on a number of clients already and it&#x27;s great. Strong airflow, high heat, lightweight, cool shot button, and works very well with my diffuser attachment also.  Makes my job much easier!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Dryes quickly, the long cable is very convenient.  It is not as loud as others dryers we have had.</li>
    <li> heavier than I expected but it is powerful and dries your hair quick.</li>
    <li> The best on the market!</li>
    <li> Broke after two months. Heat function no longer functions.</li>
    <li> Best Blow Dryer EVER!!!</li>
    <li> does not have a cool shot button. I thought it did when I ordered it. Great blow dryer overall</li>
    <li> Overall a great hairdryer, powerful and hot. The attachment falls off now and again, could  be a little bit of a tighter fit, thats&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;!  What a quality product!  I LOVE it!  It is so well made and works like a dream.  I can now give myself the &amp;#34;straight out of the salon&amp;#34; hair.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have thick, thick hair.  I have envied the speed with which my hair dresser dries my hair - and finally gave in and purchased the hair dryer she uses - the 3200 Twin Turbo.  I may not have the expertise she has in using it, but my goal has been achieved - my hair is dried SPEEDILY.</li>
    <li> I am unhappy with this hair dryer.  Due to the air flow, hair will get caught in the back of the dryer and it often has a burning smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because this is the one my hair stylist uses and it is by far the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> After many years of buying different blow dryer form different company. I went to a beauty shop and was recommended this blow dryer by the owner of the establishment.  I was skeptical at firs cause the cost was so high, but the owner assure me I would not be disappointed with this product. So I bough it and and started using it. My hair was shiny and well behave for the whole week. I never went back to the hair saloon. I have saved a lot of money with this blow dryer and after 15 years of use it finally stopped working so I recommend this product for people with very hard to manage and very frizzy hair. Very happy with the product. ^_^*</li>
    <li> Very powerful blow dryer, I have thin curly hair and if I don&#x27;t have a good dryer it&#x27;ll just be a frizz flyaway mess. Has cut my drying time in half too.</li>
    <li> Great product thank you</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that I straighten twice a week. This hair dryer makes it easy! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought a walmart hairdryer it costed 92 dollars it was the brand croc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it temporarily until I got the Twin Turbo Hairdryer at the recommendation of Jordan Blackmore from GQ Magazine in New York.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Hairdryers costed about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Croc&#x27;s Failures&lt;br /&gt;-Cord was short&lt;br /&gt;-60 mph(owners manual) on speed 1 way too fast&lt;br /&gt;-the heat was too hot and it caused too much frizz in my hair and burned my scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TT hairdryer&lt;br /&gt;Cord is more than enough in terms of length&lt;br /&gt;-The heat is just right very little close to none frizz&lt;br /&gt;-On speed 1 is just right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: The end result of my hair was flawless, and a good amount of volume when I used the TT hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;The croc on the other hand created too much frizz.</li>
