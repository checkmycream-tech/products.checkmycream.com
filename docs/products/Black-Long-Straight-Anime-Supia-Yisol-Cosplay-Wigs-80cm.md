<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I take it back, this has to be the worst wig ever. Try making your product less s***ty, thanks.</li>
    <li> This wig is not as full as pictured. Quite thin really. However it is very long. Wait length and as a costume a good but. I d not expect more than 3 good uses out of it, so not really for costplsy or theater performance.</li>
    <li> bought it for helloween, looks super real, the onli complaint is the side fringe is too long, it covers your face all the time. but its the best wig ever</li>
    <li> The price was good, however not the thickness I hoped for.</li>
    <li> Bad company. Bad product</li>
    <li> ThiS wig got very messy right after I used it. Not a good wig</li>
    <li> Tangles too easily and is very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this wig as well. It has also come to good use to me for my cosplay.</li>
    <li> The product got to me very quickly (quicker than i thought it would) and it&#x27;s a very nice wig. I was very hesitant as it was my first wig but other than it tangling kind of easy (I kind of expected it to tangle though due to long hair tangling easily anyway) it&#x27;s definitely not a buy I regret.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. The hair fibers are smooth and silky  - but not cheap looking. Great buy.</li>
    <li> it tangles easy but it&#x27;s petty long and the beautiful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful. I fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> Was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t arrive in time, but it did and my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. And so soft. My man loves it. Great for the price. Got here a full month before it was expected. Bangs were hard to tame.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! I put it on as soon as I opened it. It was a little weird from shipping but I straightened it and it was fine again! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Tangled mess. Hands down the worse wig on the planet. I understand that its two bucks but come on now, did you even try? Mine came crumpled up in a plastic bag and no matter what I did, it stayed tangled. It sheds terribly and there is no saving it. Do not get this wig. Save your money and get a better one.</li>
    <li> Adriana&#x27;s niece: it tangles easily (4stars because of it), but trust me, if you care of it will long last. Cut it a bit, it will help with the tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair a first sight (surprisingly) looks human.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;Can be comb using a special comb.&lt;br /&gt;The mine does not looks doll shiny THAT&#x27;S AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;Is THICK. EXTRA POINTS</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality for the price - shipping took a while but no worries. Lots of space in the wig cap means someone with long hair will be able to wear this comfortably once it&#x27;s all tucked inside.</li>
    <li> This wig is very long, so take good care when using and keeping. Looks great!</li>
    <li> Adorable! Made well! Love love, just took a good six weeks to receive! But worth the wait!</li>
    <li> All I have to say is it does need to be cut a bit and it tangles quite easily. Other than that it&#x27;s pretty nice !</li>
    <li> IT WAS LONGER THAN I EXPECTED AND HAIR WAS VERY TANGLED!! IT TOOK 3 MONTHS FOR THE HAIR TO ARRIVE!! WAS DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
    <li> Thanks. Excelente quality and service.</li>
    <li> Mine is horrible. I couldn&#x27;t fit it on right, &amp; it&#x27;s always knotty! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful but tangles quickly and quite easily. You have to treat the wig quite delicately but at least it arrived before time</li>
    <li> It was a bit matted up and the wig cap it comes with is kinda crappy, but other than that it is a great wig and perfect for any cosplayer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a solid wig. Not as thick as it looks in the pic! But for the price I am very happy. Using it in a photoshoot!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I like the wig but it gets crappie after a few days, it&#x27;s good quality but just wearing for even an entire it gets tangled and heat styles don&#x27;t work very well on it</li>
    <li> This is pretty good as far as cheap wigs go, but it is definitely not worth more than the $5 it cost. The hair is nice and smooth, and most certainly several steps up from those awful plastic wigs you can get in the Halloween aisle at your local WalMart, but it also tangles VERY easily. I don&#x27;t think I would use this for a long-term cosplay, but it would do well as a slightly higher-quality accessory to a Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> Its not nearly as lomg as it says or looks in the picture. When i got it it was all knoted up and frizzy</li>
    <li> For the price ( $1-something ) definitely worth the buy. Some good points are that it has a smooth, nice feeling and looks real. I wore it for a cosplay, but i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to wear it again unless I give it a trim and make it into a different style. At the end, the ends of the hair began to curl making it hard to comb and keep untangled after I took it off.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was being a bit rough with it because I was continuously in a rush (Photo shoot).</li>
    <li> Came in right on time, it&#x27;s a beautiful wig! Really soft. The bangs are pretty easy to style too, I parted mine in the middle for a Marceline cosplay. The only problem is it gets tangled pretty easy (because it&#x27;s so long) and it&#x27;s kinda difficult to brush out. But that&#x27;s wicked minor, overall the wig is great!</li>
    <li> The wig was cut real weird...</li>
    <li> The wig was great at first, flowing and beautiful. But after a couple days it got frizzy and tangled and no matter what I did I couldn&#x27;t fix it. Still trying but unless you know exactly what you&#x27;re doing don&#x27;t get it!</li>
    <li> its good for cosplay. its shiny. feels ok</li>
    <li> The size is a bit tight. I had it on the largest setting and it was still almost too small. It also tangles easily in the back. But at the same time you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is one sexy, silky, creamy wig that smells and feels so good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, It&#x27;s very thin, but it was cheap so I understand. I just didn&#x27;t like that it came twisted and bent to the point that I can&#x27;t straighten it out even when meticulously combed and brushed &#x3D;/ and I&#x27;m not talking about curled, it was literally bent. So I&#x27;m gonna cut it o.O ...wish me luck.</li>
    <li> Somewhat thin, but otherwise very nice!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin and I had to trim the bangs a bit but still nice and looks good!</li>
    <li> The hair looks really great! I wasn&#x27;t used to seeing my wife with black hair so it&#x27;s quite the change. Now you will have to cut the bangs so if your not to embarrassed then I&#x27;d say take it to the barber so you don&#x27;t screw it up. It&#x27;s very fine hair. Looks and feels real.&lt;br /&gt;IT WILL TANGLE. Brushing it often will keep it from getting into a nightmare tangle. But she hasn&#x27;t wore it a lot so I could be very wrong.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you paid for! Cheap looking wig.</li>
    <li> Does not really look like the picture</li>
    <li> Great wig! easy to care for especially for a long wig and has pretty good quality. Though I was bummed it didn&#x27;t have any holes to put the horns I was hoping for through.</li>
    <li> I have this same wig in Blue as well. Always consistent quality in this product, and affordable.</li>
    <li> A bit of fixing and this could be a great Cho Chang wig!</li>
    <li> nice, but it get tangled very very easy</li>
    <li> i loved it, only took two weeks to arrive, and its very full and feels real, its beautiful and i love that the inner cap is adjustable to fit any sized head! GET IT! its perfect &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was on sale for, like, $10 and was pleasantly surprised by the quality when I received it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig does have quite a bit of a shine to it, but it isn&#x27;t overbearing or gaudy. It&#x27;s kind of a nice, healthy shine. The fibers are VERY soft and I have no issues with untangling it as it is without any treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wefts themselves are pretty good as well. The back feels a little thin but it&#x27;s not noticeable and is too be expected of a long wig. Other than that, this wig is amazingly thick. Like, if you needed extremely thick bangs for whatever reason, this is the wig for you. The bangs and most of the front of the wig is very very thick. Thicker than Arda thick. But they are very tame and do not stick out in weird spots at all. By no means is this a spiking wig, but you can definitely do a lot with what you&#x27;re given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a long, straight, black wig, I recommend this 100%! This will be a good staple in any cosplayer&#x27;s closet.</li>
    <li> I love the black boots.get lost</li>
    <li> Great wig, good quality</li>
    <li> thanks man. my friend liked it.</li>
    <li> My wig just arrived. I just opened it and tried it on, not wearing a wig cap. It is legitimately PERFECT! It looks real, not very shiny, and fits my head perfectly. If i was going to critique it, my only comment would be that is a bit thin. Over all, I LOVE IT! You really should get this wig if you are working on a cosplay.</li>
    <li> Made me look like I did when I had long hair brought back a lot of good memory thank you</li>
    <li> Honestly I was kind of skeptical about the quality of this wig. I figured $10 was probably too good to be true, but at least I&#x27;d give it a shot. Well it arrived two weeks early, came with a nice little hair net and was completely untangled when it arrived. It really is a great wig for the price, I notice when I wear it it does tangle a bit, but you can get the tangles out pretty easy with your fingers, it&#x27;s not like those awful wigs at the Halloween store that tangle in two seconds and can never be rectified. It looks natural, the hair is full and thick all around and the bangs cuts really nicely. Totally worth buying.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this wig! i&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and it comes to the top of my hip bone. though it took me 2hrs to untangle since it tangles EASILY. people look at it and go is that your real hair? This wig is long and the hair is so light and soft the ONLY thing you have to worry about is it getting tangled. the wig IS thin but thats what i expected from china and at the price but all in all if your looking for a cosplay wig or a halloween wig since its right around the corner get it. but i sudgest you go into your locoal bueaty shop to get the wig stand your gonna need a LONG necked one the wig is adgustable but the loops do break easliy (might just be me)</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for</li>
    <li> I could not believe how nice this wig was. Very beautiful so soft, i was surprise that it was only $10 dollars. I told everyone about it, everyone loved it. so happy with it thanks so much! :-)</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a Marceline cosplay and it is absolutely wonderful. Topbill has great wigs and it fits my head perfectly. The only problem is that the hair falls out easily.</li>
    <li> This wig arrived way early!!! It arrived 2 weeks early than its suppose to. Its very soft and looks just like real hair. Its not over shiny. Its not that tangled. Just a little brush and a little love and its good to go. I wear it everyday! Lol. To the store, work, etc. Nobody knows its fake. Unless people aren&#x27;t being honest. Lol. But I do get compliments! They think its my real hair. That its so long and beautiful. I attached some real pictures, no filters. One with a cellphone camera flash and one without. There is a part of there that kinda sticks out/tangled cause I didn&#x27;t really brush it the first time. I just sorta put it on right away. Was excited. Lol. But, yeah, definitely. A five star.</li>
    <li> I bought this to look like the girl from the movie &amp;#34;The Ring.&amp;#34;  It worked great, a bed sheet draped over me and the wig hair in my face, scared the heck out of the guys at work.  lol</li>
    <li> This wig has absolutely exceeded my expectations in quality and comfort. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> This is one of the best wigs that I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s sexy, playful, decent, and manageable. Make sure you diligently hand wash your wig by combing it through ( also using a quarter size amount of shampoo, no conditioner). This can be an everyday wig, it&#x27;s natural.  I love it. My boyfriend loves it. Wonderful wig!</li>
    <li> It would have been great if the bangs were not so long and in the way. There was no pushing them to the side, so when I went to cut it, all the hair began to stand up. Otherwise, it was a good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered it on the 24th of January and just got it today. It was a month early. It&#x27;s a bit thin on the top, but I pinned the bangs up to cover it. It&#x27;s VERY soft. It feels like human hair. It just gets tangled really easily and sometimes the hair falls out.</li>
    <li> The hair is REALLY long.  Like down to my bottom long.  The bangs were extremely long and not functional at all.  I had to cut them down, which was really easy and then the wig was perfect.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle as much as some of the other wigs that I have - but the length is just not practical for me.  I&#x27;ll probably end up cutting it some more.</li>
    <li> Better quality than expected. Very long! Bangs need trimming unless you are going for that &amp;#34;mysterious&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Its really good though the bangs were not as long as they were in the picture</li>
    <li> It was tangled from the moment I took it out the package. Dont buy. Its not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very long and pretty. It feel soft and real. It is a little thin though, you make have to purchase two.</li>
    <li> Yes it did and I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great :) I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good wig but keep it somewere safe and clean it can get notty fast good quality though</li>
    <li> First off, if you&#x27;re someone who from hairloss and you&#x27;re trying to find a wig this is NOT that kind of a wig! Although it is nice. Mine came in the mail quickly and the packaging was in good condition. The wig itself is decent. It has a strap underneath to help keep it in place. The hair is prone to falling out just a tad and it is a bit brittle and stringy like most costume wigs would be. You should note YOU MAY NEED TO CUT THE BANGS. I tried mine on and found that the bangs were so long I couldn&#x27;t see or fix them in a manner to make it work so I will definitely be needing to give it a trim. Other than that for the price it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> Love this wig. purchased it for my Marceline from Adventure Time Halloween costume. I had to cut the bangs since they are super long, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem, I like customizing my wigs anyway. The wig itself is the most natural looking wig I&#x27;ve ever owned, and for the price I was pleasantly surprised. It is thick, but seems to tangle easily. To off set this I used a little hair spray and brushed it through until it dried. That helped a little bit, but what works the best is to just braid it or pull it back in a pony tail. I did wear it down all of Halloween night though and it didnt tangle too much. so overall, great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I love the hair, even though it got really tangled on the end and shed-ed a lot of hair and the bangs were a little too long I really liked it.</li>
    <li> This was rediculously nice for the price- used for a costume and it was still looking good by the end of the evening. I will get many more wears out of it in future Halloweens :)</li>
    <li> Wig immediately became difficult to handle.</li>
    <li> Really pretty and good quality!</li>
    <li> Considering this was ~$15 wig, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but honestly I was pretty blown away by it! The fibers are super smooth and silky and have a really nice texture and quality to them, much nicer than some of the other wigs I&#x27;ve bought off of Amazon. The wig was plenty long, reaching down to my waist (and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;) and the bangs are easy to style and part. The adjustable clip inside helps keep this on my head and it looks great with my cosplay! Definitely recommend. It does tangle fairly easily, but it is a long wig, so that&#x27;s to be expected. Keeping it brushed out will save you any hassles.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this wig as it looked very realistic. The length was perfect, and not too long. For me, it landed at my hip. Be careful with this one if you plan on wearing it for more than one occasion. Because it is so long, it will tangle quite easily.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! So glad I went with this one as opposed to a couple others I saw. It&#x27;s super thick, long, has a nice shine. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Not long enough.  Good costumer service.</li>
    <li> The wig came quickly, which was nice. It&#x27;s soooo long and silky! It was so soft and enjoyable to wear. I loved it. It worked great for my Morticia costume.</li>
    <li> This wig is extremely well-made, comfortable, and feel so life-like. The #1 problem with it: it is IMPOSSIBLE to brush. I spent at least an hour trying to get all the tangles out, and the last half of it is still a horrible mess. The wig tangles so easily that its other benefits become pointless. I like the wig, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Feels softer than real hair, tangles (a lot) more than real hair. It took me an hour with fabric softener to detangle. Some hair fell out but that was expected. The tangles aren&#x27;t really noticeable until you run your hands so you don&#x27;t really /have/ to detangle it. It looks more like a dark brown in natural light but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> simply amazing -&lt;br /&gt;the perfect long black wig</li>
    <li> The quality of this wig definitely exceeded my expectations!  I absolutely enjoyed wearing it for Halloween,  everyone complimented me on it!</li>
    <li> Very thin layers and does not fit extremely well, falls of easily and losses hair everywhere.</li>
    <li> A nice wig for the most part, but it&#x27;s not actually as long as is shown in the photo and it took literally WEEKS to arrive. I ordered it for halloween with three weeks to spare and it arrived after thanksgiving. So, not actually useful for the halloween costume it was ordered for.</li>
    <li> Wig is a high quality, long and realistic wig.  Cuts almost like real hair to size.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, sure is long but very poor of hair,is so thin you can see the cap of the wig easily so I can&#x27;t really wear it as an everyday use, I have to use a beanie to cover the visible cap. Also since it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair , it tangles so easily more than other wigs I have of that length. I will only recomd this wig for pictures, in my photo shoots you can&#x27;t tell how bad the wig looks. It looks fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use or for cosplay. ( I got the black long straight wig BTW) I don&#x27;t want my review to Effect other wigs the seller has.</li>
    <li> Kind of a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get cheated out of this deal, but the wig is great. It&#x27;s very nice and more than expected.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a beautiful wig really soft but the bang is ridiculously too long I had to cut it.!! I just got it today and it tangles very easily then makes the ends get nappy and loose the softness i really don&#x27;t recommend these wig !!!</li>
    <li> Its nice and soft! But it tangles really easy, just brush on the regular and you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
    <li> It was pretty long and soft. When I got it though the bangs ate my face xD but since the bangs wouldn&#x27;t swoop I just cut it straight across. That is my only issue with this product&lt;br /&gt;But I got extremely good quality considering I only paid $4</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as described, and I don&#x27;t think there are any negatives with it. It&#x27;s worth buying if you want it!</li>
    <li> At first I was in love with this wig. It is synthetic so you cannot use any heat whatsoever. To straight in the hair I used boiling hot water but you cannot leave it in for too long because of the hair will start shriveling up. For about two weeks the hair was fine until it started to tingle! After a while I have to continuously cut the ends of the here due to the amount of tangled and knots! Also the Netting inside of the wig very cheap and ripped.But on the good side it was very cheap!!!</li>
    <li> The bangs are long but that&#x27;s ok cause I styled them back so I needed it long ...  I love this wig so much . I use it for my loki Cosplay</li>
    <li> My daughter does theatrical make-up work and this wig works beautifully!  Very nice quality at a great price point!  Happy!</li>
    <li> i had to cut the bangs but it&#x27;s a really nice wig. :3</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this wig for cosplay and she say&#x27;s it&#x27;s one the best wigs she&#x27;s ever gotten.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really soft and thick and we only got it in a few weeks after purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter said she would definitely recommend this wig to her cosplay friends looking for wigs.</li>
    <li> Shipped really fast. This wig isnt bad quality for what paid</li>
    <li> Late Review on my part, but I loved this wig. It worked great. People asked how I took such great care of my hair, and they were shocked it was a wig! I for sure recommend this!</li>
    <li> Perfect wig for my Umbreon cosplay. Good Quality. Great Price.</li>
    <li> Looks great for my adult Lilo costume! Very soft and beautiful. I only wish the &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; went further down around my hairline in the back.</li>
    <li> Perfect! It arrived faster than I expected it to, and it&#x27;s so soft and full! It tangles easily, as many have said in their reviews, but if you care for it well, it&#x27;ll last a long time. Well worth the purchase and a steal for the price!</li>
    <li> Just received my package. Arrived in 2weeks.looks as shown.fits my head as well. Tangels easy,I plan on cutting it after a while. Overall, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a very dark brown color. Not as dark as the picture. But other than that, it&#x27;s a very nice, beautiful-feeling wig. I bought this on a whim, so the color didn&#x27;t really affect me all that much. But, if your cosplay needs a jet black wig like portrayed in the picture, then this might not be the best choice.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! It didn&#x27;t come tangled, it just needed some fingers through it. It is SO soft! Has adjustable straps to fit any head size. it is super comfy, looks nice, and is just plain awesome. Color is accurate, too. It makes a nice Officer Caitlyn cosplay wig!</li>
    <li> yes yes yes. My first cosplay wig. And it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> This wig is so soft and perfect...😍 I got my wig earlier than the due date and it look like professional did my hair.</li>
    <li> It was super thin. And it being so long it Knotted quickly. I&#x27;ve gotten great wigs for the Same price.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty wig. It looks just like the picture, the length is exactly what I was looking for. The quality is also great. I also got this rather quickly. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> It tangled immediately when I got, within 10 minutes it was tangled. It was quite hard to untangle. This wig is LONG. I had cut it to a little past my shoulder because it was tangled and I couldn&#x27;t get it out. This product was too cheap to be good quality.</li>
    <li> kinda hard to put on tangles easily but i loved it</li>
    <li> I bought this wig twice, and this time, it&#x27;s  a little different, but still pretty great! It was less thick, but doesn&#x27;t tangle as easily as the first. That cap doesn&#x27;t show. Super silky, long, shiny, but not too shiny. I&#x27;m almost 5&#x27;1, and it reaches my butt. My head is average sized, and it fits perfectly. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Worked for my costume but is too tangled top use again</li>
    <li> Nice, thick, silky, amazing, does not tangle. By far the best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It doesnt even tangle considering I don&#x27;t take that great care of my wigs. Still in tip top shape.</li>
    <li> It arrived like two weeks before expected, and the quality is better than what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Had a good length but it tangles...bad. Wouldn&#x27;t buy from here again.</li>
    <li> Came in a neat package and unlike many other review was surprisingly not tangled. The bangs are insane and need to be cut, but I kind of like that it&#x27;s long enough for me to trim into my own style. Also it&#x27;s thin at the bottom so I&#x27;ll probably cute off a bunch of that length. Otherwise it&#x27;s SUPER soft and pretty realistic looking. Good little wig for the price!!</li>
