      <li>(I wasn&#x27;t sure I had it all rinsed out).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is probably supposed to smell like Goji Berry or Passionfruit, but rotting tomato is all I smell from it.</li>

      <li>Obviously many things could play into how my hair looks</li>
      <li>Good hair product at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I also want to add that I have fine relaxed hair</li>

      <li>basically anyone who wants a way to control their hair.</li>

      <li>probably will not buy this line of products again since the other brands I use leave my hair looking nicer and smelling a LOT better.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>this stuff is almost 5 bucks a bottle where I live.</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick and slightly wavy, maybe on straighter hair it would be more effective.</li>
      <li>The only that I can say that was better than average on this conditioner is the scent.</li>
      <li>Steer clear if you have wavy or curly hair.</li>
      <li>This product left my hair feel smooth and silky even when it was still wet</li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair so soft and bouncy...</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and silk after I use it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair soft after rinsing out as you&#x27;d expect from a hydration conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I do mean HUGE.</li>
      <li>It left my hair very dry and Strawlike and very frizzy.</li>
      <li>I like it so much that I put a little in a spray bottle with water as my leave in moisturizer.</li>

<li> Steer clear if you have wavy or curly hair.</li>
<li> This product left my hair feel smooth and silky even when it was still wet</li>
<li> and it leaves my hair so soft and bouncy...</li>
<li> My hair feels so soft and silk after I use it.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair soft after rinsing out as you&#x27;d expect from a hydration conditioner.</li>
<li> and I do mean HUGE.</li>
<li> It left my hair very dry and Strawlike and very frizzy.</li>
<li> I like it so much that I put a little in a spray bottle with water as my leave in moisturizer.</li>
<li> Not sure how well it is hydrating at this point - My hair doesn&#x27;t have as much shine</li>
<li> - a naturally wavy type down to my rear.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t call my hair dry, but because it is long, color treated</li>
<li> When I need something heavier and/or have the extra time, I use one of the other conditioners.</li>
<li> and I have EXTREMELY dry hair.</li>
<li> but I have EXTREMELY dry.</li>
<li> But if you have just dry hair from the humidity</li>
<li> Leaves my hair dry, frizzy, tangled.</li>
<li> Not bad but not good, just boring looking, not as full of life as it once was when first using the product.</li>
<li> main problems with this are that after using this conditioner, I noticed a lot of flyaways - which is not usually a problem with one of the other conditioners I use (Tresemme and Aussie) and I find the scent to be very unappealing.</li>
<li> Other conditioners don&#x27;t do this when I let my hair air dry.</li>
<li> as I get using other brands</li>
<li> Not worth it to buy, it does not hydrate or moisturize at all.</li>
<li> I think it makes my hair softer and less prone to get frizzy which can be a problem without something to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it and this works well.</li>
<li> I usually like the scents from the other Garnier Fructis lines</li>
<li> It softens the hard effects of the protein.</li>
<li> My daughter uses this at least twice a week and loves the product.  </li>
<li> Annoyed that I wasted money on it.</li>
<li> This conditioner has a very thick formula.</li>
<li> But this product is awful on long medium thick curly hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This conditioner is the bomb!! My hair feels so soft and silk after I use it. I like it so much that I put a little in a spray bottle with water as my leave in moisturizer. I actually have some in now after I did m protein treatment earlier. It softens the hard effects of the protein. I also want to add that I have fine relaxed hair so a light weightless conditioner works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> This conditioner left me feeling a bit lackluster. It did turn out well for detangling my hair - a naturally wavy type down to my rear. Not sure how well it is hydrating at this point - My hair doesn&#x27;t have as much shine as I get using other brands but it does not feel greasy or like straw either. I air-dry my hair so I don&#x27;t have extremely dry hair, I just have to use a more moisturizing formula of conditioner every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problems with this are that after using this conditioner, I noticed a lot of flyaways - which is not usually a problem with one of the other conditioners I use (Tresemme and Aussie) and I find the scent to be very unappealing. In fact the scent smells like the juice that comes out of a rotting tomato to me. I&#x27;m sure it is probably supposed to smell like Goji Berry or Passionfruit, but rotting tomato is all I smell from it. I usually like the scents from the other Garnier Fructis lines so I don&#x27;t know what happened here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not buy this line of products again since the other brands I use leave my hair looking nicer and smelling a LOT better.</li>
    <li> This motorizes very well and it smells fantastic! I love the cost of this stuff. Amazons price is great considering this stuff is almost 5 bucks a bottle where I live.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and this stuff really makes it much easier to manage and always gets it smooth and easy to comb every time.  I think it makes my hair softer and less prone to get frizzy which can be a problem without something to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it and this works well.</li>
    <li> love ordering it from here saves me money ... I like this product smells good and good price ty</li>
    <li> I love certain Garnier products including the 1 minute recharge in this line. But this product is awful on long medium thick curly hair. It left my hair very dry and Strawlike and very frizzy. Other conditioners don&#x27;t do this when I let my hair air dry. Steer clear if you have wavy or curly hair.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a 5 star conditioner! I have color treated hair. I wouldn&#x27;t call my hair dry, but because it is long, color treated and I only trim the ends once or twice a year (I will have to adjust and do this more often) my ends tend to look frizzy and unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner works better than the Natural instincts I was using prior to this one. My hair is looking shiny and very nice after using a hot straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used better conditioners, of course, but not for under $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this at least twice a week and loves the product.  It helps keep her hair &amp;#34;tamed&amp;#34;.  We recommend it to lots of different people ... basically anyone who wants a way to control their hair.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feel smooth and silky even when it was still wet (I wasn&#x27;t sure I had it all rinsed out).  It took my unruly hair and tamed it to something I felt was wonderful and luxurious.  I recommend using the shampoo and the one-minute recharge with it for the maximum effect.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will buy it again. My hair feels nice and silky.</li>
    <li> Good hair product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I really like these Fructis shampoos.  They smell so great.  They wash out really good and leave my long hair feeling smooth, just as expected.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner, it leaves your hair soft and with a wonderful soft scent. Every couple of months you have to change hair care products to avoid residue buildup. This is a great product to change to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair soft after rinsing out as you&#x27;d expect from a hydration conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have several versions of Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge Conditioner - a one-minute, a three-minute, and now this one, which is an instant conditioner.  I like to use it when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have the extra minutes to spend conditioning my hair.  It does a good job; I have no problems with it at all.  When I need something heavier and/or have the extra time, I use one of the other conditioners.</li>
    <li> Love the smell fo this conditioner and it leaves my hair so soft and bouncy...tx</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because my regular brand (pantene) was out of stock. This conditioner has a very thick formula. It does condition hair but I did find anything spectacular about it. It was, for me, just a run of the mill conditioner. My hair is very thick and slightly wavy, maybe on straighter hair it would be more effective. In essence, it was adequate, but I prefer Pantene ice shine. The only that I can say that was better than average on this conditioner is the scent. It is very fruity and fresh smelling. If you have a conditioner that you use that you already like, I would recommend sticking to that and skipping this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and I have EXTREMELY dry hair. My hair is always frizzy no matter what I do. Ever since I started using this I&#x27;ve seen a HUGE difference and I do mean HUGE. I&#x27;m 14 btw. I do remember that shipping was about 1 week but no longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By using this I realized that I need Triple Nutrition. But if you have just dry hair from the humidity so something like that then totally get this but I have EXTREMELY dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved my garnier products, but as of late my hair has been just meh. Not bad but not good, just boring looking, not as full of life as it once was when first using the product. Obviously many things could play into how my hair looks so I&#x27;m nnot going to just put the blame on this product.</li>
    <li> I really dislike this conditioner. Annoyed that I wasted money on it. Leaves my hair dry, frizzy, tangled. Not worth it to buy, it does not hydrate or moisturize at all.</li>
