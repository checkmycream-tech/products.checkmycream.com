      <li>too.&lt;br /&gt; I really truthfully love this stuff!</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks I continue to see firmer, more radiant skin!</li>
      <li>Smooth skin, plump, and just beautiful.</li>
      <li>If you are in the search for a moisturizing serum that will give your skin the vitamins it needs, I would recommend looking into this product, for sure!</li>
      <li>It is amazing that this serum repels water like rain and from just wetting my face before washing while allowing my skin to breathe.</li>
      <li>So when I saw all these amazing reviews I thought</li>
      <li>Ahh this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>But like my resourceful self I unscrewed the pump so that I could wipe some of the serum onto my hand and apply it to my face.  </li>
      <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest review</li>
      <li>My skin has also cleared up and is behaving nicely since using this serum.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>Since the weather has been really warm</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice box and the product&#x27;s container is glass.</li>
      <li>However all the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
      <li>It is not oily, instead it has a nice feeling on her face.</li>
      <li>My skin feels nice-</li>
      <li>All opinions expressed are 100% my own, and in no way influenced.</li>
      <li>so here&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I liked the way the serum felt on my skin.</li>
      <li>Honestly...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>A lot of companies now a days add in a bunch of junk that do more harm then good.  </li>
      <li>and I have been pleased to thrilled with all of them.</li>
      <li>After two weeks of using this product, I can honestly say that my face looks clearer, smoother, and more radiant.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this serum is how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>The packaging is hygenic but perhaps a clear bottle isn&#x27;t the best choice for vitamins.</li>
      <li>I believe the formulation of this serum is suitable for most skin types, but it is not a substitute for a moisturizer of course.</li>
      <li>I do know that it helps reduce the depth of fine lines though!</li>
      <li>It also feels very light.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very light even though the consistency of the serum is a bit creamy.</li>
      <li>The smell is very light almost nonexistent.</li>
      <li>You see, Ms. J has tried using lifts and serums many times, with varying degrees of success, and so she was looking for a successful, cheaper alternative.</li>
      <li>My skin felt supple, smooth, and looked really healthy!</li>
      <li>Well seeing how Adovia has delivered nothing but high quality, impressive products, I was quite excited to receive another item from them.</li>
      <li>Im a huge fan of Adovia products!  </li>
      <li>I love the scent as it isn&#x27;t off putting nor does it have a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; scent to it.</li>
      <li>Something that I really love about the brand is the way in which they package their products.</li>
      <li>I love  </li>
      <li>also love the way that it feels when I apply it to my face and neck.</li>
      <li>I am at that age where my youthful glow and firmness is just starting to head south for the winter (lol)!</li>
      <li>We received this product free to try out and the opinion is our honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I love this serum but do not like the bottle.</li>
      <li>so many skincare products on the market</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every morning for more than a week now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin looks more radiant than ever before.</li>
      <li>I am hoping though, that this review will be able to help someone see that it helps heal your skin.</li>
      <li>I like that this serum makes my skin so much more smoother and supple.</li>
      <li>I also like that after using it for more than a week</li>
      <li>Many of my family and friends asked me how I get my skin looking so healthy for my age</li>
      <li>but this is my favorite of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am using this product I love the way that my skin feels tighter and firmer.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely and refreshing smell like all of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
      <li>I have tried a couple before but haven’t been pleased with them.</li>
      <li>I love Adovia, they have such wonderful products</li>
      <li>I also love that it isn&#x27;t oily like most serums I have tried.</li>
      <li>I love how there is a window in the outer packaging to show off the fancy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love trying new facial product to find something that keeps my makeup in place all day without having to keep reapplying due to oilyness and other additives that sabotage my beauty routine. I found Adovia Mineral Skincare Mineral Lift Serum on Amazon and wanted to try it from the reviews. This was $56 for a 1oz. frosted glass bottle with a pump but I got it for free from Tomoson to test and review. The scent is very gentle like a scent-free body lotion. It was not harsh at all. The lotion itself is thick, white and lotion-like. It did not  run and felt non-greasy. I used this serum after using Adovia Minerals Skincare Moisturizing Soap Bar. As soon as I applied this to my face it felt instantly hydrated and nourished. My skin soaked it up quickly. I only used 1 pump and it was enough to use on my face and neck area. I used it when my skin was still a little bit wet to make it easier to smooth on my face. It kept my face evenly moisturized all day, even under my makeup. It was lightweight and never sweat off or just sat on top of my skin. This is a great moisturizer that I use morning and at night. I use 2 pumps worth at night to give my skin an even deeper moisturization and rinse it off in the morning before my usual routine. I like that this serum makes my skin so much more smoother and supple. It also acts as a barrier protecting my skin. It is amazing that this serum repels water like rain and from just wetting my face before washing while allowing my skin to breathe. The Adovia Mineral Skincare Mineral Lift Serum is an exceptional serum.</li>
    <li> like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I got this item and figured i&#x27;d try it a few days before giving a good review, but WOW! I had been feeling a bit dragged down lately and starting to really look my age.  I used this and started to notice the effects and was amazed!  Maybe its the Dead Sea Mineral, but this was invigorating and felt like a day at the spa!  Who needs to spend hundreds of dollars when this one product does it so much cheaper and in the comfort of your own home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried facial lift things before, as I always hear about them being cheap gimmicks, and don&#x27;t really work, that and I have sensitive skin. So this product when I decided to test it out, I was highly skeptical with. Not anymore!!! Will be recommending this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of skin care products, it&#x27;s never too early to start taking care of your skin for the years ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Facial Serum is one of the latest products by Adovia that I have tried, and I am loving it so far. I am still using this product, so full long term results are not in yet, but I can share with you what I have noticed thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first being how firm and supple my skin looks. I am at that age where my youthful glow and firmness is just starting to head south for the winter (lol)! Since adding this into my skincare routine, I have found that my skin has that same look it had when I was 18 or so. Smooth skin, plump, and just beautiful. I have found that I don&#x27;t wear my foundation as often because I am so proud of my skin and how great it is looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I do notice results pretty fast. My skin will have a tighter feel to it. I highly suggest when applying this, apply it in upward motions. Gravity is not your friend, so work against it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the results so far, and I am anxious to see how well this product works in the long term!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Today  I will  be telling  you about  Adovia Facial lift and firm serum, Yes I know  couple blogs ago  did review another serum. But this is way better is part of the Adovia line  of Dead Sea minerals.  I love  the feel it leave my face  with  and it doesn’t  smell bad either.  Made with Dead Sea salt, green tea and 21 minerals.  It comes out of the bottle  like a cream  but turn into  a serum.  It is easy to  use  in your morning or night routine.  My  face feels fresh after use  the serum.  I do not have much  winkles  but the ones i do have slow disappearing. I would  recommend this to  all my friends.</li>
    <li> The Adovia Mineral Lift Serum has to be one of the best moisturizers I have ever used! This serum is light but it has a thicker consistency, but not too thick. It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or oily on my face and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It has a very mild scent to it, not strong at all... A clean, fresh smell. My skin feels so soft and smooth and just amazing after using it. It literally feels refreshed and moisturized. In my opinion, I would definitely give this serum a try because my face has never felt healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Today I wanted to tell you all about a new facial serum that I tested out from Adovia. I have done reviews on a few of their products now &amp; I am really enjoying the benefits from using their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Adovia&#x27;s Facial Lift &amp; Firm Serum. Something that I really love about the brand is the way in which they package their products. I am a huge fan of the simple, sleek packaging design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the way that it feels when I apply it to my face and neck. It is light and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards like a lot of products can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a little information about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Achieve An Instant Lift and Anti Aging Effects on Your Skin&lt;br /&gt; - Delivers Anti Wrinkle Results Over Time&lt;br /&gt; - Vitamin C - Also Contains a High Concentration of Vitamin C for Anti Wrinkle Antioxidant Skin Protection&lt;br /&gt; - Dead Sea Salt - Formulated with a High Concentration of Dead Sea Minerals and Salt - 21 Minerals Essential for Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt; Non-Oily Moisturizer Delivers Deep Hydration and Nutrient Absorption&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am using this product I love the way that my skin feels tighter and firmer. It also feels more smooth and nourished.</li>
    <li> I love Adovia, they have such wonderful products so of course I was super excited to try out this one! When I read that it was a serum I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think since when it came out of the bottle it was a little... creamy? It seems more like a really thin lotion to me which I liked a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product my skin was smooth and soft and I didn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky. I loved it. Just another awesome product from Adovia!</li>
    <li> A little bit does go a long way just as it states in the directions. However, I received a product with a faulty pump. The serum only squirted out twice for me when using the pump the first time. I tried several times to (over 30 pumps each time) to where the pumping was starting to make my fingers get tired from trying. Finally I resorted to unscrewing the top and getting the product out that way. (Probably too much out at once). I&#x27;ve read from other reviews that they have had issues with the pump as well. I&#x27;m going to make sure I message the company about the issue (I&#x27;m not sure anyone ever has) so hopefully it will be fixed for future purchasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product representation is really great though. It comes in a nice box and the product&#x27;s container is glass. Very elegant looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I enjoyed it. A little bit goes a long way. It leaves your skin feeling very silky and smooth. It also feels very light. You almost wouldn&#x27;t know there was a product on your face if it wasn&#x27;t for the tightness (in a good way!), silkyness and smoothness this product makes your face feel.</li>
    <li> The consistency and color is also a bit different from other serums I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s actually white in color and has a creamy texture/consistency. It has a nice and subtle scent. The bottle came with a pump (I usually prefer a dropper since I can control the amount I wanted to use with a dropper) but I&#x27;m glad the pump of the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum only dispenses a small amount per pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave myself time to use the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum first before I wrote this review to see the actual effect of the serum. I&#x27;ve been using this every morning for more than a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Mineral Lift Serum is easily absorbed by my skin. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, I have an oily skin type by the way, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break-out and it&#x27;s very light even though the consistency of the serum is a bit creamy. I love how easy it is to apply and that I only need a small amount of the serum for my whole face. I also like that after using it for more than a week, I noticed that my skin looked healthier and brighter.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;serum&#x27; isn&#x27;t actually like the serum that you&#x27;re probably used to. To me, serum is clear and quite thin and &#x27;oily&#x27; like. This is more of an extremely light cream/lotion. When you pump it out into your hand, it appears white and creamy. Once you start to rub it into your skin, it instantly &#x27;melts&#x27; and turns to a thin liquid. Pretty cool actually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and outer packaging for the product is absolutely beautiful! If I wasn&#x27;t afraid that someone would think I was telling them they were old and wrinkly by giving it to them, I&#x27;d wrap this up as a gift!! The bottle is really great quality frosted glass with a silver pump and hard plastic cover. I love how there is a window in the outer packaging to show off the fancy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;Does this stuff remove fine lines/wrinkles? Honestly...I don&#x27;t know. I do know that it helps reduce the depth of fine lines though! Instantly after applying the product, you can feel an almost plumpness in your face. I normally have somewhat dry skin and this gives my face a soft, smooth appearance. Can&#x27;t complain about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pump&lt;br /&gt;Now...I may have just gotten a faulty pump but it was a pain in the butt to get to work. It was almost as if the serum was too thick to move up the hose on the inside. I had to remove the entire pump and keep shaking the bottle to get the product down the center. Once I did that, I still had a bit of trouble so I just kept pushing the pump over and over. After about 15 minutes of wiggling and jiggling and a bit of a mess, it finally came out! Since then I have not had another issue. Again...I may have just gotten a bad pump so you may not have a similar experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;As with the other ADOVIA products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent. It&#x27;s not that it has a bad scent whatsoever, it just isn&#x27;t something that I would prefer. It is very light, but floral at the same time. Once the product is applied, the scent quickly fades. This is a very minor issue in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.loral at the same time. Once the product is applied, the scent quickly fades. This is a very minor issue in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> As soon as I got my Adovia Mineral Lift Serum, I immediately started using it. I love that it does not have any strong smell which would have been a turn off for me. It&#x27;s got a sweet, subtle smell that I like. I also love that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and it&#x27;s easily absorbed by my skin. Right after application, I can actually feel my skin &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34;. And above all, I can feel my skin soft, smooth, fully moisturized. After two weeks of using this product, I can honestly say that my face looks clearer, smoother, and more radiant. I will definitely continue using this product. Thanks Adovia!</li>
    <li> I have used many sorts of facial products over the years which include lotions, scrubs, creams and you name it..i have tried it! Problem is that none of them...no matter what the price...have worked. Some claim to work in as little as two days while others claim to make you look and feel like a super model ha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many of you have done this? Seen a commercial for an anti-aging product that costs an arm and a leg and the woman using it looks like she is 20!! Well truth is, that woman portrayed in the ad is most likely 20 something and has not yet seen any aging!! seriously...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have been using this wonderful little bottle of facial lift and firm serum provided to me from adovia mineral skin care for about 7 days now. No...I am not expecting to look 30 years younger but i do expect to have a nicer glow and softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing i really love about this stuff is that it is free of harsh chemicals and does not burn my face. It is purely made with Vitamin C, Dead Sea Salt and Green Tea and Also Contains seaweed for a Rich Infusion of Nutrients to Feed and Nourish Your Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this every morning after washing my face since it is non-greasy and so far i am loving it. my skin feels silky smooth and soft and not greasy at all which makes applying makeup a breeze. I have noticed a little glow and less redness as well. As far as firmness goes..i have seen a slight improvement around my jawbone area as it has lifted a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this facial product and plan on continuing my use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the way it smells and feels. like a really clean and pure smell. Not harshy and full of stuff you can not even pronounce.</li>
    <li> I will admit that I have never before tried facial lifts based off of my own assumption that they simply didn&#x27;t work, otherwise there would be ONE out there that everyone bought and stuck to. But I tried this, I figured, what do I have to lose? Other than wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First I will start with smell, I always start with smell. If you open the bottle and take a whiff, it smells a lot like Jergens Original Lotion &amp;#34;The unscented kind&amp;#34; You know how lotions that are unscented still have that smell -- That is what this smells like. But only in the bottle, soon as you squirt it in your hand rub it in your palms then apply to your face, you can&#x27;t smell it any longer. Its a clean smell, a fresh smell. I honestly can not describe the smell other than, not bad. It&#x27;s nice. I am huge on scents, if they smell bad, its a no go. This one, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Second. You know how when you use most lotions and they are either too oily, makes you look like you just ran a mile and are sweating profusely? Or some, are so thick, that you can literally feel like you have a layer of gunk on your face, a wax like mask. You know how sometimes after you moisturize with some lotions you still feel dry? WELL, Not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After I rubbed it in circles on my face, I could no longer feel it. My face feels smooth, and looks matte. No crazy sweaty looking nose and chin. Best part about it, is My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry. Normally about 5 minutes after applying a lotion, I would feel like I needed more. This stuff leaves your face feeling cool. Literally cool. And refreshed BUT BEST OF ALL It feels moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have mentioned in a post before that I was searching for a facial lotion that moisturizes and while I liked the natural instincts. It wasn&#x27;t the one. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell too much. This one, for moisturizing purposes alone will be my go too stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wrinkles. I&#x27;ll admit that hitting 32 had me checking the mirror every morning looking for new lines. I really only have some around the eyes. Crows feet I think people call them. I do notice that when I use this under my makeup, those lines DO NOT stand out as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, I have extremely sensitive skin, and I break out OFTEN, pretty much I have broken out with most products I have used. &amp;#34;Only for minutes at a time, nothing serious.&amp;#34; This stuff didn&#x27;t cause a reaction. I will definitely be looking into more of their line to see what else they got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In my honest opinion, this is worth a buy. My face has never felt so healthy, with the added benefits of the vitamin C too. It&#x27;s a no brainer, and I know you guys have listened to me go on and on about vitamin c and how well it helps your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This stuff is like an extra dose of healthy for your face. My tone has seemed to improve too.&lt;br /&gt; I really truthfully love this stuff!ing for new lines. I really only have some around the eyes. Crows feet I think people call them. I do notice that when I use this under my makeup, those lines DO NOT stand out as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, I have extremely sensitive skin, and I break out OFTEN, pretty much I have broken out with most products I have used. &amp;#34;Only for minutes at a time, nothing serious.&amp;#34; This stuff didn&#x27;t cause a reaction.

    <li> Adovia  #serum worked pretty good in my eyes. I felt a difference after the very first application of this product accompanied by a slight visual difference. After continued use of Adovia #serum I now get complements on my skin on how it glows. I never really had wrinkles but I do have large pores at times and this even helped with minimizing the size so I had a more flawless look to my skin. I also suffer with skin that can be real dry in spots and extremely oily in other spots but this product didn&#x27;t add to the problem by being thick and oily yet its light and clean feeling. I know that this product Adovia #serum I will keep around for a while due to the fact it does make a noticeable change to the skin!</li>
    <li> First impression: Well seeing how Adovia has delivered nothing but high quality, impressive products, I was quite excited to receive another item from them. As usual, with my weird self, I opened the serum to smell it. It has a lovely and refreshing smell like all of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: As I’ve said before,I have a typically oily face with dark circles under my eyes. I have a few fine lines as well. This product claims to help with skin lifting and to be an oil-free moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After: Well people, Adovia has done it again! They delivered a great product with lasting results! Ahh this product is amazing. My skin looks more radiant than ever before. It also leaves my face so smooth and moisturized without it being oily and shiny. It literally works wonders. This is definitely going to be a part of my new beauty routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts: This company has never let me down! This mineral lift serum does exactly what it claims to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not paid to write this review, but I did receive the item(s) free for testing purposes. Regardless of my opinion on this company/item , I would never give anything but my honest opinion and would only recommend products or services that I would use myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see my full review, check out my blog post: http://womenandtheirpretties.org/2014/07/02/adovia-facial-serum-review/</li>
    <li> As I approach my (ahem) middle 30s, I have started thinking about anti-aging, but one huge problem that I often have is that anti-aging products tend to be heavy and clog my pores - I suffer more from acne now as an adult than I ever did as a teen!  So many anti-aging products give me some seriously not nice breakouts.  The other issue I have with some serums is that they can be sticky.  None of these were an issue for me - there is a definitely an instant lift factor, and it is not greasy or sticky.  No breakouts! It&#x27;s very creamy and leaves your skin super soft.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Any beauty product that has 5 star rating is going to draw my attention.. as this did.  I noticed all of the 160 mostly 5 star (and a few 4 star) were written in a one month period.  Curious, eh?  A few people did write that they received a free product and the \\&quot;opportunity\\&quot; to review.  No, I didn&#x27;t buy and use THIS product, but a few years ago, as I always loved the idea and smell of Dead Sea salts, I bought a few of Adovia&#x27;s products direct from their website and received quite a few samples (so I got to try about SEVEN products.)  They were all nice enough but not so great that I purchased any of them again.  So when I saw all these amazing reviews I thought \\&quot;Wow, either their products are much much better now... OR.... something is funky with all of these glowing reviews.\\&quot;  A person&#x27;s review is going to be very different when the product was free versus investing their hard earned cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice as well that a lot of their other products have 5 stars as well, reviews all done in June/July 2014.  I truly hope these products are now that good, but until I see more reviews from people who&#x27;ve spent their own cash for the products, I&#x27;m going to be a little skeptical.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific brand. I have received about 5 products from them to review and I have been pleased to thrilled with all of them. I already have an extensive face/skin care routine so it was fun to try out a face serum. I have tried a couple before but haven’t been pleased with them. This one I like. I haven’t noticed any lifting or firming…but I am not even 30 yet so I would hope that I don’t have much to lift or firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my pores became noticeably smaller and less visible while using this serum. My skin is looking brighter and the patchy dry places on my face are looking healthier every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Facial Lift and Firm serum with Dead Sea Minerals has practically no smell at all. It is a very thin moisturizer that absorbs beautifully into the skin. You could put some of this on and walk out the door. It does not leave your skin greasy or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price tag is a little steep for a cheapskate such as myself but the product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Im a huge fan of Adovia products!  I loved this serum!  I havent used it long enough to tell if it helps with wrinkles but honestly I dont really have many wrinkles yet.  But I love how well it moisturizes.  Its not oily or greasy so I was able to use it as a day cream and night cream without it feeling heavy.  My skin looks vibrant and moisturized.  I would recommend trying this!  Read my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this serum. It&#x27;s not a heavy serum but really gives you that moisture that is needed to keep your skin looking fresh and aid in ridding redness, dullness and scaring. I used this product for a couple weeks and saw great improvements in the look and feel of my skin. Will surely continue using it.</li>
    <li> I was already a fan of Adovia hair care products, so I was excited to try their anti-aging facial serum when they offered me a free trial bottle to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anti-aging and plumping formula is lightweight, almost like a gel, and disappears into the skin quickly, so you won&#x27;t feel greasy or damp afterwards, even during humid summertime days. That is also great because you can layer foundation, primer or makeup over the serum soon, rather than waiting around for it to sink in like with other moisturizing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice my fine lines disappearing; however, my skin was well hydrated, and I have definitely noticed fading of some of the redness that was on my face from battling past acne. My skin has also cleared up and is behaving nicely since using this serum. I think the serum is having a tangible effect because my overall skin tone looks noticeably better and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big believer in vitamins and antioxidants, both of which are in this serum; I think they are working, because this is the best my face has looked in months. I can wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone who wants a fast absorbing moisturizer with additional skin-improving benefits like tone correction.</li>
    <li> My wife is nearing fifty and she wanted a product that would help put some life back into her face. She has a few wrinkles, sun spots and that tired look around her eyes. She tried this Adovia product and she loves it. It is not oily, instead it has a nice feeling on her face. This is a great skin conditioner that leaves her face looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know my wife is middle-aged, but she still gets some pimples and oily skin. This product took away the pimples in just a few days. Adovia makes her skin feel smoother, softer and healthier. She is hoping (over time) it will take away her few wrinkles and give her a more youthful look. I already noticed how much healthier her skin looks. We received this product free to try out and the opinion is our honest opinion. Would my wife have bought this product? My wife bought a product similar to this (in the mall) and it cost her over $200. This product is cheaper and it does a better job. It also only takes a small amount to do the job. I believe she will buy this product when she runs out because she really likes it.</li>
    <li> In general, I&#x27;m not a big devotee of skin care serums. Most are geared towards dry skin, and I have normal-to-oily skin. Since a tiny bit of light lotion is way more than enough to moisturize my skin, I don&#x27;t feel any burning desire to include another product that would just increase the speed with which my face goes from &amp;#34;balanced&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;oily.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that regard, I absolutely love the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum. It is almost unbelievably light and perfectly fast-absorbing. In fact, for my skin, I could almost skip moisturizer when I use this and would actually prefer how my skin feels. It absorbs completely leaving no feeling of product on my skin in a matter of minutes - I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever used any other product on my face that didn&#x27;t sit on my skin, leaving a heavy, coated feeling (even moisturizers don&#x27;t seem to soak in on me no matter how light they are). I&#x27;ve been using it daily, and it hasn&#x27;t left me feeling oily any earlier in the day than usual and may even be helping to keep it balanced and normal longer. Since I don&#x27;t have even remotely dry skin nor do I have much along the lines of wrinkles to speak of, I can&#x27;t really attest to any anti-aging benefits it might have, but the mere fact that it seems to keep me from getting as oily as usual is more than enough benefit for me to continue using it as part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my thoughts aren&#x27;t all positive. The packaging this serum comes in feels decidedly cheap. I actually had to play with it a bit - untwisting and re-closing it a couple of times - just to get the pump working to dispense the product. Even though it has a silver look, the pump is totally plastic and feels flimsy, even moreso than a drugstore skincare product&#x27;s packaging. Thankfully I could get it working, so at least there&#x27;s that. And I do prefer pumps over tubs or other styles of packaging that require you to actually touch the product inside to get it out - a pump is the most hygienic wayto dispense skin care. I do have to wonder how long the pump will hold up, though, given how cheap it seems. I also have my doubts about how much of the product I&#x27;ll be able to dispense with this pump and how much would be wasted if I don&#x27;t open it up at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the pump didn&#x27;t feel so cheap, I&#x27;d be all over this product. I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to seeing if there are any long-term benefits to using it (say, a more even skin tone), but even if there aren&#x27;t, I adore how it makes my skin feel instantly, keeping oiliness at bay without being able to feel a trace of it on my face.</li>
    <li> This product did moisturize pretty well. That&#x27;s hard for me to find because of the fact that I have combination skin. Something will either dry my face out or it will make my face look like I rubbed it down with oil. I did like it as a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know that my face has really gotten any results as far as the anti-wrinkle, anti-agins, and instant lift. I felt a little bit of tightness the first few times I used the product but afterwards I didn&#x27;t really feel anything. This may be because my skin is weird (to me anyways) or this product just isn&#x27;t fit for my face. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and obviously age and other things play part in this. I think this product has great potential for someone with a different non-sensitive, non-redhead skin. Yes, I&#x27;m a redhead with sensitive combination skin. I never know what will and won&#x27;t work. So please keep that in mind before you think my review is too negative. It may not work that well for me but it may work wonders for you. All you have to do is give it a try.</li>
    <li> This has evened out the tone in my face.  My complexion looks a whole lot better, now I can even go in public without makeup!  Helped smooth fine lines.  I have sensitive skin that is acne prone when using creams, lotions, etc., but this has never caused me a blemish. Super pleased!</li>
    <li> I am normally not patient and this bottle really tested my patience.  I have used it twice now and both times I&#x27;ve had to unscrew the lid, flip the bottle upside down, get some product out, then I have made a mess screwing the lid back on.  After doing this, the product starts to come out on it&#x27;s own.  I am not sure if I received a defective bottle or if more people have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the actual product.  I have been using different samples or products lately trying to find one that will make my face feel softer.  A few serums I have used left my face feeling sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has directions to rub the serum in, using circular motions, until it is absorbed in the skin.  It did not take much and did not take long to cover my entire face, making sure that the serum was absorbed.  After the product had been on for about an hour, my husband and I did the touch test.  I felt it first and he felt it.  This is the first serum, in awhile, that did not leave my face feeling sticky.  The scent was not noticeable to me, once applied, which I always enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, my face felt fantastic after washing it.  The Adovia Facial Serum is the newest addition to my morning and night beauty routine.  Sure, the bottle is a pain, but as long as I can get the product out of the bottle somehow, it will be used.  I would have give more stars if the bottle dispensed the product properly.</li>
    <li> Today I received the remarkable Facial Lift and Firm Serum with Dead Sea Minerals and Vitamin C free of charge for my honest Review.  I applied the Serum it had such a light pleasant scent it was a white cream and it spreads very well,  I put it on half of my face and within 30 minutes it had completely absorbed leaving my face very soft,  without a shine.  You can achieve an Instant Lift and Anti Aging Effect on your skin with this Serum. It will also deliver and Anti Wrinkle result over time. The Serum also contains a High concentration of Vitamin C for Anti Wrinkle Antoxidant Skin Protection.  It is formulated with a High Concentration of Dead Sea Minerals and Salt. The Serum also contains 21 Minerals Essential for Skin Health and Beauty.  You can purchase the Facial Lift and Firm Serum with Dead Sea Minerals and Vitamin C on Amazon.  Thank you for reading my Review.  Jerri Davis</li>
    <li> I found the Adovia Face Serum to be a creamy liquid dispensed from a pump bottle. The action of the pump was good, but I found that my bottle&#x27;s pumping action was difficult to start at first go and later, after using about half the bottle, the pump simply stopped functioning. I believe I must have received one that is defective which can happen with any product. Now the main properties to review are the lotion/serum itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe in miracle creams or serums. I do, however, believe that we can help our skin along by caring for it. Part of caring for it includes using creams, lotions, and serums to moisturize and aid in keeping the skin soft. The ingredients in Adovia are considered to protect the skin by hydrating, providing nutrients, and protection. As their product information claims, it produces &amp;#34;results over time.&amp;#34; I found a small amount covers my face. I allowed it to be absorbed prior to using moisturizer and makeup. I found that my skin feels silky and soft after using it - even the next morning. It is non-irritating and I believe this would be a good addition to one&#x27;s skin care regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. #serum</li>
    <li> Dead Sea minerals seriously work. I&#x27;m not just saying that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I quit smoking a little over a year ago. Prior to that I had smoked for almost 10 years. Smoking, in case you didn&#x27;t know, has a rough effect on skin, especially facial skin. I have wrinkles, dry spots, and an overall sagging skin appearance. Scratch that. I HAD wrinkles, dry spots, and an overall sagging skin appearance. After about a week of using the Adovia Facial Serum, those skin problems started clearing up. Some of them are still there, but not nearly as visible and overall I look younger and healthier. I expect that to keep improving because this is one product I&#x27;m not giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a blue package. I really like blue packaging. Blue packaging is inviting and almost reminds me of the ocean, which I find pretty cool because Dead Sea minerals reminds me of an ocean too.  The Adovia packaging itself looks very sharp. My only small complaint is that the pump on the bottle is made of flimsy plastic and doesn&#x27;t often work as easily as I would like it too. Aside from that I am perfectly happy with the Adovia Facial Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I didn&#x27;t even know I would like using any facial serum. I had never used it and had no intention of using any kind of facial serum. When Adovia sent me some to review, I figured it was worth giving it a shot. I was incredibly pleased with how well the Adovia Facial Serum works and how this one product showed me the value in facial skin care products!</li>
    <li> Like I said before, Adovia has wonderful products. I like them all. This is just another one that I was happy with. I love products with Dead Sea Salt in them because they work very well on my skin. This particular product is very gentle on my skin and I can use it under my makeup or at night before I go to bed.  I&#x27;m happy that it has Vitamin C in it because I love the way that Vitamin C makes my skin feel and look too.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is light and like the company&#x27;s description states, it really is non oily. I don&#x27;t like to use anything too heavy or oily on my skin, because then I&#x27;ll usually end up breaking out. It also definitely moisturizes my skin a lot. My skin feels nice-it&#x27;s soft, firmer, and smooth. My husband and I have noticed that my complexion looks more clear and over all better. It must be the sea salt and Vitamin C doing their jobs!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a silver pump top, which I&#x27;ve said in other reviews, these pump tops make it easy to dispense a small amount at a time. You really only need a couple of pumps (at least that&#x27;s all I use).&lt;br /&gt;Happy as usual with another Adovia product. I can&#x27;t wait to try out something new by them as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free bottle in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own, and in no way influenced.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review Adovia&#x27;s Mineral Lift Serum.  According to their site it says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Achieve An Instant Lift and Anti Aging Effects on Your Skin&lt;br /&gt;- Delivers Anti Wrinkle Results Over Time&lt;br /&gt;- Vitamin C - Also Contains a High Concentration of Vitamin C for Anti Wrinkle Antioxidant Skin Protection&lt;br /&gt;- Dead Sea Salt - Formulated with a High Concentration of Dead Sea Minerals and Salt - 21 Minerals Essential for Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt;-Non-Oily Moisturizer Delivers Deep Hydration and Nutrient Absorption&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really found interesting the fact that this serum has 21 minerals found in the product and that it had of course dead sea components in it.  The fact that it had Vitamin C infused in the product was a bonus as vitamin c is an antioxidant that works great in making the skin glowly and radiant! They also added evening primerose oil in the mix which has great anti-inflammatory properties and works great as an emollient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The serum comes out in a white cream type form and is non greasy which is a bonus for me since I have oily skin.  I applied the serum once per day after my morning shower and it dried very fast.  I never had a greasy feeling left on my face or any residue like effect.  After a few weeks, my skin also feels a bit firmer and it did not leave my skin feeling greasy.  Adovia claims that it is an anti-age serum and while that may be true, I have not used it long enough to validate this claim. I should note that I am a 34-year-old Hispanic light-skinned woman without a single wrinkle who appears to be in her mid-twenties. Needless to say, I am not seeking a more youthful appearance however using products now to slow down any signs of aging (eventually) are always useful.  Especially ones that are formulated well and have real ingredients to make a difference in your skincare.  A lot of companies now a days add in a bunch of junk that do more harm then good.  So seeing good quality products in a bottle is worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did have one complaint.  I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about three weeks now and I thought I might not even get that far because about 3 days into using this product, the pump stopped working!!  But like my resourceful self I unscrewed the pump so that I could wipe some of the serum onto my hand and apply it to my face.  Hey I figure why let a good serum go to waste if I could pull a MacGyver here!  After a few more days the pump mysteriously began pumping again, eureka! No longer did I need to scoop out serum Bronx style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my only complaint is the low quality of the pump.  For the price, I would expect a pump that would function at least to the last drop has been used.  However it could also be that I received a faulty pump.  I read other reviews online and didn&#x27;t see anyone else having the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also currently using their Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream so stay tuned for a review of that product in the future!</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPf9a0b9765441117942931c364a4bf516&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was excited to try this product because my hopes were that it wouldn&#x27;t be something heavy and greasy. Well I was right. After using this serum for one month, I have noticed that my face and neck seem tighter and softer. I have combination skin, so the dry spots cleared up, and the oily spots evened out. I am in my early thirties, so It&#x27;s time for me to focus on keeping my skin tight and glowing. Over the past week, people have been telling me that I look like a teenager, which is partly due to good genes, but I know that this new glow is because of my Adovia Facial Serum usage. I use it once per day in the evening during my nightly routine. The smell is very light almost nonexistent. A little goes a long way and it applies very evenly on the skin. Since the weather has been really warm and I tend to shine during the day when I sweat, I try to keep it really simple with soap, water, and moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this serum to anyone who is looking to preserve their skin, as well reverse early signs of aging. I only gave it 4 stars because of the amount of product that comes in the bottle. I really wish that the bottle was a little bigger. Overall I am pleased and will definitely be buying more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMf9a0b9765441117942931c364a4bf516&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I currently live in a town where the winter is long and this year it seemed even longer. If you live in a cold state you know what I mean. Our skin was screaming for nutrition, moisture, and some well-deserved TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the brands I have had the honor of discovering this winter is Adovia. A skin care line; no wait a minute let me correct myself. I apologize. A spa mineral experience skin, body and being line. Yes, a line that truly feels like a luxurious spa treatment at home and yet so affordable. I am sorry if I am little gaga over this line but I have tried the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, the Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner, the Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap, and the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum, and it has truly become my favorite skin care brand for 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems every result, every expectation was met and exceeded. Today&#x27;s review is no different. This soft, velvety, fast absorbing, and potent serum has transformed my skin. It gives me true hydration without oiliness, delivers potent skin nutrition to aid with wrinkles and fine lines, and it gives my face a lift for today and even more benefits as I continued to use it as part of my daily skin care regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my readers and beauty friends may know about me... there are products I like and then there are products I love..... my friends... this is a product I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I had the honor of trying this brand. I am a true fan today and for years to come. Truly the quality is unmatched by any other serum I have ever had the opportunity to try. I am confident you will love it too.</li>
    <li> I was totally going to buy this product until....... I read all these FAKE FAKE FAKE reviews!!: After that, I changed my mind. I dont like being lied to, tricked, or deceived...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any company that has to pay ppl to give them fake reviews MUST be selling a seriously crappy product.....</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. I use it for 2 or 3 days and my face looked like carton. I had to discontinued using it and returned it. Customer service was very good.</li>
    <li> *I received this product in exchange for an honest review*    So, I gave this as a gift to my friend&#x27;s mom and asked for her to give me her thoughts on how well it worked for her. You see, Ms. J has tried using lifts and serums many times, with varying degrees of success, and so she was looking for a successful, cheaper alternative. And she found it. Here is her experience:    -The serum rubbed in well, and didn&#x27;t leave any residue behind after it soaked in.  -The serum didn&#x27;t really have a smell to it, which is a bonus.  -The serum left her skin feeling smoother and softer immediately after using it.-Gentle enough on her skin that she could use it daily.-Her face felt better and lighter after only one week of using the serum.  -Had some trouble with the bottle at first, but got over it.  -By the time a month had passed, she noticed she had decreased wrinkles, and that her face wasn&#x27;t as oily as it usually is.  -The serum worked pretty well, but it is still expensive, plus can only buy this serum online and there are cheaper, effective alternatives at the local store.  -Would recommend Adovia&#x27;s serum.</li>
    <li> It goes without saying that the foundation for keeping a youthful appearance starts with a good skincare regimen. While Cosmetics hide flaws, that&#x27;s all they do...hide them. So what can you do about correcting them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many skincare products on the market, it&#x27;s hard to choose which one is right for you. I myself have tried dozens of products over tbe years and have found a bit of everything: the good, the fabulous,  and most often, the complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where Adovia comes in with their absolutely amazing Dead Sea Mineral Lift Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have previously used Adovia products before and have always been very pleased with them thus far but this is my favorite of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself am only 27 and just beginning to see those first fine lines pop up but they are there none the less, most notably on my brow and forehead area. My main problem with many products is how oily they leave my already oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is the lightest, cleanest products I have ever come across. I&#x27;m talking zero residue and barely any scent.  I used it everyday for two weeks applying both morning and night and already my skin is softer, smoother, and more luminious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m left looking and feeling fresh faced and brighter. And the lines? it almost instantly hides and smoothes them. I can&#x27;t say that they have actually faded them permanently because i don&#x27;t feel two weeks is enough to know that, I can say that I have high hopes that it can do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to look fresh, youthful, and bright, then this is the best money you&#x27;ll ever spend!!</li>
    <li> I will say that the packaging is very nice. The bottle is glass and the pump works well so far. I have been using this product for three weeks now and I feel that I can give a fair review. This serum has a very emollient, almost watery texture and is not as oily as most serums that I have tried in the past. It sinks into your skin almost immediately. I like how it leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling oily and it does not leave behind any kind of residue at all. I also like that it doesn’t take several minutes to soak into your skin like other serums I have tried in the past. Although the ingredients list has fragrance listed I do not notice any scent what so ever with this serum so I am not sure what exactly they have added. I was also worried about it having dead sea salt in it, but it doesn’t dry my skin out at all. For reference, I have combination skin and do not have any fine lines or wrinkles other than a few around my eyes, but I use eye cream on those so I cannot speak on how well this serum works for the anti aging factor. I also would mention that the company claims that the serum works on anti wrinkle results “over time” so I do not think that it is a miracle product (as I do not think those exist).</li>
    <li> Almost like a complete facial in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I am definitely a fan of the natural ingredients when it comes to face products in particular. However, Adovia from Cleopatra Choice has been amazing thus far so I decided to test out their Mineral Lift Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Their products have never given me any problems and I have and will continue to use them. They are high quality and their ingredients are usually all natural.&lt;br /&gt;This mineral lift serum is a blend of natural ingredients and modern science in order to get the most effective formula that will maximize lift. This serum contains dead sea water with its minerals, green tea and vitamin c. If you have ever used vitamin c on your face you already know that it rejuvenates your look quickly as it absorbs into your skin. Dead sea minerals is even better with all its healing properties that improves skin elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is only about 1 oz but you do not to apply a lot to make a huge improvement. I only squeeze no more 2 pumps and apply in a circular motion. It has a very light pleasant smell and the white gel texture is very smooth for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;As it has been added to my nightly routine, my face has been less dry and gotten a more even complexion overall. As I get older you want to start taking steps to help keep your skin looking young and this is the product that would help immensely. My experience over the past month has been nothing but positive with the improvements that i see in my facial skin.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using Adovia for about 3 weeks. After my first application, I noticed how fast the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum absorbed into my skin. I love that it’s not greasy, and feels light on my skin. It’s not a heavy serum, and unlike other serums that I’ve used that tend to be an oil base, Adovia felt more like a water based, or gel if that makes any sense. After using Adovia Mineral Lift Serum for about a week, I noticed how firm my skin felt! My skin felt supple, smooth, and looked really healthy! After 2 weeks I continue to see firmer, more radiant skin! Love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have wrinkles, but like I mentioned in other posts I have a couple of fine lines, but I haven’t seen a difference in that area. I can say that I really like my firm skin! I think that if you’re someone that’s looking for an all natural serum that is going to firm up your skin, and give it a lift Adovia Mineral Lift Serum is perfect for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it’s all natural, and contains 21 Minerals that are essential for your skin. Some good news! No breakouts! This is what I’m talking about! I love that my skin did not have to get worse to then get better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given Adovia Mineral Lift Serum for review purposes. However all the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Packaging...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to review a few of Adovia&#x27;s products and I like how they package all of their products. It&#x27;s very clean and polished looking. The Adovia Mineral Lift Facial Serum was in a smoky-glass bottle with a pump to dispense the product. I love liquid products that come with a pump, as it allows the product to stay clean and bacteria-free, so that was a major plus with this item. The bottle came encased in a really attractive box that ensured it arrived to me undamaged - and it did. They were really fast about shipping out this product, which is another bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product &amp; Ease of Use...&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, the pump on my original bottle wouldn&#x27;t work, which was unfortunate. But I contacted the company, to let them know of the error, and they were quick to offer my a replacement bottle at no extra charge. I really appreciate good customer service, so definitely loved how quickly they solved the problem. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a very light-weight and thin in consistency. This allows for very easy application, and it doesn&#x27;t take long for this serum to soak into your skin and be dry enough to put another product on. I really like that! It can be irksome to have to wait several minutes between each step of your skincare routine as you wait for something to dry, so I always appreciate and love products that don&#x27;t take a lot of time to dry into the skin. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any Major Likes &amp; Dislikes...&lt;br /&gt;Well, the fact that the bottle came broken might be seen as a dislike, but I can&#x27;t really make that claim -- it was probably just a fluke, and since they were so quick to offer me a replacement, I in no way thought this downgraded the product. I liked the way the serum felt on my skin. I&#x27;ve never used a serum of any kind before this, but I certainly like having it in my routine now. :-) The price for the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum is on the high-end side -- $49 -- but if you are the type who wants to spend the money on worth-while skincare products, then this might not be so steep for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using this product enough to see how much of a difference it made to my skin. I don&#x27;t really have skin that needs a &#x27;lift&#x27; yet, but appreciate that those ingredients are in this serum -- you can never start too soon on your anti-aging products, so I&#x27;ve heard. :-) All in all, this is a really wonderful product. If you are in the search for a moisturizing serum that will give your skin the vitamins it needs, I would recommend looking into this product, for sure!hile skincare products, then this might not be so steep for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using this product enough to see how much of a difference it made to my skin.

    <li> I loved this product, as being 30 years old I have notice aging, I have tried many products from loreal, garnier  and a few others. I had the chance to review this product and I was extremely happy with the results. It took about a week to notice changes. My skin feels more softer and looks healthier, I use it 2 times a day , once in the morning and once at night as a everyday routine. The vitamins and the dead sea salt I have noticed gives me a natural glow. Many of my family and friends asked me how I get my skin looking so healthy for my age and I told them to try Adovia Facial Serum, I also told them they can purchase it from Amazon and even though it has a price of $50 dollars its well worth it, as you get natural vitamins and minerals compared to other products on the market which is hard to find with everything you need to make your skin look younger and natural.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this facial lift and firm serum from Adovia last week. The serum is for reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and it really works. The first time I used it, the serum rubbed in in seconds and left my face feeling soft and smooth with no stickiness. A lot of serums leave a gross feeling on your skin after application, but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the serum for about three weeks and noticed my skin becoming firmer and tighter. I noticed a decrease in my fine lines and wrinkles as well. I hope to see continued improvement the longer I use the product. The scent is very light and disappears quickly. This is good because I don’t like to put perfumed things on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple to use too. You only need to pump a small amount into your hand each day and smooth onto your face. It contains dead sea salt, minerals, and vitamin C to make your skin look younger and healthier. I would recommend this product to anyone who wishes to reduce the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t pad this review like many other users who got this for free (I did as well) so here&#x27;s my honest opinion. I believe the formulation of this serum is suitable for most skin types, but it is not a substitute for a moisturizer of course. I can&#x27;t say I see any ingredients nor changes from this serum that would actually cause a face-lift effect. That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t possible--I&#x27;m not exactly old enough for me to see immediate changes from a product like this. The formula is non oily and easily absorbs. The smell isn&#x27;t offensive. The packaging is hygenic but perhaps a clear bottle isn&#x27;t the best choice for vitamins. Overall I&#x27;d say it could be a nice addition to a skincare beginner&#x27;s routine, but if you need serious help try something with more targeting ingredients.</li>
    <li> This serum feels great right after I use the Dead Sea mud mask. I use the mask &amp; then apply this serum right before bed and in the morning my skin feels so fresh, hydrated, soft &amp; new. Unfortunately the pump didn&#x27;t work on mine, so I have to take it off and just tap it out, but that&#x27;s a small problem.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was great on my sunburn. I don&#x27;t usually have to use a moisturizer but it was perfect timing on this one. As I am 39, anti aging creams are going to be part of my daily routine very soon. Right after I received this, I got a pretty bad sunburn. Putting this on helps reduce the burn and helped heal my skin. I am very impressed with this product. I know that I didn&#x27;t use it for the purpose it is usually used for. I am hoping though, that this review will be able to help someone see that it helps heal your skin.</li>
    <li> From what I can tell, this is a pretty efective anti aging product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for just a few weeks so far and am happy with my results.  I&#x27;ve been on a kick these last few months to try and improve my health and that includes my skin.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The Adovia Facial Serum works pretty well from the use I have gotten out of it so far. I love the scent as it isn&#x27;t off putting nor does it have a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; scent to it. Goes on lightly &amp; absorbs quickly! You can read my full review on my blog at the link below  [...]</li>
    <li> The best thing about this serum is how soft it makes my skin feel. It is light and incredibly amazing. I also love that it isn&#x27;t oily like most serums I have tried. The container is small enough that I can take it with me when I travel and it has a lid so the contents won&#x27;t spill. I think it is fragrance-free because I don&#x27;t notice any strong scent from it at all. Great for all skin types. You will not be disappointed with this product (or any product that I&#x27;ve tried from Adovia--they have the most amazing things for your skin and hair).</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum as a moisturizer. I do not think I am too old or too wrinkly yet, but it&#x27;s never too late to start a good skincare routine now for those days when I AM old and wrinkly. Haha! Hopefully starting early with this Mineral Lift Serum it will post pone it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Mineral Lift Serum works great as a lotion. It is not too heavy and it feels natural. I honestly cannot tell if the serum helps with fine lines and wrinkles because mine are not too bad, but it did make my skin&#x27;s texture feel good and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer my skin feels the best and I do not need a lot if moisturizer, but I used the Adovia Mineral Serum under my make up just to try it out. My make up goes on great and does not feel sticky or wet when I use the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think skin care should not feel like you are putting extreme things on your face. Adovia seems to be the right amount if moisturizer for me. It feels natural which is encouraging for me to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I figure it can&#x27;t hurt to put a little cream on my face. So with that attitude in hand I happily applied Adovia&#x27;s Facial Lift and Firm Serum with Dead Sea Minerals and Vitamin C. It&#x27;s a light serum that is good for all skin types (I have pretty normal skin).You don&#x27;t need a lot of the facial serum to cover your face. It has a pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. It doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin leaving it feeling smooth and fresh. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks so I can only attest to a short period of use and I&#x27;ve been happy with it. It makes my skin feel good so to me that is what matters.</li>
    <li> I love this serum but do not like the bottle. It was impossible most of the time to get the serum out of the bottle as the pump mechanism is unable to pump the fluid out of it&#x27;s very small tubing. The company was very kind to send a replacement and assured me that the packaging will soon be changed. They are a wonderful company to do business with, and they have a great product that makes my face feel silky smooth and healthy. I just hope they can make a more efficient container for the outstanding skin serum. :)</li>
