### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great, and even soothes bug bites!</li>
      <li>I have found that udder butter seems to work the best.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST STUFF EVER!!!  </li>
      <li>But this Derm-Essentials item is incredible.</li>
      <li>, but this works beautifully for flare ups.</li>
      <li>Very effective for seb.</li>
      <li>I believe that there is a very strong dietary component at play here!  </li>
      <li>am am ecstatically happy to be able to post a report like this.</li>
      <li>It smells awesome and more importantly</li>
      <li>and I am so GLAD that I did!  </li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and very easy to just rub on and go.</li>
      <li>I like the product because it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist assured me that it was NOT diet-related, but I have to say that I strongly disagree!  </li>
      <li>The tee tree oil smell is very strong but you will learn to love it.  </li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t explain how happy I am with this product, it worked so fast for me and if I go too many days now without it, I just start it again</li>
      <li>Each day, my face looked better and better.</li>
      <li>I think you’ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>:-))</li>
      <li>Not only did it work great for this use, it took away the underarm skin condition within weeks!  </li>
      <li>I do love the smell and softened my heels.&lt;br /&gt;But, won&#x27;t be ordering more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s looking and feeling better</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see how much better it can get.  </li>
      <li>This is truly astonishing stuff.</li>
      <li>I used to get a rash every month at the start of my period, or after working out more than a couple of times a week.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it, I am beyond relieved to have this product as such a healthy solution!!!!  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I found Scott’s product, and I recommend it to anyone who is suffering from SD or SP on their faces.  </li>
      <li>Had a scaly area around my nose and eyebrows and it magically went away&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Thank you so much, you&#x27;re a genius!!!!  </li>
      <li>So far, so good - no flakiness and no itchies!  </li>
      <li>is great because is natural, not like the steroideal creams I would have to use otherwise.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It went on smoothly</li>
      <li>Since I make my own soaps and lotions, I decided to try making some NATURAL products using EO&#x27;s and knew I was onto something when my Lavender/Tea Tree/Oregano combination alleviated the burning and discomfort</li>
      <li>and I was able to apply liquid foundation over the top like normal.  </li>
      <li>successfully, on other areas of skin conditions, and was so happy to see it now available in stick form.  </li>
      <li>I did put some on my wifes feet though make them nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I gave it four stars because the smell is pretty strong -</li>
      <li>That way I can keep treating the scalp problem more often and more thoroughly without having to worry about greasy stringy hair that constantly needs washing.  </li>
      <li>I hope continued use will help heal the skin quickly.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to thank you soooo much for such an amazing, effective, natural, and affordable product.  </li>
      <li>I was even getting it right under my eye</li>
      <li>and it works right away.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the Neem Oil scent that becomes more pronounced after applying.</li>
      <li>This product does help at first, but a visit to a dermatologist is the real solution.</li>
      <li>I was officially diagnosed with SD a few weeks ago, but suspect that I&#x27;ve had a problem with the yeast/fungus that is associated with it for many years!  </li>
      <li>and I just gently apply it there too</li>
      <li>day 1, after applying in the morning, 4 hours later my face looked better than it had the entire week.  </li>
      <li>Im going to give this 3 stars because the high quality ingredients inside</li>
      <li>Just having skin that doesn&#x27;t feel like razor blades with big dry clumps on it is making this product very helpful and worthwhile.</li>
      <li>and I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much it has helped my face.  </li>
      <li>I found a similar cream that did the trick without the hot garbage dump smell.</li>
      <li>have to use it frequently though&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I also bought the companion product for some patches just above my hairline and that product is very oily &amp; greasy requiring hair washing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a patch on one elbow for over 20 years that has never, ever healed completely and always returns.  </li>
      <li>The patches were near my hairline, and it did not make my hair greasy.  </li>
      <li>I began looking online to find some natural alternatives and found this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used one tube, so far.</li>
      <li>Since nothing has worked to clear this up in 20+ years, so far this is a winner.  </li>
      <li>the itching was completely gone; day 4 the flaking was 80% gone; by the end of day 7, I looked about 95% back to my normal self!  </li>
      <li>My cheeks are no longer red and my skin looks normal.  </li>
      <li>My face was so red before and it makes it look normal.  </li>
      <li>I finally feel like I have a solution to a problem that was making me so self conscious about my face.  </li>
      <li>and it calms it right back down.  </li>
      <li>Thanks dad for passing that down the gene pool!  </li>

<li> and it calms it right back down.  </li>
<li> Thanks dad for passing that down the gene pool!  </li>
<li> makeup only covered it for a few hours (flakes developed, I scratched, and then the red splotches appeared around lunch time).  </li>
<li> I have mild seb dermatitis that usually stays hidden in my scalp.  </li>
<li> I loved the idea of essential oils because I hated putting chemicals on my face</li>
<li> Have used for only 2 days and am already seeing less flanking and redness/a reduction in sheboreic dermatitis symptoms on my face.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work as much as expected</li>
<li> I was extremely self-conscious and embarrassed!  </li>
<li> The thick consistency is a little like having a thin layer of ointment on the dry patch.  </li>
<li> I am now expecting with this combo most or all inflation to be gone in a month as it daily diminishes whereas it was really bad with leather-like chunks coming off together with terrible open sores.</li>
<li> While one is directed to have patience to see any results in month I saw it in just 3 days for then I suddenly merely had but red skin.</li>
<li> but I was not sure if the oils would break me out because I have oily skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try this product on the scalp as well because I think this will coat the area, moisturize and treat it without leaving all that greasy mess behind.  </li>
<li> Multiple trips to the dermatologist, crazy drugs.  </li>
<li> And I don&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s a crappy product.</li>
<li> After using it for less than a week, I noticed a dramatic improvement in the scaly, itchy, red, burning and painful  patches that I had on my neck, nasolabial folds (sides of the nose), eyebrows, eyelids, temporal region, around the ears, etc.  </li>
<li> And it stinks for a long time too!</li>
<li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier with it and will continue to buy it.  </li>
<li> I only used it twice, and the smell was so bad</li>
<li> If you have seb derm on your face its probably not a good idea to use 15 diff oils on your face because seb derm is the over production of oils.</li>
<li> I mean it really has a horrible smell!</li>
<li> Used Xolegel prescribed by doctor, and the flare ups would go away after 2 days, then reappear worse than ever after a week.  </li>
<li> Mine was even worse in the winter.  </li>
<li> And steroids while helpful make the skin thin, so prospectively worse.</li>
<li> Not good!</li>
<li> don&#x27;t even have bad skin but a few areas that needed treatment.</li>
<li> I had to go on prescription meds to clear up the worst of my seb.</li>
<li> I have seborrheic dermatitis in my underarm area, and as a result, have been unable to use deodorant, powders or creams.  </li>
<li> Sorry, folks.</li>
<li> I tried all kinds of expensive lotions, creams, prescription steroid creams, dandruff shampoos, etc.</li>
<li> Prescribed meds failed me.</li>
<li> Dangerous.</li>
<li> I had an awful case of seborrheic dermatitis and/or seborrheic psoriasis this past August.  </li>
<li> I have had seborrheic dermatitis really bad for about a year on the sides of nose, eyebrows and hairline around my forehead.</li>
<li> I was using dandruff shampoo on my face and it was drying it out badly.  </li>
<li> It was bad.</li>
<li> Really ugly.</li>

    <li> Does not work as described.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks! And I don&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s a crappy product. I mean it really has a horrible smell! And why would you want to put something that stinks on you face! And it stinks for a long time too! I have dermatitis on my chin and moustache area. I have found that udder butter seems to work the best. Just have to put it on every night. Sorry, folks. There just doesn&#x27;t seem to be a miracle cure. But please take my advice. Skip this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST STUFF EVER!!!  I was officially diagnosed with SD a few weeks ago, but suspect that I&#x27;ve had a problem with the yeast/fungus that is associated with it for many years!  I tried all kinds of expensive lotions, creams, prescription steroid creams, dandruff shampoos, etc. and NOTHING WORKED!  My dermatologist assured me that it was NOT diet-related, but I have to say that I strongly disagree!  I believe that there is a very strong dietary component at play here!  Since I make my own soaps and lotions, I decided to try making some NATURAL products using EO&#x27;s and knew I was onto something when my Lavender/Tea Tree/Oregano combination alleviated the burning and discomfort I was having.  I began looking online to find some natural alternatives and found this product.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try and I am so GLAD that I did!  Now I can&#x27;t imagine living without it!  After using it for less than a week, I noticed a dramatic improvement in the scaly, itchy, red, burning and painful  patches that I had on my neck, nasolabial folds (sides of the nose), eyebrows, eyelids, temporal region, around the ears, etc.  I was at the point where I didn&#x27;t want to leave the house!  I was extremely self-conscious and embarrassed!  This stuff SAVED MY LIFE!  I encourage anyone who has SD on the face/neck to give this a try!  Along with a anti-candida diet, supplements (caprylic acid, oregano oil, probiotic/acidophilus and a milk thistle/liver detoxifier, etc.) this product is a MUST-HAVE.  I will NEVER be without it again!  PLEASE DO NOT STOP MAKING THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Works as announced. Had a scaly area around my nose and eyebrows and it magically went away&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it frequently though&lt;br /&gt;But is great because is natural, not like the steroideal creams I would have to use otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy. I am buying it again</li>
    <li> Helps with itching and peeling skin! Works great, and even soothes bug bites!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product on my elbow rather than for the face.  I&#x27;ve had a patch on one elbow for over 20 years that has never, ever healed completely and always returns.  I like the product because it&#x27;s very easy to use.  The thick consistency is a little like having a thin layer of ointment on the dry patch.  I&#x27;ve had no skin reactions...and I&#x27;m allergic to just about everything.  It has softened the patch up in two days time.  It&#x27;s looking and feeling better so I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see how much better it can get.  I also bought the companion product for some patches just above my hairline and that product is very oily &amp; greasy requiring hair washing.  I&#x27;m going to try this product on the scalp as well because I think this will coat the area, moisturize and treat it without leaving all that greasy mess behind.  That way I can keep treating the scalp problem more often and more thoroughly without having to worry about greasy stringy hair that constantly needs washing.  Will advise how that goes and will amend my review as I see how it works.  Since nothing has worked to clear this up in 20+ years, so far this is a winner.  Just having skin that doesn&#x27;t feel like razor blades with big dry clumps on it is making this product very helpful and worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Very effective for seb. derm and eczema.  Results seen within 3-4 days.  I applied it 2-3 times a day.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the Neem Oil scent that becomes more pronounced after applying.</li>
    <li> I purchased the facial stick for seborrheic dermatitis over a month ago and I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much it has helped my face.  I was using dandruff shampoo on my face and it was drying it out badly.  I was also using anti fungal cream on my face twice a day and it wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I loved the idea of essential oils because I hated putting chemicals on my face but I was not sure if the oils would break me out because I have oily skin.  Well it was quite the contrary and I noticed a difference immediately!!  I do not write reviews but I can&#x27;t explain how happy I am with this product, it worked so fast for me and if I go too many days now without it, I just start it again and it calms it right back down.  It smells awesome and more importantly I finally feel like I have a solution to a problem that was making me so self conscious about my face.  I was even getting it right under my eye and it was getting bigger and I just gently apply it there too and it works right away.  In fact I put it all over my face.  My face was so red before and it makes it look normal.  I wanted to thank you soooo much for such an amazing, effective, natural, and affordable product.  I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier with it and will continue to buy it.  I hope someone who is reading this who was feeling like I was will give it a try and have the outcome that I have.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it, I am beyond relieved to have this product as such a healthy solution!!!!  Thank you so much, you&#x27;re a genius!!!!  Nicky :-))</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as much as expected</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it works. I only used it twice, and the smell was so bad I stopped using it. It smells horrible. I found a similar cream that did the trick without the hot garbage dump smell.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis in my underarm area, and as a result, have been unable to use deodorant, powders or creams.  I&#x27;ve used the oil form of this product for years, successfully, on other areas of skin conditions, and was so happy to see it now available in stick form.  I immediately ordered it, and tried it on my underarm skin condition.  I was hoping that it would be something that I could tolerate, and use in the place of deodorant.  Not only did it work great for this use, it took away the underarm skin condition within weeks!  I recommend this product, and any of Scott&#x27;s products, to anyone... they have worked so well for me!</li>
    <li> Im going to give this 3 stars because the high quality ingredients inside but it did NOTHING for my facial seb derm at all.  I tried it several times. If you have seb derm on your face its probably not a good idea to use 15 diff oils on your face because seb derm is the over production of oils. Makes no sense to drown your face in oils. I did put some on my wifes feet though make them nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin condition, and it&#x27;s greasy.</li>
    <li> I had to go on prescription meds to clear up the worst of my seb. derm., but this works beautifully for flare ups. Often gives relief with just one application.</li>
    <li> So-so product. It helps a bit but it&#x27;s not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work :((&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have bad skin but a few areas that needed treatment. I was hopeful for this product, but for me, just personally didn&#x27;t help a bit.</li>
    <li> I have mild seb dermatitis that usually stays hidden in my scalp.  This fall, however, it started to appear along my hairline and crept onto the sides of my face.  It was itchy and makeup only covered it for a few hours (flakes developed, I scratched, and then the red splotches appeared around lunch time).  I ordered this as a &amp;#34;long shot&amp;#34;, hoping it might help.  It went on smoothly and I was able to apply liquid foundation over the top like normal.  The patches were near my hairline, and it did not make my hair greasy.  So far, so good - no flakiness and no itchies!  I hope continued use will help heal the skin quickly.  I gave it four stars because the smell is pretty strong - I would call the smell &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34;, and being female I&#x27;m not used to smelling like this, but if it treats the itchies and can minimize the red patches, I&#x27;ll put up with it for a bit.</li>
    <li> I used to get a rash every month at the start of my period, or after working out more than a couple of times a week. This cleared up my skin in a couple of weeks. I now use it every once in a while, but I haven&#x27;t had a flare-up since I started using Derm-Essentials.</li>
    <li> This product was a life saver for me! I literally have spent hundreds of dollars on products to try to heal my seborrheic dermatitis and nothing has helped, most of them even made it worse. I went to the dermatologist and was prescribed a cream that did nothing but make my skin crack. Derm-essentials healed my skin within 24 hours. I had it on my eyes, so it is such a relief that this problem is gone. I will say, that I applied 3 to 4 times a day and that seemed to do the trick. I am so grateful for this product, I am not embarrassed to leave the house anymore! I hope anyone with the same problem finds this because it will do wonders for you.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, plus it caused my skin to have a burning sensation. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Wish it had worked my dermatitis, but it didn&#x27;t. I do love the smell and softened my heels.&lt;br /&gt;But, won&#x27;t be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I had an awful case of seborrheic dermatitis and/or seborrheic psoriasis this past August.  Used Xolegel prescribed by doctor, and the flare ups would go away after 2 days, then reappear worse than ever after a week.  After this happening 3 times as well as the Xolegel making my orbital area swollen for two mornings, I found Derm-Essentials.&lt;br /&gt;From day 1, after applying in the morning, 4 hours later my face looked better than it had the entire week.  Each day, my face looked better and better. Day 2 the itching was completely gone; day 4 the flaking was 80% gone; by the end of day 7, I looked about 95% back to my normal self!  I am so glad I found Scott’s product, and I recommend it to anyone who is suffering from SD or SP on their faces.  If you’re hesitant, just try it, once.  I think you’ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This is truly astonishing stuff. While one is directed to have patience to see any results in month I saw it in just 3 days for then I suddenly merely had but red skin. I am, tho, also using a salicylic acid face wash and dilute hydrogen peroxide wash as well. I am now expecting with this combo most or all inflation to be gone in a month as it daily diminishes whereas it was really bad with leather-like chunks coming off together with terrible open sores. Really ugly. It was bad. And was told, &amp;#34;uncurable.&amp;#34; Prescribed meds failed me. And steroids while helpful make the skin thin, so prospectively worse. Dangerous. Not good! But this Derm-Essentials item is incredible. I have used one tube, so far. Will be starting on another and will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am am ecstatically happy to be able to post a report like this.</li>
    <li> Seborrheic Dermatitis cured, use the shampoo.  Miracle drug.  Multiple trips to the dermatologist, crazy drugs.  so embarrassing didn&#x27;t want to leave the house at times.  Mine was even worse in the winter.  This is no longer an issue I also use the bar soap and tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I do think this product is overpriced.</li>
    <li> I have had seborrheic dermatitis really bad for about a year on the sides of nose, eyebrows and hairline around my forehead. Thanks dad for passing that down the gene pool!  I have been using everything from over the counter lotions to coconut oil and nothing has helped.  I have been using this item for about a month and I feel like I have been healed! My cheeks are no longer red and my skin looks normal.  It is not greasy and very easy to just rub on and go. The tee tree oil smell is very strong but you will learn to love it.  Yes buy this product!</li>
    <li> Have used for only 2 days and am already seeing less flanking and redness/a reduction in sheboreic dermatitis symptoms on my face.  After using this for 2 weeks to get the symptoms under control, I stopped using Derm-essentials and now use cetaphil daily facial cleanser and cetaphil eczema moisturizer in the morning and before bed and I have 0 flaking. Still have a bit of redness, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product does help at first, but a visit to a dermatologist is the real solution.</li>
