<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love products that save me money. I bought this so I can put rhinestones on my girls nails and it worked great. The rhinestones were really easy to pick up with these tweezers. So now instead of taking them to the nail salon every couple weeks and the price going through the roof because they want rhinestones I can do it. YEAH! I do recommend.</li>
    <li> good product.  Easy to use for picking up small nail jewels and placing nail striping tape.  straight and angles help</li>
    <li> When I finally got the tweezers they were ok. Even though the items I order them to use them for were of no use to me.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  My girls ages 7 and 13 have been using them for all of their bead work and nail designs.  We will order again in the future from this quality seller.</li>
    <li> These came in the same envelope but were seprately packaged inside. They arrived quickly. These tweezers are flimsy, and made purposely that way. If you&#x27;re looking for something to do your eyebrows with this isn&#x27;t going to help you. They&#x27;re perfect for picking up gems, studs and rhinestones and placing them exactly where they need to go. Will buy again if the need arises.</li>
    <li> good small set of tweezers for the price. good to place rhinestones and nail decals, etc. shipping took a bit longer than expected though</li>
    <li> Are perfect for take the rhinestones, flowers, gems, crystals and some other decoration for nails, are comfortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use both of these tools to apply rhinestones, jewels and beads to my nails. Love that the set comes with two.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter will be going back to work in February and was so happy to have received these as a gift.</li>
    <li> I had spend so much money at the stores buying this tool and didnt realized that I could had just click and save so much money...  Love them so much I order an extra set for the future!!! we have spare ones for when my girls cousins or friends stop over to do their nails art.</li>
    <li> I only received one of the two tweezers pictured. They are pretty cheep and wouldn&#x27;t be good for plucking, but they work for putting nail gems on. Which is why I bought them</li>
    <li> Perfect for picking up the small rindstones</li>
    <li> Nicely crafted set of tweezers.  They easily pick up timy rhinestones and other decorations for nail.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This product is great. They are just as expected from the pictures and are perfect to pick out nail art gems and they help a lot with nail art techniques. Not to mention that the price is excellent!! They are awesome!</li>
    <li> The fine point helps to pick up these very small nail art. Best of all was the free shipping for such a small purchase price?</li>
    <li> My daughter was given these tweezers to practice on her nail art and they work great!!! I was not happy to have to wait for delivery but it was worth it!</li>
    <li> These will work like with nails, grabbing diamonds ect but these are definitely not for individual eyelashes they don&#x27;t hold any eyelashes, and that&#x27;s y I ordered them:/</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers for the nail arts gems..It works wonder and have awesome grips to them. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great. Perfect for the stones, and with these tweezers they&#x27;ll never fall off.</li>
    <li> nice size, easy to use to set stones on nails.</li>
    <li> they work, do what they are suppose to do, buy two or three of them for this price, because everyone will have them. and they are great for putting on lashes and other cosmetic designs, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use same one for nails on your eye makeup designs.</li>
    <li> Very good for putting on eyelashes on and rhinestone on nails. Would purchase again. Little thin but it is fine</li>
    <li> What can I say.... They are exactly as described I the ad.  They are functional and they fully serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Works well at picking up tiny nail jewels and placing decals.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very durable, nice and thick, good stainless steel, nice to work with.  Good quality. Would highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to add gems to my nails in just the right spot! Excellent!</li>
    <li> These work perfect! they work great for picking up tiny rhinestones and glitter i love them. This was a great deal. Also shipped faster than they said only took a week</li>
    <li> works great for crafts. made well and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;these should last but would order them again if need be.</li>
    <li> In doing lash extensions I find these to be a tad bit bulky compared to what I prefer.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are good but I just used them for my eyebrows they didn&#x27;t take that long to come initially brought them for the gems for my nails but I wounded up using them for my eye brows</li>
    <li> these work well for the use that it is stated for, you receive 2 different pair, with different tips.&lt;br /&gt;they can be used for many other uses as well, which I do use them for many things, including regular tweezers, and other such uses....</li>
    <li> These are just what I was expecting but be careful! They are very sharp and will hurt you if you touch the ends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but these tweezers are so cheap. They bend and you can&#x27;t grab literally anything with them! I even tried to pick up an eyelash and it couldn&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s a great waste of money. That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I use these to help me apply me false lashes. It works great. Awesome buy for the price. Will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> ordered for my daughter for Christmas and arrived after.  They seem to be OK.  nothing broke.  She cant wait to start using them</li>
    <li> These can be used for rhinestones or pearls or any kind of fingernail art, other than glitter, of course.  I&#x27;ve been able to use them for a lot of different things and look forward to using them on many more.</li>
    <li> I received this tweezers and they work fine. Stainless steel as advertised( good material). They are perfect. Shipment came on time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> They fit the purpose, although waited for about 3 weeks for delivering. Not the best art tools out there, but if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap to use for personal purposes only (not recommended for nail salons), this may be it.</li>
    <li> i really like these for the price it they are great .. they are so pointed that i can pick up my product easy .. they are so cute  thanks</li>
    <li> When using regular tweezers, I&#x27;ve had problems with them flying out and shooting on into unknown territory. These worked perfectly. They are a little flimsy, but that&#x27;s really the point. If they were too rigid, they&#x27;d send those stones flying.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my Gemstone crafting and they work really well. I would recommend these for Gemstones, Rhinestoning etc...activities.</li>
    <li> These are a good quality stainless steel tweezers for under 3 bucks!  the tips are for picking up small items and are perfect.  Great value!</li>
    <li> These came the same day my new gems came. I used the angle tipped one to inspect the compartments. They come with a rubber/plastic sleeve to keep them closed for safe keeping. A must have for any one who does their own nails. Now I can stop using my eyebrow tweezers, I hate misplacing them. These are a bit thinner for more delicate work. 2 week delivery time from order.</li>
    <li> Love it, use it all the times</li>
    <li> These precision tweezers work great.  Got them for a great price too!  What more could I ask for?  I recommend these tweezers for applying nail art.  I am sure that there are a million uses out there, but I use mine to decorate my nails!</li>
    <li> The straight tweezers work better then the curved ones. In order to effectively uses these the gems should be on the bigger side. But overall they are very useful, and the wait was a little long to get here. I realize it was international shipping but still a little on the long side.</li>
    <li> the product is of good quality, packaged nicely, and reasonably priced. I am very pleased with the purchase. I will purchase more as needed.</li>
    <li> These tools are rather flimsey. They may work out for some things, but won&#x27;t hold up if using moderate pressure. I guess you do get what you pay for and these tweezers were very inexpensive!</li>
    <li> hello to all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this article is very neccesary to use and more practiques to do the nail arts without problems.&lt;br /&gt;thanks in advance.....</li>
    <li> So far haven&#x27;t had any problems with the tweezers, I like them they get the job done. I would recommend them</li>
    <li> Considering the amazing price and bearing in mind these tweezers are going to be used for doing nail art - they are of good quality for that purpose. Being made from stainless steel they will not rust. These tweezers have FINER POINTS than many tweezers you find in a drug store, so you can easily pick up imitation rhinestones for nail art and still see what you are doing. The metal IS thinner than eyebrow tweezers, but I don&#x27;t think it was too thin. (My Tweezers were Not “paper thin” as was stated in one of the reviews on Amazon) I have looked at many tweezers for working with electronics and such - and some of those were just as thin as these are, but cost way more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. These defiantly cannot be compared to any precision types of tweezers I have bought (costing from $18.00 to $35.00 for a set – Although I did not expect that degree of quality) so if you are expecting Professional Precision Quality and Look, these are not what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great with little stones. They fit great in my hand and do what I bought them to do so I have no complaints especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these. They are good quality and don&#x27;t seem to bend or break. They pick up rhinestones with general ease. I would suggest them for anyone trying to work with rhinestones in their manicure.</li>
    <li> Ends are slightly off, but not enough to matter for applying rhinestones. These are good enough, affordable (cheap) set of tweezers that are not for eyebrow use.</li>
    <li> usually i wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on tweezers but I think this is an awesome brand,I absolutely love this pair of tweezers, They are great because i can get the perfect size of rhinestone, I am glad I bought them, excellent goods, these tweezers came in fast delivery, Packing good, Great tool &amp; very easy to use,  I would recommend this to a friend, Thanks!</li>
    <li> works as described great quality east to use and its stainless steel rust proof easy to handle and easy to pick up jewelry</li>
    <li> You cant really tell in the picture how thin these tweezers are. Let me tell you they are very flimsy ! I was suprised that they made it from hong Kong with only one little bend in them. I straightened it out, they still work fine. I just wish they were a little more durable !</li>
    <li> Used them already and they are awesome, I really like the pointiness that they have,  works awesome, great, thanks. will order again</li>
    <li> it works because it does pick up the gems BUT it isn&#x27;t sturdy... its very flimsy, unlike a reg tweezer for eyebrows or something its like paper metal i say. but for the price i guess its okay, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Ordered this tweezers and only received 1 waste of money and time so only time will tell if I ever get the 2nd one</li>
</ol>
