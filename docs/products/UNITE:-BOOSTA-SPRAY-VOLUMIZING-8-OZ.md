    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I feel like it weighs my hair down.  I like the blow and set lotion much better!</li>
    <li> I only use this spray to sort of &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my hair after using putty to style it, and it works great. It holds, while leaving some movement. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> This might be a little pricey for some, but if you have flat, fine hair, it&#x27;s a must-have. I worked in salon for a few years and this was one of their go-to products for volume. It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, doesn&#x27;t cause build up. I use this daily. Shake your hair out, spritz 2-3 times close to your scalp, rub into roots, and blow-dry. Activated through heat, make sure you blow-dry!</li>
    <li> It was nothing special. Worked about the same as less expensive drugstore volumizers. Left hair dry and brittle feeling and a little difficult to style.</li>
    <li> I spray this in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and then blow dry it. When done, I have nice volume. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Used this for years...love it! I have fine/limp hair and this product really adds volume.</li>
    <li> I love the Unite product line. I use the Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner for my wavy/frizzy hair and it works wonders!! My hair has a lot of body on its own, but I like to use the Boosta Spray to add a little volume to my roots. I like how it is not sticky or gritty, like other products. My hair is still smooth where I spray it, you can still run your fingers through it, it just gives the roots a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve love this product, wonderful product to use on clean hair.  This is my third bottle and it won&#x27;t be my last one.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, well worth the money.  I went to a salon and got 10 inches of my hair cut off to donate.  The stylist recommended this product for volume and it&#x27;s awesome.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It keeps my hair where it should be plus I can sleep all night without it falling the next day.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Like coconut. Works awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Who knew that you could get volume out of a spray bottle!!! Only down side is them smell. 😁</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I can&#x27;t live without it. So happy I discovered it!</li>
    <li> I finally found something that gives my thin hair volume!!!!! Love it!  Only suggestion, make it smell better.  It currently smells like glass cleaner~  :p&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--- I purchased this in March of this year and paid 23.00. This product now costs 49.00!  Are u kidding me?! A 26 dollar increase in under a year!!!  GREED is what I think!  Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Love it and it smells divine</li>
    <li> Awesome hair product.  My fine flyaway hair is full and behaving since using this product. Arrived very quickly after order was placed</li>
    <li> Great spray - gives some body without being too heavy.</li>
    <li> Perfection, i use it everyday and more!!  It works perfect on my hair, long or short.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for two years.&lt;br /&gt;Meets my expections.&lt;br /&gt;I love all UNITE products.</li>

    <li> fine voluminizing spray</li>
    <li> Went to beauty shop on vacation in January and was introduced to this product.My hair is short and upon waking up in morning it is smashed down. Now I don&#x27;t have to wash and fix daily I just spray and arrange.  The most I do when it is really a mess is spray and use the hair dryer.  I can go for at least 4 days and my hair looks great!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this spray gives great volume and the coconut scent is delicious. It&#x27;s great when I use the other Unite products with it.</li>
    <li> A salon in Colorado used ths on my hair for the first time. I love it. Unfortunately, there is not a salon where I live that carries this product. Im glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine naturally curly hair. I try not to wash it more than 3 times weekly. On the 1st day of use my hair looked great. The next morning it looked and felt so greasy, I had to wash it. I use it for special occasions only due to that fact.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, although there is quite a bit of it, so it tends to lay flat no matter what I do.  lately I am wearing more layers in an attempt to get it to do something!  My hair is short, but not real short, and the spray is great for boosting the style up to make things more bouncy and dimensional. The fragrance is light and for me seems sort of like coconuts.  I have gotten some positive feedback on the style since I&#x27;ve been using the Boosta so I guess that means it&#x27;s working.</li>
