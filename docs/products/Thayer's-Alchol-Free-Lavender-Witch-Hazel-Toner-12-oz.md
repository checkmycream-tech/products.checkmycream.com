<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this to use as a toner, it&#x27;s  refreshing and scent is very light.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used Witch Hazel for many things. I&#x27;ve noticed how many products actually use Witch Hazel as an ingredient.  I needed a good facial skin toner that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive freckled fair skin.  So many products are harsh on my skin, burning off layers and creating redness. I have tried every expensive commercial product you can imagine. Most cause reactions or are just too expensive to afford monthly.  This product is awesome!  It has no alcohol, smells of lavender, reduces redness, is gentle and helps with pores(all round).  I use it twice a day and purchased the multipack to save money. With a cotton pad it removes all the excess oil of my T area with no side effects.  Even if I just use it in the middle of the day to get the oil off.  This product will serve me well for many years, and is affordable.  Now I know why my grandmother used Witch Hazel for so many issues.  Smart lady who understood that its the simple things that seem to work best.</li>
    <li> We are using this as baby wipe solution, with a drop of tea tree oil added.  Works great and seems to prevent diaper rash.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product for years, and find it hard to get in the store, so once again Amazon to the rescue!  You will love this...your skin will love it.  Oh, and guys can use it, too, because it really doesn&#x27;t SMELL like Lavender!</li>
    <li> I had tried this product at a friends and wanted to get some for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I had absolutely no luck at several stores finding any alcohol-free Witch Hazel. (most are 14% alcohol) So, I ordered the three pack though Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day after I shower.  It&#x27;s great for clearing up stubborn blemishes(acne). I recently used liberal amounts on my sunburned legs to ease the discomfort.  I also use it as an aftershave.  I would really recommend this to friends with any skin problems.  I might even give one of my bottles to a close friend, now that I know where to get a ready supply!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Love the fact it is natural and a company with a long history. I used this to make a concoction for my black labs ear problems and it worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> The labeling is deceptive. The &amp;#34;natural lavender&amp;#34; is just the flavor of artificial lavender. My wife is chemically sensitive and i bought this thinking it was all natural. It is not. How ridiculous to have real lavender so far down on the ingredients list and fake lavender as the 4th.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I have used this since I was sixteen and it has been great for even skin tone.  Wonderful product with natural ingredients that is safe and non-toxic.</li>
    <li> Lovely, relaxing scent for nervous electrolysis clients.</li>
    <li> I tried this toner and used it for a couple of weeks. This next list of pros and cons are just my opinions and telling you my experiences. Everyone is different, but this didn&#x27;t work very well for me at all and I was really hoping it would do wonders...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Refreshes the skin&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Broke me out terribly. Probably the worst break out I&#x27;ve ever had. DEFINITELY don&#x27;t recommend to people with acne prone skin!&lt;br /&gt;Enlarged my pores&lt;br /&gt;Made my cheeks turn blotchy and red&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically the initial application is great. I loved the smell and it was very refreshing, but it just didn&#x27;t work well for me in the long run, and in fact made my skin worse than it was to begin with. Like I said, just my experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month now, and although it hasn&#x27;t worked miracles it really has improved my skin. My skin used to be blotchy and with some blemishes and acne. Now, most of the blotchiness is gone and some of my blemishes seem less distinct. It has an incredibly strong lavender smell at first, but it quickly wears off so its not really a problem.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and have used it for years.  Unfortunately the price has gone up quite a bit in the past couple of years locally so I was pleased to find this 3-pack at a reasonable price.  My only complaint was that I ordered the lavender but received the rose scent, I really prefer the lavender but the rose is alright too.</li>
    <li> Love this as a toner....perfect for sensitive skin and smells amazing :)</li>
    <li> Just a refreshing feel after a fresh washed face or long hot shower or nice close shave (men for the mug/ladies for the legs). The fragrance is subdued so men have no fear of smelling of lavender but certain women have a very sharp sense of smell and will tend to notice in a very positive way. Also soothing for nasty abrasion/sunburn/ scratches, etc. I have been using this brand for the past 5 years or so and they have various other fragrances. Quality brand.</li>
    <li> This is the only toner I use, and when I run out and don&#x27;t use it my skin shows it.  Good value at Amazon, much more reasonable than at the box store I used to buy from.</li>
    <li> Ever! And I&#x27;ve used quite a few different ones through out the course of my young life so far. Never found one as great as this and at such an amazing value. I love anything that involves Lavender and wanted to try out an all-natural toner to help control my oily, blemish-prone skin - and Thayer&#x27;s most certainly delivered. The Lavender and Witch Hazel scent is so pleasant and soothing, and since it&#x27;s alcohol-free it&#x27;s not harsh and won&#x27;t dry out your skin. It really tightens my pores and refreshes my skin after a long day out in the hot and humid south Florida weather. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and I actually believe it&#x27;s helped my skin. I gave a bottle to my boyfriend since he had previously been using only pure rubbing alcohol as after-shave (which is REALLY bad for your skin, gentlemen.) and he loves it. Very happy customer :)</li>
    <li> I love this scent- its not too strong and not to light. Just right. I keep repurchasing this and the Rose scent over and over and over again. Feels very refreshing on the skin. I also tried the lemon one- it was great too- however scent was very overpowering- which I liked... but some might not.</li>
    <li> Awesome toner now that I have discovered it I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own baby wipes as well as a facial toner. I feel very clean after using it on my face. As a baby wipe I mix it with water, tea tree oil, and coconut oil and have noticed no sign of irritation while using it and the area is naturally disinfected - always a plus!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how people are complaining about packaging. They have a seal on the inside you have to peel off after unscrewing the cap, and also a plastic wrap around the cap. It smells wonderful and automatically feels great after it&#x27;s applied. TWO thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Started using this as an aftershave a couple of years ago. Feel better using this natural toner than those products that are more alcohol-based. My wife doesn&#x27;t even notice the lavender scent. I have a heavy beard and fairly sensitive skin. I used to have problems finding something that really worked for me, until I started using this.</li>
    <li> This is a good light weight toner - smells great and works well.  It&#x27;s a great buy from Amazon; one bottle out of GNC cost over $10.  With this pack you get three of the same size for $23.</li>
    <li> The only toner I will ever use. Great for your skin, no alcohol to dry you out and a lovely scent. I add it to my DIY mixtures with essential oils and love it!!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin that also happens to be a giant magnet for dirt and oil. My skin care routine is pretty extensive but this is honestly my favorite part. I can trust this toner to finish the job my cleanser can&#x27;t ever seem to do while not drying out my skin. The scent is so light I never notice it except for when I&#x27;m applying it to my cotton ball or washcloth. It never bothers my skin. If you have sensitive skin and need to ensure it&#x27;s clean, look no further!</li>
    <li> I used to use the 14% alcohol version but the alcohol free feels gentler, my skin feel fresh and soothed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Rose Petal and the Lavender Witch Hazel and I truly like them both. Neither scent is overpowering in its smell/aroma - which is really great if you&#x27;re needing to use this on your face. Thayers Witch Hazel formula is so kind to my sensitive skin - and scalp. I have such extreme sensitivities with my skin and scalp - everything seems to affect them - even changes in tap water (&#x27;soft water&#x27; or no) that isn&#x27;t filtered. I have been using Thayers for at least 5 years now, for my face and body. Then, one day, not long ago, just for the heck of it, I massaged a liberal amount of Witch Hazel onto my scalp and within a few minutes I felt measurable relief. By the next morning my scalp felt &#x27;normal&#x27;. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, this isn&#x27;t a &#x27;cure-all&#x27;, but, for me, I find that it does help &#x27;soothe&#x27; irritated and/or inflamed sensitive skin. Please bear in mind if you&#x27;re considering whether to try this Witch Hazel formula, what works well for my sensitive skin, may not do the trick for you. But, fwiw, it might be a reasonable &#x27;bet&#x27; to try it if you&#x27;re plagued by &#x27;suffering skin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I use Thayers after cleaning my face with makeup remover and love the way my skin feels after using this product.  I am confident my skin is clean and ready to apply moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I ordered a pack of three of this product, and I don&#x27;t regret it one bit.  It cleanses and soothes the skin&lt;br /&gt;like nothing else I have tried.  No burning at all.  It comes in different scents or none at all, but my&lt;br /&gt;favorite is the lavender.  Go out and get some and see for yourself how great this product is.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the way it makes my face feel - also supplies the proper ph levels.  It is fragrant but not overpowering. Much better than regular witch hazel.</li>
    <li> Great product. I continue to use it despite its steep price. It&#x27;s a great cleanser and very mild astringent. Most similar products would dry me out with frequent use. Thayers does not do that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Fragrance is pleasant.  After months of using on face, a difference is noticable.  Great for skin with everyday use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the price difference between plain and this justifies the purchase, but I dislike the smell of witch hazel and, since I use it in my work, I prefer this lavender scented.  Appreciated the slight price break in buying three bottles at one go.</li>
    <li> Ship fast, pack the product well. Lower price and it is good to use. Thanks.!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s part of my daily facial regiment as a toner.  Great scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like the Witch Hazel, it makes my face feel smoother than anything I have used. I gave one bottle to my Lady Friend, and she really likes it. This is a lady who keeps herself very well groomed, and is very particular about anything she uses, if she likes a product, believe you me, it is good.</li>
    <li> This has no alcohol and is better quality than cheaper brands and has Aloe Vera, which the cheaper brands don&#x27;t. Works very well on minor skin irritations</li>
    <li> I cannot get enough of this stuff.  I apply it to my face every morning and evening after I wash my face with my Neutrogena cleanser.  I can&#x27;t believe how much extra makeup this thing picks up even after having washed my face.  I have noticed a huge difference in my oily, acne prone skin and I attribute it to this stuff.  This is a staple in my skin routine now and it probably will be forever and at this price, it won&#x27;t break the bank :)</li>
    <li> I love this alcohol free formula, so gentle on my skin. I will keep ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal also.</li>
    <li> This product is great to use multiple times a day for refreshing the skin. The scent is invigorating and my skin has improved since I began using. I would suggest this product as part of anyone&#x27;s skin care regiment.</li>
    <li> I make my own astringent with this, neem oil and tea tree oil. My oily and acne prone skin LOVES it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it always cleans and moisturizes my skin. I do not use facewash or soap, just this and then a real moisturizer (aveeno stuff). I used to have lots of acne, but using this, good sleep, exercise, and drinking water has changed all of that.</li>
    <li> This is great to clean my face every morning &amp; night without drying my skin! Its better than alcohol!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic.  I bought this for myself, my sis and my Mom.  We all love it and it is now a must have for the 3 of us.  It works great to remove any tiny traces of make-up, oil or grime while making pores small.  It also smells terrific.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  This is a quality, natural product.</li>
    <li> I will finish off what I have because this product does refresh and it does not contain alcohol.  However, it does not smell good.  My husband always prods what product he&#x27;s smelling -- and not in a good way.  I myself don&#x27;t care for it.  Also, it hasn&#x27;t done anything to help clear up my skin or heal the acne I do have.  I know my acne is hormone related since I just had a baby and am nursing, but this still has done nothing to help.  I will not buy this again.  I will go back to using Neutrogena&#x27;s alcohol free toner.  It smells so much better and works just as good as a toner.</li>
    <li> This is great toner. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t sell the Lavender variety at our local store, it&#x27;s our favorite.</li>
    <li> Alcohol free and gentle to the skin, this product is a good value and overall an excellent substitute for many more expensive options.</li>
    <li> I really love Thayers being there is no alcohol I use it all the time. It is very cooling and does not make your skin tight. It has the Lavender scent but is not over powering at all. I use it at my night time routine. Very nice..</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This gentle cleanser works well.  Even my esthetician remarked that my skin was better after a month of using it.  It gets all the leftover debris off my face and neck.  The mild smell smells like a hint of lavender and other stuff but it is so light it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I love this product as an after cleanser toner.  It has a light scent and does a great job removing excess oil but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Very calming.</li>
    <li> I have dermatitis, and though the doctor recommended T-Gel, the smell is unbearable. It would leave tar residue in my hair and leave the scent on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;Someone at my local health foods store recommended this to me. She gave me a free sample to dab on the patches of my scalp that were the most troublesome. After a few applications, they vanished. I admit it was really itchy the first day, but I think that&#x27;s because my scalp might have been healing. Now, however, it&#x27;s as though those patches were never there.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone who has psoriasis or dermatitis to try. Give it a day to work. I hope you see the same results I did.</li>
    <li> I used Thayers witch hazel for many, many, MANY years. It pains me to write this review because I loved this product and bought it religiously for so many years. However, I had some issues with my skin breaking out that I just could not get a handle on -thought it must be a food sensitivity or some other cause. However, when I switched from witch hazel (even alcohol free) to rose water the difference was nothing short of miraculous. So, while witch hazel seems ok for my teenager, it is something that apparently I should have steered clear of (I am in my later 30&#x27;s at this writing!). If you have sensitive skin, please try something other than witch hazel. I was going to give this 1 or 2 stars, but I will leave it at 3 since I am sure this is a very good product as far as witch hazel goes...I think the problem is too many of us think witch hazel is a gentle toner even for sensitive skin, and it may not be, it can cause a lot of irritation that you might never expect. I learned the hard way and wish I&#x27;d figured this out sooner (I was only clued in to this when advised during a rare spa facial to try rose water instead, so glad I switched). Just putting this out there in case it helps somebody else -if you use this and have perfect skin then continue to enjoy, but if not this could be your problem!</li>
    <li> Yum!  buy it - wonderful astringent.</li>
    <li> Love this toner. So light with a very subtle lavender scent. I will order it and keep it in stock all the time!</li>
    <li> very very thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery. I got it the next day I purchased.</li>
    <li> I use this as a facial toner. It&#x27;s gentle and alcohol-free. I really like it. I use it twice/day. When I cleanse in the morning I splash it on afterwards. In the evening when I&#x27;m removing make-up I use it on a cotton ball to remove traces of makeup and to restore the pH of the skin.</li>
    <li> Although it didn&#x27;t work miracles for my skin, it is probably the best toner I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have sensitive skin and this toner is gentle enough not to dry it. The skin feels soft and refreshed, and the smell is very pleasant. I will certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nivea visage toner, which was nice and comfortable. Then I bought a bottle l&#x27;oreal toner. But it was irritating to skin and eyes. So I bought this product online.It works just as good as the Nivea toner. My skin never got too dry since I started to use it. It is more fragrant than the other toners I used. My boyfriend complainted about the strong smell of lavender, but I feel it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Simply put, I use this every time I shave my bikini line to help prevent razor burn and it works like a dream. Keeps my skin clean and smooth and it even carries a faint (yet lovely!) lavender scent.</li>
    <li> very good,when i used it,i feel very comford,it is a good production for me,i will buy it again for my friends</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful and refreshing, multi purpose witch hazel I&#x27;ve ever used. The 3 pack here is a great deal. It is wonderful for all kinds of uses, from skin toner, to personal wash, to putting on scrapes and burns. It also smells heavenly, but not in any way overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great scent and it leaves my skin feeling and smelling wonderful!  Definitely recommend to anyone! I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all!</li>
    <li> On top of being a great toner, no matter how well I wash my face, this witch hazel will still take off any remaining makeup I have left on.  I usually don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender, but this smells soooo nice.  I love buying the pack of 3 here on amazon because the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This product is a part of my every day routine. I don&#x27;t use many beauty products religiously but I could not live without this. I only buy it in 3&#x27;s. The lavender smell is just right, not to strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many types of toner. Expensive ones to drugstore brands and I always come back to this toner because it&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol. It gets rid of the dirt, oil, and makeup residue left on the face. I would definitely recommend this product. Plus it&#x27;s cheap and last a really long time!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Cleans and tones.  The 3-pack is a good $$ deal and relieves me of any anxiety about needing to order my next bottle for several months.  They arrived promptly and sensibly packaged.  I&#x27;ll buy them again from the same seller when needed.</li>
    <li> It is definitely one of my best loved toners. I have tried a lot of those highly priced cosmetic Big Names...and found this one to be comparable with those I spend $60+/bottle on. Skin feels really smooth and relaxed. It is free of parabens and toxic chemicals. And the size is good enough for generous uses every day. I highly recommend it to those with combination skins. A plus: the scent is very nice as I am a lavender fan. It is not so overwhelming as well.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my face, gives it a clean refreshed feeling and a new sense of clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice smelling but also, unlike the witch hazel you buy at the drugstore usually has alcohol in it and this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> i suffer from dry skin and scalp in the winter time which makes wet shaving a chore. after a good shave i&#x27;ll splash this on my face and even run it thru my hair to rehydrate and tone my skin. it has a very pleasant smell to it and i got a great deal when they sell a pack of 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the inscented, and must admit, Witch Hazel has its own scent that although not unpleasant, is not entirely pleasant, either.  The lavender is a soft fragrance and certainly is not overpowering.  I think it suitable for men, that is how subtle it is.  Of course, I mix this with other essential oils, but now use this product for uses without having to add the oils.&lt;br /&gt;  This makes a great &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; on toilet paper...just pour into a small sprtiz bottle.  I ordered this &amp;#34;bidet in a bottle&amp;#34; from a company and paid bucks for it....instead, it is a lot cheaper to use this product and keep refilling the small sprtiz bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a great alcohol-free toner that works really well to remove make-up and cleanse pores after a long day. The scent is very pleasant but subtle. I have used Clinique toner for many, many years, but it contains alcohol and can be drying to the skin. I bought the three-pack of Thayers on Amazon, which made the per-bottle price very reasonable. I gave a bottle to a good friend and she said she loves it as well. I will definitely keep on using this product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and that it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> I find this particular one, without alcohol, to be far better for my skin. Some imperfection around my neck area cleared up or dissappeared entirely after I started to use this product. In addition, the smell is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Kurt Gruensfelder</li>
    <li> This is a great product I use it as an after shave minor cuts, rashes. My wife and daughters  us it as a cleanser/skin care product.</li>
    <li> Great product and exactly what I was needing. Fast ship and receipt!</li>
    <li> This was the best alcohol-free witch hazel option I could find.  My skin tends to err HEAVILY on the very dry side, so I wanted to avoid using alcohol on my face - these were the best priced alcohol-free witch hazel I could find.  I&#x27;ve been using it squired on cotton rounds to wash my face with in the evenings, and it definitely picks up whatever dirt and grime I&#x27;ve managed to accumulate throughout the day, and it helps remove the oil remnants left behind by my eye makeup remover too.  The skin on my face doesn&#x27;t tend to be problem-prone other than dry, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s benefits for other uses, but it&#x27;s been working fine for me!</li>
    <li> Lovely scent.  It works wonders on my face when applied often.  I make sure to keep this in stock!</li>
    <li> Love Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel.  But ordered the Lavender by mistake, not my favorite scent in the world.  It works fine, just wish I had the scent free, alocohol free version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel as toner for about 8 months. I didn&#x27;t see much result so I stopped but realized I should maybe try different brand. I&#x27;ve tried Thayers lemon witch hazel before and could not love it. Made my skin oily. This alcohol free lavender witch hazel calms my skin and is very light. Many that don&#x27;t see result right away shouldn&#x27;t give up. Use it for few months and see the slow changes. Nothing makes your skin better over night. This is now my staple to my skin care. I also use it in footsoak along with different essential oil. I don&#x27;t love the fake lavender smell but it goes away in seconds.</li>
    <li> So far this works wonders on my psoriasis mixed with glycerine it&#x27;s gentle on the cuts I made from the scratching on my scalp didn&#x27;t really have any smell and usually I would start to see scaling on my scalp after a few days of washing my hair but so far nothing so I am optimistic. I might not use it in my face though because it makes my face very oily</li>
    <li> Tried it on sensitive skin and it completely moisturized it. Of course it took a couple weeks of continual use to see the difference.</li>
    <li> I generally do not like lavender-scented products as they are overpowering,but I LOVE this stuff! It smells wonderful and feels so nice on my skin.  I will buy it again and again,and I want to try the other scents as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toner. It&#x27;s gentle enough for my super sensitive skin and smells fabulous. I use it morning and night without any issues of over drying. I have oily T zone skin and tend to break out mostly on my cheeks and near my eyebrows. This really helps to keep my skin calm and soothed.</li>
    <li> Stared a new skin care regime. This was actually suggested by my son and it is great. I recommend it .</li>
    <li> This toner has a nice, understated scent and works nicely.</li>
    <li> I use Thayers lavender witch hazel not only as a toner after washing my face, but it&#x27;s also great as a light non-stinging antiseptic.</li>
    <li> Like it ok.  Still prefer</li>
    <li> Love this for my rosacea, breakout prone skin.</li>
    <li> I use this for my mask,work good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Thayers for years...liked it very much, and then with this last reorder I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;issues.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed my order for three (3) bottles of Thayers, and upon using the first one opened, and after two, three shaves I was getting a weird breakdown on my skin that I&#x27;ve not had before. Same shave foam, same shaver/blades, only difference was this new bottle of Thayers I&#x27;d opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my MD&#x27;s and he had me skip anything on my face after shaving for a full week, gave me some 2% Hydrocortisone cream to put onto the area of skin breakdown. It cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week I went back to using the 2nd bottle of the three Thayers I purchased, (tossed out the 1st bottle), and after the second or third day, my skin started up again. Itching, burning, looking like a 14 hear old kid with acne...same location as before. I stopped the 2nd bottle of Thayers, waited a week, and opened and used from the 3rd bottle.  Same thing.  Thayers is now out of the house, never to be used again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what they changed in their product mixture, but it&#x27;s not working for me anymore.</li>
    <li> This product is good but you I prefer the much cheaper TN Dickinsons Witch Hazel from walmart. When I bought this 3 pack it was for $19, now it is much more expensive. Try TN&#x27;s witch hazel, it does smell bad though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!  I use it all over my body and my skin continues to get more and more amazing looking.  Such a healthy radiant glow.  It&#x27;s a light, water consistency product. It is not sticky. The fragrance is soft and subtle and I&#x27;ve never noticed it after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful toner &amp; preshave or aftershave. My husband uses it as a preshave splash. I use it as a toner. Smells nice, and not too strong to irritate my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Yes I love Thayer but I love the price the most. It&#x27;s completely natural with no alcohol.</li>
