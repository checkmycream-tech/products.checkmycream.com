<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the way it straightens my roots. I carry it around for a quick touch-up</li>
    <li> Should have heeded the reviews.  Plates did not meet and set up for return, but next day the goofy thing would not even turn on.</li>
    <li> Does not heat up. Money wasted :-(</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the BEST hair straighteners/flat irons i have ever used for my hair and edges. I have type 3c, 4a, and 4b hair and it gets my kinky/curly edges and side bangs silky straight and my ends do not look fried. This is the perfect flat iron if youre trying to blend your natural hair and or edges with your weaves or extentions. Laila did a great job on this flat iron.</li>
    <li> This Styler is excellent for my daughters 4B hair. After blowing, this Iron straightened my daughters hair with no issues. The price is amazing...I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These flat irons are awesome, I have short hair and they warm up instantly and really give life to my hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, but be careful. The outside of the wands gets as hot as the inside.</li>
    <li> I honestly was kind of bummed out by this straightener.  I do not have hard-to-work-with hair by any means, and only got this to straighten by bangs everyday (I have curly greek hair). It just doesn&#x27;t get my bangs straight, and when I try to bump up the heat, I feel like it&#x27;s damaging to my hair.  Just not for me I guess.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and gets close to the roots. It was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars I totally would. It came pretty quickly which was nice but when I opened the box I had not return shipping or any paperwork, just the device. I take it out to look at it and I try to close it and there is a gap in between the rods. I know for a fact that&#x27;s gonna be a problem but I try it out anyways. I go to use it and you have to squeeze it so tight to get the plates to tought your pulling your hair out and that s*** hurts. Never used it again. Lost $20 because I can&#x27;t return it. Even called the company that made it because it is defective and they said they will get back to me. Will never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron has many great aspects such as the width; it makes pressing your roots easy. Additionally, it gets very hot quite quickly. Unfortunately, the plates are not conducive for a smooth styling experience, meaning, it gets the hair flat, but not smooth. Most flatirons (i.e. solia) press and smooth the entire hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use this product for the purpose of flattening your roots and not the entire shaft. Plates like these burn hair quicker than your average, slightly high-priced iron.</li>
    <li> It works good just wish the edges were rounded</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Indian guy, with medium-short thick wavy-curly hair. I have been using this straightener since 1 year. I love this. It straightens my hair without burning it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;For Frizz free straight shiny hair&lt;br /&gt;lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to  use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;i hear a buzzing noise when i turn it on, didn&#x27;t care to return it.&lt;br /&gt;length of the cable is kinda short.&lt;br /&gt;The projection between the ceramic tile and led light always plucks my a hair, when i try to iron :&#x27;( :P&lt;br /&gt;This is a highly recommended product :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural and my roots sometime become a little resistant to my normal flat iron and will not straighten as I would like.  Laila Ali &#x27; s product did the job. Easy to use and heat temp safe for my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. Good quality! It works great on my short hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice flat irons for the price. I have short hair &amp; it provides a nice shiny finish on hair.</li>
    <li> Good product holds the heat, great price, shipping on time.</li>
    <li> GREAT iron, really good to for edges and keeping your roots flat! Super cute color. Just what I was looking for. Gets VERY HOT but only has one setting for heat which has worked great for my very thick coily hair once blow dried.</li>
    <li> My roots are very uncontrollable, so I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different things and this is the only one that would work. With other products I had to use multiple times a week, with this one; I use it once a week or once every two weeks.</li>
    <li> Did not get hot as expected. Highest temp feels like 300-330. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just as expected..flat iron gets really hot, so test out to make sure you use proper settings.</li>
    <li> This gets pretty hot but I must admit I expected it to be smaller when I received it. Ive had mini flat irons but length wise this is more like a regular flat iron. I am a licensed stylist of nearly 20 years so I know how to use a flat iron but this one feels kind of bulky in the handle. Doesn&#x27;t grip evenly every time but it will do for home use.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice little tool, so easy to use and so effective. My hair is wavy for the most part and curly in other areas so it&#x27;s hard to straighten up. This product does what it says and my hair looks like I just got out of the salon. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering items from Amazon over seven years and I&#x27;ve never written a review...but this product was one that I had to write about.  I&#x27;ve used many different flat irons some that have cost me over $150....and this is the BEST, the absolute BEST flat iron that I have ever used.  My hair is about a 1/2 inch in the back and I&#x27;ve never been able to find the perfect flat irons to curl my hair.  This is truly a good day.  Thanks Laila...love it!  I know want to try the rest of your hair care products.</li>
    <li> heats up fast and works great.  i love it. i take it to the gym everyday.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I am transitioning to natural. Does a great job straightening my roots! However It doesn&#x27;t straighten the rest of my hair as well</li>
    <li> This little flat iron is excellent. I never thought I would find one that could straighten out all the stray small hairs at the nape of my neck or at the front of my hair line that are extra curly and hard to get straight with a regular flat iron or blow dryer. I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who has struggled with the type of hair problems I&#x27;ve mentioned. This product is a God send. I&#x27;m soo happy I found it and I&#x27;m recommending to all my female friends who straighten their hair out.</li>
    <li> Good product. Cool edge keeps you from burning your skin. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> This does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Gets super hot and I&#x27;m able to get all those hard to reach places. I wish and would prefer the cord to be longer. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice flat iron that does the trick, especially for short thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Hair gets stuck/ very hard to smooth along the hair shaft.... Therefore it makes dents in the hair. Bought this iron to curl my short hair and it&#x27;s literally impossible. The plates don&#x27;t even touch each other correctly except at the very top of the iron. So disappointed to waste money on this product. It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This was a must have for me when transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. It makes my hair look like I just got a touch up. I have used it on my friends with courser hair than mine and it works just as good. I love this.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Love love this flat iron it gets really close to the roots and straightens the hair. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Heat settings are great for relaxed hair but the purpose of me buying this was for the smaller plates. They are a perfect size but the casing is so bulky it&#x27;s hard to straighten or curl my short pixie style. I don&#x27;t use it because I found the perfect one at Ulta that works perfectly for the pixie styles.</li>
    <li> Since it was so cheap I won&#x27;t complain too much but like the other reviewers posted the plates don&#x27;t close down completely. It&#x27;s okay for what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Great at straightening your edges and roots for natural or relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> Works Great.. gets super hot</li>
    <li> What was I expecting for such a low price? It&#x27;s not horrible. It gets hot, but the plates do not meet completely, and it pulls hairs frequently.</li>
    <li> Did a very good job straightening my daughters roots.</li>
    <li> I really love the design of this iron. It lets you get right to the scalp for straightening and it curls flawlessly. It also has easy heat settings that can adjust for what you are wanting to do. I definitely recommend buying one.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t many small irons with adjustable temperature, I love this one</li>
    <li> Gets close to the scalp which is a plus.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is perfect for natural  hair ,it doesn&#x27;t take long to warm up and it&#x27;s easy to handle . I would definitely buy more Laila Ali products, this is a grat product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a great little curling iron, the only thing is that you need to hold it closed as you iron to get good tension, but I believe that is common with the 1/2&amp;#34; irons.What I like is that I can get to the roots of my long hair, doing that with a 11/2 &amp;#34; is tricky, so I use it to do my roots then the 1 1/2&amp;#34; to handle the rest. Good purchase at a good price.</li>
    <li> Same deal, wife wanted a 1/2 flatiron for shorter hair, I ordered this for her and she likes it very much, right size with temperature controls. She is happy and uses it daily.</li>
    <li> The settings are wonderful. low heat works excellent. This product works well on real or synthetic hair. I also love that it&#x27;s purple</li>
    <li> a little bigger than i hoped for but it does work pretty good. it gets close to the roots and i love the fact that you can adjust the heat setting,</li>
    <li> it reaches directly to the root of the hair</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed in this item.&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult to get the &amp;#34;close to scalp&amp;#34; hair - disappointing as this was the hair it was advertised to take care of.&lt;br /&gt;The item was inexpensive, but I would not recommend it as regular straight irons work as well or better on the short hairs.</li>
    <li> Larger than expected, but love the product.  Really does a great job of getting to the roots as claimed.  Great for straightening new growth course hair without too much heat.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, returning, cheap, cheap.</li>
    <li> I love this root styler because I can flat iron my new growth without worrying about burning my scalp. Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent heat,  ideal for straightening roots in ethnic hair but the ridges make curling slightly challenging</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my main flat iron, but it&#x27;s handy for very short hair or for getting close to the scalp. For the money, it&#x27;s worth having an iron for the few times that I need it.</li>
    <li> Laila Ali LAST2601 Ceramic Root Styler, Black and Purple 1/2 inch plates: Looks just like picture and was easy to use. The flat Iron can be set all the way up to 450 degrees. It has a 30 second heat up and a two year limited warranty. It has a dial to turn up the temperature inside the handle and a turn on and off switch.  The temperatures settings are as follows:  Low 1-5 (Delicate, thin hair),  Medium 6-10 (Average to thick or treated hair), High 11-15 (Thick or Wavy hair) and Max 16-20 (Hard to straighten hair). Please be aware there isn&#x27;t an automatic shut off, so please unplug after each use. Keep out of reach of children and pets.</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse hair and my hair is styled in a pixie cut, because my hair grows so fast my relaxers in the back part of my hair don&#x27;t last as long due to the growth. In between touch ups I needed a smaller iron to get the shorter hair in the back and to straighten from root to tip. My hair turns curly as it grown out and this iron grabbed every piece and straightened the hair so well, I used this iron with a heat protectant and my hair is always so shiny and health looking after I use this iron. The iron manuevers well with any length but I was impressed at how it works with the shorter hair and gets that root straight and curling is easy as well. Great product at a great price point.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the item. It seems well made and so far works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just ok. Good price. Gets hot but doesn&#x27;t straighten that well.</li>
    <li> Nice root straightener but didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t have the little combs.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist.  This item does not do what I was hoping it would.  I am going to try and return and purchase something else.  It actually is too bulky and square.  It doesn&#x27;t curl in the way I was hoping.</li>
    <li> These small flat irons are great. I purchased these to replace my old flat irons I purchased  from Kmart which burned my fingertips on every use.  So happy I made the decision to buy these.</li>
    <li> i have thick natural hair and this worked great! wish it was a little bigger</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;m African American with natural hair, but I love the straight look. I just don&#x27;t love the chemicals. This gets very close to the root and has different heat settings. Absolutely awesome product! I can get Salon straight hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but after a couple of uses the coating seems to wear off and the plates stopped gliding smoothly. It didn&#x27;t get my new growth as straight as I thought it considering that it was so close to my roots.</li>
    <li> Gets professionally hot, works well and does the job.  Easy to use and get close to roots. Heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I am an african american female with natural(no relaxer) hair and this worked well with my hair...gets super hot......i love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she really likes it. It heats up fast and the heat is adjustable and is consistent for your chosen setting.</li>
    <li> It does everything in claims.  The formation of the plates allow you to get right to the root with smooth results.  It&#x27;s one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve tried and I love it.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and it is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had decided to go natural and I needed a product to keep my roots straight.  This product worked great and the ceramic iron is great for my hair!</li>
    <li> At last a mini iron with a dial control for heat....works perfect on my short pixie cut.</li>
    <li> This is the best. I love this flat iron. It gets my hair bone straight. I will be buying the 1&amp;#34; flat iron soon.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Gets all my small hair in the back and around ears. It also gets extremely hot.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> Liked this product so much that I purchased a second one for a friend.</li>
    <li> It gets hot, but is still at the low end of styling tools. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. We tried several other brands. This was the best.  Love the ability to control heat settings. Works great!</li>
    <li> it gets my roots perfectly. i love it.</li>
    <li> I use my flat iron for straigtening and curling. This product works great for flattening. All the claims in the description are true. The drawback for me was the size of the housing around the plates. It is 1&amp;#34; thick making it too bulky for small curls.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a really good flat iron. I have 3 other flat irons in the 50-60 price range that I don&#x27;t like as much as this one.  I have very very thick hard to strighten AA hair and I am able to straighten without using thr highest setting.  My hair comes out silky and no heat damage. As advertised the design really allows you to get the roots.The only small thing, not  enough to lower the star rating, is the ridges on the iron. If not carful these can snag your hair so with this iron I don&#x27;t suggest a fast jub because you really have to make sure you are parting your hair. Overall I love it and have recommended to family</li>
    <li> This flat iron grips the hair on your roots. I am an African American &amp; I say it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FLAT IRON BUT I PAIDED $18 FOR MINE WHICH WAS BACK IN JULY NOW IT&#x27;S AT A HIGHER PRICE I WAS HESITANT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE BUT I NEEDED A SMALLER FLAT IRON SINCE I WENT NATURAL I NEEDED SOMETHING TO GET REALLY CLOSE TO MY SCALP IT HEATS FAST HOLDS TEMPERATURE IT&#x27;S SO GOOD FOR NATURAL HAIR IT&#x27;S COMES CLOSE TO MY AMIKA THAT I PAID $100 FOR.FOR ALL MY NATURAL SISTAS IT&#x27;S A MUST BUT AMAZON SNEAKS UP PRICES</li>
    <li> This is wonderful machine! I am now trying to get the hang of how it works. I have seen lots of family members use it and I know I will get a kick using it also. Thank You for having so many great items to make my life easier.</li>
    <li> Great transaction! Nice product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair in a short Monica/Rihanna hairstyle and needed a styler that would straighten my hair at the root and this baby did the trick. I love it and have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
    <li> Her hair products as far as flat irons are so great, I love how it takes my hair from frizzy to bone straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this Root Styler to use when I do my keratin hair treatments. More specifically I bought this product to help with my coarse roots and edges smooth in between relaxing. I give this flat iron a 4 star rating because it does get very hot and did work well to tame my edges and roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave the four star rating is because this product should be redesigned to include teeth for combing as you flat iron as well as thinner, flatter arms so for a closer, optimal root straightening. Other than that this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! I like that it is small and therefore able to get close to my roots. I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer since June 2014 so I need a tool that can get down to my roots. I am very satisfied with this one by Laila. I will definitely try some of her other hair tools after having such a great experience with this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not what I experted.</li>
    <li> I like it heat up good</li>
    <li> It was extremely easy to order and I needed it for a trip that I was leaving for in 3 days. Since I am an Amazon Prime member this item had the 2 day delivery option. It arrived promptly in 2 days, even on a Sunday! I was very pleased with the service I received. The product itself is not the quality I was expecting however. It does work just fine, thus the 4 stars, but it is all plastic construction. Therefore I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as my prior straightener.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a few flat irons and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s black and purple......nough&#x27; said! ^_^ Both of my favorite colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African American with thick natural 3A/4C hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautifully package and well made. Nothing cheap about this. It&#x27;s very light weight and easy to hold. Simple heat dial and easy on off switch. This flat iron heats up in SECONDS. It doesn&#x27;t have an auto off switch, but that would be another great and needed feature. Especially for those with children and also those who forget to shut off the iron. It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and it gets right to the root like it is described. Leaves the hair smooth, soft and shiny. Laila Ali did and excellent job with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Gets hot fast. I have micro bangs and this works great to give them a sleek uniform look.</li>
    <li> Not bad flat iron from Laila Ali I just wish it was a bit longer where the iron part is. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice iron for the hair.  Different speeds low, med &amp; high I thought it would have the numbers no just speeds.</li>
    <li> You can get close to the roots to straigthen your hair, there are 3 temperature levels for you hair type.</li>
    <li> There was nothing wrong with the product. It just was not what I wanted so I returned it. Laila Ali paid return postage and credited my charge card before I even had a chance to return the item.</li>
    <li> This product had a defect.  It kept cutting off, but it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic cut off feature.  It would not stay on long enough to flat iron my hair.</li>
    <li> This is great it really does get to the roots and I only use two passes to get my hair straight. I have 4b african american hair and it is fine in terms of thickness</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have to take mine back to Walmart because the heat settings doesn&#x27;t change, but as far as the flat iron goes, its one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever used on my natural hair. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> Its ok i have to get use to them</li>
    <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural and this flat iron has made the process undetectable.  In the past I had used hot combs to straighten my roots but they did too much damage and left my roots standing in an awkward position that would not lay down.  Had I only known about this root straightener sooner, I would have transitioned years ago.  Hair is smooth, shiny, with no breakage thanks to the ceramic plates.  (The only thing that I notice is that it makes my bathroom lights flicker.  That has never happened before so I hope it doesn&#x27;t mean that a fuse is about to blow.)  Nonetheless, it is nothing short of hair styling miracle!</li>
