<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell great, works well with small amounts.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil. Just got my second bottle. The first lasted about two YEARS! I use this on my hair everyday, and the beauty of it is that there is no build up. I haven&#x27;t used it as a treatment just as a way to keep my hair moisturized.  It penetrates the hair in just a few seconds and a little goes a long way! It immediately changes my hair&#x27;s texture from dry to silky without the greasy feel of pomades.  Try this! You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Still getting use to this product, but anything crème of nature produces is great, and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I used the sample and its good. Adds more slip and will seal cuticle from frizz. I sleep on my hair and its still very smooth. Like it and will purchase it.</li>
    <li> i love this oil  I use it on  my natural hair after blow drying it and on my brizillian weave</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it after I wash my hair and it makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Bought this in 2014 in a beauty supply store and was totally surprised how it changed the texture of my natural black hair.  I recommend that everyone who needs better texture and fewer tangles try this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair was dry. This oil is rich and strengthens my hair against breakage, not to forget it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Works good. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair all the time! So I&#x27;ve received a free sample of this product, and i absolutely loved it! You use a quarter size amount in your palm, and rub it into your hair while its damp, or before you use heat to it. Leaving your hair soft, smelling good, and protected. not to mention it does repair old strandy, fried split ended hair. The only reason i gave it a four and not a five star is if you do use too much of it, it leaves your hair oily. So as long as you use it properly and the right amount you&#x27;ll have gorgeous hair all the time. Definitely recommend this product. I couldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my local CVS.  This product ️is wonderful, awesome,and smells heavenly.  I use it after I wash my hair and my hair is sooo soft.  And it has a wonderful glow.  I love it.</li>
    <li> nice hot oil treatment</li>
    <li> This product has a little too much silicone in it for use in my 4c natural hair to be used as a hot oil treatment product. It also has a trace of argan oil scent which I don&#x27;t care for. I think this oil would work best for relaxed hair as a protectant before heat treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/13/13 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;My original review of this product in September only gave 3 stars because of the amount of silicones it contains, which in my opinion couldn&#x27;t be used for a proper oil treatment. Now we all know that silicone just sits on the surface of your hair and doesn&#x27;t allow for the penetration of nutrients or emollients and needs to washed away before applying any other product to your hair. There are great benefits of silicone such as immense shine, smoothness, taming of frizz and protection from sun and heat treatments. But I found a great use for this product in MY hair. I now use it as a moisture sealant for my overnight pre-poo treatment. I moisten my hair with water, apply my natural oils then seal with the oil treatment. I put on my plastic cap and bonnet and go to bed. The next day I shampoo and deep condition and my hair comes out beautifully amazing! I still feel it has a LOT of silicones in it but I just figured out the best way to use this product on MY hair. The scent of this product is the strongest in the line but I can deal with it. All the products have the same exact scent. I have since tried a few other CON products and they work pretty well. The Smooth Edges and Moisture and Shine Shampoo are \\&quot;da bomb\\&quot;!  The only items in this line I don&#x27;t plan on using are the Perfect 7 Leave-in because I make my own leave-in and the Intensive Conditioning Treatment because I currently use a FABULOUS protein deep conditioner. I could see using this entire product line for my hair in the future if I decide to make a change. SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO RE-VISIT A PRODUCT AND GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE!</li>
    <li> A great alternative to the Moroccan oil that they sells in the salons only and much cheaper. Would purchase again and has a similar sweet smell to it like the Moroccan oil brand does.</li>
    <li> Very happy I bought this stuff.. I had very very dry hair now that I put it on my hair looks so awesome.. Now when I wash my hair I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of conditioner..</li>
    <li> i got this under the impression that i would be getting product shown but instead i got some other branded argan oil. i like the oil that i got so i didnt send it back and it smelled great but i should have been notified or said in description that you may not get what is shown in picture</li>
    <li> This product is liquid gold. Not heavy on your hair, gives you bounce and shine.</li>
    <li> I just love creme of nature argan line products they make my hair feel so soft and silky i use this stuff on wet hair and on day hair just love it make my hair soooooooooo soft</li>
    <li> Received in great condition.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast and I cannot wait to order like 5 more bottles. I love this argan oil it makes my hair feel so soft and moisturized. It smells so good and ugh I could just use it forever. Will buy again for sure!!</li>
    <li> This oil feels very oily when you apply it to your hair but it soaks in so fast and your hair never feels greasy, it just feels so soft. I apply it to wet or dry hair. This is one of the best hair products I have ever come across. The only thing I would change, is for it to come in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It did not strip the color from my natural hair  and it made it butter soft! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is really good. I used it has a hot oil treatment after shampooing my hair. My hair felt soft and well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at Sally&#x27;s and a couple of Hair Shops here in town. This product is great for detangling and adding moisture to one&#x27;s hair throughout the day. If you have a kid who is a tender head, this is a real saver of weeping and tears.</li>
    <li> Weighed my hair down and made it look entirely too oily with just a few drops after washing.  Had better results with Organix (OGX).</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a while ago and I still haven&#x27;t used half of the bottle. It smells so good and it makes my virgin hair tangle free, shiny, and light weight not to mention I got a few cents cheaper than at my local beauty supply</li>
    <li> Not only the oil is perfect for my type of hair (thick), it also smells great! i am loving it!</li>
    <li> Love this product I just wish there was a bigger size lost 2 stars for that</li>
    <li> I use this product a lot.. This brands smell is very nice, not all argon oil smells good. Plus argon oil is not only for hair.</li>
    <li> Keeping it quick and short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is perfect for right after the shower. I just put it in my hair and instantly you can feel the difference. The great thing about this product is that it works right away. Everyone in my family is using it now. It makes my hair look healthier.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic and keeps my hair shiny and super soft. The fabulous smell lasts all day long!  A must have for naturals.</li>
    <li> I got this oil to use with a flat iron. I have fine, thin, wavy hair that tends to have lots of flyaways. I found that just putting this oil in my hair before leaving in the morning made a huge difference in the appearance of my hair without even having to use the flat iron. I have used it on wet and dry hair and it works great both ways.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product itself is great. It smells good and it makes my hair soft. Giving this review 1 star because when I received this in the mail IT WAS HALF EMPTY! It leaked everywhere in the package but I didn&#x27;t return it because I got it onsale so it would cost more to send it back than I paid for it. I will be buying again, but from a different company.</li>
    <li> i absolutely LOVE this... i have tried the pricier product as well and i can not tell the difference! i just a hair dryer and curling iron on my hair but with this my hair still feels and looks extremely healthy. there is now a shine to my hair that i never thought possible. customer for life!!!</li>
    <li> Works when added to other conditioners...but on its own?? Not on my relaxed hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used Argan Oil for over two years. This product is a little gummy; makes it feel as if I need to wash my hair again right away! Did not find it to be useful!</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time and I love the way it left my hair!! I just used a sample and the results was wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is great for my hair. It gives it that shine and nourishment that it needs. I was having a hard time finding it where I live now. I ended up buying a similar product that would cost me an arm and a leg. Then I got on amazon and found it. The delivery was great, right on time. The price is great too especially for the results it gives your hair. Believe me, I am Puerto rican and Dominican and  have extremely curly and thick full hair, just blow drying and flat iron take about a good three hours. This product keeps my hair looking great for almost a month when I get it done. I will always order it in quantities of 2 or 4. Last forever and is so worth it.</li>
    <li> I started using it few weeks ago and I noticed changes jn my hair.  It makes the hair silky</li>
    <li> Works the same as the miniature bottle of morrocan oil I had bought from a salon for three times the price!</li>
    <li> I love this!  It keeps the freeze down on my Brazilian hair. Looks healthy &amp; ready ;) I haven&#x27;t used it on my natural hair yet but I&#x27;m sure it will do good</li>
    <li> Oh I am so in love with this Creme of Nature Argan Oil Treatment! Imparts softness and sheen to my hair. Also it has a very nice soft fragrance. I think we will be friends for a long time so more than likely I will be making this purchase again.</li>
    <li> i really like this product especially when using heat it leaves your hair shiny and smooth and you don&#x27;t need to use much,it help that it also smells good</li>
    <li> this products make your hair soft, shiny, smells great</li>
    <li> i adore this product. i have a natural 3c and 4a ish hair texture and i use this every night when i twist my hair along with some leave in conditioner and my hair is soooo soft! smells like chocolate and it great for all hair types. i brought some for my mom and she works at a hair cuttery in the city. she loves it too, esp for her customers.</li>
    <li> It smells good...the concentration of the contents was of good quality. The oil treatment made my hair silky..but it wasn&#x27;t that oily to me. It smooths out my ends and conditions my hair, pretty well. I do suggest the sellers have the cap secure with plastic wrapping, instead of masking tape over the cap. Anyway, seems to be of good quality at a decent price.</li>
    <li> There creme of nature argan oil is a good product I love the way it smells. I was amazed at how good it smelled  lite oil. I have seen a little improvement in my nape with the growth. Over all good product go buy it</li>
    <li> I used it but it didn&#x27;t make my hair soft or stop breaking .I saw no results.</li>
    <li> Note: The key is to use as little as possible. I use about a dime size and apply it throughout my hair. I&#x27;ve only used it when I put bantu knots in my hair and when I let my knots out they are so soft! I&#x27;ve also poured a bit of it into my conditioner and it&#x27;s really helped provide a greater slip. I love this product! Wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
    <li> Was not pleased by the way it was received. There was a piece of taper covering the bottle top and there was no seal when bottle was opened, which would make someone feel as if it were tampered with.</li>
    <li> Initially, I got this product as a free sample with my Sulfate Free Shampoo at the beauty supply store. Right before going to work, I put some coconut oil on, Cantu Shae Butter Flat Iron spray (my heat protectant) and then flat ironed my hair. After flat ironing, I put a small dab on my hair - Mostly because it&#x27;s at the end of the small sample size. And I can tell you that a little bit goes a LONG way. My hair is really soft and shinny 7 weeks from my last perm. Normally I can&#x27;t even comb my hair 6 weeks out, but it is soft and shinny like it&#x27;s only 3 weeks out. I want to try this product as a hot oil treatment during my wash days so I brought the regular bottle. You couldn&#x27;t really do that with the sample size. I attached a picture of my hair with the Oil on top and in it&#x27;s regular state on the bottom.</li>
    <li> After bleaching my hair, it was very brittle and dry. I put this on and wrapped up my hair up for the night. The next day I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!!!! My hair was just as soft as it was before I bleached it!!!! I love this product. Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is very dry and the end need all the help they can get this product works wonders</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this from head to toe...I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING I don&#x27;t see how anyone could not like it. It leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and my hair has so much body. I reccomend this product to EVERYONE!
