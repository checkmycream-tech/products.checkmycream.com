      <li>it smells good though, however,</li>
      <li>I did give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does have a very pleasant smell and shipped very quickly.  </li>

      <li>I feel like I had better results just using the pill/liquid and cream!</li>

      <li>I am still wearing my 36A bra but can tell it&#x27;s filling in nicely.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
      <li>work well keep skin nice</li>
      <li>To be honest I wasn&#x27;t expecting results yet</li>
      <li>really?&lt;br /&gt;why are there so many good reviews like it doesnt make</li>
      <li>How could ANYONE charged that kind of money for a soap that does NOT do anything?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this product got so many good amazon reviews.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be doing a bit more good in the growth process.</li>
      <li>I am loving this soap I am ordering two more bars as we speak.</li>
      <li>far I&#x27;m so impressed!!!!</li>
      <li>smells beautiful and works i bit better and feels great on the skin for a bar of soap to do so much it is truly a powerful bar of soap</li>
      <li>more than 6 months,&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the longer you out the suds sit the better it works.</li>
      <li>I can still urinate, but I&#x27;m no longer sure if it&#x27;s from an urethra or</li>
      <li>please, Natureday, can you somehow make the bar a bit more distinctive?</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>but they are spreading out more on the sides and getting somewhat rounder.</li>
      <li>My breasts look fuller and they bounce more when I walk.</li>
      <li>Go to natureday.com for more info too.  </li>
      <li>I like my size better.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more</li>
      <li>best soap i have ever used!no problems i would recommend it to anyone!i will buy more soap in the future!</li>
      <li>I just love this stuff</li>
      <li>I saw more results with the soap and cream</li>
      <li>Anyway I use it until the end, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>There were many days where I forgot to use it.</li>
      <li>Then I use the Natureday breast enlargement cream once in the morning and once at night before bed  - making sure to rub it in thoroughly.</li>
      <li>looking to get a sexy 34 B.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that parts over with for the time being.   </li>
      <li>I have just ordered this product waiting for it to arrive very excited.</li>
      <li>now I fill a 40C. Without saying a word to anyone about what I had been doing, my own boyfriend noticed how full my breasts have been.</li>
      <li>took a shower and while my body still warm applied the soap on first.</li>
      <li>lathered the soap on my breasts with my hands and immediately started having this light burning sensation.</li>
      <li>definitely worth it to feel better about myself and work towards having the breasts I always wanted to be sportin&#x27;.</li>
      <li>My bras fit tighter and seem to overflow.</li>
      <li>but it did make my skin smooth...</li>
      <li>..even the slightest difference will make me smile. :)</li>
      <li>Once I&#x27;m completely finish using this bar who knows there could be good results.</li>
      <li>The experiment is very worth it.</li>
      <li>First the product arrived in a very cheap wrapper.  </li>
      <li>im willing to read it :)   </li>
      <li>After just 3 weeks I have noticed a significant increased in my cup size.</li>
      <li>I tried other creams and oils before but one difference I felt with these products was that my breast feels warm and is staying warm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still taking 3 full droppers of the Natureday liquid &amp; 3 Bust Boom pills a day as well.</li>
      <li>after 6hrs i can feel some tingling (not painful)</li>
      <li>Yes, this soap give you more volume on the breast, not that much, but after you rinse the soap you will feel some itchy around the nipple, even if you avoid the nipple area.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are listed but really it didn&#x27;t as if comes from a reputable seller.  </li>
      <li>and if I like it that much i&#x27;ll write u another review and spread the word. :)</li>
      <li>But to get the full affect you have to keep using it.</li>
      <li>Not bad considering where I started 3 months ago.</li>
      <li>Super stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Truth be told I love it though definitely made things in the bedroom better.</li>
      <li>It seems the most prominent growth is gained over a 2 to 3 yr period for those of us starting  with an A cup.</li>
      <li>You will gain inches over farily quick time , but you will not go from a \\&quot;AA\\&quot; cup bra to a \\&quot;D\\&quot; cup in a month . . .</li>
      <li>I started off doing this nightly but quickly found out that this had a drying effect on my girls and would leave them flaky and sometimes itchy.</li>
      <li>and I see a tremendous difference.</li>
      <li>So I highly recommended this to any ladies:)...</li>
      <li>Personally I highly recommend this product ! ! !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even worth a couple bucks.</li>
      <li>Now, 2 months later, I can honestly say I am still wearing my 36A bra</li>
      <li>After 2 months of use I am truly pleased with the results I have received so far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I been Using There Liquid And Cream And It Works Great,With Great Results..This Soap Works Just Like The other Two...Recommended to Buy..Smells Great Too..</li>
    <li> I order this product on march 23 2012. I received the soap march 26. My first day using the soap I felt a tingling sensation in both breast im very hopeful that this soap is working. Today is march 27 and I look a inch bigger I will be ordering more this product is great!!!</li>
    <li> I got mixed up and used this on my face. I now have a lucrative job with NASA as a satellite dish.</li>
    <li> I ordered on a Monday and got to me this Thursday. I&#x27;ll let u know the results of using this soap. Thank u and if I like it that much i&#x27;ll write u another review and spread the word. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks now and don&#x27;t see much of a difference. No tingling sensation nor any growth. What I have experienced is my skin drying out causing my nipples to peel. Maybe I&#x27;ve noticed a very very slight lift in my breast but I&#x27;m not sure if It&#x27;s from the soap or from me starting on my workout routine. Not to mention some of the reviews on here indicate they&#x27;re using a cream and/or supplement along with the soap. I just started taking a supplement 2 weeks ago hoping to speed up the process. I&#x27;ll definitely keep you&#x27;ll posted if anything changes. Wish me best of luck!!!!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen a change yet but then only been a couple of day&#x27;s, but do like the feel of it</li>
    <li> Haven t been using, and ordering the soap. I feel like I had better results just using the pill/liquid and cream! I did gain about a cup size tho, when using all of the items together. 3 month results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying a product like this cause so many people say natural breast enhancement is impossible. Well they were wrong. I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a month now and there&#x27;s definitely a difference. My breasts look fuller and they bounce more when I walk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for 6 months and am having great results!&lt;br /&gt;Note that it works differently for each person. It took about 4 month to see a size difference. If you drink caffeine it will slow the process. If you want to continue drinking caffeine take the liquid in the morning an hour before drinking caffeine and before bed! I use the liquid, pills, cream and soap. I use them  twice a day and I have gone from barely filling an \\&quot;a\\&quot; cup to fully filling a \\&quot;b\\&quot; cup. So remember it reacts differently to each person so give it time!&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I only used one bar so I can&#x27;t really judge from that but it did make my skin smooth...and it did tingle....</li>
    <li> It DOESN&#x27;T work!!! I WASTED my money....How could ANYONE charged that kind of money for a soap that does NOT do anything?&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT........!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a last attempt to enlarge my breasts . I tried 4 other product with absolutly zero results . After just 3 weeks of using this soap one time a day in the evening for 10 minutes at a time , ( while removing makeup ) , I gained a little under 1/2 inch in my measurements . This Product really does what it is made for ! I doubted it too at first , but my results are real ! And now I am happier and still growing . Remember ! Patience is the key . . . You will gain inches over farily quick time , but you will not go from a \\&quot;AA\\&quot; cup bra to a \\&quot;D\\&quot; cup in a month . . . That could take up to a year , more or less depending all on your body !   Personally I highly recommend this product ! ! ! IT WORKS ! ! ! Faster results will be had using their other products with this one .</li>
    <li> This soap works instantly. I have been using this soap for about 2 months now and I see a tremendous difference. Breasts are much fuller now and they no longer sag. I am loving this soap I am ordering two more bars as we speak. I dont know why its not working for some of you but it definitely works for me. Lord knows I can see a big difference. This is the key to fuller breast. Go buy this product now.</li>
    <li> ive used this soap for a week now. i can see changes. it works. will order again.i use it twice a day and leave it on for three minutes. i also use a loofa.thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks. It&#x27;s working! I can tell. Unlike other products, nothing happened at all. I used this with the cream too. Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> best soap i have ever used!no problems i would recommend it to anyone!i will buy more soap in the future!</li>
    <li> I didnt think any kind of product could increase breast size but this soap proved me wrong! Idk what it is but it made my breasts fuller within the first two days. I will keep purchasing. I also give myself breast massages which makes them even fuller. This is a great product A++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 47 yr old female, 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and weigh approx. 150lbs. I&#x27;ve been on Natureday liquid, cream and soap plus the pills of another retailer for approx 2 months - I started Sept 10, 2011. When I started, I measured 33 under the breast, 34.5 across the mid-chest. I wore a 36A. Now, 2 months later, I can honestly say I am still wearing my 36A bra but now my measurements are 34 under bust and 36 across the chest. My breasts ARE definitely filling out. They aren&#x27;t protruding in the front as much as I&#x27;d like but they are spreading out more on the sides and getting somewhat rounder. They are still at that squishy stage but I can feel them getting firmer closer to the chest wall. In the mornings when I first get up they aren&#x27;t quite as full as when I went to bed but as the day goes on they appear to fill out &amp; spread to the sides again. The nipples/areola area are getting bigger as well. No experience with any extra sensitivity in the nipple area nor any of the growing pains/tingles others have mentioned. I do have bloating/weight gain, but that could be due to the amount/combination of products I&#x27;m taking. Hopefully it will go away when I reached my goal of a 36C and I can take the minimum amount of product.  I&#x27;ve always been a very sexually active woman so I can&#x27;t necessarily attribute my increased libido to the use of the Natureday products. My daily routine starts with: My mornings - a protein shake, with either 3 droppers full of the Natureday liquid or 3 breast enlargement pills from another vendor (only because they were cheaper). I can&#x27;t swallow pills so I open them up and pour the herbal powder directly into my protein drink. Then sometime throughout the day I&#x27;ll mix another pills contents with a bottled water mixed with Ocean Spray or Crystal Light drink mix to cut the taste of the pill. In the evening, just before I go to bed, I&#x27;ll either mix the contents of 3 breast enlargement pills with 6oz juice or 3 droppers of Natureday liquid with 6oz of juice. In the morningI use the soap - moisten, lather, massage in, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse. Then I use the Natureday breast enlargement cream once in the morning and once at night before bed  - making sure to rub it in thoroughly. I avoid caffiene as much as possible - no sodas, chocolate - which is very difficult, coffee or tea. I take 2 multi-vitamins &amp; 2 vitamin C in the mornings as well. I also mix 1 teaspoon flax seed oil in my protein shake and 1/4-1/2 tsp into my bottled water. This may or may not work for you. It&#x27;s what I do. After reading so many reviews from women and men it seems that no matter what breast enlargement product you choose the key is to stick with it. It seems the most prominent growth is gained over a 2 to 3 yr period for those of us starting  with an A cup. Best of luck with your own journey!   UPDATE: 11/10/11 - My measurements today are 34 under breasts &amp; 36.25 across mid-chest. After 2 months of use I am truly pleased with the results I have received so far. I am still in my 36A bra and the growth isn&#x27;t rapid but it&#x27;s a step (albeit baby-steps) in the right direction.   I know on the website they mention applying the Natureday liquid directly to the breasts/nipples and rubbing it in in order to speed up growth. I tried that for a while but I felt like I was wasting more of the liquid than I was using because it would end up dripping down my stomach or going places other than where it was intended so to remedy that I now add 2 full droppers of the Natureday liquid to a full jar of Natureday cream to get more of a concentration of the herbs. Does it work? I don&#x27;t know. But I do know I feel better not having to chase the trail of liquid as it spirals out of control down my front...lol...  Now on a more serious note...Many people have written me asking how much I use &amp; spend on average for the Natureday Breast Enlargement system. Well I&#x27;ll tell you,  A jar of the Natureday cream lasts me approx 1-1/2 months applying it twice a day.   The Naturday soap usually lasts me 1 month with 1 time daily use.   The Natureday liquid not nearly as long - I go through a bottle every 10 days - taking 3 full droppers daily.   The Bust Boom pills, 60 ct bottle - 3 pills a day - usually lasts me 20 days.   On the average I spend $140/mo with liquid &amp; pills and another $50 if I have to purchase the soap &amp; cream. Not an inexpensive endeavor by any means but definitely worth it to feel better about myself and work towards having the breasts I always wanted to be sportin&#x27;. Best of luck to you all!    Update:   12/10/11 - This is my 3 month measurement - Under breast is 34.5\\&quot;, mid breast 37.25\\&quot;. Not bad considering where I started 3 months ago. I am still wearing my 36A bra but can tell it&#x27;s filling in nicely. I don&#x27;t really bother with the upper breast measurements since I don&#x27;t really notice much of a change in that area and until my cup spilleth over I see no need to measure.   So, I guess I just went through my first growth spurt while being on the breast enlargement journey...two weeks ago, I was about 2-1/2 months on the program by then, I FINALLY experienced the growth pains others have talked about. I know it&#x27;s been a while since I was a young girl but I don&#x27;t remember my breasts being so tender and the pain being so severe when I was going through puberty, Ouch! I&#x27;m glad that parts over with for the time being.   I continue to use the Natureday cream &amp; soap once daily. I&#x27;ve started leaving the soap on for at least 30-45 min. while I bathe. It seems to be doing a bit more good in the growth process. I&#x27;m still taking 3 full droppers of the Natureday liquid &amp; 3 Bust Boom pills a day as well. Best of luck to one and all embarking on your own journey. Happy Holidays!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004OK8QYY Breast Enhancement Soap]][[ASIN:B002IA0XNE Breast Enhancement Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered the soap and the cream from natureday on Apr 9 and the product arrived to AZ from WA by Apr 11. I applied both of them this evening. I tried other creams and oils before but one difference I felt with these products was that my breast feels warm and is staying warm. Not sure what it means but I am hopeful it will work.&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower and while my body still warm applied the soap on first. I did not wash it off. I massaged it for 5 min and once dry applied the cream. Will do the same routine in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep the readers updated.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it.  Did nothing for me.  I don&#x27;t know how this product got so many good amazon reviews.  Absolutely won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> It works, but its not a miracle product but with patience you will eventually reach ur prefered size.  I can wear shirts without bras now.  I like my size better.</li>
    <li> i order it for  my mother  she  is 70 years old  she  use naturedays pillss  and cream  and this breast inhasment soap she loves it she  said  she sud it up around her  breast and  let it  set  for  a feww min  and then she rise it off she  said her breast are firmer  bouncy fuller  ther no more sagging it a great product ,thank God for amozon for such low  prices so people like  me can  by good product</li>
    <li> Waste of money doesn&#x27;t work. I take it twice a day hoping I can see improvement , but I realize it doent work and waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is a joke and should just be taken out of circulation, period. What a rip-off. That is all.</li>
    <li> smells beautiful and works i bit better and feels great on the skin for a bar of soap to do so much it is truly a powerful bar of soap</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had temporary fullness. I knew I was taking a chance on this product so keep in mind what works or do not work for one person may have a different effect on someone else. There are enhancement products  that has work for me but this just wasn&#x27;t one of them. Once I&#x27;m completely finish using this bar who knows there could be good results. It does have a decent smell though.</li>
    <li> I love it! Just before I take a shower, I wet and lather myself with the soap leave on for 10 minutes &amp; then go take a shower. I do this in the morning &amp; at night. It&#x27;s weird but I have noticed that within 3 weeks I have already went from a 34A to 34B. My bras fit tighter and seem to overflow. They&#x27;re more tighter on the sides and feel uncomfortable. The soreness is a bother but feeling it, I know the soap is still working!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My breast are more purky, fuller and its noticeable when I look down that there has been growth. I have tried almost everything and being a mother of 4 one tends to want the size breasts that one once had before the kids! I used to be a 36A and after the kids with the loss of weight &amp; health problems, my breasts lost their figure, went from firm and bouncy to flat and saggy but since I have been using the soap, it made some of the loss regain again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By me following this technique, the soap though small has lasted until now, almost already a month. But like I said, right before I take a shower, I just wet myself, lather on the soap and massage in until it disappears and after around 10 minutes, then I take a shower. So far, it has worked and hope it works for everyone else who is having the same problems finding something less expensive but worth the money. Believe me \\&quot;I HAVE SPENT MONEY BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE THE ONE\\&quot;. I recently purchased fenugreek 620mg to see if with this there will be faster results. I will advise of such when it arrives and when used!</li>
    <li> Starts working first use. First week you can see the results. Breast were already feeling firmer. But to get the full affect you have to keep using it. Each bar lasts a month. And the longer you out the suds sit the better it works. Should prob leave setting 3 to 5 minutes for best results. But I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It cleans and does what it is supposed to. Just lather up and let it work. Super stuff. Also no ingesting of anything just absorbing.</li>
    <li> Received on February 1st 2012 and on the 22nd day, perhaps too soon to say this is making my breasts any larger. Only noticed my nipples are getting more pink. I&#x27;m actually tempted to use this on my face if this able to lighten my nipples. Will edited this review within another 3 weeks if I noticed anything regarding my breasts and even my face complexion.</li>
    <li> wow is all i can say. A soap that can really shape up your breast and make them look full? Yes i was skeptical at first. But for the price i had to give it a try. Its been a month and few days &amp; i just ordered my second bar of soap because Ive noticed a difference in the past month. I have 2 kids and we all know after you have kids and you breast feed what happenes after. My right breast was bigger than my right breast and their the same size now and their much fuller and less saggy. I just love this stuff and im going to keep buying it until im satisified. You just have to stay committed and use it everyday only then you&#x27;ll see what this stuff really does. I also use the Enhancement cream as well. its great!!</li>
    <li> I should have already written a review on this product. I am a bit confused about this product. At the beginning, I believed it started to work. I used it morning and night and 2 weeks later, I noticed my breast would get sore and maybe swell up just a bit. It helped with firmness but overall \\&quot;growth\\&quot;....i would say thats a bit much to give credit for. I mean, during the time I would feel soreness, I soon noticed it was also a week before my cycle. I don&#x27;t know why this product didnt give me much. I only used it for about 3 to 4 months but still, shouldn&#x27;t I have had some kinda growth by now?....ridiculous! I read a review where a woman let the soap stay on her and didnt wash it off....well I tried that and it just gave me a terrible rash under my breast and made my skin dry in that area. I just dont know if I should try again or what....just dont want to waste money. The firmness went away after I stopped using this.</li>
    <li> Okay, everyone listen, because this product is GREAT. I&#x27;ve been using the soap and the cream. Soap once a day for about 5 minutes, and cream twice a day in the morning and at night. I see and feel a difference in a WEEK. Another great thing is, it&#x27;s CHEAP. Everyone is noticing, my self-confidence is better and I have NO complaints!</li>
    <li> Natureday is a great product!! It works!! I am 11% body far and well in shape which may hurt growth since I hear its based on fat cells but being muscular my chest just wasn&#x27;t growing pectorals so I looked to breast products to see if it would actually work to give my chest more definition. For 15 bucks figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;Got more then I had wanted went from firm muscled chest to a soft bouncing a cup :/&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told I love it though definitely made things in the bedroom better. I have decided to go bigger and order another bar of soap. I lather it on my chest and let the suds sit for 10-20 min then wash off and massage in the shower for another 10 minutes in circular motions and in then down motions. Never in my life would I want breasts but now that I have growth its almost addictive I try to fight it but I can&#x27;t help but feel the need for more round fuller breasts :)&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks initially I felt sharp pains and chest was itchy thought it was my shirt material but after a month my shirts felt much tighter. First bar lasted about 6 weeks looking forward to new order</li>
    <li> I have just ordered this product waiting for it to arrive very excited. I am an 18 year old girl who has always struggled with breast size im a small perky 34 A right now. looking to get a sexy 34 B. thats all i want.. hopefully this works im very skeptical but the reviews look promising! ill keep you guys posted if i see anything at all..even the slightest difference will make me smile. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;so i purchased this product about a week ago now. have been putting in on for 10 minutes daily. massaging with soap for 5, and letting it sit for the other 5. ITS AMAZING! omg i cant believe it! im already seeing a big difference maybe a half inch? its incredible!!&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;***ALSO the website said avoid caffeine at all times...ive been having my morning coffee (which i cant live without) every single day..ITS STILL WORKING. my breast feel tingly and warm, and my 34 A bras are feeling extremely tight. going to move up in about a week! TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;i am so happy!! :DDD</li>
    <li> So i never had amazing boobs but i bought this a few weeks ago &amp; im almost up a cup size already! (:</li>
    <li> this was my first time trying the soap im not sure if its working...only been using it less than a month ...but i know for a fact the cream definetly works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and wanted to give this a good trial run before I left actual feedback. Overall this soap has indeed made my beasts fuller and have added more bounce to them thus far. Every other night I would lather my girls up then let the soap sit and dry for 5 to 10 minutes (while giving myself a facial) before rinsing them off in the shower. I started off doing this nightly but quickly found out that this had a drying effect on my girls and would leave them flaky and sometimes itchy. After my second time using this pleasant smelling soap, I. Did my routne then laid down to rest. I was awakened later that night by a sight pain that started in my nipple and shot through out my breast. It wasn&#x27;t too bad but def woke me up. It was very similar to (but not as sharp as) the breast pain I would have right before my cycle starts. I took it as the soap doing its thing and went back to sleep. The next day when I took a shower I noticed my breasts were tender and my nipples were slightly sore. (Sore enough that I couldnt let the water stream hit them directly!) Now 3 weeks later I have noticed that my breasts are filling out my bra a teeny bit more. I think if I keep this up along with my nightly breast massage I will see decent results. I am seriously thinking about purchasing the pills along with the cream now because I can honestly see that this is working for me.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been using the soap and cream for a month now. I keep the soap on both breast for about 20 minutes everyday and then follow with the cream.  The right breast is firmer and bigger while the other breast stayed exactly the same. IT&#x27;S HORRIBLE!!!You can clearly see and feel the difference.  My right boob fills my bra up while for the left boob theres a pretty big spacing. I&#x27;m going to put a link of a picture of my breast so you guys can see for yourselves! I&#x27;m going to continue on only putting the soap and cream on my left breast hoping it will actually grow! unless you want to risk having one big perky boob and one small saggy boob i&#x27;d advice you not get this product. link here : [...]</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this worthless product. It&#x27;s not even worth a couple bucks. Just look at the \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews by others it&#x27;s clear that they are fakes. Just wish I&#x27;d realized before I purchased, lesson learned!</li>
    <li> So my brother thought it&#x27;d be fun to replace the normal soap in my shower with a bar of this with the labelling taken off... Well, I can say that it does work very well at least. But that&#x27;s maybe not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a start, I&#x27;m a guy. And I used it all over my body on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now covered in breasts. On the one hand, it&#x27;s every man&#x27;s dream. On the other, my life is now a living nightmare, with the only crumb of comfort being the fat appearance-fee cheques I&#x27;m cashing from all those different medical-exploitation reality TV shows. And from providing reference feedstock for Nestlé&#x27;s baby formula factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when I say covered, I mean covered. The only place unaffected is my eyes, thankfully, as I never got it in there. I&#x27;m not entirely sure where my manhood has gone, either it&#x27;s shrivelled up from the estrogen, it&#x27;s obscured by the errant mammaries that have sprouted in that area, or it&#x27;s actually turned into one itself. I can still urinate, but I&#x27;m no longer sure if it&#x27;s from an urethra or a nipple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my hair is a bit milky. Do you know what it&#x27;s like to have milky hair? I now know what a mother rabbit feels like. I&#x27;m actively considering breeding baby rabbits as a sideline, as I can easily keep them fed in a cage on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please, Natureday, can you somehow make the bar a bit more distinctive? Perhaps mould it in the shape of a boob and have dyed lettering running through it as a warning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pity the women who use this product in the bath, or have a low-flow shower that means it takes the soap suds a long time to run off their chest and down their body, maybe even leaving slight trails of residue behind. They&#x27;re in for a shock later on.</li>
    <li> If you all seriously think some sketchy-as-heck soap is going to to do anything for your breasts besides irritate the skin , then you probably deserve itchy nipples for not using common sense.</li>
    <li> work well keep skin nice</li>
    <li> Im so new to this breast enhancement soap..so i dont know what works and what doesnt.. but i came across this soap and decided i should try it.. i am a young mommy of 3.. although i could afford surgery in a yr or so, but as a mom i put my kids first and do what best for me and them.. so as a new customer im not going to rate this product yet (keeping it 5stars since idk if it works yet) but i will keep yall posted also if yall have any tips for me please let me know and if yall want to share your results with me im willing to read it :)   i do have to say i got my soap in the mail today and i used it this morning.. after 6hrs i can feel some tingling (not painful) but it makes me feel hopeful.. :D i will report any changes that occurs.. WISH ME LUCK &lt;3</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap everyday for the past 3 months. I have to say my breasts are much fuller. I had been using the cream and the liquid prior, then switched to the soap. I saw more results with the soap and cream then anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are not seeing results right away. I recommend you lather up with the soap first.. let it dry-leave it on- dont wash it off. Then add the creme on top-work it onto your breasts until the cream vanishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do this in the morning and at night. I was a size 38D now I fill a 40C. Without saying a word to anyone about what I had been doing, my own boyfriend noticed how full my breasts have been. For $15. The experiment is very worth it. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I tried the pills the creams the drops and the soap and i have to say this soap didn&#x27;t have drastic change but it really did start to work after the 3rd week . i showered every day and massaged it into my breast and i think from the warmth of the water and massaging probably had to be the results but on the other hand it could really be the soap. i will purchase again and stock up and keep everyone updated.</li>
    <li> hi.........i ordered it about a month ago and it works....i was amazed too....my boobs are now much tighter and bigger and my husband noticed it too...:)the only thing that i am worried about now is how long will it last??? is it going to be permanent or not??? well i have ordered one more as i want to make it little bit bigger and tighter.....i hate wearing the padded bras, so............anyways i am very happy that i used this soap and i will continue to use it....</li>
    <li> Soap does not make your breasts grow- your body does that. You either have big breasts or you do not. You can rub all the herbal soap in the world on your chest and still not get a result. If you have small breasts and have finished developing, the only way to make them bigger is surgery- do not buy this product. It is stupid.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff tht has work for me. Dosent work tht fast tho. I been using it for about six weeks and have gone frm 36 a to 34 b... I would like to be a 36 c and I can see tht happening with this product and only this proudut. Pills/creams/drops didnt work at all for me. So I highly recommended this to any ladies:)...</li>
    <li> I bought this soap thinking it would actually work but it doesnt it just makes yours boobs dry and itchy its a waste of moeny no miracle happened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I can already feel the product working. It&#x27;s crazy, I&#x27;m not even genetically female or on any hormones or other supplements. Though there are no visible changes just yet, I know it&#x27;s only a matter of time as there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that there are some rapid changes going on inside.</li>
    <li> First the product arrived in a very cheap wrapper.  The ingredients are listed but really it didn&#x27;t as if comes from a reputable seller.  It has no fragrance and I used it twice a day with no tingling or changes, just dry breasts.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did nothing for me.  I used the soap every day until the bar was gone.  Not even a tingle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two days and I am already getting great results. My breasts feel more firm and they are getting bigger. Now, I am a person with sensitive skin. However, this product does not irritate my skin at all. I am very happy with this product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to inform people that not every product is gonna work for you. Sometimes you just have to keep searching for the right one. One product may not work for you, but it could be working for other people. Our bodies are different so they may give a different reaction. For some people it could take a few weeks, whereas it could take others longer to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put the soap on for 10 minutes and lather. Also, another way to get bigger breasts is to massage them. That helps to shape them. Give it a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give a update later, if I remember. In the meantime, it may help to get a understanding of your breasts. Don&#x27;t wear bras that are too tight because that can make your breasts smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -&lt;br /&gt;I am still loving this product.  STILL no skin irritation also.  BTW I don&#x27;t reccomend drinking so much caffiene as it can interfere with the growth.  Now into a 50 DD and I love it!  Go to natureday.com for more info too.  Found the site yesterday.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, breathing new life into older sagging breasts.Breast fed 3 babies 20 years ago and recently lost 50 lbs. at least 5 lbs. in each breast it seemed like. I went from a 36D down to a barely 32A and they had the droopy puppy dog ears look. But slowly but surely they seem to be firming back up and regaining a little shape. Using in combination with breast actives supplement and cream. Shipping and Handling seems high but working and will reorder.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap hoping my breats would improve even a little but it doesn&#x27;t work. This is just a waste of money. I&#x27;m so dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product it&#x27;s so convenient, and it works. After just 3 weeks I have noticed a significant increased in my cup size. I especially like the fact that you only use it on the necessary area.</li>
    <li> The soap made skin very soft and overall I liked it. Maybe a liquid or gel soap would be preferred.</li>
    <li> it smells good though, however, that&#x27;s not what I singed up for.&lt;br /&gt;I used two and half of this soap,&lt;br /&gt;nothing changed.&lt;br /&gt;I followed strictly by the instructions,&lt;br /&gt;plus I got their cream as well,&lt;br /&gt;after more than 6 months,&lt;br /&gt;still nothing, so I stopped it.</li>
    <li> I used this as much as possible. There were many days where I forgot to use it. I used it on only one because I wanted to be even. I think it got maybe just a little bit bigger but I&#x27;m really not sure. I&#x27;m a vegetarian and naturally small so it&#x27;s hard for me to grow</li>
    <li> I started this product two weeks ago. I leave the soap suds on my boobs and kept it on for twenty minutes and then was the soap suds off. I must say I noticed a difference! It&#x27;s Not a dramatic difference like I was a B cup in the morning and now I&#x27;m a D cup. However the difference was noticeable, my boobs look a litter little rounder and perkier. I will continue to use the soap and leave it on for 20 minutes two times a day; once in the morning and once at night every day. I will post if there is any differences/ growth in a month or two. Thee product works slowly it lifts your breast first then you start to see an increase. Do Not Expect Fast Results give it at least 2/3 months. Before  saying that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and i&#x27;ve seen zero growth.  I apply it before I shower, let it sit and dry on.  It is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 2 stars instead of one because i didn&#x27;t use the system. this soap doesn&#x27;t last that long and I most certainly do not see nay difference at all in my breasts.</li>
    <li> All It does is make ur skin tighter. Thats about it. Didnt see and result that i had hoped for...</li>
    <li> Didnt work. comon people soap? really?&lt;br /&gt;why are there so many good reviews like it doesnt make sense.&lt;br /&gt;It just sucks, dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Yes, this soap give you more volume on the breast, not that much, but after you rinse the soap you will feel some itchy around the nipple, even if you avoid the nipple area.  Anyway I use it until the end, it&#x27;s ok.  My breast is little bit more full.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few months following the directions as listed. Not only did they NOT make my breasts grow, but they made them a bit smaller (seriously) AND less firm! I am SO ANGRY!&lt;br /&gt;Remember \\&quot;Amazon Verified\\&quot; does not always mean what you think. Employees can have an account and purchase the product to make a good review just to entice unknowing customers into buying a product that is really, really bad.</li>
    <li> I do not know how is it work yet. Still it is very small compared to its price. I never thought it will be in s such small size. I would not buy it even for 10 $.</li>
    <li> This review is a bit over due for me. Like many other women who have purchased this product, I wanted to increase my breast size. I wear a 32A and depending on the brand I&#x27;ll either fill the cup entirely or will have a huge gap. Anyways, I received the soap around the date that it was approximated to arrive. The soap arrived in one of those gold-yellow colored envelopes with bubble wrap attached to the inside. The soap itself was covered in a blue tissue paper with the ingredients sticker to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lathered the soap on my breasts with my hands and immediately started having this light burning sensation. It went away by the time I woke up next morning, but it wasn&#x27;t painful to begin with. I never had it after that. I only lathered on the soap when I was not in the shower, and left it on for 10 minutes while I read a book or did chi massages. I did this consistently for approximately 3 weeks but had no increase in size whatsoever. My breasts did firm up a bit, but that could be attributed to the chi massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to add that during this period I was on 1000mg of pueraria mirifica and had been having 7 day breaks every 3 weeks. I had no growth with the pueraria mirifica either. I just wanted to mention this because I know other women who used this soap have used it in conjunction with Naturedays other products. For now I will just be using this soap like regular body soap. If there are any other changes I will update.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but still waiting for results.  It&#x27;s too early to tell.  I&#x27;m taking enhancement pills and rubbing the cream at night, so I&#x27;ll just wait and see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American 31 y/o mother. First ill tell you that I&#x27;m not a health nut. I try but I&#x27;m too lazy. My breast have begun sagging significantly in the past few years. I already had stretchmarks on my breast that seemed to get worse when the sagging started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking all over and wasted hundreds of dollars in product to treat my stretchmarks and address the sagging.... all to be disappointed over and over. I felt like a 34 y/o trapped in the body of a 60 y/o woman and I was resigned to just deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this soap and for $15 I said screw it after reading the reviews. I got my soap in the mail today and I used it during my evening shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed the soap lather on my breasts and let it sit for about 5 min before rinsing. Then I did a 2nd wash near the end of my shower but this time I used my Clarisonic brush to work in the soap lather on my breasts. I spent 2 min on each breast with the brush then rinsed. It was then that I noticed how \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; my breasts felt. In addition, the stretchmarks on my breasts temporarily filled in almost instantly to the point where I hard to look really hard to see them on my décolleté. I say temporarily because an hour later the stretchmarks are still not as deep but more visible. But it made more of a difference than 4months of Tri-Lastin on my breasts! And I can tell that my breasts are more firm because I have a little spillage in my push up bra!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting all of this after my first use! I&#x27;m not sure how much the stimulation from the Clarisonic helped but I&#x27;m going to try the soap without the brush tomorrow to compare results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m so impressed!!!! Lets see what happens after day 7. Ill keep you all updated!!!!</li>
    <li> so far I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks with no results.  To be honest I wasn&#x27;t expecting results yet BUT the soap is almost gone and I&#x27;ve been very careful and conservative with it.  The only difference I’ve noticed is the nipple of the breast I&#x27;ve been using it on (I’m lop sided so I was only using it on my right side) is itchy and stinging.  Pretty constantly.  Anyway I don&#x27;t wanna say the product won&#x27;t work for some people but I&#x27;m wishing I had bought the cream instead as I think it would have lasted longer giving me more time to see if the ingredients would actually work on me.  I did give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does have a very pleasant smell and shipped very quickly.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It is making my skin really soft. The only problem is that I need to leave it on my breasts for 10 min or so, but I don&#x27;t usually stick to the time because I am too busy.</li>
    <li> just received my soap and started using it straight away.left it on overnight and got no irritations.can already feel the tingling in the breast</li>
