<li> I am a chef, and between the dry weather and constantly washing my hands and washing dishes at work, my hands get so dry they start to bleed.</li>
<li> The gloves are dry and brittle, with almost no moisturizer.</li>
<li> My hands just felt like I spent too long in the pool.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> But by wearing these to bed once or twice a week I was able to eliminate the awful cracking/redness and have normal hands again.</li>
<li> /&gt;Recommend to buy and use after a hard day of walking and standing long</li>
<li> We had a really harsh winter this year and my hands suffered.  </li>
<li> This is obviously a different seller and I am very disappointed.  </li>
<li> My wife had a terrible skin situation which made it very difficult to use her hands.</li>

    <li> Pamper me now!!! Perfect for spa parties</li>
    <li> These moisturizing gloves made my dry hands feel smooth and soft. I accidentally fell asleep with them and on and my hands stayed soft and smooth longer than with the 30 minute treatment. Shared with my sister and she ordered a case.</li>
