      <li>It&#x27;s not oily or dewy like many primers.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Wish I could have returned this stuff, or better yet, listened to the reviews and went with Physicians Formula Primer.</li>

      <li>So many people swore by this brand &amp; I decided to give it a chance.</li>
      <li>The foundation wears so much better now with the primer.</li>

      <li>I love the way it feels cool and refreshing on my skin.</li>
      <li>and it works best with the mousse by far in a hot climate.</li>
      <li>The product I received looked either extremely old or perhaps has been kept in a very warm place.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t easily spread my foundation before and it was looking chalky.</li>
      <li>I love love love it, and I&#x27;m happy spend big bucks if the product is worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have found that this primer works best if I apply it right after my moisturizer and wait a couple minutes before applying the rest of my makeup (which is only powder and blush for my face).</li>
      <li>I love Almay and I LOVE their Smart Shade line!</li>
      <li>Does not leave a smooth canvas to apply makeup.</li>
      <li>But this product feels smooth, and seems to even out skin tones.</li>
      <li>I personally really enjoy skincare and putting on makeup, this routine is ritualistic for me.  </li>
      <li>It does not help with any color problems I have, which I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to correct much anyway.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smooth and light and makes makeup glide on evenly.</li>
      <li>and I have always had good results with Almay products on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I actually tried the Stila brand primer that was listed as $39, and really liked the results, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that kind of money on it.</li>
      <li>Blueberries\\&quot; on my skin first, which doesn&#x27;t glide on nicely, but is worth the effort.</li>
      <li>Since adding the primer, I have significantly noticed a difference in appearance.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s quite HOT most of the time and keeping your makeup from melting off your face can sometimes be a chore.</li>
      <li>, I arrive as expected and good quality, I leave satisfied.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Neutrogena shine control primer but decided to try the Almay smart shade because the price was good and I always like to try something new.</li>
      <li>WOW I love it!</li>
      <li>My Almay Smart Shade Anti-Aging Makeup #200 works better to cover up.  </li>
      <li>this product its ok for me, I have never used before a premier but this one really correct your skin before make up.</li>
      <li>Not bad at all for the price.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even describe the smell but it is mildly offensive to me</li>
      <li>it absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Luckily that smell went away after a while</li>
      <li>But if you are one of the lucky ones, this primer rocks.</li>
      <li>I very much dislike this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Strangely glowing, and not in a good way.</li>

      <li>They wanted to manage all your purchases, ability to solve problems effectively, thanks for being so attentive.</li>
      <li>For those with sensitive or acne prone skin it has not irritated my skin or caused me to breakout which is a huge plus!</li>
      <li>Because I have to layer, I really like this Almay product because it goes on so lightly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great idea, but It smells so bad I can&#x27;t stand to use it.  Also felt very heavy and thick.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. You only have to use a little bit. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it does not prevent my skin from looking oily, which I was told primer is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and was unable to find it locally so ordered it online. The product I received looked either extremely old or perhaps has been kept in a very warm place. The spirals of primer we&#x27;re separated and drying. It certainly was not something I wanted to put on my face and I threw it away.</li>
    <li> The Good:  This product did a good job of priming the skin. After hours of wear, my face looked and felt flawless and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oh SO BAD:  The smell was so overpowering that I returned it at the end of the day. It smells heavily of antibiotics with notes of urine.  I can&#x27;t image how this product made it through all the rigorous testing phases without anyone addressing this obvious issue.  The product should be reformulated in the near future to address this problem. I&#x27;ll be waiting. : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  I personally really enjoy skincare and putting on makeup, this routine is ritualistic for me.  To have a disturbing odor interrupting my daily experience is unacceptable; however, if you don&#x27;t mind the smell of this product, then the product will probably work for you as a primer. For those looking for alternative primers, I suggest Maybelline&#x27;s Instant Age Rewind Primer( No, I don&#x27;t work for any cosmetic company, this is just my opinion), or if you want to splurge, try Smashbox Photo Finish.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge make up buff, but this product has truely gotten me to rave about it! I actually tried the Stila brand primer that was listed as $39, and really liked the results, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that kind of money on it. As I continued to browse the store, I came across the Almay primer for $13.99, and took a chance. I LOVE it!!! Normally, I only put on a liquid foundation and blush before stepping out. Since adding the primer, I have significantly noticed a difference in appearance. When I first put the primer on, I immediately see reduced redness in my cheeks. Once I put my foundation on, my skin looks completly even with almost an airbrushed look. I am hooked!!! I&#x27;m really cheap when it comes to make up, and almost didn&#x27;t even want to spend the $13.99, but it will now be a staple in my make drawer!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this at a local discount department store yesterday and discovered how well this works today. This morning I applied the primer before using the Almay Smart Shade make-up. I then applied some powdered blusher. Within minutes my middle-aged skin, that has rosacea, looked smoother and less red. I was amazed. This is the best my skin has looked in years. I now look forward to using make-up as I can see how this small effort makes a difference in how I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this easy to use product.</li>
    <li> Works, weird smell. I put it on under lotion because of that.</li>
    <li> I did not buy mine here.. I bought it at local store.. I CAN&amp;#34;T BELIEVE the Bad reviews.. hahaha I am amazed.. I am not much for using make up .. but it was like it tranformed my skin.. it&#x27;s NOT a shade people,, it is a Color Corrector for those that have too much red!!!! AHHHHH HELLLLOOOOO hahah Try it out at the store.. grab a mirror.. and try it.. that&#x27;s what I did,.  and that&#x27;s why I bought it.. I HATE getting OLD so anything that is a plus.. is a PLUS.. I DO suggest you try it.. :)  BUT IT&amp;#34;S NOT A SHADE!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It smells so bad. I got this instead of Stilla because of the price but I hate putting this on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now underneath light/medium Almay Smart Shade Balanced foundation. The primer feels very thin and light going on my skin, and dries quickly. There is no beading or flaking like I have had with other makeup primers. It does seem to slightly correct the redness in my face, and create an even surface, although it is a very subtle effect.  I let it dry a minute or two, then apply the Almay foundation. My skin looks very even and although I am still shiny and oily, I like the natural look and feel of this primer with the foundation. No cakey look, no settling in pores or fine lines, just a very natural look with light/medium coverage.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this product, but it was extremely disappointing.  The smell was difficult to get past, but eventually faded after an hour or so.  After wearing it for 2 days, I started to get acne.  Absolutely unacceptable. I threw it out the next day.  It&#x27;s been 3 days since I stopped wearing it and no new pimples have appeared and the old ones are almost completely gone.  I would not recommend this product to anyone and will not buy another Almay product again.</li>
    <li> I tried this primer because it was made by Almay and I have always had good results with Almay products on my sensitive skin.  However, this primer did not work for me.  It smells like urine.  The consistency is like water and it worked about as well as water on my skin.  I tried it a few times, but just couldn&#x27;t get past the bad smell, so I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this primer thinking it would work but the product itself sucks! It leaves your face feeling a bit cakey and your make up does not last long at all! Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think about it when I purchased this product but purple and green make grey.  That is what my skin looked like, grey with patches of red peeking through.  The coverage was poor and I attempted to apply the product in 3 layers after letting it dry but all I got was a dark grey skin tone that  still didn&#x27;t cover  all the redness.  My skin also started to burn slightly so I  didn&#x27;t leave it on longer than to figure out this is not the concealer for me.  I could not recommend this to anyone.  Next time I will look for a green only concealer.</li>
    <li> It makes my complexion look like it has less  unevenness.  I would buy it again I am satisfied.  It feels nice on the skin</li>
    <li> My favorite thing in the world it works so well I love it so much glad I found it finally</li>
    <li> I have terrible skin and have bought hundreds of beauty products in my lifetime to perfect and correct.  This product did absolutely nothing. First off the smell is bad. It didn&#x27;t tone down the redness at all much less even out my skin tone.  When I rubbed it in it completely disappeared.  I had no idea I had just put anything on other than I could smell it.  I expect more from Almay.  Don&#x27;t wast your money!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Neutrogena shine control primer but decided to try the Almay smart shade because the price was good and I always like to try something new. After using half the bottle I went back to my Neutrogena primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer smells weird, as others have also noted, and isn&#x27;t good for combination or oily skin. I felt like my makeup didn&#x27;t stay a ton longer than with no primer again. It&#x27;s also a rather thin consistency. Not horrible, but doesn&#x27;t do the best job.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference in regards to using my make up with or without it. (Over a period of two weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;-absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-horrible, disgusting smell&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t really change your makeup look&lt;br /&gt;-not much product in the bottle&lt;br /&gt;-did nothing for redness on my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> This item did not cover up the slight redness I have on my cheeks and chin.  I tried it for 2 days and I feel that it did nothing to help my coloring.  Also, it had a metallic smell to it.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this to see if it stacked up to my more expensive Stila shade correcting primer. It is very similar but feels a little heavier on. I felt like I had to blend it in more than the Stila. It is a good cheaper version but I ended up sticking with the Stila.</li>
    <li> Excellent care, serious and responsible 100% Recommended Queñes They wanted to manage all your purchases, ability to solve problems effectively, thanks for being so attentive.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing makeup &amp; asked around what to start off with. So many people swore by this brand &amp; I decided to give it a chance. Cheapest buy was here. Anyways, I love it! It moisturizes my face perfectly &amp; also makes an amazing base for any foundation. It&#x27;s not oily or dewy like many primers. It&#x27;s just a really good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several primers and this one seems to work really well.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I like Hard Candy&#x27;s primer much better. This didn&#x27;t really sit well on my face-- it felt very tacky and like it never absorbed.</li>
    <li> My pregnant skin is not enjoying this product right now and it is causing my skin to break out (very minimally) , but before I was pregnant I used it everyday with no problems.</li>
    <li> I love Almay products and this primer is great. Makes your skin smooth and ready for make up. Will keep buying products. Thanks Y.Castilla</li>
    <li> Not my favorite. It does not help with any color problems I have, which I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to correct much anyway.&lt;br /&gt;As far a primer, I think it&#x27;s average; I expected more. My biggest complaint is the smell which is something I&#x27;ll never be able to get used to. The only thing I can compare the smell to is the smell of plain gelatin. I&#x27;ve made homemade pore/blackhead strips in the past that used gelatin, but I couldn&#x27;t keep doing it. Gelatin smells sooo bad because of what it&#x27;s made from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, there is a faint, but really funky smell + for only being an average primer at it&#x27;s current price (at least in stores), I would either buy the Almay CC primer or find a different brand all together. I don&#x27;t see any perfecting or correcting from this product; not even after wearing on a regular basis. I think it&#x27;s just simply way too translucent to be able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro I find in this primer is the fact that it&#x27;s thin and light.</li>
    <li> I very much dislike this stuff!  It does nothing for my skin. The blotchy bed and brown marks are still there. leaves a green ting to my skin. My Almay Smart Shade Anti-Aging Makeup #200 works better to cover up.  Wish I could have returned this stuff, or better yet, listened to the reviews and went with Physicians Formula Primer. I have had no problem with that brand in concealer/blemish cover up.</li>
    <li> It works.  In really glad my cheap booty but it on a whim it works under my creamy foundation and powder foundation.</li>
    <li> I found that it gave my skin a weird, fake &amp;#34;highlight&amp;#34; overall. Strangely glowing, and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have red hair with red blotchy cheeks with some freckles. I have tried many products for redness and have not found one that actually covered the redness without making my skin look green or even redder because it made me worse.  This products actually goes on very thin and smooth and dries fast. I noticed a slight smell but only for a few seconds then it goes away. This evens out your complexion and also completely tones down the redness. I can be confident again with my foundation! I will continue to buy this and use every day.</li>
    <li> Left a green residue on my face that did not absorb. Did not correct redness as well as Stila Color Correcting Primer. Also made my face oily and breakout. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a change in my skin tone as for correcting. It&#x27;s kind of a think product.</li>
    <li> Best yet&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many primers and this is by far the best one for my skin..it absorbs quickly. doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sit on top of your skin...so hope you keep it in stock</li>
    <li> It goes on nicely and soaks in quick with no greasiness, it does help to keep the makeup on longer.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a primer, so I&#x27;m still deciding whether I really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; it or not. But this product feels smooth, and seems to even out skin tones. It only takes a little each time.</li>
    <li> not five minutes after using this product for the first time did my significant other (who had no idea i was trying something new)get out of the shower, look at me and say \\&quot;wow. you look so pretty. your skin is just glowing!\\&quot; okay-sold! i&#x27;m sure what other reviewers are saying about the smell...to me, the smell is very light and not really distinct and it disappears after a minute. consistency is nice and light so it smooths on very easily without having to rub for ten minutes like other primers i have tried. love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help even out my skin tone. I get red spots so I saw that the combined ingredients were suppose to help. Even out red and blend my skin. Well it did not It actually burns when I applied it. I have another product that does the job I am discontinuing buying this product again also it has a funny smell to it.</li>
    <li> Doesnt do much for me</li>
    <li> I love Almay and I LOVE their Smart Shade line! It&#x27;s genius! This product might leave you a bit disappointed though if you are also an Almay fan-girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, it smells terrible. I can&#x27;t even describe the smell but it is mildly offensive to me and I can smell it for a few hours after applying my foundation over the top of this primer. If you are sensitive to smell I would steer clear of this stuff! The consistency is similar to a face serum - not too watery, not too thick, and it is not oily. It applies easily to your face using fingertips and apart from the smell there is minimal difference that I have seen once it is on my skin. It does not feel tacky or gross on the skin. I do have a small amount of redness on my chin, corners of my mouth, and at the edges of my nose and applying this primer does not really improve it. If anything it dulls my face/skin a bit so I would never wear it alone, but under foundation it&#x27;s no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the primer I usually wait a couple minutes before applying foundation. The primer definitely helps to hydrate dry areas and would be great for those with dry skin. With combination or oily skin though I would look elsewhere as it is not so great at controlling oil/shine. For those with sensitive or acne prone skin it has not irritated my skin or caused me to breakout which is a huge plus! It actually seems to create a pretty good barrier for keeping makeup from clogging your pores as my acne actually improved noticeably when I used the primer on a daily basis. Without primer I tend to get small whiteheads appearing almost daily when I wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Arizona so it&#x27;s quite HOT most of the time and keeping your makeup from melting off your face can sometimes be a chore. Obviously some maintenance with blotting sheets and powder is necessary throughout the day but a good primer also makes a difference! I have tried this under [[ASIN:B00XUQTEYY Almay Smart Shade Skin Tone Matching - Light - 1 oz by Almay]] as well as [[ASIN:B00E9VKZRE Almay Smart Shade Mousse Makeup, Light 0.17 fl oz (20 ml)]] and it works best with the mousse by far in a hot climate. I believe this is because the mousse dries to a matte finish so oil is kept at bay longer than with the liquid foundation. After a 9 hour workday indoors with the liquid foundation and this primer I look like an oil slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you are looking for a cheap primer that you can use daily to hydrate dry skin and don&#x27;t mind the smell, then I would say give this a try. If you have combo or oily skin though, try something else that does a better job of reducing shine.ht - 1 oz by Almay]] as well as [[ASIN:B00E9VKZRE Almay Smart Shade Mousse Makeup, Light 0.17 fl oz (20 ml)]] and it works best with the mousse by far in a hot climate.

    <li> I had my doubts about this product but It works great got a lot of complement about how I got my glow back and all I did was use this product and would highly recommend I will be buying this product again</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to receiving this Primer. I have always heard that ALMAY had a great selection of hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested make-up so I decided to give it a shot. (this was my first, and my last ALMAY purchase) WOW, was I disappointed! The first thing I noticed was how disgusting the product looked when I started to apply it, and within a few minutes of doing so, it felt like my face was on fire... and the smell, let&#x27;s just say I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff off fast enough. Even after I washed my face and applied Argan oil, it still burned close to a half an hour. I do not consider myself as having sensitive skin but I had no idea this would be so harsh and my skin would have such a reaction. ALMAY really &#x27;bombed&#x27; out in my opinion. Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
    <li> The smell is really bad.</li>
    <li> I pretty much never wear makeup, but when I need to jazz things up for an event, this stuff instantly transforms my look into something put-together and good-looking. I absolutely glow with this stuff on. My only explanation for the polarized reviews is that it works *really* well for some, and *really* badly for others. But if you are one of the lucky ones, this primer rocks. Personally I just use it under mineral powder, throw on a tiny bit of eyeshadow/eyeliner/blush, and then spend the night drowning in compliments about my makeup. Enough gushing, I just think it&#x27;s a very cool product.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for the price. It is very light and mixes well. About a pee size dolop goes a long way and will cover my entire face. I have very oily skin and this primer allows for my make-up to make it almost an entire day which is honestly a first for me.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne products, but not the prices. I&#x27;ve tried the Arbonne primer and this comes close enough that I&#x27;ll compromise and buy it instead. I use a SPF 30 sunscreen/moisturizer made by \\&quot;Say Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; on my skin first, which doesn&#x27;t glide on nicely, but is worth the effort. Then I put the Almay primer on. However, it does stink. (Once I put the rest of my products on my face and hair I don&#x27;t even notice the smell anymore.) The Almay primer does brighten my skin and reduce the appearance of my rosacea, but it doesn&#x27;t hide it completely. Once I put the Arbonne SPF 15 foundation on however, my redness is hidden, as are the large pores on my nose and my skin looks like porcelein. The primer makes my foundation glide on so much easier. I couldn&#x27;t easily spread my foundation before and it was looking chalky. The foundation wears so much better now with the primer. And I&#x27;m getting all sorts of compliments on my skin now, so I feel that this is a product worth using, in combination with a good foundation.</li>
    <li> excellent article, I arrive as expected and good quality, I leave satisfied. 100% recommended, is a serious and responsible seller.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was buy one get other 50% off. Tones down redness a little IF you use a lot. Stuff stayed tacky feeling and didn&#x27;t make a difference with foundation looked. Returned both bottles next day and bought covergirl with play primer instead</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this project is supposed to do for me</li>
    <li> Smooth and light and makes makeup glide on evenly. Great bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> It smells awful.  I have been trying it for the last week and I see very little to no change.  It does nothing for my redness and does not seem to even out my skin tone.  It works as a primer, but does nothing else that it says it does.</li>
    <li> I love Almay&#x27;s Smart Shade Perfect and Correct Primer. This is the first primer I have used, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It is lightweight, non-greasy, and moisturizing. I apply it as the second step in my makeup routine after my moisturizer. I love the way it feels cool and refreshing on my skin. As for how well it works, I have a lot of redness on my cheeks, nose, chin, and even forehead as a result of having acne-prone skin and sensitive skin, and Almay&#x27;s Perfect and Correct primer lightly reduces my redness and evens my skin tone while also providing a good base on which to apply makeup. I think I also like it because it is gentle, causes no irritation, and hydrates my skin as it primes. I will likely try another primer in the future for comparison, however right now I am happy and content with this one.  I have found that this primer works best if I apply it right after my moisturizer and wait a couple minutes before applying the rest of my makeup (which is only powder and blush for my face). Also, I purchased it online from Target, not Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tend to have several areas on my face that are reddish areas.  This primer works very well to conceal and blend this areas in with my makeup.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this primer because I&#x27;d been using a Stila One Step primer for a while now, which retails for $36.  I found this Almay one to work very well considering the price. I noticed a difference in the redness of my skin tone, which is one I bought this particular type of primer with the green corrector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It finished fairly matte and smooth, which is always a concern because I have oily and acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a decent drugstore product - I&#x27;d recommend this.  It does a pretty great job for what you pay.</li>
    <li> It came practically empty. Not worth it if it was nearly empty. I got 2 maybe 3 uses out of it</li>
    <li> Blegh! I&#x27;ve tried so many primers looking for the perfect one before I found the Too Faced primed and poreless. This primer from Almay smells like urine. Seriously. It&#x27;s nasty. Aside from the smell, the color correcting ribbons are useless and my face has never been so oily than when I&#x27;m using this. If you&#x27;re purchasing Almay for the price, go with the pink primer. It&#x27;s WAY better and about the same cost.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1W3K08K6J2L58]] If you would like to see more video on this Almay primer I have used it in makeup tutorials on youtube, username: lig4me. Another pro:it doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny or overly matte. This product performs well for the $$ but because of the smell and sting I have to give it 3 stars.I have tried 2 other primers, elf mineral primer; slick feel but dries up and flakes off, and bare essentials prime time which doesn&#x27;t stay put it makes my makeup slide and clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim and will be returning it asap. Firstly, it has the most disgusting smell which is not something I want on my face and secondly, it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than make my face sting. Worst \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; product I have ever purchased. Almay should be ashamed for even releasing this product. How this ever made it past inspections is beyond me.</li>
    <li> I could not live without this product, I suffer with a condition called rosecea (redness on my face).  I apply this primer before applying my make-up.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers said, this primer does smell a bit odd when you put it on, but the difference in your skin coloring is instant and the scent is NOT. It works wonders for smoothing out my flaws under makeup and leaves me looking better, longer.</li>
    <li> This product stinks literally and burns the hell out of my face after applying. Even after applying generous amounts of lotion on my face before applying..still stings! I have pretty sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t expect an Almay product to be so harsh. I would recommend Sephora&#x27;s primer it is so smooth and silky and actually works!</li>
    <li> I like this product--using a dab under foundation help even up the color.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this would cover the redness on my face so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear a lot of foundation. Whether or not i use this product I still need the same amount of foundation for coverage of the redness. My redness isn&#x27;t bad by any means for reference.  I also found this product makes me breakout if I have it on all day, so I definitely wouldn&#x27;t fall asleep with it on. I hope this works for you but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I&#x27;m going back to Smashbox. That worked for me.</li>
    <li> It has a horrible smell. I had to wash my face after five minutes of wearing it it smelled so bad.  Not worth the $15 dollars</li>
    <li> I have severe skin discoloration so I didn&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle worker and maybe that was a good thing, considering all the negative reviews. I think people expect way too much out of mid-grade products like this. Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different and just like every other skin-correcting product in existence, you take a risk on an allergic reaction. So to the people whose skin broke out, now you know this product doesn&#x27;t work for your skin and you can move on. There is no \\&quot;urine\\&quot; smell as 2 different reviewers have claimed. It smells like makeup to me which is never awesome but not horrible either. It has a nice light, mousse/cream-like consistency and (on my skin anyway) goes on nicely without a watery or greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the effects go, I use it the way I use most of my myriad skin discoloration treatment products--not to fix my skin but simply to decrease the contrast between the darker and lighter areas--and that&#x27;s exactly what it does. It doesn&#x27;t magically make my skin all one tone; it is part of several steps I take to diminish the \\&quot;scars\\&quot; the sun has left. Because I have to layer, I really like this Almay product because it goes on so lightly. It does not contribute to a layered or cakey look which is really important when you have a 9-step skin regiment before the regular cosmetics get applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t expect miracles, know your skin sensitivity, use it for what it actually is (not what it&#x27;s over-advertised for), and you&#x27;re far less likely to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product received very quickly.</li>
    <li> I am a make up junkie. I love love love it, and I&#x27;m happy spend big bucks if the product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I ran out of my usual green primer (and I have very red skin - I&#x27;m a red head with plenty of freckles!) and I didn&#x27;t have time to get to Sephora or Ulta to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured if it was complete junk, at this price I could bin it when I did get a chance to buy my usual brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been incredibly pleasantly surprised!!! It goes on super lightly - not cakey or heavy - and it does exactly what it is suppose to - evens out my skin tone, giving my foundation a base to adhere to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m just ducking out and about to run errands I feel completely confident in applying this primer and a light coat of powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight smell - but it is NO WORSE then any foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to friends and family!</li>
    <li> The strong urine odor of this product was so appalling that I consider it an act of bravery that I tried it on my face anyway.  It went on very smoothly, and did even out my skin tone, but it did not seem to absorb.  My skin felt sticky and oily all day.  Isn&#x27;t primer supposed to help set makeup and make my face LESS shiny?&lt;br /&gt;Then, the day after I&#x27;d used this product, my face was badly broken out! I was surprised and disappointed, since Almay products usually work well for my extremely sensitive skin.  Almay, please PULL THIS PRODUCT so that you don&#x27;t damage your good name among us sensitives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my search for a mattifying primer must continue.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I am disappointed with Amazon over this product as it arrived cracked and leaking all over the package. After salvaging what I could I tried to use a little to see if it was something I wanted to re-purchase at my local drugstore. After wearing it for the day I was less than thrilled with it. First of all it stinks to high heaven when rubbing it on your face. Luckily that smell went away after a while or maybe I just got used to it. Periodically throughout the day I checked my make-up to see how it was performing and while it looked okay I didn&#x27;t notice it taking too much redness out of my skin as advertised and it does not really even the skin tone that well. My make-up honestly didn&#x27;t look any better with this on than it did without primer all of the times before. Because of this I am on the fence about primers so I don&#x27;t know if I would replace this item or buy something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this primer (unexpectedly while shopping for something else, it just kinda caught my eye) and THEN looked at the reviews (I&#x27;m a review junkie). I thought \\&quot;oh crap, I just wasted my $$\\&quot; and thought about immediately returning it to the store. I then decided to take a chance since everyone&#x27;s skin IS different and WOW I love it! It helped tone down my redness, lighten my sun spots and just made my face overall look smooth and even (I couldn&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror lol). I finished with a tinted moisturizer and I can&#x27;t believe how well it looks! Oh and the 1st thing I did when I dispensed it was take a whiff. Based on others reviews I was expecting a nose curdling odor but I smelled nothing of the sort!! It smells like...makeup. I will def be buying this again.</li>
    <li> As a long-time almay product lover, I am hugely disappointed with this product. Does not live up to expectations/specifications. It did not do any of the things it claimed or any of the basic functions of a primer. The smell is horrible and lasts all day. The colors don&#x27;t blur or eliminate imperfections. The texture is sticky. Does not leave a smooth canvas to apply makeup. The stickiness keeps makeup from going on at all. Left an unpleasant shine/oiliness.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything at all to even out my skin tone, it felt greasy, and it even seemed to &amp;#34;enlarge&amp;#34; my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> it smells really bad.&lt;br /&gt;i tried to return it, but then i rejected.&lt;br /&gt;i wont recommend this primer at all.</li>
    <li> Green+Purple&#x3D;Gray. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer but I can put it on one side of my face and not the other and you can not see any noticable difference.  I would rate a five for moisterizer but as a corrector it is definately not noticable to the eye.</li>
    <li> Useless.  Not a good primer and the shade is shadeless.</li>
    <li> I was trying to decide between this and the Cover Girl primer, and I went with Almay because it is supposed to be better for your skin. Well, this is not. I never break out. I am 43 years old and have never had a product wreak such havoc on my skin. Cystic acne the very next day and a rash all over my face. My skin actually hurts, not just the spots...my entire face. The product is oily and sits on top of the skin without soaking in, leaving my face looking like a pizza!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going back and I will try another brand.</li>
    <li> this product its ok for me, I have never used before a premier but this one really correct your skin before make up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a couple of times and each time I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I like the idea of it, but I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin that would make me want to put up with the smell. Not sure why it has to stink so it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom.</li>
</ol>
