    <li> Very light cream and lightly scented. Its not an over bearing coconut  odor. Coconut oil is supposed to be good for you. I figured I would give this a try. I used it a few times on my face, knees, and elbows. Somewhat moisturizing but not enough for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice face cream and smells so nice also.  I do like it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great moisturizer without the greasy feel this is the product for you the price is great, the product is great, Amazon is great!</li>

    <li> Love this cream my hands feel smooth</li>
    <li> It exceeded my expectations!  Surpassed more expensive facial creams.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream I have tried in years! It leaves skin with a healthy glow and does not clog pores. I hope this is always available to order. I gave a jar to my mom and one to my sister and they love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I have been odering this product for years and it works for me...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am using as a moisturizer.  It is actually minimizing fine lines.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom who has very dry skin.  She LOVES this and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It has a wonderful smell too!</li>
    <li> Smells like a tropical island, feels great on the skin, doesn&#x27;t stay greasy too long.  I used it for massaging a sore ligament I had in my leg and it was actually an enjoyable experience.  I don&#x27;t know how it works on stretch marks or anything, but I did get comments about my newly smooth hand skin from the GF.</li>
    <li> If you get on Mason&#x27;s website, you can get the full list of ingredients. This is not a pure product and has ingredients I prefer to not put on my skin.  It smells great, but if you&#x27;re after a product free of parabens, I suggest you look elsewhere, I know I will.</li>
    <li> wonderful item,would buy again,thnx</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well as expected</li>
    <li> This is the second jar(and third) purchase. Not much is needed; it is creamy and disappears readily into my skin.  I use it on my face at night.  It isn&#x27;t made completely of coconut oil, but the product works well.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth and silky. It is not greasy like other coconut creams I have tried. Since I started using this brand, I noticed that some of the little brown spots on my hands have fadded away.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels but the fragrance is way to strong. However, it does,tend to go away after awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is absorbed into the skin and leaves no greasy residue.  I used it on my dry heels before bed and in the morning they were smooth and soft again.  I&#x27;m trying it on my crows feet ( no not the bird but my face).  I&#x27;m looking forward to some great results.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I put lavender oil in and put it on my babies feet.</li>
    <li> I had purchased my first jar when I was visiting in New Jersey because I liked it I did&lt;br /&gt;not know where to purchase it so decided to check with Amazon and am happy I&lt;br /&gt;found it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> The cream is great and effective on dry skin. Would like to see it available in a larger container.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, it is super soft and moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy.  I am very pleased and will reorder.</li>
    <li> Love this silky feeling lotion. :)</li>
    <li> Smooth and creamy, yet light.  My skin looks and feels so much better.  My face tends to be oily; however, as I age, it is less so.  I would use a lighter moisturizer in the summer and a heavier one in the winter.  This cream works best for me all year round.  AND, it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than all the others I&#x27;ve used. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to coconut products and have been looking for a face cream with coconut oil.  I received the product 2 days ago (great shipping time) and have only used it twice so am not able to give it a complete 5 stars.  So far, so good,</li>
    <li> Confession I didn&#x27;t buy this item through Amazon.  However I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon for providing a forum for sharing individual experiences. The first thing I noticed upon reading the ingredients is that \\&quot;coconut oil\\&quot; is never listed. Huh?  The first ingredient listed is Deionized water. Another \\&quot;Huh?\\&quot; by me.  I proceeded to use the product assuming that the long list of ingredients would be a breakdown of the coconut oil&#x27;s individual components. You know, what makes coconut oil.  With this product, my skin is moisturized no longer than it takes for water to evaporate. Beyond the scent of coconut, I detect nothing to indicate coconut or oil is being applied. (I have virgin coconut oil with which to compare.)  I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed and will not purchase \\&quot;Mason natural coconut Oil Beauty Cream\\&quot; from any source ever again.  Fool me once, same on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.</li>
    <li> Smells great, non greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> i find this cream to be non greasy and healing.  I developed a rash after using  a certain brand of gloves and used the cream on my hands.  It stopped the burning sensation and in one week my skin was almost back to normal.  I also use it as my daily  face moisturizing cream and I love the way it makes my face feel and the healthy tone it gives my face.  It works for me and I have tried many expensive products over the years so THANK YOU, Mason.</li>
    <li> This is easily absorbed, really softens hands and face!  The aroma of coconut is not something I like, but this has a very subtle fragrance.  Wonderful service!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and find it really helps my skin. My husband ordered it for me on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find in stores here.</li>
    <li> I have been using coconut oil for several years.  I thought I needed something a little more creamy and longer lasting.  I love this cream and it makes my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> like the way it feels on your skin  and the coconut smell is not to strong very happy I purchased this product</li>
</ol>
