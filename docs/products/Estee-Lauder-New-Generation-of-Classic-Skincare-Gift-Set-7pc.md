      <li>This makeup set is small but has the most required components.</li>

    <li> shadow compact was broken and pieces missing never did get a reponse from the sender. was missing some components</li>
    <li> Very Nice all products in the bag.</li>
    <li> I love  Estee Lauder but missed the \\&quot;gift w/purchase\\&quot; at Macy&#x27;s. When I e-mailed the third party vendor about how to choose BOLD they replied \\&quot;just e-mail the supplier\\&quot;. So, I ordered then e-mailed Herer and was told Amazon fulfills their orders randomly. So the lipstick I got doesn&#x27;t show up on me because I didn&#x27;t get the BOLD set. Other than that, the products are very good.</li>
    <li> to me they have deceived me. I received only a shadow and lips painted. in advertising or photo are two of each. This is called misleading advertising and is punishable by law. I get what I miss.</li>
    <li> Great make up &amp; fragrance products purchased these as stocking stuffer gifts for family members every year that they always love getting &amp; me giving</li>
    <li> I paid more than product is worth but its ok</li>
    <li> Ugh this picture is so misleading! The items came literally sample sized.. :( The eye shadows are half the size shown in this picture.. I wish I returned it but not worth the hassle. The price is good for the brand name only not for the amount of the product. I most likely won&#x27;t buy this set again as a gift. I had to buy something else to give with it because this alone is a joke</li>
    <li> It was a gift for a picky picky lady.  I don&#x27;t know if she liked it or not but hasn&#x27;t asked me to exchange it yet.</li>
    <li> From the picture it looks like I was beginning to sense eyeshadows but I only received one and that&#x27;s okay I understand that unity can&#x27;t send to to every person your purchases this but I would&#x27;ve liked to have had the two .</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow came all broken.</li>
    <li> It is fine.  I didn&#x27;t see where I was to chose the palette that best suits my coloring and received the other one. The one that doesn&#x27;t look good on me.  Overall probably too much $ but it is fine.</li>
    <li> This was advertised to have two tubes of lipstick. The bold color was missing--other than that I was happy with gift set.</li>
    <li> excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
    <li> Amazing thank you very helpful!

    <li> Delivery of the merchandise was fast product was intact it was everything that was expected from the pictures and descriptions it really made a great gift. Packaging was appropriate for the size container</li>
    <li> I really like this gift set but I didn&#x27;t choose a color is just one problem that&#x27;s all! (But you can contact seller if you need to choose it) I think this gift set is reasonable and valuable for someone who looking for brand name skincare.</li>
    <li> This pack was really bargain</li>
    <li> This makeup set is small but has the most required components. The night repair kit really works great and the Pure Color lipstick and eye shadow add charm to the beauty.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed, I thought product was as pictured. It&#x27;s shown with 2 shadow compacts and 2 lipstick, both different shades/colors  I got one of each ( not the ones I would have chosen)  , maybe description says get one of each, but if that&#x27;s the case, you don&#x27;t get to choose. Of course, I got the ones I was going give my friend. I can&#x27;t use the shade of lipstick I did get. Product still good quality and arrived when promised,  and all other stuff comes in bag shown ( super cute bag) Read description of what&#x27;s included before purchase.  You may be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> The item is to small for the price</li>
