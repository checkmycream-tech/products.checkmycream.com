<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These masks are a  wonderful buy.  They are very inexpensive and render good results when used in combination with a good moisturizer if your skin is dry.  Otherwise, they can be used alone to refresh your complexion.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I really like this face mask but I am non compliant so I can&#x27;t really tell you much about it.  The few times I used it, it did make my face feel tighter and refreshed but I should use it more often to provide actual results.</li>
    <li> I tried these collagen masks. They are really good. reasonable price with fast and free shipping. Plus, they have good smells.</li>
    <li> I like this mask and makes my skin feel great.But takes some practice keep it on.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin completely hydrated after use however it takes time to absorb which makes me wonder if it&#x27;s just too much product or maybe it requires more time for the contents to be completely absorbed by the skin so i leave it on for about 45 minutes sometimes mostly once a week.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that makes your skin soft and fresh, and smooth. Fast delivery. I will highly recommend this mask to all women with all types of skin. I will definitely use other masks of this seller. Thank you!</li>
    <li> What do you make this mask out of? What&#x27;s in this product?   My cousin works at a cosmetic company and as soon as he saw this mask on top of my desk, he told me not to use it ever. I asked him why. I mean I didn&#x27;t like how it smell and never felt like this mask ever moisturize my skin but I was shocked to hear what my cousin has to say about this product.   He said essence and mask sheet are the most important with face mask. If this mask cost approximately less than a dollar to produce, it&#x27;s obviously made with cheap cheap ingredients. He also added, in Asia where this kind of face mask was created and fully marketed, they would never use this kind of cheap mask on their valuable face. He said most of masks in Asia cost more than 4~7 dollars each, which I was very surprised but hey, it&#x27;s my face right? How much do I value my face skin? Obviously more than a 5 dollars each session..and it&#x27;s recommended at least twice a week so less than 10 dollars, which I think it&#x27;s cheap enough to take care my face skin from harsh sunlight.   I started to breakout and I am soooo mad at myself for trying this cheap mask!!!!! If I could, I would give zero star.</li>
    <li> Me encantó el cutis se siente mas hidratado y con un nuevo brillo, es necesario modificar el precio porque como hay que usarla varias veces a la semana se acaban rapidamente</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time ordering these.  They make your skin feel so soft and supple.  I use every last bit of it by rubbing it on my hands and feet after I take it off my face.  The next morning your skin is so smooth.  Love these!</li>
    <li> Good, but not as good as Loreal. Good price helps make up the difference.</li>
    <li> Great product, leave skin feeling moisturizer and smooth.</li>
    <li> These sheets seem to hold moisture well, when I put them on my face over my normal moisturizer. Then I leave it on a half hour, and rinse off. They are reusable (for me).</li>
    <li> I just tried this mask 2 times, and I am satisfied with the after effect. It&#x27;s very hydrating and feels good on my skin. I use this once a week. I&#x27;ve been looking for good masks from Asia, particularly Korea that are inexpensive. I&#x27;m glad I bought this. The shipping was super fast too!</li>
    <li> Collagen mask relaxes the skin and leaves look&lt;br /&gt;I had the occasion and my face is very cumbersome to work, so put a mask vital collagen and returned to my face&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;قناع الكولاجين يريح البشرة ويتركها نظرة&lt;br /&gt;كانت لدي مناسبة ووجهي مرهق جدا من العمل ، لذا وضعت قناع الكولاجين وعادت الحيوية إلى وجهي&lt;br /&gt;سأقوم بشراءه مرة أخرى</li>
    <li> I wish there was a cream  to go with the mask. They really work and help my face to feel fresh and rested.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel and look great. Soothing.</li>
    <li> I feel my face more tight and fresh.  I also tried the green tea but I like better the collagen mask</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with these masks.  They are inexpensive, but come soaking in juices and do their job.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR DRY SKIN , YOU MUST BECARFULL NOT TO USE IT IF YOU HAVE AN APOINTMENT THE SAME DAY , I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN BUT LIKE AN HOUR LATER I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME SPOTS CAME ON MY FACE</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit too rich for me. I want some masks that I can use everyday or every other day.</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto, lo recomiendo 100%, la calidad es como la describió el vendedor y llegó sin ningún contratiempo y en el estado mas bueno</li>
    <li> I used to buy collagen masks at Japanese one-dollar stores and those were a lot more rich and effective than this mask. It&#x27;s a bit too watery for my taste. It does work, however, so I will probably order another batch when I am out.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent value for the results. This will leave you skin baby soft and create a more youthful appearance. It should be used consistently to keep up that appearance.</li>
    <li> Great. I just love it. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. I would definitely recommend this product. I am planning on purchasing some more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a week for a few months. Definitely feel that my facial skin is not as dry as before.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for the price! My skin is noticeably smoother since I started using them right after derma rolling (I use a 2.0 once every 4 weeks). Though much of that can be attributed to the rolling, I think getting more collagen building nutrients into my skin is certainly complimenting the needling very well. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> but there were a little problem, produced some rashes on my face overnight.. but it was OK.. i like it</li>
    <li> My second order of these lovelies</li>
    <li> The product is amazing! After using it the skin feels soft, fresh and tightened. Great price and fast delivery! I am going to order more.</li>
    <li> I bought this before and am a repeat buyer. This is a good moisturizing mask at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I use these masks for 3 months. The skin became more elastic and soft. I recommended it for my friends.</li>
    <li> This product is written in an asian language and I was unable to identify its ingredients - didn&#x27;t use it out of fear that it had urea or some form of formaldehyde to  preserve it.</li>
    <li> Mine is dry skin and&lt;br /&gt;i have tried so many masks, but the result of this mask on my skin was wonderful. It gave my skin a new life with refreshing look. I was amazed to see my skin so smooth and supple.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know if this mask worked at all. after doing the mask, my skin felt really moisturized. but i feel that if i put a damp washcloth on my face, i could get the same effect.  after a couple of hours, this feel was gone. plus you have to look like a burn victim while applying the mask</li>
    <li> At this price, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong, so I gave it a try.  It&#x27;s a VERY cooling and soothing mask and my face felt great afterwords, but it didn&#x27;t last for long.  I guess I&#x27;m looking for a more creamy mask.  I&#x27;ve only tried one, maybe the effects will be better once I get into a routine.  I&#x27;ve used It Works in the past and really like them, but they&#x27;re just too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and those pesky forehead lines are starting to show up along with my laugh lines. Compared to the handful of anti-wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve used, this has shown me faster results. However, you have to keep using it to see permanent results.</li>
    <li> I felt very uncomfortable and I had even skin breakouts after using this product. I will not buy this product ever.</li>
    <li> Very good price. Makes my skin soft and clear. I use it once a week and it does what it claims. The smell is soothing and not strong at all.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel and look fresh after letting it stay on your face for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> I dont really have an odly shaped face, but this really does not fit me well, its hard to keep our of my eyes and it burns if it gets in them.  The smell is really not that bad, but its not pleasant either.  It does however, moisturize fairly well.  I only use it at night and would NEVER consider putting makeup on after.  It leave a sticky residue and I can&#x27;t imagine what it would feel like if i out makeup on after.</li>
    <li> NICE PAPER MASKS, VERY REFRESHING, I LEAVE THE MASK  ON MY FACE UNTIL IT DRIES, THE EFFECT IS TEMPORARY, DON&#x27;T EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware that I had ordered these! I must of had them on my &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; so here they came, and I tried them. They do make your face feel wonderful for a few minutes after use. I also have to say, that some things work better for certain people than others. I&#x27;m older, and if I were younger I might feel they were/are great. But, I can&#x27;t find too much at my age ( 60) that I have been completely satisfied with yet. So for a younger person, try them. For older, consider they aren&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
    <li> Definitely is like a spa in a package - Made my skin feel oh so nice afterwards and are inexpensive. love these.</li>
    <li> Great ! Very happy with this!</li>
    <li> Very hydrating and sticky but the cut is not great. My face is pretty round but this mask is huge! If you have a wide face this would be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I tried first before using in my costumer. Mask dries so fast. Inside the package there are not enough product.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Product is not expensive but not good quality at all.</li>
    <li> These collagen mask are great.  I use them about twice a week in the morning for about 20-30 minutes.  Afterwards my skin is so soft and my make-up glides on and looks great.  This is a really good product.</li>
    <li> I really like these masks, i use all sorts daily. I really like these though left me all soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I saw these full faced masks on You Tube and went looking for them but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on them since I wasn&#x27;t sure how they would perform.  It&#x27;s a perfect way to end a hard work week with a face mask.  It&#x27;s relaxing, hydrating and no fuss and muss to clean up.  Will definitely repurchase since these are so easy for weeknight masks!</li>
    <li> I have acnes, sun break-out eventhough I am already 30 years old. I have been using proactiv product which really help nothing but dry my skin and wrinkle it. So I try this masks just to get some moisturizer and BINGO, I can feel my face more lively even after the first use. I am really pleased with the result and will continue using this product. Affordable and Great result. totally recommended...</li>
    <li> I ordered the collagen masks but received the variety pack instead. I like them, but I really wanted just collagen since that&#x27;s my preferred mask. They are very nice and great quality. Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> This mask is very dry, checked expiration date is 2016 but it&#x27;s not mositured as it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to return or exchange but it doesn&#x27;t allow to do so.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and face really glows. I had no skin irritation and I have very sensitive skin. Careful when you unfold mask, it may tear in the area around eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mask. I used it 2 times, feel different. It helps wrinkle gone and my face smooth. worthy to have it!</li>
    <li> After a peel, I always use this product. You can also put it on the fridge and cool your face down . Love this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used two so far, but it&#x27;s very soothing and hopefully it&#x27;ll help my skin.  Will have to use all 10 of them to see if I&#x27;ll reorder.  So far I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
    <li> you do get an offer for a price that the person buying the masks came each by hand reaching its too high commercial value because I had to cancel each mail different price that&#x27;s too bad of you, please be more specific next time so they rid of misunderstandings,</li>
    <li> I love it! This product is inexpensive and works great! Collagen is what keeps your skin young and firm..so stock up ladies!(and men) I strongly recommend it.Put it on at night and you wake up feeling great and beautiful, I store mine in the fridge..and when you put it on it feels super refreshing!</li>
    <li> These are great, i like the feel of cooling and refreshing my face, I&#x27;m 70 and deep moisture is essential, I get that from this item&lt;br /&gt;Thank you........Elvira</li>
    <li> Feels nice but do not notice any lasting results.</li>
    <li> so fresh ! I doubt if there is more toit than  just feeling fresh. But feels great after using it. skin feels plump ,soft and glowing !</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  I do this one day a week for a allover facial fix.  Usually on Sundays as I prepare for another week of whatever comes my ways.  Love them.</li>
    <li> face looks so even after it!</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It&#x27;s so relaxing &amp; makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> feels nice when applying on face.</li>
    <li> MY FACE looks brighter and I think I maybe loosing my melasma</li>
    <li> There are a few other masks that I&#x27;ve been using pretty regularly and like more. They&#x27;re slightly pricier, but more moisturizing and has a softer cloth. My favorites are the &amp;#34;My Beauty Diary&amp;#34; masks-- you can find them for about $13-14 for 10 pieces.</li>
    <li> Love this facial, although the printing on the package was so small it was hard to read.</li>
    <li> Within the first use, my face was brighter and felt very hydrated. I use this mask every 3-4 days and use the liquid left from the mask as a moisturizer. When I begin to run out, I will surely be purchasing another set.</li>
    <li> I used these face masks when i was in Korea and they are great! The directions in English are limited so i would just like to add that even though it says 15-20 mins you are actually supposed to leave it on till it drys. YES! Make sure you get every drop out of that packet and onto your face and neck. You are also supposed to apply it to your neck as well but again the English directions are limited. Your face will feel smooth and soft. Also you might want to try the face peeling spray by hamo hamo or the face peeling gel by misha prior to applying the mask.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased, I thought it&#x27;s crystal colloid mask, because it shows on the picture, but the real thing is regular mask, so I didn&#x27;t use much, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s better than other brand or not.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Korean product.  It is traditional face mask.</li>
    <li> good products.the price is amazing too,thanks</li>
    <li> I use them all the time. They are very good.</li>
    <li> Collagen Essence Full Face Mask,  is an excellent product.  Every woman must use it.  I am first time user and it worked, I noticed the difference on my face inmediatelly after I used.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see not difference:-(&lt;br /&gt;After waittttttttt so long for, I used on me and my husband:-(&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY:-/</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Price is so good I can feel comfortable buying them often.  It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have read some of the reviews claim that the effects of the mask last only while you wear it and that after removing it the effects wear off. Maybe they are rinsing their face off afterwards, because this has not been my experience. I make sure my face is cleaned and toned. I wear the mask for about 20 minutes while doing other things, afterwards I remove the mask(and I do not rinse my face), I apply a very good, natural moisturizer over the collagen on my face to seal it in. My face stays baby soft and moisturized ALL DAY LONG. I do this 3-4 times a week and everyone has been commenting on the health of my skin. I can&#x27;t stop touching my own face because it&#x27;s so soft! I&#x27;d recommend this product to people who want to re-energize their skin. If you have sensitive skin, please test the product on a small area first. But I am happy with it and ordering more.</li>
    <li> I use these in facials and my clients skin looks amazing afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great full face mask and value product&lt;br /&gt;I would buy bulk of this for daily use....i recommend for everyone</li>
    <li> Please note that I purchased the Collagen Essence Full Face Mask by MJCare and not Neru Biotech Inc.  Somehow amazon only shows this Neru Biotech Inc on for me to review.  The package looks similar but the picture in the middle is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped going to a spa for facial probably in the last 2 years since the service of the one I went to had gone downhill.  Coming across this Full Face Mask at a price that is very reasonable, what the heck, why not try it?  Even it&#x27;s not good, not too much damage in term of money.  However, one that you may be concerned is whether you would have allergic reaction to it.  I was concerned also as I have sensitive skin and toward the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used it, I did a home \\&quot;facial\\&quot; first - steam, exfoliate and clean.  Then I put on the mask but I leave it on my face while working on my computer. By the time I realized, it&#x27;s been on for an hour.  The instructions say to leave it on for 20 min. The mask was sort of dry by the time and my face felt tight. After I lifted off the mask, my face felt baby soft.  Very nice and happy! I&#x27;ve used 8 mask so far and no allergic reactions after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week, I used it 3 times. Then I slow down to 2 times a week then 1 time a week.  I&#x27;ve learned some tricks now to get every drop of the essence and get my money&#x27;s worth.  I use it before I go to sleep at night now.&lt;br /&gt;1.  When I pull out the face mask (folded in quarters), it&#x27;s very wet.  So I wipe the excess on the edge of the mask over my face and neck first. Yes, neck too.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Then I unfold the mask and line it up to my face. Note, it&#x27;ll be a little off because our faces all have different sizes.  Just work with it.&lt;br /&gt;3.  I then lay in my bed either read or close my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4.  After 45 min - 1 hr, my face feels tight (signal for me the mask is drying).I take the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I cut open the pouch and scoop every drop out with my fingers and put it on my face and neck. Yes, my neck again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE VERDICT&lt;br /&gt;Not only does my face feel soft, the most dramatic difference I see is in the line (crease) across the front of my neck - used to be deep and obvious even when I stretched my neck straight up.  Now of course it&#x27;s still there but it&#x27;s light and smooth versus all the little crosses along the crease due to dryness and slightly loose skin.  Oh no, I&#x27;m not a senior citizen yet :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;Here, I&#x27;ve put myself as guinea pig.  I&#x27;ve also gotten my sister and sister-in-law trying it and buying it.  Since you are reading this, I&#x27;m recommending to you - yes, you also!  Be pampered and feel beautiful!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the soothing feel of this face mask.  It leaves my skin soft and nourished. It&#x27;s one part in a total skin care regime. Of course, the proof in any product is long term use and results.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell that.  But I really like the way it leaves me feeling.  I&#x27;ll give this a go for the long run.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and I can feel that the mask is working on my face. It tightens on certain areas of your face that needs the collagen. Very refreshing and smooth after the use of the mask. Plus, it whitens the skin.</li>
    <li> I love how soft and smooth my face feels after I use this mask.  I could not ask for a better product</li>
    <li> So far I love the product.  The mask makes my face feel soft.  My pores look smaller.  I will definetly repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have bought other face mask from here and they are all good. It makes my skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I like it because it makes my skin tighter and smoother, but if you have highly sensitive skin I would not recommend this item. Sometimes I break out in hives and stuff from using this.</li>
    <li> Great mask!  Bigger than usual size and fits real well.  I would have given 5 stars for the products, however I have a hard time opening the package.  I end up using scissors and cutting masks inside several times:(  That is why -one star</li>
    <li> it is really good product. very comfortable for my skin/love it will definitely buy more when i need .i use it almost everyday before going to bed.</li>
    <li> It works. Give one piece to my friend and she likes it too</li>
    <li> it looks nice, and very effective. No problem during the using, highly recommand.</li>
    <li> This product has been fantastic for me so I recently ordered several packs at once. I can really feel the healing they offer when I take the mask off, and still can well into the next day. I drink a lot of water, so I think that is important too. My skin is dewy when I am finished and I try to do one to two a week before bed and after my deep cleansing routine. It is also very relaxing and easy to apply. I recommend the product completely! I&#x27;ve used some of the others offered by this company and I think you just can&#x27;t go wrong. I do cut the packet open when I am done with the mask and use the excess as a pre-moisturizer too... which is a really great thing as well. Try it! Your regular moisturizer after will seal in the goodness.</li>
    <li> Today I came from work and my masks were waiting for me on my mailbox, so I decided to give a try, I took before and after pictures and compared. It gave my tired face an immediately lift and glow, My skin looks much brither it tight all my pourous and soften my expression marks. I will order some more right away to make sure I am stuckup to bad we can post before and after pictures here.</li>
    <li> I wear it and when I took off I had very dark and sunken eyes, don&#x27;t understand why.If Neru Biotech has the answer please contact me andlet  me know.</li>
    <li> This mask sheet left my skin moisturized, firm and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to use it when you skin feels tired.</li>
    <li> Nice way to replenish my skin. Wonderful to wear at night after my evening shower before I head to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Olga</li>
    <li> These are very good masks. After I get done using it, I put the used one in a zippy bad to use for later. When I take off the mask I can see the difference. Easy to use and I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It was a okay product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaint about the masks.&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of a good deal for the price and the quantity.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice face mask.. I ordered this when i was in USA. It makes your skin tighter, more elastic, glowing...&lt;br /&gt;Loved It!!</li>
    <li> Just an ok product to me.  I had something else before and liked it better.  Does not seem to be as effective as a face product I previously used.  Maybe something in the cloth changed.</li>
    <li> Only used it once because it made my skin itchy and I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results. It&#x27;s very inexpensive, but I don&#x27;t think it works....</li>
    <li> ok to use,but not good as expected. i think it will be helpful when using on dry skin. fine product.</li>
    <li> Awesomeness! I love the masks! perfect for relaxation at the end of the day and they make your skin look amazing!</li>
    <li> Something everyone needs! Moisturises my skin and great for acne prone skin too.</li>
    <li> This is one of my best products ever I&#x27;ve to buy it every time I&#x27;m out of it because is the only one that really works on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the tipe of skin that you can&#x27;t use any kind of products in the market,  my skin finally finded a solution for hydrating and it took out the dry apparience from my skin problem.</li>
    <li> I like this one! It was quite moist and covers the eyes as well</li>
    <li> Fantastic, immediate results.</li>
    <li> And I keep re-ordering it. You must follow the directions properly and not rush. But in a couple of weeks you will love the results. Please try.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product.  Easy to use and feels great on my skin. No messy clean up afterwards.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this years earlier....it is worth every penny of it and would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get it, I hope you can give me a reason, but I really want it, you can return my good</li>
    <li> Step One: After cleansing face, soothe your face with tonic water. (Seriously, tonic water?)&lt;br /&gt;Step Two: Tap two or three times before opening pouch. (Tap?)&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it&#x27;s pretty clear the directions (the English directions which are way at the bottom after Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian and Arabic) are written by someone who is translating Korean to English.  Can I assume one doesn&#x27;t need to run to the store and get tonic water? I would have preferred a product with very clear directions in English.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these masks a couple of times, but I feel they really do plump up and refresh my tired winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;I might suggest using one just before you&#x27;re going to wash your hair anyway, because the mask is a generous&lt;br /&gt;size (and I don&#x27;t have a tiny, petite face) so it reaches right up to the hairline.  I had absolutely no bad reaction to&lt;br /&gt;them, left me with softened skin and a soft natural glow, so I plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> Not really as good as other masks. Just a mediocre mask that is cheap. The mask is made with this weird cotton sheet that doesn&#x27;t have enough essence. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected to. It did leave me with moisturized skin for about an hour and then I felt like I needed to apply something else to keep my face hydrated overnight. I rather recommend the brands &amp;#34;beauty diary&amp;#34; masks or Klair&#x27;s masks.</li>
    <li> Actually one of a few things I ordered that never came. I ordered a lot of different things at once &amp; when I was going through what I have gotten, I realized this never came?</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used them twice but i already feel the difference in my skin and it looks less tired lol so i would recommend this masks. also they&#x27;re very inexpensive so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> I bought these masks at such a great deal that i ended up buying 10 more. Great price and leaves my face looking refreshed and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;I store my masks in the refrigerator ( great during these hot summer days ) for a relaxing, cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;With the extra serum in the pouch i store that in a little container for next day touch ups.</li>
    <li> I like using this mask. It seems to be helping and does the job.</li>
    <li> I usually use this mask at night. My skin feels super moisturized after, although I can&#x27;t tell if it lasts because I use so many products at night. But the next morning when I wake up any breakouts that I had will always be clearer and my skin will be waaay calmer. I also purchased the faceshop real nature masks and they are not nearly as moisturizing as these although they do have a similar effect on breakouts. These masks also have a really subtle scent in comparison, which is nice. If you are looking at both, buy these!</li>
    <li> I much like. My skin becomes very soft and much smooth. Looks fresh and young. I Shall recommend my girlfriend</li>
    <li> I loved them!!! they are great and are very refreshing! 100% recommended.&lt;br /&gt;My face changed a lot! I really loved them</li>
    <li> I would def recommend this one. Acne or not. It refreshes your skin ans leaves it soft. I use it once per week.</li>
    <li> This product is from Korean, from the instruction on the back of the pack. It is alright with this price. It comforts the skin and feel very relaxed.</li>
    <li> I use this mask as part of my weekly facial hydration routine, but I dont expect miracles. For the price, this mask is a great value. The mask is very generously soaked in the serum. It took an hour to dry out completely. There is enough serum left in the bag for me to apply to my neck and decollete. The sheet is larger than the other masks I am used to. It goes beyond my hairline and jaw line, which is great because I can fold the sheet over and wrap the jaw line which is the area that I overlook the most. My skin feels smooth and soft afterwards.  I will recommend this mask as part of skin hydration routine. It really does the job.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try it.  I have a mild case of rosacea.  This product instantly took the redness and itching away.  Several of my friends noticed how clear and smooth my skin had become.  I use this mask 2-4 times a week depending on my need.  I use a moisturizer 10 mins after I take off the mask.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!  This is a must try.</li>
    <li> I have used these masks before. They do work to temporarily soften wrinkles.</li>
    <li> the product is not worth it.  it did not reach my expectations.  i would not recommend it to anyone. not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product and it definitely hydrates my skin and feels refreshing :) I use it 2 times a week and overall just feels hydrating more so then anything. It was delivered very quickly with an extra mask as a gift which was very thoughtful. I&#x27;m not sensitive to many things and my skin normally needs time to get use to new products so mild to little random break outs occurred but they go away. New products need time to get use to so give it time but its great overall. (from a male perspective)</li>
    <li> Love these Face Masks...they work and are affordable.  I can now skip salon facials that always seem to irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> good price, great product, I noticed my skin looks better after the mask , specally if I putit on at night. I wake up looking rested , and my skin tone is more youthful&lt;br /&gt;you will not regretitbuying  , if the price stays as good as it was when I bought I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I love these masks! My face definitely feels nourished after and during use! They have a nice smell. I will reorder!</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply, easy to remove, works great. Feels great on your face, and works. No bad surprises here.</li>
    <li> The package made it look like a knock-off product, but I used most of it and it didn&#x27;t cause skin problems so I assume it is ok.</li>
    <li> Loved this and I use it after my mt needle roller treatment.  It refreshes and minimizes redness after treatment.  I will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Just found out about face masks. Have only used it a few times. I have a bit of difficulty separating it to make a full mask. Does not leave my face feeling as moist as I would like</li>
