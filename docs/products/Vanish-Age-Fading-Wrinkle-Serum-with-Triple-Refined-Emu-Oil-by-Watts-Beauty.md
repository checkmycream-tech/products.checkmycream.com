      <li>I don&#x27;t like it because it feels like baby oil and does not absorb quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is my very first experience with Emu oil.</li>
      <li>I decided to try it after reading all the positive reviews, and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I slather it on, morning day and night and the oil absorbs very well into the skin - smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and so far been pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t see any changes and very much cheaper than competitive emu oils.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a recent convert to emu oil - I love how it moisturizes, and I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in wrinkles and sun damage since I started using it a year or so ago.  </li>
      <li>all - actually noticed the crows feet again - did better with my Olay Regenerist</li>
      <li>My wrinkles really are VANISHING!</li>
      <li>This is better then then regular Emu Oil.  </li>
      <li>I estimate the bottle lasting one more month.  </li>

      <li>It really does work!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I use in the morning, and when I get home in the evening.</li>
      <li>Fine lines around eyes are filling in, blemishes are lightening, and the deep laugh lines are plumping in.  </li>
      <li>My skin can be sensitive so it reacts pretty quickly to a products it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;like\\</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s easy enough to touch it up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Immediately after the very first application my skin felt uneblievably soft, non-greasy and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure as my face is very sensitive to topical moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>I use it every night after my regular vitamin E moisturizer, and it is smooth and very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any changes.</li>
      <li>It will smooth those lines out and make you look 10 years younger.</li>
      <li>I wash my face with a gentle exfoliating wash.</li>
      <li>For real.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help, either.</li>
      <li>Once in a while I use the oil as an overnight treatment on my whole face</li>
      <li>but ,I really want to see results with my wrinkles  </li>
      <li>so much-</li>
      <li>It just seems to be very restorative on the skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I thought this might be a gimmick like so many other wrinkle creams, but for $15 thought what the heck.</li>
      <li>I live in CT, so the real test will be in the winter.  </li>
      <li>The product last a very long time making it a real bargain for such good product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product as it has become a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have battled acne all of my pre-teens, teens and adult life!  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
      <li>Love this oil over or mixed with my other face care products.  </li>
      <li>Use first thing in the morning, last thing at night.</li>
      <li>not sure how long it is going to take to see results for the wrinkles to fade , but it does make your skin soft and your lips soft too good on hands as well</li>
      <li>Full refund is expected!</li>
      <li>Within just a few weeks I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>This product is clear and runny.</li>
      <li>This is a terrific product that absolutely lived up to its claims.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel soft and supple.</li>
      <li>I used the emu oil faithfully over the course of several weeks and had very noticeable benefits.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product even for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Spend the extra money, get the real stuff.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I did not break out</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have never tried Emu Oil before, I have been using it for several weeks now and all I can say is wow has it been amazing on my skin. It says on the bottle that it is an anti-inflammatory oil and i have even used it on a really bad inflamed bug bite on my leg. It just seems to be very restorative on the skin. Mostly it has been used on my face, with really nice results. I would highly recommend this product as it has become a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Love this oil over or mixed with my other face care products.  If you use glycolic washes or treatment, you may want to consider using this afterwards.  The bottle with the dropper works fine for easy control over how much you want to use. The product last a very long time making it a real bargain for such good product. For me, there is no offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;I put on a light cream, add Marie Veronique sunscreen, them use my powder foundation.  Just let the oil dry a little prior to using your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I recently tried Vanish,the best age &amp; wrinkle fading, moisturizing serum. My skin was always very dry. I could not find anything to moisturize my face plus treat and repair my wrinkles. It really does work! Within just a few weeks I noticed a huge difference in my skin. My wrinkles really are VANISHING! Thanks so much-</li>
    <li> This oil feels like baby oil but more watery and oily.  Total waste of money and did not sooth or heal my skin. I have never written a review but I really needed something to heal my skin and am so dissaponted I waited for such a poor product with awful quality and results. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this oil is very good.  I use it every night after my regular vitamin E moisturizer, and it is smooth and very moisturizing. I&#x27;d recommend this product even for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the product does what they say it will do which makes it a very expensive bottle of oil. The program would not let me submit wtih no stars, which is what I would give the product based on the claims for the products usage.</li>
    <li> I used the emu oil faithfully over the course of several weeks and had very noticeable benefits.  Very fine lines vanished (really!) and deeper lines diminished noticeably.  My husband even commented on the difference.  Further, my complexion is pinkish from rosacea, and the emu oil took some (not all) of the pink from my skin.  Finally, the skin on my cheeks had been inexplicably rough as well, and the emu oil smoothed my skin.  This is a terrific product that absolutely lived up to its claims.</li>
    <li> This emu oil works very well and is by far the best value I have found. I have already reordered and will make sure to always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I thought this might be a gimmick like so many other wrinkle creams, but for $15 thought what the heck. Ordered it and it arrived. I used it twice and saw a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and have to say it is the best, hands down, moisturizer and wrinkle reducer I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s about 50 and experiencing the reality of a few wrinkles where nothing used to be. It will smooth those lines out and make you look 10 years younger. For real.</li>
    <li> Could not have asked for a smoother transaction.  Timely delivery and intact product.  Thank you !</li>
    <li> This product is so-so...I dont notice any difference in my skin and it is pricey. I would not buy again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any changes. That&#x27;s me...maybe it works for others. I like to try things out. This was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product because it had so many good reviews.The first day I used this triple refined Emu oil it felt great, it made my skin feel soft, but after a week it actually dried out my skin, and made matters worse. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, maybe I am allergic to it. All I know is I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all - actually noticed the crows feet again - did better with my Olay Regenerist</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had a severe rash (redness) on my face and with that extremely dry facial skin as well.  On top of it I had an outburst of pimples.  I went to the dermatologist who prscribed me a steroid cream (which didn&#x27;t work).  I then researched and found out that emu oil is supposed to be soothing for rashes/dry skin.  It actually worked!  My skin normalized over the course of about 1 1/2 weeks.  The redness and dryness was gone and even the pimples disappeared (I was concerned putting &#x27;oil&#x27; on my face would make the pimples worse).  I now use a generous amount of the emu oil around my eyes every night (I only use a tiny drop in the am because it&#x27;s oil and it will make your mascara run).  Once in a while I use the oil as an overnight treatment on my whole face (I&#x27;m not doing that every night because it makes you look shiny).  I&#x27;m also impressed that my &#x27;eye wrinkles&#x27; have seemed to softened (and I didn&#x27;t even buy it for that purpose).  I like how it makes my skin seem more hydrated so that wrinkles are not so noticeable.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got sucked in again thinking this was going to be some miracle skin renew.  Just average.  I will use it but not buy again.</li>
    <li> This oil goes on very easily. Just follow the directions on the bottle. My skin feels so smooth and silky afterwards. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for people with dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. It&#x27;s unbelievable. I&#x27;m 55. No one can guess my age. Not kidding. My skin looks radiant. And I swear those little \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; in my forehead are getting fainter. It has reduced wrinkles around my eyes and mouth, too. This works so amazingly well. I have two girlfriends already hooked on it with me. And I no longer have to buy the $50 1-oz. moisturizer that was costing me a bundle per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip: put it on and let it soak in about 10 minutes before applying foundation. Use first thing in the morning, last thing at night. And - for a nice fresh glow -- dab a drop on your hands and pat onto your cheeks before going out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and so far been pleased with the results.  I live in CT, so the real test will be in the winter.  The air gets drier and with the heat on in homes, offices and other buildings it can be a challenge to keep my eye area moisturized. I&#x27;m hoping this will help since every eye cream I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture to last through the day.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference even in the first couple uses. I slather it on, morning day and night and the oil absorbs very well into the skin - smoothly.  There&#x27;s not a layer of gook and absorption doesn&#x27;t take long. I am prone to breakouts and this oil I can use all over, even my problem areas, without any issue.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a smell that I can notice.</li>
    <li> I have never used any emu oil based products before, but reading the reviews and doing my own research prompted me to buy this product. I am 40, and have mocha brown skin and some blemishes.  I have very sensitive skin and have battled acne all of my pre-teens, teens and adult life!  I do not have deep wrinkles but have slight creases around eyes,some puffiness and defined laugh/expression lines.  I have been using this for 2 months and have about 25% of the 1/2 oz. bottle left. I estimate the bottle lasting one more month.  Bottomline I am glad I bought it! It&#x27;s the first thing I use in the morning, and when I get home in the evening. Immediately after the very first application my skin felt uneblievably soft, non-greasy and moisturized.  Even areas that I have had an \\&quot;oil issue\\&quot; has ceased to be a problem. I have been getting the results that I anticipated. Fine lines around eyes are filling in, blemishes are lightening, and the deep laugh lines are plumping in.  I love the Vanish Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER INFO:&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use the product. I wash my face with a gentle exfoliating wash. I found that the product works best if your face is still a little damp after your rinse. The product goes on smoother.  You only need 2-3 tiny drops per application for your entire face.  A little does a lot!!note:  We all know the benefits of drinking more water!  This always helps.</li>
    <li> I already use the Emu oil and thought this might work on my face!  Wasn&#x27;t sure as my face is very sensitive to topical moisturizers.  I was pleasantly surprised that I did not break out and this has worked phenominally!  I would recommend you try this on especially dry skin!</li>
    <li> fine lines are disappearing, no odor.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and i feel like I can see a difference already after less than a month.  Will buy again,</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks not sure how long it is going to take to see results for the wrinkles to fade , but it does make your skin soft and your lips soft too good on hands as well after I apply i just rub my hands  but ,I really want to see results with my wrinkles  any one know if it works for this as it says it does? or is it just a good moisturizer for the face ?</li>
    <li> I am seeing a difference after a few weeks of use.  It&#x27;s not greasy and just a drop or two mixed with my moisturizer makes my skin happy.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product to use at night. Makes your skin feel soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only started using the Emu Oil.  It does feel like something that&#x27;s really good for my skin.  I don&#x27;t know that I look 30 years younger. . maybe that will come with time LOL.</li>
    <li> I just got some for me.  She is 88 and loves this oil.  She claims that it has helped the dark spots.  We shall see.</li>
    <li> I like this product buy find it is best to use at night.  It is an oil so I use it sparingly but it offers great moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to be ordering any more cosmetic items online that haven&#x27;t bought before.  However, I do think the ad may have been from another site.  Warning - question anything Dr. Oz recommends.  At least one item ordered from another site was a total rip-off.  This at least felt like it was helping though didn&#x27;t see any changes and very much cheaper than competitive emu oils.</li>
    <li> This is my very first experience with Emu oil. I decided to try it after reading all the positive reviews, and I was not disappointed. This lightweight oil soaks right in! I use it at night after cleansing, on my face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and even my hair. During the day,I apply just a tiny bit before my primer and make up and it does not interfere with the application or wear. In just a few weeks of use, twice a day, I have noticed improved skin texture (softness) and tone.  My skin can be sensitive so it reacts pretty quickly to a products it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;like\\&quot; but I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation or break outs with this product so far, which is a good sign. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to emu oil - I love how it moisturizes, and I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in wrinkles and sun damage since I started using it a year or so ago.  The other brands I&#x27;ve tried are a white viscous liquid that spreads almost like a gel until my body heat warms it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vanish serum is the consistency of water, and I find that it drips out of the dropper before I can get it to my face or fingertip, and that wastes the product.  It does moisturize just as well as the other emu oil products I&#x27;ve tried, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, but the watery consistency doesn&#x27;t make me a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that it&#x27;s much more expensive than regular emu oil.  At $21 per ounce, I definitely won&#x27;t buy it again.  I also was a little put off by the poorly-printed, gushing brochure that comes with the bottle - hinting that Oprah Winfrey and other movie stars use it and that it&#x27;s a huge Hollywood secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is Pro Emu Oil 2 oz. for $10.95:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/PRO-EMU-OIL-2oz-Certified/dp/B001DKK7Y0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1364302919&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;emu+oil</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money! This product should be ban from being sold on Amazon; my face reacted violently. Customers need to be warn of violent side effects, itchy painful, red blotches, horrible. Full refund is expected!</li>
    <li> This product is a  rip off. Spend the extra money, get the real stuff. This is either mineral oil or vitamin e oil. Emu oil is white, thick and creamy. This product is clear and runny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old with Meadium Brown skin I started to notice small wrinkle lines around my eyes and deeper lines on both sides of my mouth. I researched and purchased Emu Serum, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing a BIG difference in the lines around my mouth they&#x27;ve faded ALOT and the lines around my eyes are GONE!! Today I am happy to let everyone know \\&quot;IT WORKS\\&quot;.  My skin feels wonderful and looks younger too! The FREE BONUS for me is that my FINGER NAILS are growing stronger and faster.</li>
    <li> This is just an oil that you put on your face.  I don&#x27;t like it because it feels like baby oil and does not absorb quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t really help, either.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this did anything for me at all. I had hopes that it would work but just a pure waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about two months and does seem to help with fine lines.  I am 48 and in the sun I do a lot of maintainence on my face and this does seem to work.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is my second order</li>
    <li> Just started using this and it seems to be working well.  I don&#x27;t use it during the day, just at night.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, noticed absolutely no difference in the appearance in my skin, wrinkles or anything else, just saying</li>
    <li> Have purchased for myself and others.</li>
    <li> Great!! Really really moisturizing and healing without overloading the skin, it got rid of dry sore patches around my eyes I&#x27;d had on and off for a few months - nothing else seemed to clear them ( I tried!) and this healed them in a few days.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face day and night for over a month now and my skin is neither oily nor dry, really plump and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt; It tends to make my eye make up dissolve after a few hours but it&#x27;s easy enough to touch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase it again and again I expect!</li>
    <li> It is perfect for my skin to use as a moisturizer. I use Retinol and it dries my skin, emu oil works perfect fot it. I have no more dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is better then then regular Emu Oil.  It&#x27;s light and absorbs so it&#x27;s good for daytime.  It does make your skin feel smooth but it is not as moisturizing as Livpurely Coconut Oil which I use at night.  It also does nothing to change the appearance of your skin the way that Livpurely coconut oil does.  So it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
