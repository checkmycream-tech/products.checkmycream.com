      <li>Love love.</li>
      <li>just okay.</li>
      <li>I would compare it to \\&quot;TIGI Catwalk Curlesque Curls Rock\\&quot; but even better because it&#x27;s lighter.  </li>
      <li>, this is my go to mousse now :-)</li>
      <li>you are looking for a great mousse, I highly recommend Dove Damage Therapy Curl &amp; Sculpt Defining Mousse  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I am in class all day, toward the end of the day if my hair started becoming windblown, I would just head to the restroom</li>
      <li>Great for naturally wavy curls.</li>
      <li>It is exactly the texture of whipped cream and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>I have curly fine hair</li>
      <li>I think most of us curly and wavy haired ladies are used to the tried and true mousses of the years that are light and airy.</li>
      <li>My hair is bouncy, light and holds up well</li>
      <li>Cheap though</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair frizz free all day.</li>
      <li>It was really fabulous....</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>but it feeling product free.</li>
      <li>I have always used Dove&#x27;s Curl and Sculpt and loved it for the soft shiny curls.</li>
      <li>It is a little oily, but my hair looks shiny and healthy, and the curls are beautiful.  </li>
      <li>While it does not have the amazing scent as Sebastian whipped cream, it sure works the same!</li>
      <li>Another thing I do appreciate is that you get quite a large bottle of the stuff, I&#x27;m expecting to be able to use this for two months before having to determine if I&#x27;ll repurchase or try another product.</li>
      <li>Holds curls nicely, while keeping hair soft.  </li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
      <li>I have very fine curly hair and have tried almost every product on the market from drugstore to high end salon brands and this stuff is the best for my hair hands down!!!  </li>
      <li>However, it leaves a sticky residue on my hand...which I haven&#x27;t experienced with other brands.</li>
      <li>It does just ok in high humidity</li>
      <li>It smells great, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, or make my hair crunchy.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine, but naturally curly.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely, but I have fine, curly hair and it left my hair crunchy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light, and I would think that those people just have greasy hair or put way too much</li>
      <li>I have been using Dove Nourishing Curls Whipped Cream Mousse for a few months now and it has turned out to be a great product.</li>
      <li>All in all, I could see where this product would not work for quite a few people, but it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
      <li>The product is great for curly hair, smoothing the frizz, bringing out the shine, keeping the curl and the bounce, but not feeling sticky or heavy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Perfect for curly thick hair or straight hair to make a wavy style.</li>
      <li>Hair comes out ok but feeling like your hair has something on it to manage it rather than the old mousse managing you hair</li>
      <li>If I use the appropriate amount, it dries soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life I can wear my hair down and feel like it looks great</li>
      <li>This product is just right for it.</li>
      <li>I have curls that need to have the right cut and the right product or they are just &amp;#34;wavy.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>but it melts away quickly leaving it soft, light</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have very curly frizzy hair....have used many products on my hair over the years. I would say this product works better than most expensive ones. Many great products have not worked for me but this product happens to work perfectly for a fraction of the price. Keeps my hair under control without stiffness. I do have to use a lot though.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mousse! My hair is very fine, but naturally curly. This is the only mousse that has made my hair full and feeling thick at the ends so that I can wear it longer. Usually I keep it short because it thins out and gets stringy. At first I thought it was too oily, but after using it, and you only need a very little, I love how it makes my hair fill out. I mostly use it on the ends of my hair and not throughout or toward my scalp. I&#x27;m having trouble finding in stores now. I just hope Dove keeps making it because I don&#x27;t want to wear my hair short anymore.</li>
    <li> I thought I was cursed with my hair until I used this product :D My hair isnt crunchy and well im in love!</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair like when I was a child and I had springy hair. But halfway through the mousse will get stuck. Here is a method that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dip the nozzle of the mousse upside down on really hot water and the mousse stuck in the nozzle will eventually flow out. Just don&#x27;t dip the entire mousse bottle or do it for a long time. Remember: it is flammable.</li>
    <li> This Dove mousse creates volume, reduces frizz, encourages curls but is too sticky. Dove&#x27;s previous mousse wasn&#x27;t sticky at all. I lived it and I cry a little every time I think of it. It was really fabulous....this mousse is just okay.</li>
    <li> Nourishing Curls, Whipped Cream Mousse and was really disappointed. I&#x27;ve been a Dove brand loyalist for YEARS and this mouse doesn&#x27;t feel or smell like the Dove brand. The mousse feels chemical-ly unnatural, really heavy and greasy on my hair. Even my scalp felt sticky. If you have thick waves or curls I don&#x27;t recommend this product. If you are looking for a great mousse, I highly recommend Dove Damage Therapy Curl &amp; Sculpt Defining Mousse  [[ASIN:B0017O61ZG Dove Damage Therapy Curl &amp; Sculpt Defining Mousse, 7]] but good luck finding it, as dove discontinued it and replaced it with this Whipped Cream crap.</li>
    <li> I have searched all my life for something that combines the softness of conditioner with the curling of mousse. Love love. Just don&#x27;t use to much. It&#x27;s nice and thick.</li>
    <li> But that&#x27;s not a bad thing. I think most of us curly and wavy haired ladies are used to the tried and true mousses of the years that are light and airy. This Dove formula is very thick, and to me, feels like dessert mousse. With that being said, I definitely should use less of this than the lighter formula of Tresemme mousse that I alternate with. I say &amp;#34;should&amp;#34;, because I find it hard to break the cycle of using an apple-sized dollop of mousse for my long, thick hair... and then I&#x27;m left with either wasting half of the Dove mousse or forcing too much onto my head and then it WILL dry crunchy. If I use the appropriate amount, it dries soft and bouncy. I would say there is kind of a learning curve with this because of that, which is silly to say when dealing with hair products, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> i had a hard time finding a mousse that is light and perfect for my thin hair. i love this product it smells so good, and when you add a little on your hands and rub it feels so thick on your hands and hair but it melts away quickly leaving it soft, light and it holds your hair nice and neat all day. The top of the bottle its shape just like a whipped cream bottle so cool, and it comes out just like it, leaving this wonderful smell on your hair and the price is cheap, i bought at walmart for $3.49 i think im gonna stock up on this item before everyone realizes how good this product is and run out lol, great for women and men with thin hair.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I can buy this online, because I can&#x27;t find it at my local store anymore.  The product is great for curly hair, smoothing the frizz, bringing out the shine, keeping the curl and the bounce, but not feeling sticky or heavy.  It also feels like it is nourishing for my hair.  I have very coarse, thick, moderately curly, long hair.  This product is just right for it.</li>
    <li> its very greasy but whats good in that respect is very very little needed</li>
    <li> I have natural waves in my hair and I used to try different types of hair mousse every time I went shopping. Last summer, I discovered Dove&#x27;s cream mousse and have religiously used it since! Unlike other mousses, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling hard and looking super crunchy, if I use a small amount and evenly disperse it, my hair doesn&#x27;t look like it has mousse in it at all! I also love the smell! It is very fresh and faint so it doesn&#x27;t smell like a strong perfume like other mousses do. If you are hesitating buying it, I would recommend trying it because it has worked so well for me!</li>
    <li> to thick and makes hair greasy</li>
    <li> I love dove products and this one is no different however I was surprised when I walked into my bathroom and saw my boyfriend using it.  haha so works for him and her. :)</li>
    <li> Smells lovely, but I have fine, curly hair and it left my hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells great, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, or make my hair crunchy. It leaves my hair frizz free all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is kinda sticky but definitely keeps my curls curly! I would recommend to a friend! etc. etc. etc.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding this is a local store and it really works on my hair.</li>
    <li> Holds curls nicely, while keeping hair soft.  It does just ok in high humidity (nothing works great in that weather!)</li>
    <li> If you have really curly or wavy thick unruly hair like I do, this is the first mousse i have ever used that worked. it makes your hair soft and holds the curl for days. i have stock piled this stuff.</li>
    <li> Keeps my curls bouncy all day, even in humidity, without the crunch and stiffness of many other products. Great for naturally wavy curls.</li>
    <li> I had been using Sebastian whipped cream for years and decided to try this as cheaper alternative. While it does not have the amazing scent as Sebastian whipped cream, it sure works the same! The foam comes out thicker than most mousse products but will not weigh your hair down. I recently had a baby and my hair has begun to fall out, so it&#x27;s not quite as thick as it was a few months ago but the product still works just as well. My hair has a lot of natural curl, is fine with medium thickness. Used in conjunction with john Frieda&#x27;s frizz serum, this has made my daily hair routine a &#x27; 1 &#x27; on the high maintenance scale.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dove Nourishing Curls Whipped Cream Mousse for a few months now and it has turned out to be a great product. While initially I was wary from switching to brands from my former hair products (Toni and Guy Curlesque), being a college student I found out that this product was not only more economically friendly but had great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mousse is light on hair and yet keeps my hair (extremely curly and can get frizzy in the humidity) in check. It works throughout the day and keeps all strands defined and in place. Also, it is not harsh on hair and even after using it my hair still feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am in class all day, toward the end of the day if my hair started becoming windblown, I would just head to the restroom take a bit of water and re-straighten and voila hair is great to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some advisements when using this product, do not over use or else your hair will become crunchy. Additionally, if you put too much mousse in your hair you will notice that if you run your hands through your hair they may feel sticky, which is just the extra mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only this I dislike about mousse products in general, is that towards the end when the can is almost out it is difficult to get the last bit of product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I would recommend this product to individuals with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why other people say that this product is greasy or weighs hair down.  It doesn&#x27;t!  It&#x27;s really light, and I would think that those people just have greasy hair or put way too much on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...  It&#x27;s great! I have long thick 3b curls that are frizzy and hard to manage.  This product tames them and keeps my curls defined.  I would compare it to \\&quot;TIGI Catwalk Curlesque Curls Rock\\&quot; but even better because it&#x27;s lighter.  It leaves my curls soft and bouncy!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have used every brand of mousse out there.  This does the job of holding my curls.  However, it leaves a sticky residue on my hand...which I haven&#x27;t experienced with other brands.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I discovered this product on Amazon. I had first bought it in the store, and then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. My hair is soft and the curls are defined with very little frizz. It really works the way it says it does!</li>
    <li> Caused my scalp to break out.</li>
    <li> Caused my hair to clump together as if it were glue, was impossible to style and comb through, and took forever to blow dry.</li>
    <li> Weighs my curls down. I have curls that need to have the right cut and the right product or they are just &amp;#34;wavy.&amp;#34;  It feels nice and adds moisture but this is definitely NOT a product for light curls..</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair and I use this mousse to give my curls definition and bounce. It doesn&#x27;t get all stiff like some other products, and so my curls looks much more natural. I use it on damp/wet hair, let air dry if I can, then gently scrunch my curls with my hand or a dry towel to make them extra soft and natural-looking. I tried a lot of other products before this one, but have stuck with the Dove Whipped Cream Mousse for over a year now. It also helps with my frizz!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair - big curls, not tight curls - that is also prone to frizz. I&#x27;ve used this mousse for a week now and it does help define my curls. However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just has an underlying musky fragrance that reminds me of men&#x27;s cologne. The trick with this product is to not apply it to your hair like you would a regular mousse. It&#x27;s very thick, so I&#x27;d recommend applying a golf ball size amount by first spreading over your palm (rather than keeping in a ball) and then work from the roots out. Then, after that is worked in, assess if you need another golf ball size applied towards the ends of your hair. It will make the top of your head feel weighed down or even greasy if you use too much. Another thing I do appreciate is that you get quite a large bottle of the stuff, I&#x27;m expecting to be able to use this for two months before having to determine if I&#x27;ll repurchase or try another product. It does leave my hair soft and not crunchy but does not entirely get rid of the frizz factor.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mousse. It is soft and gives my hair great volume! It also has yet to run out since I ordered it months ago!</li>
    <li> Did not control the frizzyness.</li>
    <li> Dove mousse is a great product. It does not leave your hair stiff, hard or flaky. I&#x27;m a woman of  color and I can vouch it works on all hair types. Dove mousse is the greatest invention ever.</li>
    <li> Well priced and does not dry out my curls like other cheap products. I recommend this product to those prone to dry hair.</li>
    <li> One of the only products I have ever found that produces soft bouncy curls with no frizz!  I usually only use salon grade products but purchased this on a whim and I will never use anything else as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> It smells So good ! Like sweet berries, it does get flaky, I use it only on split ends not on all my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product with all my heart! I couldn&#x27;t wait until I got it. When I first used it it made my naturally curly hair very soft and moisturized. I was very happy. Must have if you have naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves ur curls soft. love it</li>
    <li> Really goopy and heavy in my hair. It is hard to spread evenly and feels heavier than if I put straight lotion in my hair. That might be the &amp;#34;nourishing properties&amp;#34;, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use product for soft curls. It works for various hair textures. You will need an oil sheen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to rock my curls often but when I do, this stuff does wonders! I never liked my curly hair until I found this product. Keeps my curls tame throughout the day, soft, shiny and smelling fresh. My routine: apply nickel size Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal to wet hair, apply little larger than quarter size dollop of this Dove Whipped Mousse and twist sections of hair, loosen a bit then scrunch and diffuse with dryer upside down until ALMOST dry. Finally use about dime size of coconut oil to smooth and spritz with hair spray. Perfection, every time. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as dry as how most others describe their hair and I do a ton of heat styling. To give a better idea.. without any product my curls are frizzy and somewhat formed, when I brush them out before straightening or while blow drying my hair is pure thick frizz but when I straighten my locks it&#x27;s shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using it many years now, but recently had to go to Amazon to buy it because I cannot buy it anywhere!  They seemed to have discounted it where I live and I have looked throughout California when i&#x27;m on trips.</li>
    <li> I too was a dove loyalist. I have type 3a curly hair which is extremely hard to manage because one product will tame the curls and leave my hair crunchy and hard, another would leave my hair soft but frizzy. I tried this new replacement mousse and I absolutely detest it. It smells like a coconut crossed with fingernail polish remover. It is extremely slimy and doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly when applied. Once you dry your heir either air dry or with a hair dryer you end up with random frizzy spots and where the product decided to congregate your hair will be hard and extremely flat and weighed down. I do NOT recommend this to anyone who had any type of curls as it will not help you manage them at all. I have tried five or six different products since dove decided to discontinue the curl and sculpt and have yet to find anything comparable. Why do they have to completely cancel a product line to introduce another? Maybe if enough complain they will get the picture and bring back curl and sculpt....</li>
    <li> Good product for curly hair. I like to use it every day for my hair</li>
    <li> Best product ever, wish they had it in local stores, very different than the other versions this whipped version feels like lotion for your hair which is great for my super curly thick and often dry hair.... May be too oily for someone who tends to have oily hair.... But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else again</li>
    <li> I have very fine curly hair and have tried almost every product on the market from drugstore to high end salon brands and this stuff is the best for my hair hands down!!!  Most other products just make my hair look kinky and dry.  This mousse is very thick and does feel kind of greasy and I have to admit the first time I used it I used way too much and my hair was weighed down and felt a little oily.  I decided to give it another try and this time used about the size of a golf ball for my whole head. (I have long hair past my shoulders.)  Blow dry and scrunch til almost dry and then let air dry the rest of the way and my hair has never looked better.  The curls are really defined and bouncy and my hair is soft and shiny.  I think this is a great product but you have to use it sparingly.  :)</li>
    <li> My hair is just past my shoulders and pretty well layered. It is just medium thickness. The Dove mousse worked really well for me. Out of the shower I scrunch my hair with the towel, let it dry a little, then scrunch with a little mousse and gently blow dry.  I was worried that the mousse wouldn&#x27;t work well because the feeling in your hands is REALLY creamy, but it actually works REALLY well. Make sure that you only just a little bit and spend some time scrunching though out your whole hair. I&#x27;ve only used wit with the blow dry so I don&#x27;t know how well it works without blow drying. My hair is very curly and not stiff AT ALL!! I really love it. The next day it is still curly and I just need to fix it up a little before going out.</li>
    <li> I have mixed hair, thick and curly and I am Very particular on how I want my curls to look and let me tell you Boy is this an Awesome, light weight product thats is Excellent for curls and smells Wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair. It is so difficult for me to find a product that even relatively offers my hair shape and hold. I usually settle for crunchy curls that loosen as the day goes on, topped off with frizz if the weather gets too humid (I life in Florida). My father is African American and my mother is Cuban American (she has straight hair) so my hair is in between, and somehow I think it got the worst of both worlds. If it isn&#x27;t frizzy it&#x27;s uneven because the product is usually so difficult to distribute properly through my hair that I only get it on the outside, and if not that then I haven&#x27;t put enough product and I end up with a poof on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There came a day when I first purchased this mousse. I got it by accident because after Dove changed their bottles I had trouble finding the mousse I used before. I was upset and honestly left the can in my bathroom closet for a good month before I ran out of my other mousse one day and used it out of desperation. I am SO glad that day came because this mousse not ONLY manages my hair without making it crunchy, but my hair stays so soft and the girls are able to be free yet tame. For the first time in my life I can wear my hair down and feel like it looks great instead of just okay. I hope that Dove never stops making this mousse because it has changed my life and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> It is ok. The mousse is a bit too heavy for my naturally curly hair and I really have to be careful how much product I put in my hair. Just a small amount does the trick and I leave my hair extra damp to help spread the product around. I think I might try to find a lighter mousse next time so that it does not take so long to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product  my hair is better managed with  the dove mousse  will continue to buy and use as long as it&#x27;s available</li>
    <li> I love this mousse.  It is exactly the texture of whipped cream and smells nice.  I have very curly shoulder length hair and have found that other products, like gels, make my hard too hard and crunchy, but products like biosilk make it too greasy.  This whipped cream mousse is perfect! It is just sticky enough to holds curls without looking hard or crunchy, and it is silky enough to smooth frizz without leaving hair slimey or greasy. And the best part is the price!  I highly recommend this product for curly girls.</li>
    <li> Best mousse on the market for curly/wavy hair, I never let myself run out :)  I recommend keeping it on autoship</li>
    <li> It was okay.  I didn&#x27;t use it and think &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; - I thought, meh.  It kept some of the frizzies down, felt a little soft, and smelled a little funky, but I might be a touch spoiled.</li>
    <li> If you have naturally curly hair, you need to use this product.  It leaves your hair perfectly curly and touchably soft.  It&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t have any product on your hair at all.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Soft soft curls!!  I absolutely love this mousse,  a lot of mousses makes my hair crunchy and icky.  I was expecting the same with this one but I was surprised, this is my go to mousse now :-)</li>
    <li> I wish Dove would remarked the old curl and sculpt mousse.  It far exceeded that potential of this mousse.  This gives a filmy feel on hands and hair and reminds me of a silicone product.  Hair comes out ok but feeling like your hair has something on it to manage it rather than the old mousse managing you hair but it feeling product free.</li>
    <li> This Whipped Cream Mousse is very thick and heavy so you&#x27;re better off using a small amount, learned the hard way because I was used to regular hair mousse. I love the smell and I love that it is the only hair product that doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy or frizzy..it gives you the \\&quot;natural curls\\&quot; look. Another negative thing is that it kind of makes my hair a little greasy, and it comes off when I sweat at the gym so my sweat is sticky and sometimes drips down sticky on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for soft curls.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well for curling.</li>
    <li> The greatest for coarse curly/wavy/thick/dry hair. It&#x27;s thick, but once dry fluff out your hair. It takes the place of gel+ hair spray without the gross crunchiness. I usually get out at local stores. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find. Looks very much like the amplifying mousse which is a softer, and who needs volume!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I will admit the first time I used it I applied way too much and yes my hair was heavy and greasy. Now I apply about a ping pong ball size and it works beautifully. My hair is bouncy, light and holds up well (I only wash every 2 days) I even use it to give myself blowouts and my hair straightens nicely with this and my hair is soft and smooth. Probably one of my all time favorite hair products.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse! It is a little thicker than typical mousse (looks like whipped cream, the name is no exaggeration). I have long, thick hair and only need a little. It helps a lot with frizz. I will keep buying</li>
    <li> very nice.  Not too heavy and is long lasting without being sticky.  I will buy it again.  Good for curly hair</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m still using it... but only a smidge at a time... I would only suggest using it if you wash your hair every day... which i do... so its OK.  Would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that would help keep naturally wavy hair controlled without being being stiff.  Many other products I have tried are worse but this is still more stiffness than desired</li>
    <li> Bought two bottles of, is all use half cannot be used</li>
    <li> This stuff is so thick and heavy. I have curly fine hair and I can only use a small amount of this product. I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone as I hate to throw stuff out but I&#x27;m not that thrilled with it. I&#x27;m going to try cutting it with a bit of water.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way, it does not flake and it spells great, but it didnt make my hair curly enough but i like it either way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better... I have extremely curly hair and this was okay in the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of product which means it will last a while but since it didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped reading other reviews that may be a curse.. lol... But it is a decent back up mousse to my normal herbal essence if I&#x27;m out... Its thick and if you don&#x27;t apply it right the white mousse can take a while to work out of a section of hair if you put too much on.</li>
    <li> overall I like this product its thick and not runny perfect for curly ponytails. Perfect for curly thick hair or straight hair to make a wavy style.</li>
    <li> I have always used Dove&#x27;s Curl and Sculpt and loved it for the soft shiny curls. This works even better. I have dry hair and this moisturizes and keeps my curls tame. I always try other products but nothing ever beats this, even the more expensive creams can&#x27;t compare to the control and softness. What a great price too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of other brands to compare it with, but this works well as far as I have used it.  It does leave a little residue in my hair that I can feel, but I figure that is normal</li>
    <li> I use this product all of the time, but from this source the cans were defective  and I got very little product out of each can.</li>
    <li> The mousse - nourishing cream combo didn&#x27;t work for my rather heavy curls. Didn&#x27;t like the smell. Cheap though</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product through Amazon, but I wanted to add my 2 cents.  I love this product.  I have thick, dry, frizzy, unmanageable mid-length hair that only curls up with styling products.  Gel tends to not have the coverage I need, and mousse dries crunchy.  I need very thick/heavy product to tame my curls.  I think the name of this product is misleading, IMO, as I feel it&#x27;s not a light styling product, but more of a heavy duty product.  I apply a kiwi sized amount right after getting out of the shower, and make sure my hair is equally saturated with product, takes probably 2 minutes of squishing and scrunching.  Then I let it dry by itself.  As long as I get my hair saturated while it&#x27;s still wet (not soaking wet, but before it gets just \\&quot;damp\\&quot;) then it has beautiful shine and definition.  It is a little oily, but my hair looks shiny and healthy, and the curls are beautiful.  The smell is not the same as the rest of the Dove products, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, and I am sensitive to strong smells.  I was previously using DevaCurl (shampoo, conditioner, and gel), but it was making my head break out.  I haven&#x27;t had a breakout problem since switching to Dove.  All in all, I could see where this product would not work for quite a few people, but it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
