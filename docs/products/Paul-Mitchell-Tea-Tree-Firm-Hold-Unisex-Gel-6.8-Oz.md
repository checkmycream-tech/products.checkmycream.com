      <li>who wants to try a new gel</li>
      <li>A little bit more water</li>
      <li>I normally buy Tea Tree wax but ordered Gel by mistake.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite features of the gel is that if for some reason you don&#x27;t want your hair to look or feel gelled anymore, you can run your hands through it quickly a few times and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like there&#x27;s product in it anymore.</li>
      <li>I like this product, but I am not sure I love it.</li>

<li> It has definitely helped clear up that red scalp issue I had and even though it says firm hold, my hair is never crunchy from it.  </li>
<li> I have very short hair and like a gel that not only gives me a wet look but holds my style all day.</li>
<li> Well all day&lt;br /&gt;bottle lasts a long time</li>
<li> It definitely does not leave your hair crunchy or with flakes like some of the other reviews</li>
<li> However, the gel is not strong at all and will last for only hours.</li>
<li> /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and shiny while avoiding that typical \\&quot;shiny gel look\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Several hair stylists have recommended this product to me and always speak highly about its quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only difficult issue is its availability.</li>
<li> Not much holding power when used on dry hair.</li>
<li> Also, relatively re-workable with a little water.</li>
<li> Now I just order it every few weeks through Amazon when I get low</li>
<li> Before I used this, I never really thought my hair looked &amp;#34;nice.&amp;#34; I now bring this gel with me wherever I go</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve order this from other people and it was never like this.</li>
<li> It only takes a small amount of gel to get my hair styled (I have about two inches of hair).</li>
<li> Not real strong smell to it either</li>
<li> I use it everyday in the morning and it holds all day without white flakes or getting rock hard</li>
<li> The hold is not very strong.</li>
<li> My hair also has less buildup from this product.</li>
<li> What a waste.  </li>
<li> so maybe this gel just isn&#x27;t made to hold a heavy head of hair</li>
<li> It gives you a firm hold without feeling like your hair is heavy and hard.</li>
<li> I usually love these products but this gel is just the worst I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of trying.</li>
<li> He has used this product for at least 6 years.</li>
<li> This product is awesome,you can not go wrong with Paul Mitchell product&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> i gave it three because there is flakes after couple of hours, I rather use the shine because i hate the damn flakes falling from my head.</li>

    <li> Best Jell yet.  Holds All Day.</li>
    <li> I usually love these products but this gel is just the worst I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of trying. It leaves your hair feeling gross and stringy and won&#x27;t allow it to really move at all unless you try to comb through it. Combing through it leaves not just big white flakes everywhere but makes your hair look greasy and gray all over like the color is being leeched right from your head. By the end of the day it started to smell a little funny to me. I used it for a couple of weeks thinking maybe it was one of those that I had to get use to. New products sometimes make my hair go funny for a bit. But it never got better. My husband had the same issue. We ended up throwing out the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Product is advertised as 1-6.8 oz bottle but I received 3-2.5 oz bottles with a note on the packing slip stating there are 3-2.5 bottles instead of the 6.8 bottle. It&#x27;s not a big deal but now I have 6 bottles (since I had ordered 2). I checked again and unless I&#x27;m still missing something, I don&#x27;t see it anywhere in the original listing about them substituting the bottle for 3 smaller ones. Like I said, not a big deal, just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I do love the gel. For this reason, I rated it a 5. It gives you a firm hold without feeling like your hair is heavy and hard. I also like it because when I curl my hair, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy but prevents my curls from frizzing too. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its cheaper then the stores. i gave it three because there is flakes after couple of hours, I rather use the shine because i hate the damn flakes falling from my head.</li>
    <li> I always use this product to my hair and it works good. You feel fresh when you comb with it.</li>
    <li> I normally buy Tea Tree wax but ordered Gel by mistake.  What a waste.  It leaves my hair all crunchy and does not hold as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and have no problem with flaking as another shopper had stated.  I have thick coarse hair and this lays it down nicely.  It has a nice shine to it as well.  Without it my hair looks dull and dry (and even more grey ;)  The styling wax is too soft of a hold for me and has no shine to it.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday in the morning and it holds all day without white flakes or getting rock hard</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It definitely does not leave your hair crunchy or with flakes like some of the other reviews say.  If your hair is crunchy, then you&#x27;re using way too much of this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get a red, itchy scalp from a lot of gels I used.  One of the stylists I visited suggested that I try something with tea tree oil in it.  I saw this product at the store, bought it, and have been buying it for years now.  It has definitely helped clear up that red scalp issue I had and even though it says firm hold, my hair is never crunchy from it.  You don&#x27;t need to apply that much of it at all for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely MUCH cheaper here than in the store.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it and it does not dry on your hair.  Not real strong smell to it either, he doesn&#x27;t like the perfume colgne smell some hair gels have. He has used this product for at least 6 years.</li>
    <li> Great hold all day long. Also, relatively re-workable with a little water.</li>
    <li> Great service great product.</li>
    <li> Really like this gel and it&#x27;s kind of a pain to find at most of the stores around my house.  Now I just order it every few weeks through Amazon when I get low and it&#x27;s here in a couple of days.  Really like the fact that this gel is so easy to wash out, and also if you put just a little bit of water in your hair it reactivates the gel very well.  A little bit more water and it will just about rinse right out!</li>
    <li> I like this gel over all the other gels (&amp;#34;product&amp;#34;) that I have tried. It provides a good hold without making your hair greasy and it&#x27;s easy to clean out.</li>
    <li> Again...with my wild hairdoo...this works super !</li>
    <li> Sticky gel.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome,you can not go wrong with Paul Mitchell product&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This gel leaves you hair in one place place all day and do not have to worry,&lt;br /&gt;anyone who wants to try a new gel try this you will love it.</li>
    <li> Purchased because Paul Mitchell products are cruelty free.  When used on damp hair it&#x27;s great for accentuating curl.  Not much holding power when used on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Excellency quality and does not make scalp itch.</li>
    <li> excellent product &amp; excellent delivery</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing. Smells like regular hair gel. The container looks exactly like the real one but the gel does not smell the same. Something seems to be off here. I&#x27;ve order this from other people and it was never like this. It holds my hair but doesn&#x27;t have that tea tree smell to it.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love - great price, same Paul Mitchell hold and the tea tree smell makes it all work.</li>
    <li> good product - last long time -</li>
    <li> My husband would be lost without his Tea Tree Gel! He has used it for over a year and likes it very much!</li>
    <li> Due to my first girlfriend, I have some self-esteem issues regarding how my hair looks. Before I used this, I never really thought my hair looked &amp;#34;nice.&amp;#34; I now bring this gel with me wherever I go (I also have a 2.5 travel sized one). It only takes a small amount of gel to get my hair styled (I have about two inches of hair). My hair sticks really well where I style it, without looking like it has been drenched in product. The smell of the gel is really nice, and I think it helps me smell attractive (i&#x27;m a guy). One of my favorite features of the gel is that if for some reason you don&#x27;t want your hair to look or feel gelled anymore, you can run your hands through it quickly a few times and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like there&#x27;s product in it anymore. The other side of this is it requires a certain level of vigilance about not touching your hair, but I assume most people who use gel do that anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good smell&lt;br /&gt;Works Well all day&lt;br /&gt;bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Can get hair feeling soft and natural in no time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hair can lose gel quickly if touched&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair pretty much always looks good with this in my hair, and I actually get compliments about it. I even had another man ask me what I used because he wanted his to look like mine. If you want a nice styled look, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and can&#x27;t use anything else now. As a man, I love the way it smells and how if is much less goopy that the cheap stuff you get at the big box stores. I am able to style my hair In the morning and not worry about it the rest of the day. Great product to go along with the tea tree shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I am not sure I love it. The consistency is a bit softer than I am used to. The hold is not very strong. But it seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel since last 3 years and it is the best I have found so far, lot better than any other store brand.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and shiny while avoiding that typical \\&quot;shiny gel look\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Several hair stylists have recommended this product to me and always speak highly about its quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only difficult issue is its availability. this gel is not so easily available and has always high shipping price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, if you are looking for a good quality hair gel, this is an ultimate product!</li>
    <li> Nice hold without the usual stiffness from a firm hold gel.  My hair also has less buildup from this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and i love the price!</li>
    <li> Nice gel, no skin issues. I could not use gel for many years or my forehead would break out.</li>
    <li> This product does not have the hold that it claims. I have very short hair and like a gel that not only gives me a wet look but holds my style all day. The smell is great but the hold is just not there</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it after each time I shampoo.</li>
    <li> True, no flakes ensue after using this. However, the gel is not strong at all and will last for only hours. I have pretty long hair so maybe this gel just isn&#x27;t made to hold a heavy head of hair</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It holds but once it dries it never feels like anything is in your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard to find at my location and, the price was excellent. I&#x27;ll be back see you again</li>
    <li> Perfect light hold for curly hair that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I have a large colic in the back of my hair.  This works great on it without too much of the wet hair look (albeit if you put a lot in your hair you can achieve that look)</li>
    <li> Not for women at all,Really smells like a mans cologne .Super sticky in your hair and really doesn&#x27;t hold the style.Gave it away.</li>
    <li> I like that this high quality product being available through Anazon.  #1 Retailer Online.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel -- good holding power, accentuates curls, without feeling stiff or sticky once it dries in your hair.  And a pleasant aroma</li>
