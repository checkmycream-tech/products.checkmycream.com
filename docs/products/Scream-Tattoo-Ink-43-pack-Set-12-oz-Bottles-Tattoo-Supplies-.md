      <li>starbright is the best in my book but it worked best on me and others i know eternal worked better</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Always great quality...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Even a good ink would be seen when you puncture the skin.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the color selection and look forward to using them soon b</li>
      <li>and so beautiful if you like tattoo it so worth the money</li>
      <li>I HAVE TO ORDER MORE FROM SOMEONE ELSE AND SPEND MORE MONEY!</li>
      <li>Tattoo ink is like a box of chocolates :)  </li>
      <li>YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR BETTER QUALITY FOR THE PRICE</li>
      <li>I LOVE this INK.</li>
      <li>Need I say more than the title?  </li>
      <li>its bright, and the right consistency, great! will definitely order from now on.</li>
      <li>Love the colors and the description is exact and the whole pack is awesome!</li>
      <li>i enjoy haven&#x27;g</li>
      <li>but if u want some ink to tat a grapefruit or some hog skin practice with the cheap stuff you got to learn with something</li>
      <li>I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him.</li>
      <li>and I was extremely excited when I got home and</li>
      <li>the other hand I have to say that as always worldwide tattoo supply is a great place to order from, they are fast and the quality of a product*aside from this one* are great and always brand new and undamaged during shipping.</li>
      <li>ink its self is great easy to put into the skin and even though its a lower brand of ink it works very well next to intenze and eternal</li>
      <li>However, I found it to be smooth and just the right texture.</li>
      <li>Its got a nice array of colors and its of decent consistency, if your just starting out and need a nice variety of colors and decent quality ink give it a shot.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is because I cant&#x27; seem to get any kind of grey-wash out of it.</li>
      <li>this i have to say is my favorite thus far 2 out of 4 brands i&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and take to the skin easily.</li>
      <li>These came in right on time</li>
      <li>these were waiting for me right at my door when I got inside.</li>
      <li>Its not bad ink for the money, if you cant afford the top shelf inks, then this would be my next choice for inks.</li>
      <li>The best part was that they gave me a big bottle of one of the reds while all the others were indeed half ounce bottles</li>
      <li>there were so many different colors so worth the money</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>and it took pretty well.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I have come to expect.</li>
      <li>because of this i have lost many clients due to the fact that i needed ink quick.</li>
      <li>He went crazy happy when he saw all the colors :)</li>
      <li>it might look good in the bottle or a week later but tell me how it looks in a year next to some skincandy</li>
      <li>All of our clients enjoy the new colors, and how the ink pops out their newly artwork.</li>
      <li>every other color is amazing and works better then expected.</li>
      <li>the ink arrived wrapped very well and all caps were sealed and ready for the twist tops 2 be put on.</li>
      <li>Its cheaply made ink with no regard to human health.</li>
      <li>I wish i could pick my own colors for the same amount of bottles with the same price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kinda new to tattooing and this ink takes very well for me.</li>
      <li>but if you research it you will find that after dipping your needle you will then need to dip it in water to get the ink to take, not a good choice for a professional who wants to do amazing work</li>
      <li>now ive been on amazon for many years and never had to deal with late packages.</li>
      <li>then ill make my decison if you want ink that will stay in the skin and look good for years you will pay some money for it prob about 8 bucks a oz</li>
      <li>the color goes in wonderfully &amp; smoothly, its not too thick nor thin,.. and results are bright and satisfactory, next to Eternal Ink</li>
      <li>but the seller site indicated that the ink is THICK, which isn&#x27;t true at all.</li>

<li> but the seller site indicated that the ink is THICK, which isn&#x27;t true at all.</li>
<li> The colors may go in easy, but they do not stick and they ARE NOT BRIGHT!</li>
<li> the white doesnt really take well to skin, but white is a hard color to get it to stick.</li>
<li> INK IS SUPER THIN AND DOES NOT STICK TO SKIN</li>
<li> But as a professional tattoo artist, I have to say that this was the biggest waste of time and money.</li>
<li> Ive heard a ton of mixed reviews, a few from folks that have never even TRIED this ink.</li>
<li> i have been using this ink for a few months and have used one of the eternal inks for my grey wash before, but this ink comes in a close second, if you are having any trouble packing any of these colors into the skin try either holding your machine a little straighter, or add a tiny drop of water to you inks.</li>
<li> get Eternal or Intenze or some other compatible ink, but this ink doesnt need to be on the shelf.</li>
<li> I was concerned about trying this ink based on other reviews.</li>
<li> This so called \\&quot;proffecional\\&quot; ink was complete crap, it came in a giant plastic bag wrapped on tape in a box, and half of the bottles had expired dates some dating 3 and 4 years back, the reds come out as pinks, some of the colors are mislabeled by name of color, and overall i do NOT!!</li>
<li> you get what you pay for hands down!</li>
<li> WISH I NEVER BOUGHT THIS SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
<li> one of the inks was too settled, and i am not able to mix it, but I don&#x27;t have a mixer either</li>
<li> RECOMMEND THIS CRAP TO ANYONE, Complete waste of money...</li>
<li> I mean the colors are so runny, water...</li>
<li> I knew right of the bat that it was horrible, when I was applying it.</li>
<li> the ink is thin and watery.</li>
<li> NO GOOD!</li>
<li> The price wasn&#x27;t bad neither.</li>
<li> I hate to say it</li>
<li> it&#x27;s like shading ink gone horrible!!!</li>
<li> i have to say that this company is the worst one ive had to deal with on amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Exactly what I have come to expect. Always great quality... and i always find myself wishing that i bought the larger bottles.</li>
    <li> the ink arrived wrapped very well and all caps were sealed and ready for the twist tops 2 be put on. ink its self is great easy to put into the skin and even though its a lower brand of ink it works very well next to intenze and eternal i&#x27;ll be useing this ink aswell. I was very happy with this ink and seller.</li>
    <li> Ive heard a ton of mixed reviews, a few from folks that have never even TRIED this ink. I have used it for tattoo&#x27;s, and have this ink on me. Its not bad ink for the money, if you cant afford the top shelf inks, then this would be my next choice for inks. Its got a nice array of colors and its of decent consistency, if your just starting out and need a nice variety of colors and decent quality ink give it a shot.</li>
    <li> skin is an unforgiving medium, it does not make or break the artist or the product. Tattoo ink is like a box of chocolates :)  and it is NOT always \\&quot;you get what you pay for!\\&quot;  I LOVE this INK. the color goes in wonderfully &amp; smoothly, its not too thick nor thin,.. and results are bright and satisfactory, next to Eternal Ink this i have to say is my favorite thus far 2 out of 4 brands i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I hate to say it but the seller site indicated that the ink is THICK, which isn&#x27;t true at all. I mean the colors are so runny, water...it&#x27;s like shading ink gone horrible!!! The colors may go in easy, but they do not stick and they ARE NOT BRIGHT! I have been tattooing for a while and I try every ink that I can, just to compare quality, etc. But as a professional tattoo artist, I have to say that this was the biggest waste of time and money. Do not bother purchasing these inks or should I say watercolors!On the other hand I have to say that as always worldwide tattoo supply is a great place to order from, they are fast and the quality of a product*aside from this one* are great and always brand new and undamaged during shipping.</li>
    <li> i ordered this item on the 1st of august. it said that i will get it by the 5 through the 10 and its already the 16th and no ink. i have to say that this company is the worst one ive had to deal with on amazon. now ive been on amazon for many years and never had to deal with late packages. because of this i have lost many clients due to the fact that i needed ink quick. i would recomend not buying this product or any product from this supplier.</li>
    <li> This ink isnt compatible with skin. It causes infections and is a hazard to work with. Its cheaply made ink with no regard to human health. DO NOT BUY THIS INK</li>
    <li> WISH I NEVER BOUGHT THIS SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!! INK IS SUPER THIN AND DOES NOT STICK TO SKIN NOW I HAVE TO ORDER MORE FROM SOMEONE ELSE AND SPEND MORE MONEY!</li>
    <li> these inks work perfectly. the white doesnt really take well to skin, but white is a hard color to get it to stick. every other color is amazing and works better then expected. i used this ink for all of my clients</li>
    <li> Love the colors and how well they hold after they are healed!!! Definitely a return customer</li>
    <li> Colors look great &amp; the verity is awesome. The price wasn&#x27;t bad neither. All in all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> one of the inks was too settled, and i am not able to mix it, but I don&#x27;t have a mixer either, that is my next purchase. Love the colors and the description is exact and the whole pack is awesome!</li>
    <li> I wish i could pick my own colors for the same amount of bottles with the same price. Great ink!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality ink. I&#x27;ll be using this again.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT PURCHASED THESE INKS! BUT im sleeved out and been in the tat shops for hours/days! and if the rule every applied to anything it applies to tattoo ink you get what you pay for hands down! it might look good in the bottle or a week later but tell me how it looks in a year next to some skincandy then ill make my decison if you want ink that will stay in the skin and look good for years you will pay some money for it prob about 8 bucks a oz all i have on me is eternal starbright and skin candy and they all worked great and looked awesome! starbright is the best in my book but it worked best on me and others i know eternal worked better but if u want some ink to tat a grapefruit or some hog skin practice with the cheap stuff you got to learn with something then if you have the gift spend your money on good ink! that is your money maker it talks to people when you are not there anymore you have to think like that..lol</li>
    <li> I was concerned about trying this ink based on other reviews. However, I found it to be smooth and just the right texture. The colors are vibrant and take to the skin easily. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Need I say more than the title?  But my number 1 reason for this review is that it is Runny. How can I advertise myself when the tattoo doesn&#x27;t even look like a tattoo after a week. I knew right of the bat that it was horrible, when I was applying it. Even a good ink would be seen when you puncture the skin. Not this one. I had to make up for the lack of consistency with Millenium ink. Please do not use this to tat on human skin. Use it as practice on pork skin (or the equivalent).    Runny - doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin (Caucasian female)</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him. He went crazy happy when he saw all the colors :)</li>
    <li> I have this ink on my arm and it took pretty well.I&#x27;m kinda new to tattooing and this ink takes very well for me. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is because I cant&#x27; seem to get any kind of grey-wash out of it. i dont have an ink mixer, but i am looking for one. i have been using this ink for a few months and have used one of the eternal inks for my grey wash before, but this ink comes in a close second, if you are having any trouble packing any of these colors into the skin try either holding your machine a little straighter, or add a tiny drop of water to you inks.</li>
    <li> no instructions come with it but if you research it you will find that after dipping your needle you will then need to dip it in water to get the ink to take, not a good choice for a professional who wants to do amazing work</li>
    <li> this is the best ink i have ever ordered! its bright, and the right consistency, great! will definitely order from now on.</li>
    <li> i purchased the ink to try out and let&#x27;s just say its not something I would use on any skin. not even to practice with. the ink is thin and watery. the ink doesn&#x27;t want to stay in, and I was pretty&lt;br /&gt;upset about the outcome. I did one pass with a 7m, using the white ink, and it looks like a bloody&lt;br /&gt;wart on my leg. i do not recommend using this ink what so ever. get Eternal or Intenze or some other compatible ink, but this ink doesnt need to be on the shelf. Im trashing all of them...NO GOOD!</li>
    <li> there were so many different colors so worth the money and so beautiful if you like tattoo it so worth the money</li>
    <li> YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR BETTER QUALITY FOR THE PRICE THE BOTTLES LEAK SO I ASK THE COMPANY TO SEND MEBETTER LOCKING CAPS SO THERE IS NO LOSS OF PIGMENT WHEN BEING STORED OR TRANSPORTED</li>
    <li> These came in right on time and I was extremely excited when I got home and these were waiting for me right at my door when I got inside. The best part was that they gave me a big bottle of one of the reds while all the others were indeed half ounce bottles this one is a fill ounce. Very pleased with the color selection and look forward to using them soon b</li>
    <li> This so called \\&quot;proffecional\\&quot; ink was complete crap, it came in a giant plastic bag wrapped on tape in a box, and half of the bottles had expired dates some dating 3 and 4 years back, the reds come out as pinks, some of the colors are mislabeled by name of color, and overall i do NOT!! RECOMMEND THIS CRAP TO ANYONE, Complete waste of money... (Try Intenze brands) best on the market in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Ink does not hold to skin so well</li>
    <li> All of our clients enjoy the new colors, and how the ink pops out their newly artwork. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know what color you need then this might help , the short hand&#x27;d and short supply  need&#x27;s of your choosing. i enjoy haven&#x27;g all the color my self . Thank you</li>
