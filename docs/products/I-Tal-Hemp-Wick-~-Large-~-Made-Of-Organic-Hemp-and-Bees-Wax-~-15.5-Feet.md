      <li>This is a great alternative to a cigarette lighter, but not quite as convenient because you will need a lighter to light the wick.  </li>

      <li>this is great stuff and by far the best and healthiest way to light things and smoke, i recommend this</li>

      <li>Having said that, if you are new to hemp wick and wanna try it and wrap your lighter, this is the ideal tester.</li>
      <li>It seems like there is a lot of wax on it, more than needed.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Not to mention it makes the smoke taste much better.</li>
      <li>I would recommend fully wrapping your lighter with it and using the wick mostly when you&#x27;re in a group setting.</li>
      <li>I love it, I still have more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a greeat way to light a cig or a pipe without sucking in the harmful fumes from a lighter.</li>

      <li>Love these, such a great idea instead of inhaling butane from lighters, light the end of this wick and use it as long as you need to.</li>
      <li>Love hempwick in general</li>
      <li>Research yourself if super picky for long term investments, but this is a great product that is healthier than simply using a lighter!</li>
      <li>It melts fast and the hemp itself burns pretty fast as well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>There is no odd taste, and has an even and consistent burn.</li>
      <li>This wick is alright, its kind of weird to light things with, like the angles you need and the way it burns...</li>
      <li>There are bulk suppliers on other sites that will offer more and be natural.</li>
      <li>I give them out to friends on gifts, tie them as a little bow; pretty and useful!</li>
      <li>but it lasts a pretty long time and feels alot healthier than using butane.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help with burning all that well, but I&#x27;d used it as a replacement wick for my low wax candles.</li>
      <li>Hemp wick is kind of expensive</li>

<li> Extends the life of your lighter by at least 100%, if you use it in a group setting.</li>
<li> bad smell when wick goes out</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help with burning all that well, but I&#x27;d used it as a replacement wick for my low wax candles.</li>
    <li> This wick is alright, its kind of weird to light things with, like the angles you need and the way it burns... There are times where you&#x27;re going to just want to use your lighter. But, for taste and not-inhaling-lighter-fluid purposes... Its a good alternative. These are nice, and i would recommend them. Also, get this size. Its not that big</li>
    <li> Extends the life of your lighter by at least 100%, if you use it in a group setting. Love hempwick in general and this is a great brand. I would recommend fully wrapping your lighter with it and using the wick mostly when you&#x27;re in a group setting.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to a cigarette lighter, but not quite as convenient because you will need a lighter to light the wick.  There is no odd taste, and has an even and consistent burn. Lights everything well. I keep a cup of water nearby to extinguish the wick after use.  Great stuff, be safe.</li>
    <li> Love these, such a great idea instead of inhaling butane from lighters, light the end of this wick and use it as long as you need to. when you&#x27;re done, put it out, and use it again when you need to! :) I give them out to friends on gifts, tie them as a little bow; pretty and useful!</li>
    <li> There are bulk suppliers on other sites that will offer more and be natural. Having said that, if you are new to hemp wick and wanna try it and wrap your lighter, this is the ideal tester.

    <li> I love this stuff! No more nasty chemicals in my lungs, and it&#x27;s cheap. Not to mention it makes the smoke taste much better. I&#x27;ll be buying the big roll next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use a lighter again.</li>
    <li> Best clean smoke, best brand, nice oder.</li>
    <li> Quality Hemp Wick and A Very Natural Approach to An Enjoyable Smoking Experience! A Unique Buy For All Interested! Iyah!</li>

    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a greeat way to light a cig or a pipe without sucking in the harmful fumes from a lighter. It is a bit more expensive here than at my local smoke shop which is the reason for only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Hemp wick is kind of expensive but it lasts a pretty long time and feels alot healthier than using butane.  You also taste nothing but your herb when using hemp wick!</li>
    <li> this is great stuff and by far the best and healthiest way to light things and smoke, i recommend this</li>
