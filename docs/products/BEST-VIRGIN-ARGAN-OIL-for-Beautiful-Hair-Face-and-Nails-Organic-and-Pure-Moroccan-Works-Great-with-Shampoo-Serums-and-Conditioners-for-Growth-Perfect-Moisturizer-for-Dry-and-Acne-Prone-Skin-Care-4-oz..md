<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. So excited to be using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing price. Great company Puruskin.</li>
    <li> I love this Moroccan Argan Oil.  It has a very light scent and is also very light.  I use it on my nails, hair and face.  I also usethe oil  on rough areas such as my elbows and knees.  It gives them a smooth and soft look.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. The product is light and does not weight my hair down and my skin feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this argon oil!  It is 100% organic, it has no scent, and it absorbs into my skin quickly leaving it soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this and I have used pure argan oil products before.  However, it does absorb very well and works well on my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Makes everything silky smooth</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review so I could make sure I had a solid opinion about this oil.&lt;br /&gt;At first what stood out the most was the smell of the oil, it is not your typical beauty oil so it has a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent. I got over it after applying it to my hair. I have semi color damaged hair and I usually apply drug store hair oils or leave in conditioners. I decided to only use this oil so I could know what exactly it does. I also chose not to use it on my face or any other part of my body (yet). The first 3 days of using this product I applied it right after I took a shower and my hair was wet. I applied 3-4 drops the first day and didn&#x27;t feel like I did much. My hair is short (4-5 inches long) &amp; thick. I decided to fill the dropper all the way and used about half the dropper, I would say about 10 drops. I let my hair air dry and do its thing. My hair did not look oily nor weighed down even though I used a lot more oil than recommended. My hair felt soft and didn&#x27;t tangle like it usually does. After using it for 3 or 4 days I then decided to go without it to see if it did anything to my hair. Sadly I don&#x27;t think it did much to repair or help it. It is in the same condition it was before using the product but I&#x27;m not upset about that because either way I would still be using some sort of oil based product. I continued to use the oil in the way I mentioned before for about another week. I then decided to style my hair using heat tools. I applied the oil like I had been doing already and then used a blow dryer on high to dry my hair. When I was done with that step my hair felt super soft and light weight. I took 4 more drops and applied them to the ends of my hair only before using a flat iron to complete the styling process. I will say, it did add some kind of hold to my hair and it made it so I could make my hair keep its style in place but it was not weighed down nor did it look greasy. It just looked like I used a light pomade. As the day progressed I noticed the oil must have been absorbed into my hair leaving it shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am very pleased with how this oil works on my hair and I hope to keep it as a staple in my hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;  Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Everything I say is true and in my own words.noticed the oil must have been absorbed into my hair leaving it shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am very pleased with how this oil works on my hair and I hope to keep it as a staple in my hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;  Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

    <li> Just a tiny bit moisturizes my dry hair. Also use on my face and it absorbs great and doesnt leave it greasy.</li>
    <li> I read and heard good, positive things about Moroccan Argan Oil for over a year and decided to try it.  I read all the instructions and information and  started using it on the very sensitive skin on my face, then face and neck, then face, neck and body!  I have been pretty faithful about exfoliating my face and neck, but not on my body.  The senior citizen kinda rough and wrinkly skin on my legs was shocking to me as I usually don&#x27;t scrutinize my body-just exercise.  I have been using it on my legs for about 2 weeks and the skin is smoother, softer and, I dare say, the bit if cellulite that I have seen, is disappearing!  The slightly crepy skin on my neck is smoother and my complexion is more even toned.  Sometimes I just wear concealer and a bronzer! I used to wear full make up all the time.  There is a lot to be said for smooth, soft skin!  I am a big fan of Moroccan Argan Oil and would recommend it to anyone as I have extremely  sensitive skin and have derived great results!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My favorite to use on dry hands/nails during the winter months. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This brand of argan oil meets the highest standards and requirements.  I checked with the company.  The company, by the way, is very friendly and provides excellent/prompt customer service.  Most savvy buyers of Argan Oil know to look for the following attributes:  100% pure organic, ECOCERT and USDA Certified, Triple Virgin Grade, cold-pressed, and unrefined.  This product meets all of the above.  I have used it and works great, creating a smooth and silky look for the skin.  I would suggest using just a few drops at a time.  Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently and I notice that if I use too much of the oil it makes my skin look heavy and greasy.  Using a few drops works best for me.  You can always experiment and see what amount is ideal for your skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Virgin Argan Oil and absolutely love it!! It arrived on time(actually 1 business day early which was awesome). I have used one time and can see a difference in my skin! I purchased the Derma Roller as well and used the oil after I used the Derma roller for better results!! I will continue to use this product and will purchase again! This is a must buy! I was skeptical because I was unsure how the product would actually work with what I was hoping to gain...I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a try..you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again</li>
    <li> I love this Moroccan Argan Oil by Puruskin.  I have been using it on my feet for my dry cracked heals.  It is gradually making a difference! I also use this oil on my son&#x27;s head for cradle cap.  I am so excited to discover all the wonderful uses for argan oil!</li>
    <li> Use it on my nails and hair, like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and hair, it&#x27;s light yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;I can see the difference!</li>
    <li> Feels very nourishing and emollient on my skin. Just started using it at night and love it so far!</li>
    <li> I received my order within 5 days as promised. This argan oil is rather light weight and has good absorption. Although it is an oil, it does not make my skin feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve only used it on my face so far and it does a great job of keeping me moisturized. It would probably be very beneficial to mix this in with your body lotion/moisturizer also . I&#x27;ve very recently received this product therefore can&#x27;t comment on the long term effects on my skin or any specific changes, yet. There are no negatives to report relating to my use of it either. I like the way it feels on my skin and will continue to use it to reap the positive benefits. Argan oil is known to be rich in vitamin e which is excellent for the skin (not that you don&#x27;t know that already!). :)</li>
    <li> My first Argan oil. I was messing around with a bump below my eye and totally stretched out the skin (I so know better, too) so the skin was so much baggier and wrinkled compared to the other eye after so I got the derma roller for that. I have used the derma roller under my eyes 2 times without anything except my regular creams.  Recently, I got the oil. The first night when I applied the oil (not after rolling btw), I rubbed in more than 3 drops on my face as it seemed my skin was super dry and left it on over night. I woke and my skin was noticeably smoother under my eyes and so was my whole face. I keep looking in the mirror through out the day and yep, still smooth. I used it as a toner and used only 2 drops. My skin looks very supple and does well under my make up. I did not get this for free. I really love the results so far and hope to keep them. It&#x27;s hard to say if the results of the oil would be the same without rolling. I&#x27;m 44.</li>
    <li> This oil seems to have a good effect on my skin.I think it is clearer and brighter,  and when I have had acne,  it seems to clear up quicker.  Bonus! I use it on my face,  hands,  hair. ..etc.  It has no scent-- I like scented products--but a little research into good skin care will tell you that anything with fragrance is a huge no-no for the face.  So I like that this is pure and gentle,  with no irritants. The price is actually pretty good too,if you look around.</li>
    <li> I recieved a great discount via email.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product enough yet to give it 5 stars.  I do like it so far.  I have  rubbed it on my hands and nails about three times and do believe I can tell a difference.  I will follow up in a couple of weeks.  I also am thinking of using it with my derma roller and will report back on how I like it.</li>
    <li> Received it fast so this thing is amazing I&#x27;m almost done with it need buy more I love it. The only thing don&#x27;t like the smell so I use this at night time but it works!!! My stretch marks are getting lighter and looking better!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about a week now and it&#x27;s awesome I use it on my entire body after I shower and after I dermaroll.  Every kind of soap I buy dries out my skin, after i shower i use this oil instead of lotion it leaves you soft and moisturized without being oily or greasy. I blow dry and flat iron my hair everyday which leaves it dry and feeling like hay. I put the oil on my hair after I towel dry then dry and straighten, my hair has never been this soft and healthy usually my ends look so fried not with this oil it&#x27;s amazing please try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil for a week or so, and I have to say that I&#x27;m happy that I got it. It not only hydrates my skin, it also repairs and eliminates imperfections.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for dry skin and hair. I only use two drops for my hair ends, then run through the rest of my hair and it stays soft and shiny with no flyaway ends.  Go easy though, you can overdo it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On skin, this oil  soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel; again, be careful not to use too much.  You only need a couple of drops!</li>
    <li> I received the product I like it thus far</li>
    <li> UPDATE: New uses for the argan oil.  I LOVE this stuff...beyond belief.  I never want to be w/o this stuff.  I found 2 new uses for it.  This is the product that keeps on giving!!!    1.  Fixing knots in hair --  If you have long hair, you will know what I mean - lol.  My hair is so long, I have to pull it up carefully at night or braid it to sleep...so I don&#x27;t get knots in my hair.  I got a NASTY knot one night when I failed to pull it up/braid it.  I tossed and turned and got the nastiest knot ever on the back of my head.  It was one of those people/parents would end up having to cut out or break to fix it.  I thought...why not...try the oil...massage it in and see if I can carefully fix the problem.  OMG...it worked!  I was able to get the knot out w/ only breaking a couple strands.  Thank you Lord!heehee  2.  Make up enhancer -- If you want that dewy look and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune at sephora, ulta or department store make-up counters...add this to your arsenal.  I add a few drops to foundation I got at target and my concealer (it cosmetics...it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve been able to find that has a light enough shade for my porcelain-like complexion).  Just mix it...&amp; apply.  I used a foundation brush for the foundation...a brush &amp; my fingers for the concealer.  O-M-G!  I can&#x27;t tell you how surprised I was at the outcome.  My face looked flawless.  It kept the make-up from creasing and settling into my smile lines.  My make-up didn&#x27;t run at all!  I actually had a photo-shoot the day I tried this - lol.  The shoot was an all natural make-up look...and all we had to do was reapply lip gloss.  I was in AWE!!!  So...before you toss your foundation or concealer (b/c it isn&#x27;t delivering or is making problems worse...settling into creases and drying out your face) try a drop or two of this and you will be pleasantly surprised! :)      OMG...I&#x27;m in LOVE!!!  I have tried a couple of oils (besides vitamin c - lol)...almond and rosehip. I have NEVER tried argan oil before; however, I do have a hair product I got from TJ MAXX that has argan oil as an ingredient in it (it&#x27;s a curl defining lotion).  Anyways, who knows really how much argan oil is in it??? We never know...just know that the farther from the first of the ingredient list...the less of it there actually is - lol.  I don&#x27;t need that product now that I have this one - heehee. This product not only delivers, but it smells AMAZING!!! I have no idea where people are getting that it stinks.  I love it!!!  I would not lie about that...I&#x27;m one of those girls who ALWAYS has to smell things b/c if it doesn&#x27;t smell good...I&#x27;m not buying it - lol.  Anyways, I waited to review this product until I put it through the ringer...literally - lol.  I got it a couple months ago.  I love using it for everything.  Hair:  It&#x27;s AWESOME in your hair. I like to let my hair air dry.  It&#x27;s half-way down my back.  I towel dry my hair...put a few drops on my hands, massage it through my hair, and, in the morning, I have beautiful beach-like waves - woo hoo!  And...it&#x27;s all healthy which I love.  Here&#x27;s another neat trick.  Put a few drops on your hands...massage it through your hair (wet or dry), braid your hair...put a few more drops on your hands and rub the braids...making them a little looser.  It&#x27;ll give you the prettiest waves in the morning!  I am not sure what all the benefits are of argan oil, but my hair seems a bit thicker, stronger, and healthier.  I think that ROCKS! :)  I don&#x27;t usually massage it into my scalp...unless I&#x27;m doing like an overnight treatment where I&#x27;m going to wash my hair the next day.  If you do that...you can use more than a couple drops...I massage it good into my scalp and throughout my hair.  The next day I wash it...I have shiny, soft, frizz-free hair - yay!  Body: Yes, I have put this argan oil ALL over my body, too-lol.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural and I don&#x27;t have to fear harmful ingredients. I have used it after derma rolling, glycolic pads, at home microdermabrasion treatments and even derma wand.  It just seems to sink it and gives my skin what it needs after I just tortured it - lol.  I wish the bottle was bigger! That would be AMAZING!!!  And...if it had a spray pump. I would seriously take it into the shower and spray it all over my body after every shower.  That is how much I love this stuff.  Here are a few neat tricks I use it for...hand treatment:  massase a few drops of oil into your hands and put on some of those cheap walmart/dollar tree cottony gloves, leave them overnight and in the morning beYOUtiful hands - heehee.  You can do the same for your feet, just wear socks overnight.  I know with puruskin what I am getting...all natural ingredients. You can&#x27;t beat that!  Yes, I&#x27;m a  return customer.  I have their derma roller...&amp; love it!  Yes, I tried it ALL over my body.  Call me nuts...but, when I get something, I put it to the test.  And...I love that their stuff really works.  I also love their customer service.  They are THE best!!! If you have a question, they&#x27;ll get back to you immediately.  You can tell that they really care about their customers as much as their products.  That&#x27;s hard to find in a company.  Thank you Puruskin!!!  This is another A+ product ;)</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review this product at a discounted rate for an unbiased review. I love the product, but the smell of it wasn&#x27;t very comforting. After I did use the product though I loved it. It&#x27;s the reason it wasn&#x27;t rated at 2 or 3 stars. My hair is really dry and the softness and shine this product gave me made me ecstatic. I do recommend trying the product. It&#x27;s a good buy for the cost. you just need to get past the initial smell...which in all honesty isn&#x27;t that bad, I just expected different, I suppose.</li>
    <li> A great shine pickup for my extra dry hair and makes it very soft. Not greasy i guess my last oil was not as pure. also used on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was bought on discount for review.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. It works well on dry skin, even my very dry hands. The shipment came quickly and was wrapped very well. I will order again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product came to my door in three days!  I already love it, makes my skin feel so nice :)  Thanks!</li>
    <li> works great, but i didnt like the smell. the scent was a lot stronger than usual and im not sure if that was because this was the triple virgin oil. but either way, it works just great! i used it on my hair and after using my hair so was soft. it does take me two to three times to completely wash out with shampoo. my hair is shiny and super soft. the bottle is made of glass and comes with a squeeze topper. I received this product complimentary for review purposes, all opinions are our own unbiased thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil I&#x27;ve tried a few Argan oils, and I think this is my favorite. It seems lighter thwn the others o have tried, which is great for the summer time! It is rich enough to do serious moisturizing though. I love using it on my nails too! Not only does it soften your cuticles, it helps your nail polish dry faster too!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel silky smooth. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Oil doesn&#x27;t go over well with my sense of smell. After using it, my skin, however, loved it!</li>
    <li> I loved this oil and definitely going to purchase it again</li>
    <li> This product is great, I love what it does for my hair and face. I recommend people use it</li>
    <li> First time user.  I really like the oil.  It is a great moisturizer for my skin and hair.  Will be sure to purchase again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I got this product on a promotional price in exchange for an honest review.&amp;#34; Multiple purchase, great for frizz, non sticky I love this- have bought multiples of the small bottles, i will definitely need to invest in a large one. i have long, thick hair that has a tendency to frizz and get poofy year round and in the summer months gets super oily after 2 days and in the winter after 3 days between shampooing. I put a small amount of this from my mid shafts down and it makes my hair so soft once it&#x27;s dry and helps so much with the frizz. I&#x27;d say best results are with it in my hair and letting it air dry, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hands and doesn&#x27;t feel overly heavy on my hair or make it oilier. Its also good for my nails it got thicker and slo works great on my skin it leaves softer and supple this really works great on everything.</li>
    <li> I use the Moroccan Argan Oil for my nails. They are stronger and not as dry. It&#x27;s great for my cuticles!</li>
    <li> I have a friend that has used it for ever and her skin is Beautiful! So I&#x27;m trying it!!!</li>
    <li> this is a very good oil. It&#x27;s light and though greasy at first, it absorbs fast. The next morning, my face is very very soft. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! High quality argan oil in a dark glass container which is nice. Apply daily for increased softness and a visible diminishment in fine lines.</li>
    <li> perfectly smoothes the skin.</li>
    <li> I used it on my face and for my hair. I noticed a difference right away. My fine lines were noticeably improved and my hair was shinier than ever. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have a curly hair and using Moroccan argan oil my hair look beautiful.  Using this oil is easy take care of my hair.  Don&#x27;t look dry.  I going to start using in my face too.</li>
    <li> This is my first extra virgin argan oil I&#x27;ve tried and I have to say the product works well. The bottle came packaged in a box and came with a long glass dropper in the bottle instead of a cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing bad I have to say is that it has a bit of a chemical smell I can&#x27;t really describe. It could just be my bottle or maybe the smell is from the process they used to make the oil?&lt;br /&gt;Either way smell and all, I ended up using the product on my face and hair. The smell actually went away after it was applied to both and left them feeling soft and moisturized. This is why the rating is not lower. Had this not worked like argan oil is suppose to, this could have easily gotten 3 stars. I will be contacting the seller to ask about their product and update my review after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This product works really well !! I applied it on my hair and my hair feels so soft and has an added shine to it. I even used it on my face and  my face feels so soft. I like that it is organic .  It has so many uses and I absolutely love this!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I use it at night.  It is very light.  It has almost totally removed a touch of rosacea that concerned me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other argan oils, and so far this one is the nicest I have tried. The smell is even nuttier than the previous oils, and feels less oily as well. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ! I love the way this oil makes my face feel !! Fast shipping and item exactly as described. Will absolutely reorder this product again from this company !!  Everyone should give this oil a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I love it.  I was very skeptical because it was so much cheaper compared to other brands i had looked at, but it seems very high quality and is moisturizing my skin beautifully!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!! I always use a small amount in my hair after I shower. This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found and I got it cheap for a product review. I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it in my homemade body butter and it feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Argan Oil by Puruskin&lt;br /&gt;Puruskin&lt;br /&gt;I received my bottle it is 2oz but it seems to be a lot more it came three days earlier than expected it has a really light smell very smooth and not greasy at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 or 5 different types of pure organic Argan Oils .. And this by far is the best I&#x27;ve used to date. My hair , skin and cuticles are in the best health ever. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> 100% pure and certified organic cold-pressed argon oil is a wonderful organic product for my skin, hair and nail.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! I am using it in combination with the derma roller for the reduction of stretch marks, along with many other things. It feels really concentrated and silky and I can tell that with consistent usage results will definitely come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful and very informative. They even have an insert with instruction to an entire e book with info on the many uses of this product. It shipped very quickly and there was tracking info available the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m hooked! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using the Argan Oil.  So far i like it!  I use it on some scars i have and it seems to be helping lighten them and i also use it on the ends of my hair.  You only need to use a tiny bit if you use it in your hair because a little bit goes a long way!  The bottle is definitely a good size for the price and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil but this oil smells awful!  There is no way I want this anywhere on my body!  It smells rancid, sour.  Did I get a bum bottle?</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil!  Honestly, if you derma roll (and I recommend Puruskin) you need to have Argan Oil in your arsensal of skincare products.  After derma rolling, I use the hyalauronic serum and then the Argan Oil.  Not only does is help to reduce the stinging sensation that results from rolling BUT it helps to moisturize your skin.  It only takes a few drops to cover your entire face and absorbs quickly!  I will continue to use my oil even on the off days from derma rolling.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! M yhairlooks and feels great</li>
    <li> I received my bottle if puruskin Aragon oil sooner than expected...I love it the smell is very light its smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> As soon as I got this oil, I shelved my other Argan Oil. this bottle is rich, suptuous and absorbs well. It seems to have improved my skin and nail beds as well as my split ends far superior to the other oil I was using. I use about 3-4 drops for my face and neck, mix it in with my cocoa butter for my body in the same amounts, and dab it onto my cuticles. It really is an all purpose beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! With the weather being so cold and the air so dry my skin has been so dry. I started slathering the argon oil all over my face nightly and it&#x27;s been amazing!!</li>
    <li> This argan oil was perfect for healing my son&#x27;s scars. He&#x27;s two and I really worried about putting certain products on his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> need to use it more to get a good feel for this but like it and priced good for quality product.  maybe more later when I have used it daily and for awhile to see if there is an improvement.  I bought this product from Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> This Oil is the best. I use it on my hair because its really dry. It keeps it moisturize and itch free. And that&#x27;s what I love. Overall body use I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product works well. Yet, has a strange funky smell. I don&#x27;t know if this is argan oils natural scent being that it is organic, but it&#x27;s bothersome. I only use it in days where I know I won&#x27;t go out. The smell does not linger when it&#x27;s washed out. So that&#x27;s a plus! It def dies condition and add shine. I would recommend if you can tolerate funky smells.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice Argan oil. Good for skin and hair. It&#x27;s organic, so I feel safe and comfortable when applying it on my skin. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair and skin and this oil has been fabulous for both. It does not leave your skin feeling greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin and hair. It has a slight scent that dissipates quickly. I love that it does so much more than just being used as a beauty product. The dropper makes it easy to apply so u don&#x27;t end up getting more than u need. Customer service is awesome and this product will go a long way.</li>
    <li> The packaging for this amazing Argan Oil was so professional and really, beautiful!  It was shipped very quickly and as I have been using it, the product is clearly high quality and has made my hair silky smooth.  My nail beds have been so dry from the winter and it has revived them quickly, even in the week or so I have used it.  AMAZING product and AMAZING company!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Use after I cleanse and tone, don&#x27;t need much, just a few drops.  Also use in hair.  I love that this works and knowing its safe and natural.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review on it.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and makes my skin soft.  Stretch marks on my abs along with using the derma roller seem less noticable, the tiny wrinkles by the eyes are less noticable and it makes hair soft and shiny.  I don&#x27;t like the smell. It has a strong odor that I can&#x27;t even describe but that goes away after a short time.</li>
    <li> So far ive had satisfactory results.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Super fast shipping and amazing quality!! Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Great product I love it</li>
    <li> After using this organic argan oil for the past week, I&#x27;m hooked-  my skin has never felt so smooth, it&#x27;s definitely going to be a permanent part of my skin regime! Thank you puruskin!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is excellent. The consistency and quality makes it an essential product for the skin</li>
    <li> Just received the oil.  I like the fact that it does not have a strong smell, like some argan oils I have tried.  It absorbes into the skin nicely and makes it feel soft.  Would reorder this one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product !!! I&#x27;m 24 but my skin is in pretty bad shape I look like I&#x27;m 30 I&#x27;ve been using this for about 72 hours and I have noticed a HUGE difference my skin looks hydrated the skin under my eyes is dramatically tighter and it gives me this pretty glow i No longer have to wear much make up it completely  replenish my skin will continue to buy</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love Argan oil! Just received my order and am very pleased with the quality and the bottle is huge. It has the warm nutty scent of pure argon oil. I love using it around my eyes and lashes as it seems a great conditioner for lashes and brows. It also feels great on the skin. Very soothing to use as a moisturizer after derma rolling.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for my hands and hair!!!! I put it on my hands a couple times a day with lotion and it really works well for dry skin. Also, love the shine and replenishment it gives my hair!!! Five stars for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Great product as no additional ingredients are added. Smell is slightly nutty which indicates this is pure Argan oil. I use it after Using my Derma roller and all over from my head to my toes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Josie Maran for a short time and I love this oil from Puruskin. It absorbs nicely into skin, rather than leaving my face greasy. It&#x27;s a great price for the size bottle too. I&#x27;ll be switching brands for sure!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I love it!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this.  I put it on first thing in the morning after washing my face and then put sunscreen.  My face feels and looks radiant and hydrated.  Also, it&#x27;s very mild and, again, I LOVE THIS stuff!!</li>
    <li> I stopped buying moisturizers, sunscreen and basically anything I apply to my hair and face, since I learned all about the quality and quantity of the most important ingredient are both unpredictable and laughable.&lt;br /&gt;I realized the only way to to know what I am using is if I get the pure organic quality ingredients myself. Therefore I was thrilled when I was offered to sample  PURUSKIN organ oil. Which is referred to as &#x27;liquid gold&#x27; due to its many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;PURUSKIN triple virgin cold pressed oil is full of essential fatty acids, anti oxidants, vitamins and minerals that moisturize, softens as well as protects hair and skin from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is considered dry as it absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy, which makes it great to add, or apply directly to just about anything from sunscreens to overnight hair conditioner. It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer, and helps eliminate wrinkles and scars.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of these!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I really like using it with my derma rollers for maximum benefit.</li>
    <li> I really make an effort to take good care of my skin, especially to compensate for years of torture from sun, wind, saltwater, dirt, sweat, etc.  This is a gem in my toolkit.  I love that just a little goes a long way and that I can use it on so many places including my hair which looks and feels amazing when I add this to it.  I keep a bottle in my medicine cabinet and another in my room.&lt;br /&gt;Until I found this I thought my cuticles were just doomed to be a painful nightmare during winter.  I can&#x27;t say I now love winter but at least I have one less problem during it. Several less problems actually since it has kept the rest of my skin and hair in good shape too.&lt;br /&gt;I like that is has a dropper for precise application and lack of wasted product.  It&#x27;s thin enough to spread a small amount over a large area but thick enough to apply a few drops with plenty of time to rub it around.</li>
    <li> Last year, I was in an accident that left many scars on both of my arms.  I have been trying many different products to heal the wounds and get rid of as much of the scars as I can.  I had ordered from Puruskin before and had been pleased with those items.  I have heard so much about Argan Oil, that when I saw the chance to buy some pure oil at a reasonable cost, I jumped on it.  I made a mistake when I ordered it, so I called Puruskin, the company selling the product.  Customer service was quick, and some of the nicest, most helpful people I&#x27;ve had the fortune of working with.  I know it is still going to take time for the scars to fade.  I&#x27;ll continue using the Argan oil because it penetrates the skin so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  I&#x27;ve quit using some products because I can&#x27;t stand feeling like a greased pig.  When I first started using Puruskin&#x27;s Argan Oil, I noticed a scent I wasn&#x27;t crazy about.  Another review of this product said the scent disappears quickly, so I put it on, and within seconds, I&#x27;d forgotten about it because I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the scent.  Even on my face near my nose, the scent goes away within seconds - especially if you put lotion of after - which I don&#x27;t.  Also, I tend to break out with acne when using any oil on my face.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with this oil.  The thing that has amazed me most with this product is that my nails are growing almost faster than I want!  I&#x27;ve always had short, peeling nails that look stumpy to me.  Putting the Argan oils on the cuticles is like a miracle!  My nails started growing faster and stronger than ever before.  So while I&#x27;m waiting &amp;#34;patiently&amp;#34; for the scarring to fade, I&#x27;ll have great nails!  I&#x27;ll put a review for this product and how it has worked on my scars when I&#x27;ve used it for a few months.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love it.  I use it with my Retin A (dr. prescribed) to make it softer and more effective.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works wonders!!</li>
