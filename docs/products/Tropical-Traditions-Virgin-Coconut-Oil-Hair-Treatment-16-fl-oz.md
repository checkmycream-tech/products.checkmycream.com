<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my 5th jar. Use on my hair and skin. Husband uses also..he is hooked! We keep 2 jars as back up. Look for sales...sometimes can get 2 for the price of 1!</li>
    <li> I am white &amp; do not have ethnic hair. At least once a week, I run this oil through my hair with my fingers, especially on the ends, tie it in a bun overnight and wash it out in the morning. It has completely repaired my damaged ends and my hair is much stronger and sleeker. I am able to grow it out longer than before without it becoming stringy &amp; weak. I don&#x27;t even need to use daily conditioner anymore. If you don&#x27;t wash the oil out completely, it will leave your hair visibly oily, so make sure to clean it out well. I use baking soda &amp; water followed by a little Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap. I even rub a little of this on my eyebrows, eyelashes &amp; the skin around and under my eyes at night. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and completely natural &amp; non-toxic. Love it.</li>
    <li> Left my hair very greasy.  I have dry brittle hair and was looking for a product that would help stop the breakage.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This products works great for hair and skin.  Have not used for cooking yet but will soon. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> too thick and has a bad after</li>
    <li> I should have read the other reviews more closely regarding the smell.  It definitely has a cooking oil smell to it and the barest hint of coconut.  I&#x27;m African American with coily, curly hair.  I like how it moisturizes, so a couple times a week I put it on my hair at night with a shower cap (to preserve my pillowcases) and use another hair lotion come morning to cover the cooking oil smell.  My hair stylist also suggested I rinse out the coconut oil the morning after I use it to help with the smell.  Supposedly since it&#x27;s a rinse and not a wash, the oils will be retained.  I haven&#x27;t tried that since I tend to switch up products, but plan to see how that works.</li>
    <li> This is the best coconut oil I have tried(and I have tried several)! A little goes a long way. I like the way it softens my hair. Also, the packaging of Tropical Traditions is done with great care and shipping is quick. I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
    <li> It came in a box with a styrofoam sleeve to hold the glass jar  in place and  a piece of card board on top of it.It was professonially packed and secured.The company shows professonial way in packing the product and stand behind the quality and purity.It looks just like I saw it online. I do smell the faint scent of coconut.It is a solid white oil and at times it will melt depending on the temperature in your home. I have it in on my dresser.It is rated 5 stars of high quality and guarantee of what it is.I just had it for almost a week and I am putting it in my hair.I even put some on my hands legs and a little on my face.The winter has really dried out my skin more and I do have dry skin anyway.It really helps to make it soft and mosturized.I do recommend this product to try.Excellent!</li>
    <li> Love it! Good for many uses. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product smells like bacon grease. I&#x27;ve bought some coconut oil from other brands and it never had this type of smell to it. I&#x27;m sure it was real coconut oil, but that bacon smell just made it terrible.</li>
    <li> After much use of mousse my hair finally took a whipping and it was opaque. I tried different products, but this one product really helped me restore that shine into my hair. I no longer even need to use mousse and I am in love with it. My hair is jet black and it looks and feels so healthy. Would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair and my wife now uses it for her hair. Helps provide soft and healthy hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> This is real virgin coconut oil!!!!  At first I really liked the smell but after a while the smell changed it did not smell very good, but I put it on my hair anyway.  I left it in my hair over night with a plastic cap on my head and the next morning my hair was so moist and so soft that I will just have to get over the smell.  I ordered it for my hair but it also makes you skin smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo20KIMQ38YOH1]]I have very coily natural hair and using the Tropical Traditions Coconut Oil for Hair Treatment as a pre-shampoo treatment really softened my hair, making detangling a breeze, and keeping it moisturized longer.</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s oil so what did I expect. I reviews two other products from TT and I&#x27;m saying the same thing for all - four stars only because I didn&#x27;t use it daily for l long term. But when I did use, the quality seemed high.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it seems like its actual coconut oil unlike some of the other products I have tried.

    <li> I love this product. The oil melts into your skin after you&#x27;ve had it on for a bit leaving it soft and smooth. It has a great  but not overpowering coconut scent. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I could have purchased 3 jars in the local Indian Market for the price of this one jar.  Too overpriced and nothing special.</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant. The shine it gives your hair is awesome and it softens my rough, kinky, curly hair! Naturals you would want to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this coconut oil. I treat my hair with it once a week and makes it so soft! The only thing is that I does smell somewhat like frying oil but I can deal with it because it is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I always thought all coconut oil was created equal...until I found this one.  My hair is thankful for it.  No more dry hair.</li>
