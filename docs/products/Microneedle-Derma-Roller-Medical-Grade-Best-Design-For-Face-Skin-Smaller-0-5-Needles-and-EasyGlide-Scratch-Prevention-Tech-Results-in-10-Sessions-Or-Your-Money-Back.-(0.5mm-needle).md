<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> did not reap any benefits after using for quite some time.</li>
    <li> This roller good for new skin generation  but one need to go through pain while doing this(don&#x27;t worry its tolerable one ), if you don&#x27;t want laser treatment, skin downtime, expensive skin treatments then this is your best bet. it takes time but sure it will work and also you need to apply some skin serum after using this roller to boost collagen generation.    i have used this around 8 times in 7 weeks and I can see my scars are slowly getting diminished and skin is looking brighter. i think continuous usage for six months will show better results. will post another review after 6 months of usage.</li>
    <li> works quite well I was surprised.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with the results i got from this product. I have very bad scars and wanted them to vanish even just a little would do for me. After using this product for  a few weeks and using as directed I saw amazing results. I had tears in my eyes from seeing how well this product worked for me. I am so thankful to have found this product and will continue to use it ! thank you for giving me a great results and helping me feel better about my scars!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the Microneedle Derma Roller for the money, and the delivery time was great. I have only been using it about twice a week for the last two weeks, but find it&#x27;s easy to use and I haven&#x27;t experienced any discomfort. Now that my skin is getting accustomed to the routine, I hope to use it every other day. My skin appears brighter already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65, older that a lot of people who have written reviews. I specifically wanted to get rid of the &amp;#34;eleven&amp;#34; lines that are starting to appear between my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been using this roller for two months about once a week. It is working! The lines are definitely less deep and sometimes, probably depending on how much I&#x27;ve been wrinkling my brow, they are not visible at all. I&#x27;ve also seen an improvement in my neck, although the skin there tends to stay red for a couple of days, much more sensitive than on my face. I&#x27;m using it with Vitamin C serum that I make myself, Retin-A and hyaluronic acid. I put these on right after rolling while the holes are still open. It stings a little. I know that the true results won&#x27;t show for months to come so I&#x27;m looking forward to an even greater improvement than what I&#x27;ve already seen.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really give an accurate review, just got it today! however what I will say is I enjoy the discomfort I get from using the derma roller - makes me feel like its really working especially the sting that is felt after products are applied to the  freshly punctured skin ;)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very sturdy. I love the the clear storage box. Would order again from this company.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I received an offer for this at a seriously discounted price.  I received it quickly (2 days). I can&#x27;t say a lot about how well it works, as it will take quite a while to see a difference.  I have some scarring on my upper arms that I hope this will make less obvious.  It appears to be well made. I was expecting something with a very cheap feel, but it is a higher quality than I anticipated.  It did hurt a bit, but not terribly.  I am using Bio Oil after using this, and I hope to come back in a couple of months with an update. I am going to Hawaii and I hope this will help me not feel embarrassed to show my arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gonna exaggerate this but it has been only one week and I can feel the different with my skin, it&#x27;s for sure one of my favorite skin care products of all time, looking forward to see the results after a month or something like this</li>
    <li> Works as intended and seems to be of good quality.  I&#x27;ve been using for several months with no problems and no complaints.</li>
    <li> I started noticing melasma or pregnancy mask on my face since the beginning of my second trimester, and it grew darker with time. After my lo was born, my skin started clearing out..but VERY slowly. Now i have patches on my face with a crows feet under my eyes, i feel horrible about the way i look. I was searching some serums when i came across this product and thought to give it a try. trust me it is worth it. I have used it just twice...but i can see my skin light and reduced under eye patch. I love it and am planning to get the bigger needle for much better results.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with Vit C serum.. and it is so much worth it!!! and yes..it is not at all painful. You can adjust the pressure as per your tolerance.</li>
    <li> I have used this roller for 2 months now and I love it. I have seen significant improvement in the lines on my face and also the veins in my legs. Thank you.</li>
    <li> As stated, no noticeable results yet.</li>
    <li> i cant believe how this makes my skin feel and look!  love it</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to; but your skin feels and looks much more vibrant than normal the next day.(I use mine in the evening) I&#x27;ve used hand held abrasion machines and pore brushes and I feel this is better.</li>
    <li> Best roller i have every had,could see a difference in my skin right away.</li>
    <li> Started using it beginning of Jan, not painful at all. Will keep going as everyone says you need to use it for a month or so to start seeing results.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It hurts wish there was a numbing cream!!!</li>
    <li> This seems a little intimidating at first when you see all the tiny little needles, however, it feels like I am exfoliating with something really good. If you are consistent with it, you will get the best results. I like to think I am aerating my face because afterwards I like to use my light Vitamin C Serum on my face. You will want to start pressing down light at first and then over time you will push little harder. The sensitive areas are still a little unnerving, but it is mind over matter (at least for me).</li>
    <li> I like it and I think it helped with my acne hyperpigmentation but I give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s not worth the amount of money I paid for and because it promised a free Dermi-Logic book but I never got it. I think I will be contacting the seller about this.</li>
    <li> This product helped me to remove blackheads from my face. With consistent use and the right serum, face cream, and/or moisturizer this product could probably work wonders. The roller came nicely packaged with all items as described. I purchased iodine wipes to disinfect my skin before use. I also watched a video online to see how exactly to use the product. Directions came with the roller but I do not recall if they were detailed (the directions may of been discarded after initial eye scan). I went online to download the user pamphlet and had a difficult time accessing. The product works well when used properly.  Aside from the difficulty acquiring the user guide I am disappointed that some of the needles on my roller are bent on the edges. As I was shaking the excess alcohol off the roller i must of knock the head of the roller on the sink making it come off. When I replaced the head onto the handle I realized some of the fine needles were bent.</li>
    <li> Strangely enough I could see results after the first week. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Ouch! You definitely know you are needling your face with this roller. I haven&#x27;t noticed major changes, but I have only been doing the rolling once every two weeks. (I do a glycolic acid mask treatment in between.) So, I have only done three treatments to-date. I did purchase hyaluronic acid serum from Cosmedica to use after the procedure.</li>
    <li> Honestly it takes 2-3 months to obtain maximum results. I have been rolling with .5mm every second day for the past 3 weeks and today my 1mm. The 1mm did not hurt me although my husband does not enjoy the .5mm. So clearly everyone is different. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and my husband is early 40&#x27;s. We both have fine lines and I have pigment or brown spots from hormone imbalance. I love this method. It does work. It does not hurt. It feels you got some sun. I advise using a good serum that contains vitamins C and E with hyraulic acid. The keys to fighting signs of aging.</li>
    <li> Good quality..still kind of expensive</li>
    <li> Highly Recommeneded!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.i done it once on my face.i was bit scare abt if left any scar because of redness n my skin went to bit more dark thn normal skin.but after I was waiting for recovery.i seen after two week my skin went to normal as befor n also I found bit chang on my skin.i will do again on my face .wish it will be more batter then now .thanks you so much you made my skin nice then befor ..I just love it again</li>
    <li> This is great! It is a little weird to get used to the sensation, but once you get the hang of it, it is easy. It is awesome to see the results so quickly!!</li>
    <li> I really like this roller.  The needles are smaller that the one I had and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  My skin looks very fresh and I have noticed a decrease in lines around my mouth.  It seems to really firm up my skin.  I would recommend this roller over the others.  I use it a few times a weeks.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Good for beginners. will upgrade eventually with the same brand</li>
    <li> Awesome easy to use no pain just results!</li>
    <li> Great packaging and very good instructions (PDF) came with Derma Roller.  Not having used the Derma Roller very long, I find each time I do that I am getting better and better at mastering its technique. (One tip that I read and shall share is that better results ensue by pulling the skin somewhat tautly to derma roll.)  The reviews I have read about the Derma Roller&#x27;s results are very motivating, so I would be the person who would want to derma roll every day! Only I am trying to follow the recommendation to derma roll from two to four times weekly.  Initially, there was some getting use to the roller&#x27;s feel on my skin but completely doable.  Actually, I find that as I derm roll my skin that I can tolerate a slight bit more pressure with very, very negligable discomfort. Interestingly ( and perhaps a bit unusual), I find that I kind of enjoy the derma rolling process. As to reporting on its results, I cannot at this point, but I do have high hopes and trust multiple reviews that I have read. Also, the seller has been very attentive to my questions and responded quickly and helpfully, too, which I appreciate.  With that in mind, I would recommend this derma roller!</li>
    <li> OK the thought of rolling fine needles across your skin may not sound sane, but wow does it work. At first, I winched, but after a few times I didn&#x27;t feel anything.  It has a nice tingly sensation. Following up with your serum or creams, you will see and feel results. My skin looks more toned and refreshed and the lip area is fuller. Currently using every evening and plan to continue. Very pleased with the quality of the roller and the results.  Customer service news and updates is very helpful.</li>
    <li> It is so excellent. I can see the results after the very first use.</li>
    <li> Using this product my face has dramatically change, i have no worries about pimples.. my face look younger, soft and firm... the needles are painless, I will  buy this product over and over again</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try the roller! I used regularly for a couple weeks, but honestly, it&#x27;s not crazy pain, but it&#x27;s not a feeling I looked forward to either!  So I didn&#x27;t stick to it long term, perhaps I would have seen more results? Do think I noticed a difference, but not wow!</li>
    <li> not for black complexion!!!</li>
    <li> Product is high quality and well made. It hurts to use at first but it does leave your skin looking and feeling smoother. I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results, but I don&#x27;t use it as consistently as maybe I should.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only rolled a couple of times so far, but it seems to be doing a decent job of repairing my skin. I have acne scars, and it makes sense to open up the skin so that it might be forced to heal. Hopefully will continue to see results!!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality roller. The needles are sharp and don&#x27;t cause too much pain when rolling.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the way the head rotates with your movements. It seems I get scratches easier with head that moves. Maybe it&#x27;s user error.</li>
    <li> not costly and works great...</li>
    <li> Like the product and noticed a difference starting the day after my first treatment.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about two weeks now (about 5 times) and I totally love it!  I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my eye / cheek wrinkles.  I use Vitamin C syrum after using the roller.  My face kind of feels like it is burning a little for several hours after using it my it is no big deal to me.  I&#x27;m hoping to see continued improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have only used it a few times, and already I am beginning to see results!  I have stretch marks around my chest and shoulder area because I was very skinny as a teenager and began gaining muscle in my twenties.  After only two uses, the stretch marks are beginning to fade away and I can see my skin actually changing.  I plan on continuing to use this product and also plan to purchase the cream that goes along with it.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> I have several derma rollers.  This one is for the face. This is the only derma roller that came with an E-book on how to use it. I&#x27;m going to buy some as gifts for my friends. I love it!</li>
    <li> Only used it twice so far, very easy to use, hard to say what the long term effects will be but for now it plumps up my skin, so I&#x27;m very happy, overall good purchase:)</li>
    <li> I have just started to use the Derma Roller and am seeing results already.  My hands have age spots and are looking old so I decided to only do one hand so I could compare. It definitely works!!!! I am seeing a big difference in my face and neck and the one hand that I am doing.</li>
    <li> I love this product ! My skin feels and looks former after only a few uses . I am very happy with my Derma Roller</li>
    <li> Amazing !&lt;br /&gt;Had been using micro needle rollers for a while on my face and recently bought this model since&lt;br /&gt;I had a baby almost 5 months ago and my stomach has stretch marks all over it so I have started to use the roller regularly to reduce my stretch marks and I feel more comfortable now with this model as it seems i can complete the treatment faster and with my skin less irritated at the end.&lt;br /&gt;The scratch prevention features works great and the treatment is much smoother then with my previous roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma roller treatments has improved a lot of my stretch marks appearance and also smoothed out my belly skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used 3 time on my face and neck as well as my upper legs so too early to tell true results yet , but I plan on being religious with my regiment and will let you know results in 30 days it has however brought a healthy skin glow to my face and so far I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> So far, I have only used this product once about a week ago, so still waiting to see the results. However, initial observation was that the process was painless, didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and very easy to use. Cleaning it was easy, and the storage container that comes with it is very useful. Will update review in a month or so with actual results.</li>
    <li> Customer service is excellent - follow up emails and instructions, tips help you to get the most out from your purchase.  I have used it only twice very briefly (mostly because of my schedule), it feels working towards a deeper layer than any moisturizer / serum is able to get to, so I am confident over the time I will see visible differences.</li>
    <li> absolutely love it!!!! I&#x27;ve got dry skin and my face was just piled with dead skin as I realised that only when I started using derma roller. any face cream gave me no affect as it couldn&#x27;t get deep in to the skin,but now I&#x27;ve got fresh revitalised and good looking skin on my face. now will try my derma roller for stretch marks. I&#x27;ve read other girls comments they say it works very well an stretch marks disappears. absolutelly recomend it to all ... My friends gives my compliments every day now. they say I look younger</li>
    <li> The only difficult procedure using the roller is keeping it level with the contour of your face or head to insure even penetration of the needles. This has become an easy and automatic task with the rotating head!  Brilliant thinking or maybe just recalling film of the Lunar Rover traversing the uneven surface, it works better than any of the other systems available on the market today..I have tried them all, this is the absolute finest.</li>
    <li> This derma roller give results! This has literally changed my skin and I am so grateful, it has made my skin look so plump, it has evened out my skin tones and it has also allowed my skin regimen to work even better b\c it allows the products to go deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, but i use this every night, I wash my face with my clarisonic and I use this microneedle aka dermarioller in every section of my face in all directions for the ultimate results, I then use my retina and it has literally changed my skin. I have a you tube page (meloneyn10) and I will be doing a video on this product as well! I can not imagine not using this everynight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it seems to work very well.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I just want to say first thanks to the seller for emailing me the helpful hints they were really detailed!! I&#x27;ve been using the roller for two weeks now and I have noticed a little difference in the elasticity in my stretch marks on my stomach. I also apply stretch mark cream to my stomach before using the roller. The 1st time I used the roller it scratch my stomach I&#x27;m guessing because of the pressure I applied was too much.</li>
    <li> Great product for a fair price. Have been using for every other day for 3 weeks and my skin already feels tighter!</li>
    <li> This product was super lame... It just helps your skin absorb product better but you&#x27;ll be fine without this product in your life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks.  Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in the appearance of my skin but definitely can feel that it is softer.  I use vitamin C and firming serum after I roll my face with the derma roller.  Will wait and see if there is improvement in tone after a couple of months of use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller then I thougt it will be But it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t matter I love it and it works good Easy to use</li>
    <li> Good quality product and very efficient follow-up enquiry made to Derma-Logi direct.  Would definitely recommend this roller - easy to use, with clear instructions on the company´s website. Glad I chose this one above the others advertised.</li>
    <li> After researching skin needling and the many benefits it offers, I choose the Derma-Logi Derma Roller. Honestly, I have only used it twice but I plan to use it two to three times a week. The emails sent by the vendor offered great tips on how to get the best results. I have sensitive skin and was reluctant to try something like this but I hate my hyperpigmentation more and have tried many treatments for it with limited success. In my research, I found many women who reported improvement with their hyperpigmentation issues. I eat a very clean diet and use organic natural products on my skin. I really have nothing to lose in trying this a few times a week. I am very happy with my purchase and the customer care has been first rate. I will update in a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the implement for a week. I think I&#x27;m seeing improvement in the circles under my eyes they don&#x27;t seem as deep. I am 74 years old so I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my derma roller. Definitely would recommend.  Great deal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Derma Roller for couple of weeks and have yet to see results, but I have to say it&#x27;s very easy to use and have no complaints. I just had a Photo facial so I stopped using it on my face, but I&#x27;ve read people using it on their hands also and I&#x27;m trying that next!!&lt;br /&gt;You definitely will feel some discomfort when using it, but I suggest starting first with a mild pressure and move up from there.</li>
    <li> So, first day I used the derma roller I have to admit, it hurt. There are 600 sharp little needles on the derma roller. That’s a lot of needles!! I promise, now that I’ve been using it for the last 7 days I really don’t find it as painful. Although I do still feel the needles but not like that first day. I really think that first day was more from never having experienced Derma Rollers before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using my new Derma Roller morning and night. On a clean face I roll the derma roller around for anywhere from 45 seconds to maybe 90 seconds. My face is red afterwards like I had just run a marathon. (Look at me being funny again!! I’m never ever running a marathon!) Then I add my vitamin C and my argon oil. I work in small sections when I use my Derma Roller. For instance, I roll my forehead on the right side, then immediately add my vitamin c, do my left side, add vitamin c and so on. I want to take full advantage of those little holes!! I can’t imagine that the holes stay open for too long. (Again, that is just my reasoning!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derma Roller head rotates to you can easily get under the eye, around the nose, under the chin. This little guy glides everywhere. I give it a little bit of pressure as I go. Trust me you don’t need a lot of pressure to get the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using this awesome little tool!! I haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere but my face yet but I can use it on stretchmarks! OH YEA!!!  You are making little holes all over your face, so your serums, creams and lotions are going to work even better than before!!! I LOVE this little tool!!!!!! I know that the Derma Roller is not an over night fix. This takes dedication and time. But, I&#x27;m already impressed!! This is a keeper!! 100%!!</li>
    <li> This is a quality product manufactured using medical grade stainless steel. It has a replaceable head, a travel  case and comes with a 100% Lifetime Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the .5 mm needle roller &amp; progressing very slowly. Because the needles puncture your skin, it is very important to micro needle on clean skin using a clean roller.  Extreme cleanliness is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A micro-needle session,&lt;br /&gt;Always disinfect the roller head with medical grade alcohol before  use.&lt;br /&gt;Clean your skin with alcohol or a cleanser before you begin.&lt;br /&gt;Roll over the skin while applying a slight pressure...be sure to reduce speed &amp; pressure when you change directions.&lt;br /&gt;Finish the treatment by applying a vitamin &amp; mineral enriched skin care product to your skin &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to disinfect the roller with medical grade alcohol &amp; store in its case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not necessary to roll everyday. The skin needs some time to regenerate.  It can take several months of persistent &amp; consistent rolling to  see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to talk  my daughter into using a Derma Roller on her chicken pox scars. If she can muster up the courage this might be the solution to getting rid of the unsightly scars that cover her torso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice like instructions I found on the Internet. Once every two weeks to be sure the skin heals. Doesn&#x27;t hurt too much, but I didn&#x27;t apply a lot of pressure either. After a month, I definitely notice the stretch marks fading. They aren&#x27;t gone, but absolutely look better.</li>
    <li> Within 3 weeks of use, can already see reduction in fine lines above lips, crows&#x27; feet area, marionette lines, elasticity in neck. Follow directions and your filler days will be over!.</li>
    <li> This is well worth purchasing.  I have tried many skin care products and none of them have given me the results I have seen using this roller.  My skin has improved greatly over the last 1 1/2 months with use 2 times a week using the .05.  Lines, pores and brightness are all better and keep improving.  I would highly recommend.  I was so glad I purchased the higher needle count and rotating head.  I am currently looking at purchasing new roller heads and a smaller roller for more intricate rolling around the nose and eyes.  Also I did not find it painful at all...it did redden my skin as you would expect but this did not last long.&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> This is a very high-quality derma roller. Consistent and prolonged use definitely does improve the texture of the skin.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my first roller. I have been using it for about a month. I choose this particular roller because of the reviews.  Well, it really works.  I can see improvement in my skin tone and acne scars.  It is super easy to use and clean.  I purchased the .5 roller and was pleasantly surprised that the pain level is minimum.  I use it for about 5 minutes each night.  My face does look like I have a sunburn after using but that does not last very long.  I use a HA serum followed by Aragon Oil and It is amazing how quickly and completely they are absorbed into my skin. I intend to graduate to the 1.0 in the future and it will definitely be this roller again.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is awesome.  I received an e-mail inquiring if I was satisfied with my purchase also a couple of e-mails thereafter with very helpful tips on using my roller.  Very, very, pleased with product and seller.</li>
    <li> Need some kind of numbing agent to use it. It&#x27;s not very painful, but the needles are a little annoying to stand it alone. Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to see a difference.</li>
    <li> I like the product so far.  I have only used it three times but it seems to be smoothing my skin a bit.  I am taking photos so that I can see the progress.  Every 5th time that I use it I will take a photo.  I hope for wonderful results!  I would recommend this product because I can see some smoothing already after three uses.  We&#x27;ll see just how much better my skin will be in the future (I plan on using it tonight for the 4th time)!  I think I will also try it for thinning hair.  I also like the pivoting head so that it rolls without scratching my face. Thank you for a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Delivery was so fast (got it in 2 days)... I received detailed information on how to use the roller which made a big difference. This was my first time using a derma roller and I am amazed at the result that I am already seeing after about 1 week plus of using it! My face is glowing my acne scars are fading. The customer service is great, they followed up with me 1 week after purchase to ensure that I didn&#x27;t have any needs for them to address. I don&#x27;t regret buying it :)</li>
    <li> hi guys- okay i bought this because my pores are getting rather large on my chin, nose and cheeks- my dermatologist told me that this happens at about age 45- basically your pores are like the opening of a bottle- but imagine that the opening is made out of elastic- the elastic stretches and then closes (contracts) again when you are young- but at about age 45, our pores stay open instead of closing again- so the opening of the bottle gets bigger and stays like that- anyhow, she wanted to charge me $600 for fraxel laser to help with my pores and i didn&#x27;t want to spend that- i had already paid $400 with her for ipl for sun spots and other brown spots which was amazing- ipl worked wonders for that and got rid of all of my sun spots basically&lt;br /&gt;- ANYHOW, back to this product- i have used this roller about 5 times over 5 months i&#x27;d say- it kills- i HATE using it- for those who say they can&#x27;t feel it- lucky them- i think it&#x27;s excruciating and i dread using it- as well, it scratches me up sometimes- the swivel head is not a good idea in my opnion- because it is very easy to scratch up the delicate skin on your face- the scratches heal very quickly however-&lt;br /&gt;as well, because it has an interchangeable head (if you want) it has popped off on me before during use and scratched me to death- the reason i am giving it 3 stars out of 5 though is because i DO BELIEVE that needling works! and i am happy to have had the chance to try it- even if this product is not the best quality- my pores ARE SMALLER FOR SURE- so i do think micro needling does indeed work- but today i am going to order a micro needle from white lotus in a .75 length to get deeper penetration and for what i think will be better quality- as well, i am going to buy NUMBING CREAM! lol-  try micorneedling- you won&#x27;t be sorry-</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Derma roller for 3 days and have seen a difference. I&#x27;m sure future results will be amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this derma roller so much. I did a lot if research on different ones and I am very pleased with my decision. I&#x27;m 38 and smoked cigarettes for 19 years. I have been using the derma roller on my lips to help with the small lines I notice have appeared on my lips. I also thought about lip injections but thought I should try this out first and see maybe I can avoid that procedure. I used the derma roller 2 days in a row then took a day off. Then another 3 days in a row took a day off. (Getting used to the needles.) I&#x27;m telling you from the first time I used it I was so pleased. It smoothed out some of my skin on my lips already and I&#x27;m so excited. They feel plumper too! I&#x27;ve always thought my lips were one of my favorite assets so seeing this is very promising. I would definitly recommend this item. It&#x27;s very imortant to moisterize your lips afterwards. I&#x27;ve used vasaline and Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid + Vit. C Serum and my lips feel so much better than they have in a while. I drink a lot of water too!</li>
    <li> I have used the derma roller 3 times now...I went to dinner with family and received many complements on my skin!!  It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of extra time. So far I am a big fan and will continue to use it</li>
    <li> seems to be best for darker discolorations and redness due to never burns or injuries. the ability to rotate is definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> I am very hopeful at this time.  I feel it is a good product and I certainly have received excellent service thus far.  I intend to use it regularly so I will definitely give it a chance to please improve my skin.</li>
    <li> The whole premise of micro-needling is intriguing to me.  I recently consulted with an MD who runs an medical cosmetic clinic and we discussed using Fraxel to combat scarring and age-related sagging.  The idea seemed sound, but I was leery of using a laser on my skin and worried that it might have some long-term effects that aren&#x27;t yet understood.  High energy treatments are still in their infancy and I can&#x27;t help thinking that it is too early to use them when the motive is purely cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I learned about Micro Needling.  The theory is exactly the same, but the technique is really ancient.  Nothing happens that doesn&#x27;t normally happen to the skin during a lifetime of wear and tear, except that the method is well thought out and organized in the way it is implemented.  This makes me more comfortable that in 5 or 10 years I will not look in the mirror and rue the day that I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE DERMA ROLLER - MICRO NEEDLE ROLLER WITH ADVANCED 360* ROTATING HEAD - 0.5 NEEDLE LENGTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this item, I had a number of issues I wanted to address:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Age related sagging of the neck and jowls.&lt;br /&gt;2.  #11 creases between the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Body sagging due to weight loss.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Acne scars which have bothered me since early adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Small surgical scar on the left breast.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Severe scarring on the abdomen due to a botched surgical procedure that happened 40 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tall order for any device, so I decided to start small.  Not wanting to micro-needle my face before trying it out on less visible areas, I opted to use the Derma-Roller on the small scar on my breast, the #11s between my eyebrows, and also on the sagging area of my neck and jowls.  For now, I am leaving the bulk of my face alone.  And with further research, I have come to understand that the sagging due to weight loss and the severe scarring on my abdomen calls for professional micro-needling treatment using longer needles than can be purchased for the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I Like About the Derma-Roller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is good quality - the needles are very sharp and it rolls easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It stings a bit, but doesn&#x27;t really hurt.  ( I cannot understand at all the reviews that complain of the pain.)  The pain is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  I did not experience bleeding, even though I put significant pressure on the roller.  Believe me - I am not a wallflower when it comes  to this type of thing.  No fear here, I gave it a good workout and didn&#x27;t experience a single drop of blood.  There was minor redness and swelling for about 24 hours after each treatment.  REMEMBER, I USED THE 0.5 LENGTH NEEDLE.  Don&#x27;t know what a longer needle would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4,  600 Needles!  This item can do more in less time than the other micro-needler that I purchased at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  RESULTS.  The best part is that the minor scar on my breast is looking undeniably fainter, and it was noticeable after only the very first treatment.  This is encouraging, however I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the minor sagging around the neck and jowls.  The #11s between the eyebrows are extremely deep and severe, so I would be surprised to see any improvement before several months have passed.  At this time it has only been a 2 weeks and I have been needling  every 3 or 4 days, meaning that each area has been treated 2-3 times.  I won&#x27;t try to evaluate the results before 4 months, MINIMUM have passed.  In a few months I&#x27;ll check back in with my final evaluation on how effective this is.  I might move to a longer needle, since I have since read that sagging requires deeper penetration, and also that #11&#x27;s sometimes respond better to single needling rather than a roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER:&lt;br /&gt;Things I DO NOT LIKE about the Derma-Roller:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  THE PACKAGING:  This is a definite WRAP RAGE ALERT!  It is so thoroughly bound up inone of those impossible clam shells that it is very, VERY difficult to  remove the item without damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  LOOSE ROLLER HEAD:  The process of opening the package was a big headache, and when it finally popped open, the roller head fell off of the handle and rolled across my dirty kitchen floor!  AARRGH!  I retrieved and sterilized it, and proceeded normally, but I am lucky that it didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  THE PIVOTING ACTION:  I know that this is supposed to be a plus, but I find that it makes the roller harder to control.  IMHO, this increases the possibility of injury, rather than preventing it.  That little roller head has a mind of it&#x27;s own and it takes a little practice to learn safe control.  I ordered another micro-needler at the same time as I ordered this one, and found the other one to be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about it for now.  In a few months, I&#x27;ll check in and let you all know if there is a brand-new me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Linda~one of those impossible clam shells that it is very, VERY difficult to  remove the item without damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.

    <li> I really loved this product! At first I was kind of scared of rolling needles over my skin, but to be honest this does not hurt at all! And I have noticed a difference after the first two uses! My scars has faded away alot.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product 2 weeks ago so I am still awaiting results.  The company is great about sending information on use.  It does hurt some, suggest using ice packs.  I divide my face into two sections switching areas.</li>
    <li> this derma roller is well made, sharp, good size, and does the job perfectly.. I am not sure about the rotating head, I don&#x27;t think it is necessary but I can work with it..</li>
    <li> I really love this derma roller. I have 3 others which I have put to the back of my bathroom cabinet because this is my absolute favorite! The way it turns 360° is ingenious.  Thank you derma logi!</li>
    <li> Just received my Derma Roller in the mail. Was a little surprised to open it and find no instructions. There was however, a QR code on a strip of paper that reads \\&quot;WARNING!

I used my typical \\&quot;for junk mail only\\&quot; email account and reluctantly hit \\&quot;submit.\\&quot; Then a screen pops up telling me the guide is on the way to my inbox, and below it says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Want to receive a free replacement head from us?

You can easily and safely use the derma roller in the comfort of your own home and save yourself the time and expense of having other treatments such as laser or other aesthetic treatments. The derma roller can be used regularly to help reverse and prevent signs of ageing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Derma Rollers have been around for some time, yet not all are created equal...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derma-Logi micro-needling system offers the latest in derma roller technology and safety to help you get your skin looking its best, without wasting your time and your money on expensive and invasive clinic treatments. Derma-Logi roller features Advanced Scratch Prevention Technology: The 360 degree turning head and the 10 separately rotating needle discs allows this roller to smoothly glide over your skin curves and prevent it from scratching. A high needle count ensures that a large surface area of skin is affected by each roll. To prevent falling needles, the needles are fixated into the rolling disks. Needles of a shorter length are safer for home use and are less irritating to the skin. The detachable head will make cleaning easier and will allow the replacement of the Head whenever needed. Derma-Logi derma roller will ensure your comfort, safety and will help you get great looking skin results from derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Unpacking your derma roller - what&#x27;s in the box&lt;br /&gt;While unpacking your Derma-Logi roller for the first time please verify the following:&lt;br /&gt;2.1. Make sure your Package is new and is sealed by a plastic shrink wrap for your hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;2.2. Your box contains: A Derma Roller handle and rotating head, a plastic travel case, cleaning and disinfecting cup which can also be used a counter top mount.&lt;br /&gt;2.3. Take a close look at the roller different parts, make sure they look intact and complete and verify that the needle head is firmly attached to the roller handle. (The head might have partially detached in the box and you can clip it back into place)&lt;br /&gt;2.4. Gently turn the rotating head and the disc needles to verify the movement is smooth and the device is functioning as you would expect it to.&lt;br /&gt;If something is missing, damaged or you have ANY doubts - contact us first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Preparing and disinfecting your roller before and after use.&lt;br /&gt;3.1. Disinfect the Roller Head with Medical grade alcohol before and after each use. Place the roller inside the designated soaking plastic cup and fill it to the top with medical grade alcohol (with 70% isopropanol) that can be found in stores. Make sure the whole needle head is covered with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;3.2. Use alcohol or your preferred cleanser to clean your skin in the treated area before the micro-needle treatment.&lt;br /&gt;3.3. When you are done derma-rolling place the roller head into the soaking cup again to disinfect and clean it again before storing it for next use.&lt;br /&gt;3.4. After using the roller and cleaning it, let air dry completely before returning to the plastic case and store it for next time.&lt;br /&gt;3.5. Store in a dry place and keep away from the reach of children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) How to safely perform the derma rolling treatment.&lt;br /&gt;4.1. (when rolling for the first times) Select a Test Area first, a less gentle part of your skin where you can test and learn the behavior of your roller before treating your more gentle areas.&lt;br /&gt;If any learning and testing mistakes occure, they better happen on your paln then your face.&lt;br /&gt;4.2. Cleans the skin in the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;4.3. Roll over the skin while applying slight pressure in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions on each part of the treated area. Reduce speed and pressure while changing directions.&lt;br /&gt;4.4. To make the best of the rotating head function and prevent scratching: apply mild pressure and let the roller adjust itself and glide over your skin curves.&lt;br /&gt;Find the right pressure for you to apply; a too high or low pressure can result in unexpected turning of the rotating head.&lt;br /&gt;4.5. To complete the treatment apply a vitamin or mineral enriched skin care productsuch as a cream, serum or mask. Your treated area is now open to better absorb the product and makes it a thousend times more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Handling Pain and Fear from Derma Rolling.&lt;br /&gt;While most customers report a feeling of itching or a sunburn like feeling on their face and other gentle areas they don&#x27;t find it to be painful and it does goes away after some time or overnight.&lt;br /&gt;It is advised to stop rolling over your face if you feel ANY risk or unbearable feelings.&lt;br /&gt;In case you have hesitations from derma rolling or are experiencing pain you might want to use some of these tips:&lt;br /&gt;5.1. Try and experiment with Derma Rolling on other areas of your body which might be less sensitive then your desired area and use Derma Roller for: stretch marks removals, old scar removal and cellulite treatment. On your arms, legs or such areas which might be less sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;5.2. Make sure you cleanse the treated area before the treatment. (do clean and disinfect the roller as well of course)&lt;br /&gt;5.3. Apply MILD to LOW pressure while rolling as you want to control the depth that needles goes into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;5.4. Only roll 2-3 times over each part of the skin to reduce the amount of micro wounds on each part of the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;5.5. It is most recommended to perform micro-needling treatments in the evening so that you stay in a clean and more sterile area while your skin naturally heals from the micro wounds.&lt;br /&gt;5.6. Apply a skin care Cream or Serum but AVOID using VITAMIN C as this makes it sting! Use Hyaluronic asid or other formulas instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) How To Get The Best Results?&lt;br /&gt;As in many other skin care treatments results comes with time and consistency!&lt;br /&gt;It is advised to use your derma roller 2-4 times a week according to your ability and and how dedicated are you going to be with this, more treatments gets faster results...&lt;br /&gt;While most of our customers reports a significant and noticeable results within the first five treatments, as well as comments from friends and family, it takes longer to achieve real, solid and clear results and this is an on going process.&lt;br /&gt;If you start with a 0.5mm needle length and after a while you feel confident with derma rolling and want to step it up - get a replacement head of 1.0mm for deeper penetration and a stronger impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) The Science behind derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering how the Derma-Logi derma roller works, you can think of it as a natural way to help your skin renew itself. The very fine needles are able to target not only the upper layer of the skin known as the epidermis, but also the deeper dermal layer of the skin called the dermis.&lt;br /&gt;Stimulating the dermis increases the production of collagen and fibroblasts which support the skins layers. As a result of this stimulation, new and supple skin is regenerated as healing occurs rapidly. The new skin grows, improving the overall look of the skin which has become tighter, brighter and firmer. With the regular use of micro needle stimulation, wrinkles are reduced, fine lines are eliminated and the skins texture becomes smooth and even; this is truly an anti-aging product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) A Derma Roller can be used for various skin conditions:&lt;br /&gt; Reduces Cellulite and Stretch Marks&lt;br /&gt; Hair Growth enhancement for Thinning Hair&lt;br /&gt; Reduces the appearance of Acne Scars And other Scars&lt;br /&gt; Stretch Marks from pregnancy, weight loose and aging&lt;br /&gt; Sunspots and hyper-pigmentation&lt;br /&gt; Smoothes facial Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Pores, and Eyes pouches&lt;br /&gt; Creates Firmer, Tighter and a more Revitalized Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Dropping from two stars to one star. Would give zero stars if I could. After using the Derma Roller for three weeks straight, I finally gave up after not seeing any results or changes whatsoever. Not even the faintest change in skin texture or appearance. It&#x27;s not painful as some mentioned, but it&#x27;s definitely not comfortable using it. I was further annoyed after receiving multiple emails from Derma Roller urging me to put a review on Amazon, and then sending another email stating that it could take up to 9 months to a year to see any results and to stay diligent in my use of it.&lt;br /&gt;I will just continue using sunscreen, drinking lots of water and trying to be as preventative as I can when it comes to skin care!such as a cream, serum or mask.

    <li> I have used it for the first time, tonight.  I will be updating as I go. It is my understanding that you need to do three treatments a week for six months to get the full effect, so I wont know for awhile exactly what I think. This is what I know so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller seems to be very well made and smaller than I had expected. It isn&#x27;t painful, but over bony areas (forehead/chin) it is a bit uncomfortable. Its easy and fairly quick to do. I did my face, neck and chest. Afterwards my skin feels a bit dry and itchy. I need to get a product to put on afterwards, I am currently out of such products. That&#x27;s about all I know so far.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this tool from Rodan and Fields but didn&#x27;t want to spend that $$$ so I opted for this one.  Needles are short and not painful but this tool has multiple &amp;#34;wheels&amp;#34; of needles which is different from the RF needler.  It&#x27;s not bad-just different.  Also the head rotates which i don&#x27;t like at all-----the RF tool does not rotate and it felt like i had more control with that one. Again for 1/4 of the price I can deal with these small issues</li>
    <li> I use the 0.5 for my face and 1.0 for the rest of my body.  I am very happy with the results.  My face is clearer and softer.  Best of all my face is brighter giving it a younger glow.  I am getting the same results with the rest of my body.  I like the fact that Derma Logi includes little cups which I use for disinfecting the derma rollers.  I also like being able to disconnect the 0.5 derma roller from the handle and replacing the 1.0 derma roller to the same handle. I would highly recommend this product for a better skin appearance.</li>
    <li> Love love love! This roller is so much easier to use than the other ones I have bought! Plus replacement heads!!!</li>
    <li> I have never used a derma roller before. I&#x27;m 47 years old with lots of fine lines. Creams alone weren&#x27;t softening the lines or totally removing the dark spots on my face. This roller has helped with both of those issues. My skin is also more firm since using this roller. I have used this approximately every other day for about a week. It took a week or so to start noticing any improvement. I use the roller in conjunction with retinol and a glycolic acid cream (alternating which cream I use). My skin is combination and not sensitive. I will say that the derma roller does hurt. The longer I use it the more tolerable the pain seems to be. I would recommend this for anyone who has been debating trying it! I&#x27;ve seen an improvement above and beyond what creams alone can provide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update. The only drawback I have found so far is the fact that the roller head pivots. It&#x27;s easier to scratch your skin when the head constantly moves. After some practice, I have been able to control the head better, so I wouldn&#x27;t say that the rotating head is necessarily a disincentive for purchasing this product.**</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I was pretty skeptical at first, but I am so happy that I didn&#x27;t let that stop me from giving this a try! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, every other night and afterwards, I use coconut oil with 2 drops of frankincense essential oil, as a moisturizer for my face. I&#x27;ve seen a DRAMATIC difference in the texture and noticed my acne spots were healing at a rapid pace!  The only  downside of using  this device is that it is slightly painful, especially on the forehead and anywhere there isn&#x27;t a lot of fatty tissues, like the eye and nose areas.  But if you have had a tattoo, you know you can live through it. That&#x27;s what it feels like. Anyway, I&#x27;m super pleased with my purchase, and I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, and works well when using on my face. However, the rotating head seems to be a little too loose, and sometimes flips on its&#x27; side during use. Overall, it is a good idea for overall body use, it just seemed to rotate a bit too easily. Delivery was timely, and it arrived very securely wrapped, with a nice storage case-- and the derma roller sealed in sterilized packaging.</li>
    <li> When I first read about the derma roller I sort of pictured my face turning into pinhead from the movies... rolling a roller full of pins over my face and body seemed intimidating to say the least. I read the directions, then used alcohol to clan the roller and washed my face. Taking a deep breath I began rolling the derma roller over my face, over the stretch marks on my belly, and the back of my hands. At first I didn&#x27;t feel anything, it honestly does not hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the rolling with moisturizer. The first day nothing, second day nothing, third day I began to notice my face seemed a little fresher and the back of my hands seemed younger. As the days progressed my face was the most noticeable, probably because it&#x27;s the least damaged, but my hands and finally the stretch marks began responding. The first time I used retinal after rolling I did feel a minor tingling, not a sting or a burn, just a &amp;#34;hello there!&amp;#34; tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do see a reduction in the lines in my forehead, especially paired with niacin cream. The back of my hands definitely look better, my forearms seems smoother when I bend them up towards my body they don&#x27;t seem so accordion like, and those stubborn stubborn stretchmarks are starting to fade bit by bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply clean it before and after every use. The roller came with a cap that is nice to keep it clean. I&#x27;m really pleased with the results and the lack of pain with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love rolling it over my head. My scalp feels invigorated and it&#x27;s like a mini massage each time. I worried about it tangling in my hair but I just follow along my hair growth, like using a comb, and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sent for evaluation</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that this really helped maybe a little as far as getting serum into skin...I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 weeks. I noticed no change in the first four weeks, but a minor difference in the last two. My skin looks smoother, with less noticeable pores. I have very slight fine lines under my eye on the orbital bone and it hasn&#x27;t made any difference on that, and it&#x27;s made a small difference on my acne scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it because I think it makes sense and it doesn&#x27;t bother me... the microneedling itself just feels like minor scratches, and it&#x27;s only hurt once afterwards, when I probably got too into it. ;) I pressed harder than I should have, I think, and ended up red-faced the next day, like a sunburn. But aside from that time, it&#x27;s been fine. I use it in conjunction with vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other concern-- which is sort of a mixed blessing-- is that the company follows up a LOT. I received this for review, and I&#x27;m not sure if they do it to everyone or only reviewers, but they&#x27;ve gone so far as to call me on my cell phone unexpectedly to ask how I like it and when I&#x27;m going to review it, and sent numerous emails asking how I&#x27;m doing. As I explained on the phone, I didn&#x27;t want to review it after just a week or two or all I could say was, \\&quot;This product did nothing.\\&quot; I wanted to give it a fair chance to work, so all the following up got on my nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it&#x27;s a worthwhile product to add to your skin routine.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;m very glad! Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the result at first day.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend. The staff are very professional!</li>
    <li> This works great on my face, I haven&#x27;t tried it on my scrares yet. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. Thanks, very happy!</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing a dermaroller, but after finally getting cleared up with my skincare regimen, I knew it was time to help me get rid of the few scars that was left on my cheeks. If you are suffering from acne and have scars, do NOT use this product unless your skin is on its path to being very clear with NO active blemishes. If you have active spots on your face that are still popping up and you use this, then you are only going to spread the bacteria all over your face making it WORSE on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So wait to use this! Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a good amount of time looking around for a good one and finally decided on this one, and I have no complaints as to how the product itself is made. Not to mention it&#x27;s a great deal for the quality. It&#x27;s sturdy, fits nicely in my hands, the (titanium) .5mm micro needles are just perfect to begin with, the head rotates for easier use, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is cheaply made like a few I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the product great, but the company goes out of your way to send you an e-mail to give you a full DETAILED guide on how to use this, what you should do to clean, when you should use it, how you should roll, etc. They even e-mail you to make sure you got it since they care about their customers so much. You couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about a couple weeks now, and I&#x27;ll admit I was a little nervous at first, but once I started it was a breeze. It doesn&#x27;t hurt bad, just feels like someone is taking their fingers and lightly tapping your skin with their fingernails (well, for me it does considering I have a high tolerance with pain). I bled just a teeny tiny bit, but it wasn&#x27;t nothing major to where I was turned off by the product. My face was red for little bit afterwards, but I was able to apply my serums and moisturizer with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more months of using this. I don&#x27;t expect to wake up one day anytime soon and see a major improvement, but at least I know deep down in those scars, something is changing for the better. My scars aren&#x27;t deep, but they&#x27;re enough to annoy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several people tell me I am wasting my time with this, that it isn&#x27;t going to change anything and that I am better to go get laser treatment if I am that concerned about my small scars, but let&#x27;s be honest here, I don&#x27;t have that kind of money. I am fine with doing this for however long I need to. I have heard and read about many success stories with using one of these, so I am going to stay positive. I hope that so many of you that are using this see major results, as well. We all deserve to have nice skin.nths of using this.

    <li> We are new to micro needling and frankly, my wife thought it was a gimmick at first.  However, after a few weeks of use, she (we) is convinced it works.  In fact, we were intrigued by the product and conducted some research.  Based on what we found, there is little dispute that micro needling works to varying degrees based on the individual and application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derma Roller arrived packaged very well with great instructions.  The company provides great support for this product. You can store the roller with the provided cap or, in our case, we store it in the long hard plastic case it arrived in. The roller itself is built very well with high quality materials. The design of the roller made it very easy for everyone in our house to use (you can share the Derman Roller with proper sanitization). What I also like i sthat replacement heads are easily available and only for $10.  As a side note, if you are new to micro needling, I recommend you start with the 0.5mm and then progress as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usability is fantastic. The roller is very easy to use.  First time users will likely experience slight irritation. If you are allowing a child to use (for example, to increase absorption of acne medication), I recommend parental supervision.  My recommendation is not for safety concerns, but for proper use.  My wife noticed an immediate improvement in the absorption of topical skin applications when the Derma Roller is used first (for about 2 minutes).  Our teenage daughter used the derma roller prior to applying acne medication.  After twelve or so applications, she believes she responds better to the acne medication when using the Derma Roller compared to when she does not use the roller. In my case, I noticed slight improvement to some minor scarring near on my hand (I used a specific scar for my testing in addition to my face).  By no means does it make the scar go away.  However,  it seems to reduce the scar visibility to some degree. As a male, what I found intriguing is that using the Derma Roller, I have less ingrown hairs on my face than I normally have (I am a frequent shaver).  For me, this has been the greatest benefit whereas for my girls, absorption of topical applications is their greatest benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I received a sample for testing and an honest review, I think we will be using this in our household regularly.  Definitely the girls will.found intriguing is that using the Derma Roller, I have less ingrown hairs on my face than I normally have (I am a frequent shaver).

    <li> only reason i gave it 3 stars is because of the rotating head when i first saw the product thought it be a great idea but now that i own it i regret it..</li>
    <li> I got this just to check it out. I have clear skin and just a few small fine lines (i&#x27;m 28) and i&#x27;ve been using this at night before bed. i&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my skin looking glowy and its really really soft. I would recommend. keeps your skin stimulated.</li>
    <li> I am still healing from a total face lift, around ears are still swollen and very sore, I must make sure I am healed good before I do this.&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate getting these updates and tips from you, I have read soooo many articles, but this - from you - is straight from the horses mouth, so to speak......smile...........&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this service, you Do go above and beyond what I expected!!&lt;br /&gt;In a month of two, I will have used the roller I&#x27;m sure, and I will be glad to give you an honest review of my experience.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to hold and maneuver around your face. I started with .5 mm length needles.&lt;br /&gt;The small holes make your facial products get right where they need to be without having to rely solely on soaking into your skin.  Read the important email  you&#x27;ll receive after purchase which has important info on using the proper cleaning solutions for your face and the tool itself.  It DOES matter the kind of alcohol you use!</li>
    <li> I just recieved my derma roller yesterday 4/22/14.  It came in a timely manner.  Im disappointed that there are no instructions with it.  Just a long card telling me to go to derma-logi.com/freeguide.  I did &amp; there are no instructions there.  I would really like to have the instructions especially because it says &amp;#34;don&#x27;t start until you get them&amp;#34;.  I am really anxious to get the instructions &amp; get started.  If anyone knows let me know.</li>
    <li> 4 star easy roller treatment a snap to use to create smoother skin without paying high clinical prices.  Somewhat&lt;br /&gt;drying to skin so spacing treatment schedule. Easy use and directions made for immediate use day I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it twice and think this is a good way to treat skin and reduce lines and skin issues</li>
    <li> It is important to use and cleanse correctly but the premise that it works on is solid and scientific.  I have had laser treatment and this is an at home treatment that does a similar thing...it makes your skin work to repair itself and therefore generate collagen.  i did not find it painful or hard to use.  You need to make sure that you follow the directions and pick up the roller before you change directions or you will scratch yourself.  I think my skin looks better and will continue to use with confidence.  It works, especially if you use it with good products that can enhance its effect. I think it is better to buy this version from the manugfacturer rather than a knock-off because, if using on your face, especially, it is best to get the most number of needles and the best made.  I would recommend highly</li>
    <li> I love this!!After regular use I can see an improvement in my skin. It is a part of my nightly routine that I will not skip.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, but I wanted to use it several times before reviewing it.  So far I&#x27;ve only been using it on my face.  I am 40 years old and a long time smoker.  I have pimples (not acne), with some acne scarring.  I also have fine lines around my eyes, forehead, and around my mouth.  I added this to my new regime.  I have not had any problems using this.  The first few times I did have a bit of puffiness in the morning, but it went away quickly.  I must say that I&#x27;m really enjoying the way my skin is looking now.  I also changed most of my skin care items.  I&#x27;m using this along with Kiehl&#x27;s night-time recovery.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement in the lines around my eyes and I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use will do for me.  I&#x27;m currently using this every three days and I took the advice of another reviewer and am using Efferdent Denture Cleanser for soaking the device in.  I went to my local store and picked up some bactine spray for my skin.  I spray it on a cotton swab and then apply it to my face before needling.</li>
    <li> Not only do I love this product, I love that the company does not abandon you but keeps sending tips (and morale support) on how to use it  I think how often to use is as important as technique.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying both the ease of use and the gentleness of the 0.5 needle length.  While it is still too early to judge results, I&#x27;m hoping to be able to give it five stars in the next month or two.</li>
    <li> I have been using the roller since July. I see very good results on my face. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the roller two times but can say it&#x27;s very easy to use. I didn&#x27;t think the pain was too intense but everyone is different. I used at night time and applied by cream after. There was a small amount of redness and felt like I had a slight sunburn. I will continue until I see results.</li>
    <li> The roller works great - it comes with a storage tray and little disinfecting cup. The head rolls &amp; pivots smoothly, at least to my liking. The company even has a downloadable pdf with instructions. I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
    <li> I get the heeby-jeebies seeing instructions about using numbing cream to deal with pain.  I would never do a home cosmetic procedure that caused any real amount of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use rollers like this, 0.5 size, on rough spots, age spots and such.  I normally apply a anti-biotic cream afterwards to avoid any irritation.  I have never had any pain beyond a very slight prickling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a free sample of this model and find it does have some advantages.  The head of the roller rotates at the neck, also the needle are on wheels that rotate separately, not on a single solid roller. I think this does allow it to follow skin contours better--although it makes me extra carefully about sanitizing between uses as it makes lots of little areas that dirt or bacteria could get caught in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on a product sample from the vendor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. An incredible beauty product that is simple yet powerful. Easy to use, fast, visible results. Why didn&#x27;t I know about this sooner?? Love it!</li>
    <li> no results yet still waiting maybe it is still early and needs some more time i will let yo know as soon as i see some kind of change</li>
    <li> Though it may seem barbaric, the science behind needle/derma rolling makes a lot of sense. I did a lot of research on how the skin renews itself and needle rolling seems to be a miracle for skin rejuvenation and collagen boost. As far as the product review I got my needle roller from Derma Logi yesterday and used it the first time. I washed my face with mild  castille soap. I then soaked the roller in rubbing alcohol. While I waited for the rubbing alcohol to evaporate from the roller I rubbed my face with an ice cube not only to numb it a bit but to tighten the skin. I then used the needle roller. It stung a bit and my face did get red. Since I stopped using chemicals on my face a long time ago put carrot seed oil and coconut oil on my face as moisturizers right after needling. Coconut oil is by far my most favorite out of all natural and chemical moisturizers out there. When I woke up today I felt my whole face tightened a bit, my complexion looked flawless, my pores looked smaller and overall the skin on my face felt baby smooth. I love this product and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again in a few days. Not sure about other rollers, but I like the fact that this one rotates which makes gliding easier.</li>
    <li> The company not only sent me an e-mail with info on how to use it but how to take care of it before I received the actual product.  Upon receiving the roller I was sad to see that it was damaged.  I sent an e-mail and was immediately responded to, not only with an email but a phone call the very same day. They are sending me a new one.  The company definitely stands behind it&#x27;s product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had chosen this particular brand from all the wonderful reviews I read and hope that I will see the same results.  I am giving 5 stars due to the company&#x27;s amazingly fast response.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this device on my face twice, so of course I don&#x27;t expect results. I&#x27;m not sure at this point if I like the rotating head .. seems I find myself correcting the position a few times during the course of treatment. When using on my scalp (thinning hair) it did pull on my hair a bit. Maybe the 0.5 is too short for hair. I&#x27;ll keep at it for a few more weeks, then I&#x27;ll graduate to the 1.0 version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m typically skeptical about items that make you look younger but I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m 32 and starting to show signs of aging on my forehead. I&#x27;ve been using this product a few times a week for a month now and I can actually see a difference! My skin is beginning to look younger again.</li>
    <li> I am 37 yrs old and I bought this derma roller in hopes that it would help with some of the scars that I have acquired. I was amazed that within just a couple of months my skin tone had already started to improve. I have been using this on my face for these past months now. Not only have my scars become less visible, but I also had some dark pigmentation spots on my face since I had kids. The pigmentation has lightened quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a day, in the evening before bed. I wash my face with a mild soap, then I spend about 5 minutes using this derma roller on my face. I then wash my face again with an acne wash and apply my night cream. My face feels great and my skin tone is evening out. So excited. I think I may add this to my evening routine and possibly try in other areas too (stretch marks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it is really simple to clean also. I just keep a small baby food jar of rubbing alcohol in the bathroom that I dip it in when I am done using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 0.5 version.  It is not painful to use.  I have only used this twice so far.  Both times, my face looked sunburned the day after.  Though, the effect did not last as long after the second time.  I have a feeling my skin will get use to the treatments soon.</li>
    <li> “My husband bought it for me, It arrived very quickly as well as some vital information from the seller himself who made sure i received it and that everything was ok during the waiting days for it. I love these products and this one seems to offer the most advanced features. It is much easier and painless to roll it due to the rotation and it feels it makes more “work” in a single stroke than what I was accustom for so far (Obviously, 600 needles is the highest amount of needles I seen in 0.5 mm needle length).&lt;br /&gt;I use it for cellulite and wrinkles. I have chosen the 0.5 mm due to significant part of my treatment being on my face. So I wanted to have the most efficient length and the most safest. I try to have it every second evening before bedtime since I want to give my skin the most amount of time for rest before potting any makeup or creams over my face.&lt;br /&gt;My husband might have bought it for me, but he also enjoys me using it. Love it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received my Dermaroller System on the day I was told I would. I used it for the first time and was very careful to follow all the directions. I did have some burning but it only lasted for about 15 minutes and I used a fan to cool it down. It did not hurt at all. My face was very red but I expected that thanks to the outstanding instruction booklet that I was able to download and print out. I plan to take a before picture in the morning and then follow ups every month to keep a record of the changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all so much. I look forward to continued communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lacy</li>
    <li> Super product that I stumbled upon as i was preparing to embark on a badly needed skin treatment for my aging &#x27;ruddy&#x27; face.  This little guy is super-easy to use, quick and not painful at all (at least to me)  Although, I am a guy!  HA  my ex-wife and daughters are telling me how MUCH improved my skin looks in only a short couple of weeks.  I put vitamin C cream on afterwards to pep-up my skin.  I&#x27;m positively glowing now!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  Ladies, get your guys on-board...there is a good looking guy hiding under his old, sun exposed  face!!!</li>
    <li> After carefully reviewing various brands, I purchased the 0.5 derma roller with a 1.0 replacement head from Derma-Logi in May 2014.  The company not only shipped quickly, but sent  emails with very useful tips. I received 3 or 4 emails spaced at about a week apart with helpful information and encouragement concerning derma rolling. This really kept me going as derma rolling is not exactly pleasant...but extremely effective.  When changing to the 1.0 replacement head, I found the 0.5 very difficult to remove. When I finally dislodged it, it flew across the room hitting a tile floor.  I was concerned that it was damaged and contacted the company. They responded quickly and offered to replace the head at no cost to me.  What great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the effectiveness of the product, after 2 months, there is a real improvement in my skin. (The pivoting head makes it easy to navigate facial contours.) I have one scar that has smoothed out considerably and is much lighter in color. Unless I point it out, nobody even notices it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Derma-Logi derma roller.</li>
    <li> I have seen results with my VERY VISIBLE stretch marks. After i finish using it on my belly I apply vitamin E oil. The only thing i hate its the intense itchy feeling i feel on my belly after i use the roller. But thats the only way I know that its actually working.</li>
    <li> Naught this for pigments on my face, I used it once a week and followed it with vitamin C serum. 2 months later not only I didn&#x27;t see any improvement but also more pigments appeared on my forehead. I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received the Derma Roller about a month ago and have used it every 4-5 days. I ordered the .05 depth after reading the reviews, (which were a bit horrifying in some cases. The pictures posted were also not pretty). I am using the tool specifically on frown lines between my eyes. I do not use it to the point where I draw blood, as one person advised nor is it extremely painful. I have not seen any noticeable change, as of yet, in the depth of my frown lines but it has only been a month and reviews say 4-5 months before you will see a big difference so I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. I haven&amp;#34;t shared with anyone that I am using it and hope someday they will remark on the improvement. The quality of the tool is very good and really not that expensive compared to the other wrinkle treatments out there. I will update in a few months as to my final rating.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used one of these before, the idea behind it is that a slight irritation to the skin stimulates collagen, and therefore can reduce the look of skin imperfections like scars and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Before I write another word, I have to stress that it is indeed slightly invasive, so cleanliness has got to be a priority.&lt;br /&gt;Denture tablets? Yes! This roller has a removeable head, you can clean it with a fizzy denture tablet. One of the things I really like about this model, as well as the company, is that they seem to be as obsessed with cleanliness as I am. The box arrived shrink wrapped, as did the unit itself. It comes with a plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to use you lightly roll across the skin in every direction, the head swivels.Then apply your facial serum and cream. And yes, it does work, at least for me. Like everything similar, you need patience, it isn&#x27;t an instant fix. And it is not a dramatic difference. If it is painful, you are pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: A few people (ok, a grand total of 2) emailed to ask about denture tablets for non-traditional uses, so while not a direct part of this review, I&#x27;d like to share how handy those fizzy tabs can be.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to throw out useful things, and a dear friend passed, leaving behind a box full of Polident tabs. I started thinking, dentures are made of a material like porcelain, so I tossed a few in the toilet. So long as the loo isn&#x27;t overdue for a scrub, they work great! A quick Google shows lots of other ways, I now use them to clean my [[ASIN:B0006D34OK Emsa Eleganza Stainless Steel 34-Ounce Insulated Carafe]], which btw, I can&#x27;t recommend, please see my video review for safety precautions...jeez, there I go all off track again!&lt;br /&gt;Back to this roller! Remove the head, place in a cup, fill with water and drop in a denture tab. After it sits, place the roller back on the handle, rinse in very hot water, and shake all the excess water off. The heat will quickly dry any remaining moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps, if not, leave a comment!oisture.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps, if not, leave a comment!</li>
    <li> Having a few scars I am embarrassed about, I have long wondered about the effectiveness of micro needle roller devices. I’ve heard good things about them, and finally started using one a little over a week ago. I had worried it might be painful, but I found that the Derma Roller - Micro Needle Roller has not caused me any discomfort at all. I can feel little pricks when I roll it over scarred areas, but because you control the pressure when you roll it on your skin, you can also control how comfortable it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind these devices is that the tiny punctures stimulate collagen production, which helps to reduce blemishes such as scars. You should never use this on broken skin – only on healed skin that has a scar or other blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions for the Derma Roller advise to sterilize both your skin and the roller head with rubbing alcohol. Buy the solution with the highest percentage of alcohol that you can find – yes, you’ll find some bottles with a weaker alcohol than others. Given that the device is actually puncturing your skin slightly every time you roll it on, disinfecting both the skin and the roller is an extremely important step to prevent an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a little cap for the roller head, which is nice, but I actually keep it in the full length hard plastic case that it comes in, so as to keep it more sanitary. The cap has an open end, so I like the case better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine it will take some time for this to show results. I’ve used it a little more than a week, and I confess that I haven’t yet gotten into the habit of using it yet, so I missed a few days. I will report back after a month or so with a progress report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested in the Derma Roller but worried it will hurt, I can tell you that it has not caused me any pain so far. Only time will tell how effective it is, but with an affordable list price (currently $34.95 at list), I would have taken a chance on it even if I hadn’t received a unit for review. If I see improvement in the areas I have used it in, I’ll buy a spare one to keep in my toiletries bag for travel.ce on it even if I hadn’t received a unit for review. If I see improvement in the areas I have used it in, I’ll buy a spare one to keep in my toiletries bag for travel.</li>
    <li> I have unbelievably sensitive skin.  So I was very apprehensive in using this product.  I used it for about a month on and off and I think my skin does in fact look a bit smoother and one small scar is beginning to look like its fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the good news is that the product does really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that for people like me with very sensitive skin, it is VERY painful to use this product.  It&#x27;s only slightly uncomfortable when you&#x27;re doing the rolling part but afterwards, OH MY GOD.  It feels like my entire face is on fire.  Sometimes, its so uncomfortable that I can&#x27;t even sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, or if you&#x27;re one of those \\&quot;beauty is pain\\&quot; kind of people, I think this product does exactly as it claims and you will really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive skin, I doubt you can keep using it.  It&#x27;s too painful! I would really give this product 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
    <li> I took the advice of another reviewer and tested this on the back of my hand. I was anticipating a lot of pain, but it was tolerable. Not what I was expecting. My test hand is noticeably smoother.  I shall update this after I start using on my face.</li>
    <li> The Derma Roller feels great. I am a man and my skin maybe thicker. I feel no discomfort at all, except for the first two times maybe. I feel my skin is better. I would complement it with a good cream or similar product. Facial workout is also convenient.</li>
    <li> It looks weird at the first time. But, technically it works for me. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this but have always wanted to try it.  It was actually in my cart before I got the code to try it for free.  I must say, I love it.  I have only used it for a week and can already see a difference.  I have a deep scar on my cheek bone that has been bothering me for a long time.  When I roll over that spot, it&#x27;s super tender, so I am considering getting some lidocaine just for that area.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all on the other parts of my face and it doesn&#x27;t bleed.  I will update my review when I use it for more than I have so far.  I love the swivel head, it really helps the dermaroller move freely over all parts of my face.</li>
    <li> best to use a light touch with this product!  it works!  i use it several times a week.  i also have used fillers, and i think this helps to extend the time between filler touch ups.  i also use this on the back of my hands, and have noticed an improvement there as well. there are great videos (on youtube) showing how to use this.  once you get used to it, it takes a few minutes, several times a week for a very noticeable improvement .</li>
    <li> When I started using the derma roller, I notice my face is not drying anymore and very smooth. After using it, I put facial mask and night cream to relax more of my face.  I&#x27;m using the derma roller during the night before going to the bed.</li>
    <li> this product its really nice for the skin</li>
    <li> Definitely something you&#x27;d have to get used to but definitely worth it to try. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have terrible acne scars ever since childhood and did try several solutions along the years until decided to try this micro-needling therapy treatments and was actually surprise it works.&lt;br /&gt;Using the roller 2-3 times a week for a couple of months I could see results and my scars appearance have improved significantly. I used this with my high quality serum and cream because after the treatment the face is very irritated and this calm it down as well as absorbs better to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, easy to use and clean and most important – works for me!</li>
    <li> I have used this 4 times and feel a difference. Am going to continue use and very glad that I made this purchase... Just hoping to see great results but I am sure I will. It feels good...</li>
    <li> Awesome tool to healthy looking skin</li>
    <li> So far so good! I noticed subtle difference after 1 use! Haven&#x27;t had the product too long so unable to give more detailed review at this time but I have high hopes. Hopefully it will perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> Although I had a different brand dermaroller, I purchased this one because it looked alittle bigger and it was. This unit is much easier  to use, has it&#x27;s own cleaning cup. Was wrapped tight and sterile. The company informed me to brush the area your going to roll first and I was grateful for that information. I never knew that before. Getting tips from the company (seller) is tremendously helpful. I found that this unit did a much better job on my skin than others I have tried in the past. I look forward to faster results using Derma-Logi.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product and I appreciated the follow up after with directions on how to use product.</li>
    <li> Love my new Derma Roller! :-)  Definitely worth trying! I started seeing great results almost immediately and glad I took the advice of a friend and bought the derma roller!&lt;br /&gt;A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> When I was first offered the Derma-Logi derma roller for testing and evaluation, I had never heard of such a skin treatment.  When I investigated it and saw what it was, I admit that I was a bit afraid of it!  However, curiosity conquered fear.  When the derma roller arrived, I was relieved that it was the version with 0.5mm needles rather than the 1.0mm length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box has simple instructions, including to clean the roller and the skin with alcohol before use, and I think that this is good advice.  I would also advise washing and rinsing the face and hands thoroughly before applying the alcohol, and to give the alcohol time to evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is necessary to apply a great deal of pressure to puncture the skin and actually cause bleeding, but I don&#x27;t think that is necessary.  Moderate pressure, carefully applied in repeated sweeps of the area to be treated, will have the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, the skin stings a bit, like a mild sunburn, a very tolerable and maybe even a pleasant sensation.  It is obvious that the action of the 600 tiny needles on the derma roller&#x27;s rotating head has stimulated the inflammatory response, setting off the production of cytokines and a complicated biological defensive process against the irritation, including vasodilation and a concentration of specialized cells that protect and repair the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of the derma roller followed by application of an effective skin serum will increase the benefits of either treatment.  The ideal time to use it is at night after a shower or bath and before going to sleep, because the skin can then begin to repair itself overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The derma roller device itself is well-made, with a detachable and replaceable swivelling head and a comfortably-curved handle.  It comes with a clear plastic storage case.  Be sure to clean the head with alcohol after use, as well as before.</li>
    <li> Derma roller has been working very well for me, I have noticed a difference in my skin tone as well as it&#x27;s texture. Because I have scarring on my face I&#x27;m looking to upgrade to a 1.0 though instead of a .5</li>
    <li> I am 35 and starting to see the signs of aging and stress.  I have good bone structure but my skin has always left a little bit to be desired.  I ordered this on a whim because I really don&#x27;t want to start a whole invasive set of procedures that I have to maintain at a clinic for a ton of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not comfortable in a getting a bikini wax kind of way. I did it. Set it back in the nifty case and promptly forgot about it (as my whim purchases go). A few weeks after my purchase, I started getting compliments on my skin (that never happens! My skin isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s not something people are going to comment on either). I didn&#x27;t add anything to my routine as far as creams or change my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, this is a new tool that I love! It&#x27;s just what I needed to keep that drag of aging at bay!</li>
    <li> Love it so far, if you have never used one before it takes a little bit of time to get used to but once you use it. You will definitely want to use it more. It really helps afterwards with the absorbtion of vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to try this needle roller, but the concept makes sense: make a million tiny pinholes in your skin and then slather it with a high quality moisturizing product that can now penetrate the surface layers through the holes.  Regardless how good the concept is, the reality is that you have to roll a million pins across your face - not necessarily an easy thing to do to yourself.  After leaving this roller sitting on my bathroom counter for several weeks, I finally got up the courage to try it and I was surprised, it really didn&#x27;t hurt and it actually felt kind of good in a weird way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, applying hyaluronic acid after use.  Hyaluronic acid is a chemical that your skin produces in great quantity when you are young but that dries up as you age.  After using it for awhile, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in the softness of my skin.  With longer use it may have some noticeable effect, but I&#x27;ll have to update this if that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: you do have to be careful with this, if you get distracted while using it you can scratch your skin, so be careful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this Derma Roller for my wife and she was very hapy to own it. She use it at dayly basis with helauronic acid . The product quality is good. I think, that you can&#x27;t find same quality product for this price.</li>
    <li> I chose to buy this product because of the product description, reviews and the good price at $23.95 last February 13,2014. However, after using the product for 12 times, using it 2 - 3x/week, I noticed the needles were hurting my skin from the last rolling. I can tell the difference when I first use it; it used to be smoothly rolling. This time, it&#x27;s rugged and painful. For this reason, I wanted to reorder it but shocked of the seller&#x27;s new price for $70 today.  What the....!  You raised the price 3x in a month? To tell you honestly, the roller head is of inferior quality as it fell from its handle 3x on me.  I had to sterilize it each time, which is a hassle. And if you&#x27;re first timer, it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to connect it back to the handle.  The multiple fall made me an expert of snapping it back in seconds now. Nevertheless, it could have been easier if there was an instruction, otherwise you&#x27;re running the risk of pricking your fingers when putting the roller head and the handle together.  On the other hand, my face has never been brighter and tighter after several use.  If not for the last use, I would have been giving this review a 4-5 stars. To add to the pain, you&#x27;re current price is just outrageously high for a product that only cost a few nickels if I buy it straight from China.  Sorry, not a fun review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/07/2014: Thank you seller for sending me a new replacement for the damaged derma roller. Because of the seller&#x27;s quick response, I am able to continue rolling my skin, this time every 4-5 days until I see the most desired result.  So far, my skin is tighter, brighter, and my forehead lines, crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines are incredibly less noticeable now. After exfoliating and sterilizing the face, I apply organic hyaluronic acid (with Vit C and Aloe Vera gel) before(to penetrate best while rolling), and, of course, after rolling my skin. Then I follow it with Argan oil, sometimes with therapeutic-grade sweet almond oil. I use plant-derived moisturizer only the days after. The result is glowing, younger looking skin. People who know me give me a second look since I started rolling my face. Some couldn&#x27;t help not to be complimentary. (If they do and they&#x27;re nice, I smile and give them my secret.)  I am confident the days of haggard-looking skin is over. Thanks Derma Logi to this ancient derma rolling method. From 1 star to 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: My skin type is dry to normal, so using oil, such as Argan or Sweet Almond oil, on my face doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any breakout. It may irritate those with oily skin and larger pores.  However, with proper use this can be best to put in on any skin type.  Better yet, Google it.</li>
    <li> When I received the Derma Roller, it took me a month before I convinced myself it was ok to roll NEEDLES across my face. I opened the box &amp; noticed the roller was slanted. I used it anyway &amp; ended up hurting myself. As I later found out, the scratching was due to the bad roller. I took a picture of the roller and send an email to customer service. I immediately received a replacement roller in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I received the new roller, I&#x27;ve certainly noticed good results from the use of this product. I also use a serum in conjunction with rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect:  Well, they are needles folks! So, take caution and don&#x27;t overdue the rolling by applying too much pressure and rolling the same area twice. It may take some getting used to, but well worth it for me. I have to admit, the first few times I used the roller, I my have overdone it myself! What can I say? I&#x27;m the over achiever type. Needless to say, my face was a bit red and achy/itchy for about a day or two. So, a word of advice, DON&#x27;T use this product for the very first time when you have an important function to attend the next day! You may be overly anxious (like me) and want to see results right away, thus applying too much pressure onto the roller and causing the needles to go a bit deeper than you and your skin are ready for.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week along with a face oil and my skin is super soft. Even though it has a pivoting head it doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin as easy as i would like and I sometimes end up with barely noticeable scratches on my face.</li>
    <li> Really great product, I loved it so much that I bought all the ladies in my family one! I definitely saw a difference in my complextion when using it, and you will notice it quite quickly (within a month). After I used the roller I applied a hyaluronic acid serum with MSM, and vitamin C and followed that up with organic rose hip seed oil from mountainroseherbs.com. Great product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Really small and handy. Easy to use. Been rolling for six months now, once a month, and haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results but there&#x27;s been so much positive feedback on this, I&#x27;m still hopeful!</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good roller, it has a lot of needles which is good. The only criticism I have is that when it arrived there were a few needles that were bent at the tips. I bent them upright with a pair of tweezers and it worked fine after that.</li>
    <li> So far so good but haven&#x27;t used it like I should for best results.</li>
    <li> good product + great  customer service  as well</li>
    <li> First and foremost I want to say that this product will not change your scars overnight. I&#x27;ve dealt with acne scarring for most of my adult life and never thought there would be a way to heal my scars; at least not without laser surgery, which I have heard can be very dangerous and not to mention expensive. I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of remedies, from topical creams to pills, and nothing as seemed to work. The Derma Roller system is something that is based off of the natural healing processes of our amazing skin, but it takes time. I&#x27;ve been using the roller fairly regularly for about 2 months now and I&#x27;m seeing a bit of change. My family also has said they can see a difference in my scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From someone who has struggled with scarring for years, to finally find a natural solution is incredible. I will continue to use the Derma Roller because I know it will continue to activate my skins natural healing processes to rid (or lessen) my dreaded scarring.</li>
    <li> About a year ago my roommate who is an esthetician, tried to get me to try the derma roller. I was fearful of the needles and refused to try it. She moved away and recently came to visit me. I was shocked at how great her skin looked. She attributed it to the derma roller. I immediately bought one and use it twice weekly. I love how it has smoothed out my 61 year old skin and helped diminish my age spots.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 3 months. Now dark spot on my face is getting smaller and smaller. Happy with the roller:)</li>
    <li> Just getting started- as I understand it, I should start seeing results in a few months. Not painful, just a bit uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I have given 4 Stars , because of only a very small problem as it is that actually the needles are of 0.5 mm it should be at least 1 to 1.5 mm ,&lt;br /&gt;Ur derma roller has given awesome appearance on my face only a few marks are left only , hope I could buy the product with 1.5 mm needles&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise&lt;br /&gt;Must have products  Thanks Derma Roller</li>
    <li> this was free and I still give it one star</li>
    <li> Good roller, well made, nicely packaged!!! What more do you need!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived just as expected no problems, have only used once so far and seems to work as described will be using it again and will go back thru this seller to get replacement heads for it.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal - not a cheap knockoff...  works well on my stretch marks on my love handles...  would recommend for anyone who wants to clean up un-even skin texture.</li>
    <li> I have used derma rollers before but this one Derma-Logi is wonderful, I love the fact that the head swivels in all directions making it smoother to use. It&#x27;s a very good product, I have not used it for very long but do notice a difference in the smoothness of my skin and it helps to exfoliate and helps my products to penetrate into deeper levels of my skin, producing better results, I am looking forward on seeing the long term results from derm roller .</li>
    <li> Loving the feel and results so far. My skin tone is already starting to even out. The feeling is a bit strange at first but nothing that you can&#x27;t get used to! Love it and will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and after only a few days.. I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference! The only time I felt any &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; was on my upper lip, other than that... It actually was refreshing!!</li>
    <li> This should be against the law is all I&#x27;ll say!:I would&#x27;ve sent it back but lost it so now it&#x27;s too late. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works well for opening your pores and helping skin creams penetrate so they can lift,tuck, and firm (lol) but it was a tad uncomfortable. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought two derma-logis. One for my daughter and myself. Love love love the Derma-logi. Already see results. I can see the texture of are skin changing in two times of use. I have dry skin and fine lines at fifty eight i wanted to try the derma-logi and so glad i did. I was a little soar the next day but i used Neosporin and that helped alot . I do need to use a lighter touch.  😜  Thank you dermi-logi for this wonderful tool. My daughter loves her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terri And Kortnie</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s worked good for me, I&#x27;ll a bit later into the program.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several times already and have noticed a difference definitely in forehead lines and middle in between eyebrows wrinkles diminishing.  Its not s miracle but with repetitive use like you&#x27;re suppose to you will see a difference.  It&#x27;s not for the sensitive because it does hurt like heck but a numbing cream does help and you build up resistance to it after each use. If you&#x27;ve never needled it&#x27;s like a sunburn feeling for about 35-45 minutes afterwards and possibly having redness for a day or so. Use an excellent follow up cream for your skin afterwards;)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it compleatly but did do it on one of my arms just to see how it worked. It worked very good , first a little red spot for one day then it seamed to get nice and smooth it smooth out a lot of wrinkle. I like it and will use it all over my face a section at a time.</li>
    <li> Completely happy with the purchase.  The company has contacted me twice by e-mail with instructions.  I also see improvement in my skin.  I am targeting a large scar on my stomach and it is already starting to fade slightly.  I am also trying to tighten the area along my jawline and my face is soft and the skin feels tighter.</li>
    <li> After the first time I used this, my skin looked brighter and felt firmer. I&#x27;m not kidding! I use this every-other-day and use a Vitamin C serum after it. Sometimes, it makes your skin tingle a bit - it feels good!  Just don&#x27;t press too hard and you will love this.</li>
    <li> I have had the derma-roller for about 1 month.  I have noticed an improvement in my skin.  It is easy to use and clean.  I thought it was pretty cool that a rep from the company called to ask me if I have used it and if I like it.  I found the derma roller is not  painful. Maybe I just have a high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am new into Needling, this is my first derma roller. I decided to try this one based on the reviews. The needles look ok. and it is the perfect size for the face (0.5). Now, what I don&#x27;t like is the fact that this one since has a rotating head, switches directions while I am using it and I got a big scratch along my cheek. I now that it is a convenience the fact that it can be use in any direction, but I would suggest the manufacturer to work on this issue. I would like the head to stay on one direction unless I want to rotate it. What I do now is I hold the roller by the base and not by the end of the handle as I am supposed to do.  Customer service has been awesome; they contacted me before I received it to give me some information on how to take the proper care and how to get the most benefit out of it. Two weeks after delivery, I got another email, again to make sure I was pleased with it and to know if I had any questions about. Never never ( and I consider myself a Amazonholic) any seller had contacted me and offer that awesome customer service.That is a 6 out five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.03/08/2014&lt;br /&gt;I am using the roller once a week. I am updating just to let you know that I have noticed that the skin on my face absorbs my moisturizer and C serum better than ever. I am 34 and have some smile wrinkles and wrinkles in between my eyebrows. I try to focus more on those areas, but I guess is still too early to see any results on that yet.</li>
    <li> An aesthetician recommended a dermal roller so that my serum could penetrate my skin better, and this one is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face, neck, decollate, and the backs of my hands. It is doing a great job of minimizing brown spots. I&#x27;m in my sixties and take skin care very seriously now! The company that sells it provides a series of very helpful emails too.</li>
    <li> This works like a charm only of all instructions are followed to the letter. Be sure to follow all instructions skipping no step and be happy like I am with my results. It arrived undamaged and packed well. I got it so fast without paying for fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased the .05mm roller &amp; can&#x27;t say enough good things about what you get for your money. The package came with the roller &amp; case plus a small cup to use for soaking the roller head to disinfect it after you use it which is really convenient. I used it about 3-4x a week the first month but now only use it about 1-2x a week due to time constraints. It&#x27;s something you should use at bedtime since it will leave you looking like you got a sunburn but by morning my skin feels soft &amp; has a bit of a glow. The rotating head is ok, I can see how it makes it easier to go different directions on your skin but it sometimes ends up spinning around when I don&#x27;t want it to but that&#x27;s my only complaint. I&#x27;ve noticed a definite breakdown in the hyper-pigmented areas on my face which was my main concern. The best thing about this product though is the awesome customer service. Even before I received it I was getting emails on how to properly use the product for best results &amp; how to clean it correctly to keep things sanitary. Great company, great product.</li>
    <li> Umm so this thing is good but it does kind of hurt! Works well I guess but I was red after and it did hurt a bit although I used it pretty gently. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything, haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results but whatever I guess I&#x27;ll use it a while longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give it a four star review just because of the way it came packaged, it really didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to use it so I&#x27;ve  been reading how others  roll it on. I Don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s recommended to use it everyday! Time will tell if it works and yes it does hurt some!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount through a promotion and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I was skeptical at first but now I feel it really works!  It&#x27;s really comfortable and really easy to use.</li>
    <li> When I was offered a sample Derma Roller to test-drive on my person, I looked into it and decided that the potential benefits were too great to ignore but I was still fairly, well, scared.  Having watched some pretty gruesome videos, I let the thing sit in my bathroom for a few days while I deliberated.  And then one day my husband walked in, smelling strongly of pharmaceutical-grade alcohol, and told me the Derma Roller was brilliant.  Of course, being a guy, he had just grabbed it and started rolling, clueless as to procedure and precautions (well, not quite ... at least he had disinfected with alcohol).  And I, of course, being a woman, read him the manual twice and handed him a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using the Derma Roller for six weeks and are very happy with its carrying powers, meaning it makes everything you apply afterwards penetrate more.  To me that is its most useful role.  I have no intention of turning my face into a pulpy, bloody mess and I am convinced that it is not necessary to achieve good results.  I am careful to follow each skin-rolling session with an application of natural skin care products.  A good serum first, then watermelon oil, seaweed cream or aloe vera gel, the purer the better and, of course, avoiding any of the chemical-laden, top-name face products.  I don&#x27;t find the process painful but I did notice, on my second try, that rolling over my temples made me feel queasy, so I don&#x27;t roll there now.  The forehead is more sensitive than the rest of my face and I am careful to avoid the immediate circle around the eyes but, other than that, it is not sore.  I would never use numbing cream, the use of which has been linked to nerve damage.  After rolling, my face is slightly pink for a couple of hours but I never draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As compared to other rollers, the Derma-Logi roller has a much higher number of very fine needles and is a well-constructed tool with a curved handle that is easy to hold firmly.  I like the pivoting head and feel very much in control of the direction and pressure.  I have tried it on my legs but, for cellulite, I would need the 1.0 mm needle length head.  As for results, I have been using it once a week to give my skin time to adapt.  It is encouraging to see the money-back guarantee but I am not even close to the suggested ten uses.  I have noticed a general glow and tighter feel to my face, and some nasty age spots are starting to fade.  Given my cautious approach, I would expect to see more quantifiable results in another month, but I am very happy with the improvement so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Three months on from my original review, I really love my Derma Roller!  My skin has become visibly tighter, smoother and nasty pigmentation stains are really fading.  I use it every five days, following with the amazing serums and moisturizers I am testing.  I have refined my skin preparation:  alcohol on the roller but not on my face (too drying).  Instead I wash with a gel cleanser, rinse with warm water and pat dry with a disposable tissue.  I roll my skin thoroughly but not aggressively, resulting in visible \\&quot;pinkyness\\&quot; and tenderness which last for a day or so (comparable to a mild sunburn).  I really believe it lets my skin care products work 100% better.ry much in control of the direction and pressure.

    <li> I bought this product with the hopes of resurfacing my skin on my face and to help aid in diminishing my cellulite. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 week now and I&#x27;ve already seen a difference. My skin is so much smoother and softer. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far do good!  This company is great.  Consistently follows up with me to be sure everything is ok and provides ideas for optimal use.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use and does not hurt. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I lover the derma roller. After about 4 weeks of using it every other day I started to notice a significant difference in the texture of my skin. Fine wrinkles have greatly improved and hoping for the same on the deeper ones.</li>
    <li> I have used the derma rolls a couple of rimes and have to say it is a good product. My skin feels softer and smoother. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Be careful as it will draw blood</li>
    <li> I had no idea that irritating skin could cause it to renew, but, now that I’ve tried the DermaRoller, I’m a believer.  My skin is definitely clearer and smoother than before I started using this roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain?  There’s no pain.  There might be a slight discomfort using the roller with the 1.0 replacement head you can buy from Amazon.  But the 0.5 head included with this roller causes no pain whatsoever.  I do see reddening of the skin shortly after using the roller, but my skin is back to a normal color after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow use of the roller with a hyaluronic acid serum.  It cools the skin and works with the action of the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not particularly fond of the rotating head.  While it usually conforms to the contours of my face, it sometimes locks up in a wrong position.  I suspect I’d find it easier to use a fixed head so I’d expect to turn the device to fit a given area of my face.  However, this is a small inconvenience, not a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, try this device if you want to keep you skin looking healthy and glowing.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> Thank you! Fast delivery and the product is exactly as described.It&#x27;s nice that it can rotate and the head is replaceable.</li>
    <li> I have not used this everyday, so no miracles have occurred.  However, the improvement is noticeable enough that I am inspired to use this nightly once the discipline sets in.  There is a little pain, so begin gently and work up your pressure to what is appropriate for your pain level.  If you are exceedingly pain sensitive, you should try chemical peels first I&#x27;m thinking.  My dear husband recently installed a hd flatscreen on my makeup table.  I am loving doing facials, teeth care, and foot soaks while watching my favorite tv shows or movies.  Perhaps a similar regimen might get you started as well.</li>
    <li> Great product, perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a few times to get used to the swivel head.</li>
    <li> Great service, really works!</li>
    <li> I have used the roller a few times and it feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I tried a different derma roller before this one، it didn&#x27;t come with a small container to clean you roller in nor did it come with instructions on how to use it nor was it one that would move with the direction you were rolling in. I feel like the container is an essential just because it make the cleaning much easier. I used the 1mm one last time and I hated it. It was very difficult to use just because it hurt so much, I couldn&#x27;t actually penetrate the skin, or at least I felt like I couldn&#x27;t but with the 0.5mm needles I feel like the pain is a lot less, it works better on acne scars and that makes it much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I love the way my skin feels in the morning and these little bumps I have on my jaw line and neck are going away. I&#x27;ve bought one for my 21 year old son who is losing his hair from stress and my mother got one for herself too. It does poke a little, but I would say it&#x27;s more uncomfortable than painful.</li>
    <li> Got this for a Friend not so sure how it works but she seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I thought the derma roller was going to help me get rid of my acne scars but after my first try I don&#x27;t ever want to try this product ever again. I followed the instructions, it wasn&#x27;t painful maybe just a tiny bit. My face was red after my use, which is completely normal but it didn&#x27;t go away right away. My face was still very red the next day and it felt as if I had a really bad sun burn (when I tried washing my face, my face stung the moment I touched it and it hurt even more as I tried to dry my face) . Today is the second day after my used and my skin still feels rough, dry and it&#x27;s somewhat pealing! This was totally not expected! I have never experience anything like this!&lt;br /&gt;(I have sensitive skin by the way and I didn&#x27;t add anything to my face after I used the derma roller only before I used it.... Not sure if this is why it didn&#x27;t work for me but I sure wish I would have known this was going to happened before I decided to use this and destroy my face)</li>
    <li> Love this product. Thought it would hurt a lot but much to my surprise it Does not.  The only discomfort is when I put in the serums after rolling.  But I do have get sensitive skin. I do my rolling at night and my face is a little red but does not hurt. When I wake up my skin is clear and glowing. Beautiful. I have tried it under my eyes some noticeable difference in 2 applications. I am looking very forward to trying it on my scars:))</li>
    <li> I feel a Slow but steady improvement in my skin. My dark marks have just started to disappear. Since im using .5mm needle dermaroller, i didn&#x27;t feel much pain.</li>
    <li> Works great and helps loosen dead skin plus is great for massaging if used gently .</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2W9ZI2DNNRXS1]]I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Derma Roller would work, but it promised to help with scars, and I had a one year-old scar that needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before beginning, I took a photo.  Today, sixteen days later, I took another photo.  What has improved immensely is the center of the scar.  Whereas it was once paper thin with no elasticity, the elasticity is now returning.  The paper thin quality is visible in the photo, but to touch it is more dramatic and the change is unmistakable - not one of those subtle things where I think it could be my imagination.  The scar is also smoother to the touch.  There was a crater in the middle before that is less pronounced now.  That&#x27;s hard to show in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this hurt?  Not at all.  When I started, I could see track marks from the 1 mm needles and I felt a smidge of rawness, but I don&#x27;t feel it anymore.  I don&#x27;t feel it to the point that I even wonder if I&#x27;m pushing hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to use the Derma Roller with in combination with a beauty lotion, serum or mask to enhance the effect of the products.  I used hyaluronic acid, which is sometimes injected into scars.  I figured, it&#x27;s a natural choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I can still see the scar.  It&#x27;s quite visible, especially when the camera lens is not so close up, but it&#x27;s getting better slowly but surely.  Maybe it&#x27;s the hyaluronic acid.  Maybe it&#x27;s the Derma Roller.  Maybe it&#x27;s both.  Maybe in the past two weeks, my scar suddenly decided to improve.  Whatever it is, I&#x27;m going to stay the course.  Don&#x27;t change it if it ain&#x27;t broke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by BigyCom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/1/14: My scar is improving so much, I decided to take one last photo to compare. It is amazing. I cannot believe the difference. I&#x27;m so glad I took pictures. It&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s not just wishful thinking.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s really quite an amazing little tool.  It really does work, but you have to be careful not to go to deep- I didn&#x27;t know this because it didn&#x27;t come with a lot of directions.</li>
    <li> Works good, but leaves your face red for a while. Don&#x27;t go out anywhere for a while after using this</li>
    <li> i bought this a while back, never really got around to using it. I have scars left over from my acne, which im always trying to cover up. anyways, i started using the derma roller, on my first go i found it to be abit painful, but nothing that you cant endure, it got easier as i used it more and more and four weeks later im already starting to see the results, small acne scars are already fading and the needles dont bother me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;if theres anyone trying to make their mind up, id say go for it ! you&#x27;ve got nothing to loose !</li>
    <li> Very well made comparing to other ones I purchased in the past.  However, the needles seemed to be much smaller in length comparing to my others the same size.  Maybe that is why it hurt less.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product - well made with great design for storage and easy use over time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> love this product. have been using it since September. I already see result on my face. have been using the .5mm. will be ordering the 1mm roller soon.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it yet. So don&#x27;&#x27;t know how it works will update later. It looks like its well made. Don&#x27;t know if it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Great Product! I started using mine 2 weeks ago and love the results! I just ordered my mom the value pack for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I was excited to order this after reading about the benefits, then it arrived quickly and I was scared to use it so I waited about a week to finally try it out and WOW after 2 treatments I can see the difference and this has become part of my regimen! I love it</li>
    <li> My skin feels different in a good way, positive results with continue use.</li>
    <li> I tried my Derma roller last night. It was easy to use and didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I applied hyaluronic acid serum after. There was a tiny bit of sting. My skin gets red easily but it didnt with this. I will update after a few uses.</li>
    <li> This item really helped some of my acne disappear. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> One star, at best. This roller is wrong on many levels. The most critical flaws are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; are NOT needles!  They are BLADES!  If you take a good look at the very closeup of the roller head, you will easily see this.  The blades do not prick the skin; they slice it.  In dermatological terms, that is a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; (blades!) are not properly staggered.  You end up with unevenly sliced skin in strip/line pattern, as opposed to the grid-like punctures you need.  This pattern also makes or breaks it, when it comes to the ultimate goal of enhanced delivery for your serums, creams, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say, give this one a definite pass.  Unless you just want to spend a good money to make your own perforated toiled paper, or something...</li>
    <li> So far so good! I have only used twice, but do notice smoother and more even complexion. I have a low pain threshold and this size is tolerable. No pain, no gain with this device.  I use it only once a month. I follow with pure hyluronic acid, although next time I roll I plan to put it on before I roll. People say it gets into the pores better.</li>
    <li> Was delivered as promised and was exactly as it was described. Very haaaaaaaaaaapppppy ;-) Thank you. ;-)</li>
    <li> “This was bought for my girlfriend. Everything came as described and on time. I also received additional care information for use of the product. Very good product and after care / follow up service. ”</li>
    <li> It can cause horrible infections amd and scars.  Make sure you disinfect it And your face before use like your life depends on it.  I always disinfected it and still got 2 nasty very deep infections /pimples after use.&lt;br /&gt;Reason for 3 stars is because so far I see no effect from it aside from immediate on the,  when skin plumps up after the use,  but that is due to mini puncture wounds. I hope it eventually worka</li>
    <li> I have used it 3 times and it seems to work well so far. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it did me any good I began breaking out a lot. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Good quality derma roller. I picked this one because their facebook had a coupon code. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for three weeks...as for results, it&#x27;s going to take a long time...my research on derma rollers has suggested as long as a year. The first time I used it the pain was very tolerable. For some reason, with each use, it seems to hurt more. But again, tolerable. The worst pain is in the hours after you use it. If you workout or sweat then it burns the following day, as well. I follow up with sweet almond oil as a moisturizer since it&#x27;s 100% natural and that&#x27;s what you want. I got the 0.5 but I wish I had purchased the 1.0 because I have a couple of pits from deep acne and I&#x27;m not sure the 0.5 is penetrating that deep. I&#x27;ll probably purchase the 1.0 in the months to come.</li>
    <li> While I realize this .5 mm doesn&#x27;t help too much with acne scarring, any positive results seems to go away after a few days. I used this coupled with a serum and the results (swelling) seem instantaneous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I need to keep a steady routine for permanent results?</li>
    <li> Have been using this dermaroller for a few months now and really don&#x27;t see any changes. Will keep using it though.There isn&#x27;t much pain while using this, can definitely feel it penetrate a little but I have a high pain tolerance. Much cheaper doing this at home vs the doctor.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how easy it was to use this product! I&#x27;ve had botox and fillers in the past so I am use to having needles on my face, so I really didn&#x27;t feel any pain with this product! I have only used it one time so far on fine lines  around my mouth and jowl area and saw a difference the very next morning ! I was a little red especially in cheek area where I think I rolled a little to heavy and a little sore but the next morning everything looked tighter and smoother! I can&#x27;t wait to use it again! I think this is a very useful tool to have available for home use in addition to antiaging products!</li>
    <li> I have been using a derma roller for a couple of months and have seen great improvement in my skin. This unique design with the swivel head offers greater comfort and maneuverability while using the product. Also, the increased number of needles encourages more even distribution and causes fewer scratches (pokes) than the previous roller that I used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Derma Roller for about 2 months now. I use it twice or three times a week at night on my upper thighs to target cellulite. I have been using it with Vitamin E and I have been doing it consistently (never skipping a week). Although very easy to use  I have not really seen any difference on my skin. And I REALLY wanted to see some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller has a rotating head to make it more manageable and comes with a carrying case. In my opinion, it does not hurt that much - epilation is way worse. It left the area red, of course, but it was gone by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep trying it because a lot of reviewers have experience results. So, I am going to give it another month and report back here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have great customer service and are great about following up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7/24/2014 I have continued to use this and I have not noticed much difference, if any. I use Rose hip Seed Oil and I am attempting this for stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Yes it does work. My pores are smaller and my face is smoother in just few times of using it with moisturizer and serum. I strongly recommend this roller.</li>
    <li> I had to think a while before trying this product. It reminded me of an epilator because I thought it would be painful to use. No worries, though - compared to the epilator, this is a piece of cake and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I really thought the needle roller was going to hurt, but I was so surprised when it didn&#x27;t. It was like going before the firing squad and not getting shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a surprisingly great product. It&#x27;s packaged nicely and the Derma Roller comes in a nice plastic case. There is another piece that the head fits in so you can easily take it off for cleaning without poking your fingers. I do recommend cleaning this before each use-I use rubbing alcohol and it works great and it&#x27;s fast and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head on this roller allows you to derma roll in any direction and it&#x27;s recommended that you run it over your skin vertically, horizontally and diagonally to get the best results and this is easily done with the mechanics of the roller. It&#x27;s super simple to use. My skin is red after I use it and I don&#x27;t know how long it stays red because I use this at night and read and then go to sleep, but my skin isn&#x27;t irritated in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a high quality serum such as Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; A+Ctive, which contains Vitamin A and kelp - the derma roller helps get the nutrients into your skin. It sounds kinda gimmicky and maybe crazy, but it works! Top this off with a nice Aragon Oil for your skin, such as Jose Maran and you have a nice recipe for an anti-aging regimen that will work over time, and not too long of time at that. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> The roller is perfect for stimulating circulation. You don&#x27;t need to use any pressure, as the roller does the work. I chose the smallest needle size as I wanted something to give me a glow--and hopefully stimulate the collagen production in some areas where I had acne and have scarring. I am trying it out twice a week, as I think you need to give the skin some time to recover from the rolling. I apply a rich cream with hyaluronic acid afterwards--and only to this at night. I definitely feel the difference in my skin, and see that it has a &#x27;glow&#x27; the morning after using the roller. Definitely a great item to have at home (microneedling is expensive if done at the salon!) I also use it around the jawline, and that seems firmer as well.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone; even those who have problems with absorbing moistures and serums.  It does a great job of allowing those expensive products to be absorbed into the skin. Since I started using this I can see and feel a difference.</li>
    <li> Nice quality! I have used this twice so far and while I understand that it takes time to see real results, it does make my face feel revitalized. i use it at night-I wouldnt use it before going out as it makes my face look slightly sunburned-and follow it with a serum from Clinique. I don&#x27;t need any numbing cream and remember to pick the roller up before changing directions!</li>
    <li> takes some commitment but I&#x27;m staying positive that this routine will bring results.</li>
    <li> My Skin Looks Amazing! I use the Derma Roller 3X a week, and the difference is Visible. Brown spots-gone. Saggy Jowls- Gone. I can&#x27;t wait to see what 6 months looks like.</li>
    <li> This product is honestly amazing and it really works. I use mine with Jouer Essential Lip Enhancer and I can see the results. 5/5 stars, would definitely buy!!</li>
    <li> Not sure what this is, but it was like 10 cents.</li>
    <li> I am African american, and while there isn&#x27;t a lot of marketing towards this demographic, I did a lot of research on many different rollers. This was one of the better reviewed on Amazon, so I decided to give this brand a try. With consistent use every 10 days, I see great results with this product and bought several to give to friends as stocking stuffers.  Be sure you educate yourself on how to use this properly.&lt;br /&gt;I use this to fade acne scars and improve skin tone. After use, there is a sensation similar to being sunburned and subsequent peeling for 2 days max (the peeling is barely noticible).  Again, I get great results and am more comfortable with this method over a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> I used the derma roller every 5 days for the last last 3months,Idid not hurt at all and have noticed smaller pores and alot less skin imperfections.Love it!</li>
    <li> Immediate results just by one use!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to see results in the wrinkles but I use it every time I can feel a cystic pimple coming and it severely reduced how painful they are, the amount of time of healing and if you get it early on sometimes the pimple just goes away. I have bad acne scaring from years of picking at pimples and using this followed by the proactive dark spot pads has made a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m not saying its a miracle worker but I am saying its a good tool to have.</li>
    <li> Good quality and quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it once a week! It works and effective also cheap!</li>
    <li> I have used this 3 times now and I do feel like its starting to work.  It feels great while you are using this - but your skin does feel the effect afterwards - so dont overuse intially until you get used to the after feeling.  Great packaging, and good instructions. Hopefully i will look 10 years younger by next week ( ha, ha)</li>
    <li> Very good and easy to use, but can be a bit painful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use , very flexible .</li>
    <li> LOVE my Derma Roller! My skin is looking younger each time I use it. My skin is smoother and has a natural glow. I have only tried it on my face, but will try on other parts that need it. Thanks Derma Roller for helping a 60 year old feel younger!</li>
    <li> wonderful product, after 3 weeks skin was more firm and pores noticeably reduced</li>
    <li> Your skin just turns a bit red when your done with your treatment. Their is a bit of a pain at first but your skin gets used to it and their is small visable results after the first treatment</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll see a difference.  I was a skeptic (and still am - slightly).  I keep thinking the results are just in my head, but I have received quite a few compliments and turned heads asking me what I&#x27;m doing differently.  This is it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to make a significant difference, but I like it a lot so far and have hopes that I will see an improvement with continued use.</li>
    <li> This roller seems to be of higher quality than other cheaper models out there, and the extra $10 is well worth it. The needles are part of larger metal discs that are placed side by side and move independently from one another. Using rubbing alcohol to disinfect will not cause the loss of needles as with some rollers whose needles are glued on individually. All the needles are in perfect shape.The swivel head prevents uncomfortable snagging. Replacement heads will be available on Amazon in the near future (from the date of writing). I wrote Derma Logi on Facebook and they offered to add me to their e-list so that I&#x27;m notified when the heads are for sale. I recommend doing the same if you like this product.</li>
    <li> I use Derma roller for a week now and it seems to be working and my skip already looks better!  The only reason I am giving it 4 starts because I think that at least short  instructions on how to use should be in the box because they are too important to miss and some users will no go to the site to get this information</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this yet I was extremely impressed that several days before it arrived I received an email from the company with added info on it. Including tips and tricks as well as Dos and don&#x27;t s it was quite a surprise and I was very happy to know they at least cared enough to send this added info out (and before it came to make sure you can purchase the correct cleaner and so that from the start you don&#x27;t use it incorrectly ) I will add more upon use of this for about a month or so.  But I had to say how impressed with the company I am</li>
    <li> This Derma Roller Is Really Cool, It&#x27;s Medical Grade Strong steel I&#x27;ve Used it once With hyaluronic acid And Im already seeing results. The turning handle makes application very easy and the removal head it a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I just tried for the first time I feel some different I think it will make a great job</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this item but as soon as I do, I will return with a thorough update!</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time.  Pain is tolerable!  I hope it works!  A little tingling and redness.  Stay tuned....</li>
    <li> I have been reseaching &amp; reading up on these things since I 1st heard about them so I am sitting here with a tingly face &amp; hope, like many others have also shared, not gone a bit overboard the first time.  From what I&#x27;ve read, the .5 needle length is perfect for at home use &amp; to use every other day for 3 months to see some results.  Still unclear on the best type of roller, as far as the metal they are made with, also not sure of the exact product to use after the rolling, what&#x27;s best to clean the face before rolling, what&#x27;s best to clean the roller, etc.  There are a TON of different ideas out there, so I will just start trying different products to also form my own opinion.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if the lines are indeed less deep in 3 months.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and instructions are great,used it for 2 treatments with great tightening results,product penetration is amazing ,will order more rollers 👍</li>
    <li> The dermal roller is my new favorite beauty aid!  People are telling me how great my skin looks!  I also am using it on my neck and chest.  It definitely jump starts my skin and wakes it up!  I&#x27;m hoping it will also diminish my age spots with further use!  Very inexpensive way to look better!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time using this, but already starting to see improvements in my skin.  Company practices very good customer service, too.</li>
    <li> I find the roller extremely beneficial my skin is feeling softer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great customer service.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1WHRTAY7MHKC4]](Update: I find this a much easier roller to use than most of the other rollers because of the additional pivoting head.  The pivoting head helps a let when you are turning around curves on your face.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The derma-roller skin treatment for removing blemishes, scars, stretch marks, etc. is one of the latest advancements that are flooding the market for beauty products. This is a 0.5mm length needles that are good if you are a beginner like my wife.  It doesn&#x27;t go as deep and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much so she doesn&#x27;t need any numbing anesthetic.  After about ten days we start to notice the difference on her stretch marks on her thighs. She is doing it every week to allow some healing time. Derma-rollers are also used by men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses this in conjunction with Vitamin C serum.  Just don&#x27;t forget to disinfect the needles before and after each use.  You can use a small bottle spray filled with concentrated alcohol and then dry it with a hair dryer before using the rollers.  The only side-effects she got was a bit of itchiness for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good quality roller at a reasonable price.  The head rotates 360 degrees and is replaceable. Each of the disc rotates by itself.  You would need to do a lot of research though how to properly use it as the instruction is only limited on the roller&#x27;s specs and how to take care of it and not how to use it.  It also comes with a clear case to protect the needles from touching any surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I just received my Derma Roller and used it today for the first time.  I followed the directions by cleaning roller with alcohol and cleaning my face and using an iodine disinfectant on my face before using.  I used slight pressure and there was no pain at all.  Cleaning the roller afterwards and using an organic serum on my face afterwards.  I hope this works for me.  The nurse at the medical facility I go to recommended it to me.  I understand it could take up to 6 months to see a difference.  I am hoping it will help.  It was sealed in plastic wrap when I received it so I felt safe using it.</li>
    <li> It is a nice system.  The rotating head makes the rolling really easy.  I would recommend this product.  I will be trying the cream they recommend with it.  I will write the review once I start to use.</li>
    <li> I was a bit leery of this product but I bought it on an inner hunch that this would help me. I suffer from guttate psoriasis and or Lupus: both are difficult to Rx and both can mimiac each other but whatever I have, I have on my left cheek, nose and sometimes on my right cheek. It is moderated and chronic, and I was unable to find any product that could control it or help heal it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Derma Roller because of the quality. Each needle is secured, and that needle is then grouped into a separate wheel with all the wheels being able to move separately so that the roller rolls across the skin with ease and no sideways scratching as it moves the contour of your face or body. I bought the .5 needle to start as recommended,&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 weeks of using it 2 or 3 times a week, I was able to clear up my face. I still get new spots almost every day but by using this and then my coal tar gel the spots are gone within a day. If I get a sudden outbreak because I ate something that triggers my system to have an &amp;#34;attack&amp;#34;, all I do is Derma roll the area every day. Within an hour the spots are no longer red and have begun to heal by evening. I wake up every morning with almost perfect skin which I have not have in years.&lt;br /&gt;The Derma Roller changes your skin texture too. I&#x27;m closer to 60 than 50 and I roll my whole made not just my cheeks and nose. My face is tighter, and smoother and glows with an even color. I did not have many wrinkles but I did have the beginning of the marionette lines on both sides of my mouth and they have been reduced. It seems to me that the under skin is changing. It seems that it is rising up into places that time and sleep patterns have creased.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Derma Roller. When I&#x27;m in the shower and I wash my face, my face feels like it did when I was a child. So soft and smooth. I have also used it on a pimple that I had on my shoulder and that too was gone in days. I make sure that I keep it CLEAN. I always Derma roll after a shower, and I always use an alcohol based toner to remove any soap that could still be on my face after my shower. The I Derma roll my whole face and finish up with a light layer of coal tar gel. With this routine, the coal tar gel/grease absorbs into my skin almost immediately where as before it would just sit on my face and be all greasy. I have tried Vitamin C serums but they don&#x27;t seem to do anything and seem to spoil quickly. The Derma Roller was enough for me. It is uncomfortable the first time you use it but within 2 uses you become use to it and see that you, if used correctly, cannot hurt your face. The bridge of the nose is painful to do because of the thin skin and bone so I avoid this area but the ball or bulb of my nose and nostrils I roll without problem.&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the product is extremely low for the results you get. It really changed my life and my face is almost perfect. I use to hate the idea I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup to cover up when in public but the results were just not worth it. One day of makeup and I would have to battle for weeks to get back to where I was the day I felt I needed to cover up. NOW... I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup. The outbreaks are few and when they arrive, they are gone in a day.&lt;br /&gt;I had this same condition in my early teens and I thought it was just teenage completion problems. If I had this then, I truly believe it would have helped that too. Those gentle little pokes cause the skin to jump into healing mood... or so it seems to me. At this time, I see no need to go to the larger needle; the .5 works great.&lt;br /&gt;For about an hour after your rolling, your face will be red like sunburn but it fades. Our skin heals at night while we sleep or so I have been told. So evening or before bed is best. I have a shower after the evening news on TV and then chill out with the hubby. This schedule works great. If you skip a day you won&#x27;t notice, skip a week and you will. I stopped for a week just to see what would happen and within the 3rd day I was seeing my complexions returned to its ugly, old ways again. I don&#x27;t know how long the needle head lasts but I&#x27;m ordering a new one today so I have a spare on hand.&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I had sun sensitivity this spring and I do believe it is from using the Derma Roller. So get a hat and if you can wear sunscreen. Your skin is like new again and is very tender to the sun... in my opinion anyway. I have one dark (age) spot on my cheek about the size of a fingerprint and the Derma Roller has had no effect on that but DermaRest cream I use to use before I switched to coal tar, DermRest, if used every day, will fade age spots away almost completely but if you stop using the cream, the dark, dry skin will return within the week. So, NO, Derma Roller alone cannot do anything to combat dark spots from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;The handle fits my hand great and the rolling motion is smooth and easy to steer over my face in all directions.in the 3rd day I was seeing my complexions returned to its ugly, old ways again.

    <li> Loved the roller. There was no pain at all and it&#x27;s very simple to use. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this roller!  I used it for the first time and I&#x27;ve already seen a glow added to my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see results on my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, what it does and the quality of it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a client or friend.</li>
    <li> I have invested in 4 different rollers in the past two years. This is absolutely my favorite. I highly highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have not used this roller enough to notice any difference , Feedback from seller could not be any better ! They go the extra step to make sure you&#x27;re happy and using the product right !</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am a skincare aficionado and have tried almost every serum, cream, product and contraption known to man to keep my skin looking young EXCEPT plastic surgery, botox, fillers, etc.  When I first heard about &amp;#34;derma rolling,&amp;#34; I thought it seemed so archaic, especially when they are so many advanced technologies like lasers that can help the skin grow collagen.  However, I did a TON of research before buying this product and realized that micro-needling is pretty much the basic pre-cursor to lasering and seems to be almost as efficient at a fraction of the price.  What I like about THIS roller is the fact that it has interchangeable heads, and it moves to the contours of your face.  You can also switch back and forth between a .5mm, 1.0mm, 1.5mm head, etc.  Trust me, I watched all the videos, went to all the different websites that sell derma rollers, read all the reviews and decided on this one and have not been disappointed.  My skin feels great after using it, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Every good derma-rolling expert will tell you that there should be no blood when doing this and very little pain.  I have to say, this was so easy to use, I had no pain, and afterward, my skin just drank in my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Interchangeable heads&lt;br /&gt;Rotating head that adjusts to facial contours&lt;br /&gt;600 needles (some people feel this doesn&#x27;t matter, but I think it does)&lt;br /&gt;Great case and cleaning container&lt;br /&gt;VERY clear instructions on how to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;Money back guarantee&lt;br /&gt;Surgical grade stainless steel (I considered titanium but then read that it can flake off microscopically)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to try a micro-needle roller, this is the one!</li>
    <li> I have other derma-rollers, and this design is really superior.  I have scratched myself with the single handle/roller style roller.  This swivel head makes a tremendous difference, allowing much better control.  I believe in the benefits of derma rolling, and this design will make it even better.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a Derma Roller and I found this easy to use!  Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> Great quality and a must have in my beauty regime. I use with the Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> This thing works. And the seller was wonderful, as he/she sent a follow-up email to ensure I had no questions using this device. I love how it allowed me to get below the thick skin of my knuckles, knees and elbows. I know it is doing it&#x27;s job because the same anti-hyperpigmentation creams and serums that I use are now working almost immediately. The same products that did not budge my skin are now working like a charm, thanks to this tool. I would have been better off had I discovered this much sooner in life, but now that I am aware of its existence, I shall not ever part with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I have used it the past two days and it really makes a difference. I use it on my lips and it leaves them looking fuller and super smooth! Thank you!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Very good product, shipped with in two days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this derma roller for about three weeks now, and I&#x27;ve used it every night (except for 3 or 4). I roll it over my whole face [except my nose and eyelids obviously] in at least two directions (ex up and down and side to side). The roller moves almost like a Dyson ball, so it&#x27;s very easy to maneuver. I personally don&#x27;t think the pain is bad at all, but I have had laser hair removal in the past (which was much worse, pain-wise). I&#x27;m able to do my entire face with minimal discomfort. After I go over my face I just take off the roller attachment and put it in the little casing provided that is perfect to allow it to soak in rubbing alcohol. I apply restoring face cream and eye cream, and call it good. The whole process takes just a few minutes. My skin feels tingly and rejuvenated (similar to the feeling if you&#x27;ve ever worn any &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; products like plumping lip gloss). There is some redness of the skin after, which is normal. By the morning time all the redness is gone, my face feels fresh, and still feels rejuvenated. I haven&#x27;t noticed any major differences in the way my skin looks, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for three weeks. I have been complimented on my skin since I started using it though, so maybe it&#x27;s noticeable to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product. It makes my skin feel good, and I feel like the restoring facial creams I&#x27;m using are more effective. After I use it I do feel as if I just got a facial, and I am going to continue using it every night. I&#x27;ve only used it on my face but I think it would be effective on any skin. Also, the company is really great--they send emails every so often full of helpful tips on using the roller, as well as general information to help better your skin. I&#x27;ve been very impressed, and have actually learned a few new things about my skincare regimen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I recommend wearing a headband when you do this, as it can catch on your hair (it won&#x27;t pull your hair out or anything, but it&#x27;s annoying).</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle tool. There is no pain. The swivel head is great! I am starting with the .5 because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I will move up to a 1.0 next for my face. I purchased the .5 for hair growth, but I also tried it on my face.  No pain either way.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t see a lot of results during month of use.  Perhaps it takes a longer period of time to see effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far and I do think I&#x27;m seeing results already!  It is slightly painful to use, but worth it.  My process:  first I do a microdermabrasion scrub to get rid of all the dead skin on my face, then I use the roller according to instructions, and follow up with a few drops of the &amp;#34;Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum for Face 20% - With Vitamin E &amp; Hyaluronic Acid&amp;#34;.  My skin is so smooth and baby soft, just GLOWING for a few days after.  I&#x27;m only using this once a week.</li>
    <li> I have the .5 roller and have used it 5 times in the past 2 weeks; now trying to use every-other-day.  It definitely does what they claim and I can see my lines lessening--hooray!  The roller comes in a plastic case with a cleaning cap which is very useful.  Super easy to use!  The stinging doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, especially when I think about the results.  I follow with hyaluronic acid serum and coconut oil...in the morning my skin looks amazing!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the deems roller. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks and can definitely say that my skin is a lot smoother and discoloration is diminishing. I have pitted acne scars and bought to see if it will help with those and unfortunately purchased the .5mm instead of the 1. I will order a .5mm replacement head at the end of the month but I&#x27;m still really impressed of how the .5 is working. I use it every other day and I make sure I follow the directions accordingly. I do use this with Amara&#x27;s vitamin c serum which is why I believe the discoloration is leaving effectively due to absorption being 100% more potent and so I would recommend coupling it with some sort of natural or organic serum to target your problem areas. I will update when I get the 1 to see if my scars have healed but for this price, I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this derma roller. It is very easy and safe to use. I already received a lot of compliments from co workers because my skin is brighter and firmer. I use it once a week. At first my skin was a little dry because of the vitamin C I use after using derma roller, but using it moisturizer helps in exfoliating the skin.</li>
    <li> Just received and tried once, so far so good. I am excited to continue use and I am very hopeful it will yield anticipated results.  I will purchase again, different strengths as I move along with rhe progress.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about the process.  I believe it works. I have noticed some freckles/ age spots vanish. That amazed me. I do not press hard. I do not want to look like I have been scraped, nor have I. I do think using a serum afterwards enhances the benefits. I have been using for 3.5 weeks.  I had a girlfriend ask me why my skin looked so good and that stunned me. I will keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s tips are helpful!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it works. Also impossible to clean,so not very sanitary. Just asking for a skin infection.</li>
    <li> Great treatment for skin ! I can feel After a few after a treatment nerve ending tingling and it like life is coming into my skin ! Just after a few treatments my face is brighter,  and improvement in overall tone, the photo below is before ! Will be back in 2 months with an after !</li>
    <li> In some areas of the face cause irritation, I need to get more familiar with the rolling and find that perfect roll.</li>
    <li> This device is awesome.  I can really see a change in my skin.  The initial discomfort is a littel hard to get use to, but using this device with my Vitiam C and E, WOW, what a different.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly recommend product. It was recommended to me by a friend. I have been using it for a week and can see a difference in my skin already. So much so another friend has just brought the same roller!</li>
    <li> Just like many others, I am skeptic about this roller. I tried it last night, and decided to give a fair review. I have bought some excellent products thru amazon , from the reviews of any fellow &amp;#34;Amazoner&amp;#34;&#x27; Thought I should do the same. I have not been register thru the seller&#x27;s web site yet- I got the instructions thru one of the review below, thank her so much. So will be 100% honest to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, just a little back ground so you will decide if this is good for you too. I am a lucky one who has some lucky genes, always looks 10 year + younger than my age. ( I am in my mid fortie). Before my children I has time and $$ to go have my facial once to twice a month, but now, time and money goes to my children, but i have been very careful for my skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;Lately, my skin look aged and tired, my biggest concerns is the browns spot from hormones and sunning thru my youth years. So i decided to go for something new. I found the 180 Swiss hyaluronic serum, tried for 2 weeks&#x27;which works like a charm on the hydration, and retexture area, but I am not convince about the brown spots yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bumped into rollers accidentally, and after many search, I decided on this one.  When I receive this, I was like- holy- this thing looks scary, and painful. I was thinking maybe this is not a good idea, should just return this. After a week, and I was like , okay, what the heck, no pain no gain, just tried once and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this last night, and I am sitting here, having my mothers day breakfast, writing this review, with a &amp;#34; shinny face&amp;#34; - description from my 7 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be honest, this does have a little pain, and I also breed a little, in about  2-3?area like you have been pinched like a sharp needle. But the blood is very lightly, not at all like thedripping down your face horror movie type</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this little device, did a lot of research, then bought it.  I like it!  I have been using it for about 3 weeks - about every other 2-3 days.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt!  It does sting a little afterwards around sensitive areas like the upper area and neck - but nothing more than what a sunburn would feel like.  I can&#x27;t say I have seen a HUGE difference - but like the directions say, you will see a difference (small) after 10 uses - I have only used it about 7 times, and more dramatic changes after 6 months or so.  I definatley have seen a difference on some small laugh lines I have on my upper lip and sun damage on my chest.  I like it a lot and will keep using it!</li>
    <li> I found this product quite by accident, I&#x27;d never heard of it before but I like the claims it makes so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Some of the other reviews say that it hurts, I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case. There is a kind of warm burning sensation, kink of like a mild sunburn but nothing that hurts. I&#x27;ve only done it a few times so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s made a real difference yet but I find it to be very easy to use. I&#x27;m not sure that I like the fact that the head rotates but maybe I&#x27;ll get use to that feature. So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, I use it at night and by morning the redness is gone and my skin looks fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this specifically for my eyebrow lines.  I had deep frown lines and was about to try fillers until I stumbled upon some positive comments over the use of these derma rollers.  The comments were so enlightening that I saw this as an inexpensive means of removing wrinkles and gave it a try.  I started with the smallest needle first because overall I have good skin.  Plus, I was skeptical of how painful it would be.  I chose this derma roller company by luck.  And have been using their product more so on the area between my brows and I&#x27;m getting good results!!  I use it sometimes twice a week and I do see a smoother difference.  I&#x27;ve noticed it from the very start and I&#x27;d concur that the use of this product is remarkably helping in removing  frown lines.  I feel very positive that continued use or more frequent use will fix the problem entirely.  The redness goes away in two days so I&#x27;m good so far.</li>
    <li> It works (at least for me)! I took my time to learn how to use it. Now it is part of my 3-4 times per week routine. My face looks better hydrated, my serum/creams penetrate better.You can see results after few uses. Dermaroller claims that it stimulates the body’s own collagen production and I think it is true, my face looks more&amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;. I get sunburn sensation after procedure, it goes away in a few hours. Also my skin feels more sensitive to sweat during my exercise next day. I hope it will work on my aging spots also. Give it a try, much less expensive than fillers. Another plus: after my purchase Derma-logi e-mailed me easy to use instructions. Step by step guide can be printed from their website also.</li>
    <li> its the most amazing thing ever!! better than any skincare that exist</li>
    <li> Does feel strange at first, almost hurts, but it works. It helps skin, reduces fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing</li>
    <li> The same as a roller sold by a MLM company for hundreds. Wife was shocked to find it so cheap...</li>
    <li> Love the derma roller - comfortable to use with positive results!</li>
    <li> Shockingly, this cheap little thing really does work.  I&#x27;ve been playing with it on all sorts of areas.  I&#x27;ve noticed in just 3 uses that my scars are slightly better, and the little fine lines near my eyes &amp; above my upper lip have lessened.  In time I can see this really working some magic.  I originally bought this after seeing a youtube video where a woman was using it to plump up her lips. It really works for that as well, and the bigger lips lasted about a full 48 hours then went back down to normal for me.  I suspect they increased in size due to the irritation of the needles, but whatever, I&#x27;ll take it.  Hopefully it will work long term as well.  The only negative would be that after a few days the areas I rolled over got a bit itchy (except my lips, they were fine) and I couldn&#x27;t stop scratching which left me with some little scabs.  If I had some sort of anti-itch cream it would have fixed that, but I didn.t  I assume that&#x27;s just my skin healing itself, so it&#x27;s just a minor irritant.  You can plan on your skin being red for several hours afterwards if you roll lightly, and a few days if you use a bit more pressure.  That little cap they give you to soak the roller in works, but every $$$##%@@ time I use it, I spill it.  They need to come up with a better cup that doesn&#x27;t tip over so easily, but that&#x27;s just a minor issue.</li>
    <li> I am new to derma roller and so far I am loving my choice of this roller! It&#x27;s very well made, the container is nice, and I&#x27;ve used it three times and I look forward to the results! I love the glow I get using this and I use my own face cream made with mango butter, coconut oil, vitamin a,e, and a few drops of frankincense and my face soaks it up! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am using this roller along with another that is 1.5.  I am told that it will take months to see a major improvement on the lines.  I do see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months now and have been seeing real results.  I have deep frown lines and after using the Derma Roller the have lightened up.  They&#x27;re not as deep.  My skin overall looks better.  Fine lines around my eyes have filled in a little too.  Will definitely keep using this product</li>
    <li> Having struggled with acne for all of my adult life and attempting to deal with the scars left behind, I have found the Derma-Logi derma roller to be heavensent. It has helped me to fade discolorations, pigment scars, and the deeper, icepick-type scars on my face. The roller is easy to clean, maintain, and, most importantly, use. As other reviewers note, it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable to use, but the sensation is short-lived, and if you have had facial scars to deal with, you&#x27;ll know that a bit of discomfort is well worth genuine results. The redness, for me, goes away fairly quickly, which makes it less of a hassle/ obligation than I first imagined. I will be buying one to use on stretch marks, as well. Very glad I finally found what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised of how well it is made for the low price. It&#x27;s also nice that it comes with a case and a stand to sterilize it in. I&#x27;ve only used the Derma roller twice so far. It doesn&#x27;t hurt near as much as waxing! Very tolerable (at least the 0.5mm roller). My skin was slightly red for a day after using the derma roller (like a mild sunburn).  I just purchased some hydralaunic acid to use along with the dermaroller.  I will try to report again in a few weeks. I am hoping for some good results!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, friendly and informative emails. Love the way my skin feels when I&#x27;ve used the roller, feels like it&#x27;s tightening. Can&#x27;t see results yet as I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough but will write again once I do.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this tool some time before submitting an honest review. I feel that the derma roller is a great addition to your skin care routine. I have seen some changes in my skin health that were needed. At first it is somewhat stinging even though you don&#x27;t press down and just lightly roll. But after a few times it doesn&#x27;t sting as much and it feels good when you apply your choice of serum afterward. I use ilike brightening serum that I swear by.  I believe this little tool will continue to be an asset and I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Well, before I talk to you about this product I would like to tell you have never seen such great customer service. The manufacturer really cares that you get the best possible results and the safest treatment. They are extremely proactive with their advice on the best use of the product, how to care for it, and troubleshooting all manner of issues. I really appreciated having such thorough and caring customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use this at first because of the fear of pain or infection but with the right care (which they are very clear about) it&#x27;s easy. I have no other product to compare this too but it&#x27;s a clean well design that is easy to handle and manage. I would highly recommend this product based on the customer service alone!</li>
    <li> I woke up feeling beautiful.  My frown line was gone after 2 uses.  Fancy creams took a month to make that improvement.  I skipped a day and it didn&#x27;t look quite as good.  I use sesame oil wash before and afterwards.  I&#x27;m really happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Scared to use at first but started lightly. Seems to work good. I notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once yet and it seriously seems to be working on my skin. It could be a long-term treatment but the results are worth it...</li>
    <li> Instructions take forever to arrive in email. A little shady product. I question the safety of the item.</li>
    <li> I finally picked up some rubbing alcohol to disinfect the roller before and after using per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse using a Clarisonic brush, apply toner, and then then roll away. I don&#x27;t find it to be painful at all during the rolling process. I finish by applying a vitamin C serum. My skin just glows with this combination. It is a little stingy after, but not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to get rid of a few acne scars on my cheeks and they seem to already have a faded a bit. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now,  every other day on both my face (large pores) and stomach (stretch marks). On my face, I&#x27;m already noticing plumper lips and waking up each morning looking as though I had a facial.  Love that effect! Still too soon to notice results on my stomach (I will note that I&#x27;m using strivectin vs the usual serums) but keeping my fingers crossed for results within 30 days.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool, convenient carrying case, and very helpful tips provided by the company.</li>
    <li> I returned it.  I was hesitant to use it.</li>
    <li> This was the most interesting item I&#x27;ve bought for my face and lips.  I have noticed a difference.  The skinn after a couple of days from using is softer and smoother.  Also I&#x27;ve notice the creasing Is getting better On my lips. It is a little scary to use at first but it&#x27;s a piece of cake.  I got one for my son and I&#x27;ve noticed a fresher skin for a 17 acne prone boy it&#x27;s really awesome to see the skin he used to have as a child.</li>
    <li> I am only on my second week of using my derma roller, but my skin definitely looks healthier. I can&#x27;t say at this point that the wrinkles/sun damage/acne scars have gone away, but I am confident with all the reviews that I am headed in the right direction. I am in my 40&#x27;s and used to be in the sun all summer usually without any suntan lotion. I can see the effects of this on my face, neck and especially my chest. These are sensitive areas and I am very red after, but my skin looks smoother immediately after. Also, I had numerous questions about the product and a customer service rep (Maria) answered all my questions (with lots of detail) within 24 hours. Great customer service and great product. I will continue to use my roller 3-4 times a week and looks forward to even more great results.</li>
    <li> I really love this thing! I was kind of scared to use it at first but once I started I couldn&#x27;t stop! My face feels lovely and and I&#x27;m noticing a big difference in the quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> I love my Derma roller! I had some old acne scars on my temple and the roller cleared it right up! I have already bought one for my mom (who is worried about some fine lines) ...just try it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I received it almost a week ago &amp; I already see a difference in the brightness of my skin. My acne spots are starting to fade away. The most perfect addition to my skin care regimen</li>
    <li> This was my 1st derma roller purchase....I was very pleased that there was no real pain....just a ticklish scratchy feeling. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any crazy amazing results, but I did notice using the .5mm head that my face seeemed brighter &amp; tighter...just 1 use.  The only negative that I have was ths t with the 360 swivel I thought that it would turn too easy &amp; would scratch me...but I just held it @ the head to prevent it &amp; loved it.  I would change the swivel as I didn&#x27;t see any real benefit of it. I am excited to see more results ss I continue to use on my face &amp; body.</li>
    <li> IN EXPENSIVE - FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> notice some improvement as long as I keep using it</li>
    <li> This kind of seems extreme. Derma rolling feels like an annoying little stinging feeling to the skin. So I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s painless. I&#x27;ve seen the biggest difference on my lips after two weeks of using twice a week. I use at night and the morning after I have a more healthier look to my skin.</li>
    <li> definitely made my skin smoother and more revitalized</li>
    <li> This has been my skin saver!  Seriouly it works!</li>
    <li> This derma rolling is very new technology to a lot of people but its the best way to stay very young and beautiful on your own without doing nonsence surgery but it doesn&#x27;t happen over nite just like a lot of other things we do it takes time and patience but at the end believe me you will be so happy you stuck with it , its very simple and easy to do it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time and at the end WOW beautiful skin and it changes the way you think about yourself so I actually think women should have at least three n medicine cabnet its the new goto thing that&#x27;s happening and I swear just stick to very well written instrutions and there ya go... thank you and get it while its HOT!!!!</li>
    <li> So far I am liking my dermaroller.  It has been one month and I do see improvement.  :)</li>
    <li> early days yet, but skin certainly feels softer and firmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
    <li> I would really recommend this roller. I was skeptical about this product actually erasing wrinkles but it does work. I use it for about a minute or two. Then follow up by using a moisturizer. If you follow the directions you should get results in no time.</li>
    <li> it peeled of my skin. than it turn my breast black horrible.</li>
</ol>
