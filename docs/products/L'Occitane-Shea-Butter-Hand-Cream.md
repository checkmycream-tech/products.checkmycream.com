      <li>/&gt;He encouraged my family to try it and it has been wonderful.</li>
      <li>This hand creme is the best!</li>
      <li>Try the foot cream, it&#x27;s wonderful as well.</li>
      <li>This one is the best.</li>
      <li>The hand cream is the highest of quality, and it moisturizes my skin wonderfully.</li>
      <li>This is L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s best product.   </li>
      <li>Along with the 100% shea butter product these are the best products around.  </li>
      <li>This product has no scent and is very good.  </li>
      <li>, everything works AMAZINGLY!     </li>
      <li>I agreed and was impressed right away.</li>
      <li>It works on the most driest skin in the world!</li>
      <li>First of all the scent is positively delicious.  </li>
      <li>but this is an amazing product...</li>
      <li>Ahava may be a good luxury alternative for people who don&#x27;t care for the fragrance of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s shea butter hand cream (although I happen to LOVE it.)  </li>
      <li>There is no greasy feel and it smells nice too.</li>
      <li>Fragrance pleasant and not too strong.  </li>
      <li>The smell is light and pleasant, not overpowering and flowery.</li>
      <li>I also love the scent not overpowering but still nice.  </li>
      <li>Despite the high price tag, it is a very good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just use more of them more often.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
      <li>I expect more from a place that sells gifts.</li>
      <li>I love this hand cream...</li>
      <li>I love using this hand cream at bedtime as it has a nice mild scent and has become part of my routine in the evenings.  </li>
      <li>super-creamy balm penetrates my hands quickly and is a extremely effective moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes super effectively.  </li>
      <li>I just love to apply and reapply ...leaves my skin smooth and beutiful.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent, and goes on smooth and light as compared to pure shea butter, which can feel somewhat greasy.</li>
      <li>This is the best, richest hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used hands down.  </li>
      <li>I find it to be the best lotion out there hands down, and I have tried everything.</li>
      <li>handcream softens my psoriatic skin and makes it comfortable once again.</li>
      <li>Also, if you crave more of the feeling, try the straight shea butter.</li>
      <li>A week later,  everyone was commenting on the good condition my skin was in.</li>
      <li>But as far as lotions go, it works, smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>and I wake up with super silky skin.  </li>
      <li>I bought several tubes of the hand cream for Christmas presents and one for myself,everyone I gave it to is very pleased with the cream,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this hand cream for a long time and finally decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is super-moisturizing, absorbs into the skin quickly and smells really yummy.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, drugstore lotions such as Vasoline or Jergins are better than this.  </li>
      <li>, it only gets 4 stars because it does not have sunscreen and thus isn&#x27;t appropriate for day use.</li>
      <li>I wash my hands many times throughout the day and this is the ONLY handcream that prevents my nails from splitting and keeps my hands looking moisturized.  </li>
      <li>And at $23 per 5.2-oz tube, I consider it vastly overpriced (if it were more reasonably priced, I would have given it 4 stars).</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t have the same kind of moisturizing effect as pure shea butter; people with extremely dry skin might not find it effective enough.</li>
      <li>If this is too expensive, then alternatives worth trying: Eucerin Calming Cream (which I think is also fragrance free and comes in a nice, large tube) is pretty rich, and Neutrogena Norwegian Formula (also greasier but available in fragrance free version) or Norwegian Formula</li>
      <li>FAST ABSORBING Hand Cream also work pretty well.</li>
      <li>There are certain products that I use, that I wouldn&#x27;t change for the world.  </li>
      <li>I really thought I would like this product</li>
      <li>It is thick, but goes on smooth and has a real fresh scent.</li>
      <li>The cream absorbs into the skin quickly, but still provides lasting protection.</li>
      <li>I just wished the price wasn t as high...</li>
      <li>I will always use this product and highly recommend this line to everyone.</li>
      <li>good fragrance and a little goes a long way,will buy again.</li>
      <li>After drugstore brands left my hands feeling oily but ultimately un-moisturized, I followed the suggestion of several magazines at the time and invested in a tube of this amazing hand cream.  </li>
      <li>L&#x27;Occitane also did not qualify for the free shipping regardless of the dollar amount I spent and shipping locals.</li>
      <li>While slightly greasy-feeling at first application, it soaks in within 5 minutes to leave your hands feeling soft and comfortably hydrated/protected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shea butter sold by L&#x27;Occitaine is processed refined shea butter which has lost most of its healing vitamins, minerals and properties associated with authentic cold pressed, unrefined shea butter.</li>
      <li>(its very soft though)  </li>
      <li>one thing I would suggest though, go to a local store and try l&#x27;occitaine first</li>
      <li>Outstanding for dry or very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cream 3 times a day for a week, and my hands are as soft as my 2-year-old daughter&#x27;s hands.</li>
      <li>This cream is the one that fixed my skin.   </li>
      <li>I also love the subtle, natural scents of their products.</li>
      <li>My hands get super dry in the winter and this is the only thing that works for me.  </li>
      <li>My dry hands are smooth and soft after only one application several hours ago.</li>
      <li>Recently I purchased a shea butter lotion that is all natural, fragrant, and thoroughly conditions my skin</li>
      <li>My single large tin is going on its third year, and I use it almost every day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for people with very dry hands.  </li>
      <li>But, on a recent trip to a big city (I live in a rural area), I walked into a L&#x27;Occitane store in a mall and the clerk asked if I wanted to try the hand cream.</li>

<li> My single large tin is going on its third year, and I use it almost every day.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product for people with very dry hands.  </li>
<li> But, on a recent trip to a big city (I live in a rural area), I walked into a L&#x27;Occitane store in a mall and the clerk asked if I wanted to try the hand cream.</li>
<li> I usually use pure shea butter on my skin, so this cream was a definite departure for me.</li>
<li> /&gt;While the price is high - currently $9/tube for 1oz, $25 for the 5oz - a little of this lotion goes a very long way.  </li>
<li> I use it on my legs when they are really dry, especially during the summer.</li>
<li> If you have dry, cracked, irritated skin, this handcream and a pair of white cotton gloves will work miracles overnight.</li>
<li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy layer behind.  </li>
<li> cause it goes a long way.  </li>
<li> So, it takes a long time to use it up.</li>
<li> /&gt;Sadly, it isn&#x27;t any better than several other less expensive lotions that I have tried.</li>
<li> I also use it when my legs get really dry in the winter.</li>
<li> Now I use the Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunblock by day.</li>
<li> felt a little guilty at first spending $21 on a tube of hand cream, but I know I&#x27;ll use every last drop and the tube will last a long time.</li>
<li> My hands were very dry, chapped, and my cuticles were tearing.  </li>
<li> You only need a little bit of this</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> Although I do plan to purchase other products from this company.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena Norwegian formula, Vaseline Intensive Care, Jergens, Curel, Lubriderm, Eucerin, Aveeno and other common brands, but none of them quite did the trick as well.   </li>
<li> I typically use a pea-sized amount each time I use it, which is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Granted, they are expensive, but I never get the same pleasure or results from using my $3 bottle of ultra-moisturizing store brand lotion.</li>
<li> Not sure, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
<li> I usually use this at night before I go to sleep</li>
<li> The only other hand cream that worked about as well was Ahava  (also a gift and also very expensive).  </li>
<li> Very Poor Service - paid cash for this and several products from L&#x27;Occitane</li>
<li> I wash my hands numerous times per hour -- not per day but each hour -- and use Purel hand sanitizer, and my skin had gotten sandpapery rough and cracked (1/8-inch to 1/4-inch painful fissures).</li>
<li> The prices charged by L&#x27;Occitaine for a poor product is beyond belief.</li>
<li> I purchased L&#x27;Occitane with average expectations and was immediately disappointed.  </li>
<li> Before using l&#x27;occitaine, I was just miserable with my dry skin.   </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shea butter sold by L&#x27;Occitaine is processed refined shea butter which has lost most of its healing vitamins, minerals and properties associated with authentic cold pressed, unrefined shea butter. The prices charged by L&#x27;Occitaine for a poor product is beyond belief.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream...I just love to apply and reapply ...leaves my skin smooth and beutiful. I also love the scent not overpowering but still nice.  I just wished the price wasn t as high...</li>
    <li> It seems as though I&#x27;ve tried every hand cream out there. This one is the best. It isn&#x27;t greasy - rather, it&#x27;s softening. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses that won&#x27;t quit - rather is smells like a field of spring blossoms that disappear in a heartbeat.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This handcream softens my psoriatic skin and makes it comfortable once again. Its moisturizing properties last from day to day and provide a degree of elasticity that I haven&#x27;t known for years. If you have dry, cracked, irritated skin, this handcream and a pair of white cotton gloves will work miracles overnight. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love using this hand cream at bedtime as it has a nice mild scent and has become part of my routine in the evenings.  This is L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s best product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, it only gets 4 stars because it does not have sunscreen and thus isn&#x27;t appropriate for day use. Those \\&quot;liver spots\\&quot; on the backs of my hands were caused by sun exposure, according to my dermatologist.  Now I use the Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunblock by day.</li>
    <li> There are certain products that I use, that I wouldn&#x27;t change for the world.  This is one of them.  It is super-moisturizing, absorbs into the skin quickly and smells really yummy.  Try the foot cream, it&#x27;s wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> This hand creme is the best! It works on the most driest skin in the world! I use it on my legs when they are really dry, especially during the summer. It is thick, but goes on smooth and has a real fresh scent. A little bit goes a long way. So, it takes a long time to use it up. This product is well worth the money. I find it to be the best lotion out there hands down, and I have tried everything.</li>
    <li> I bought several tubes of the hand cream for Christmas presents and one for myself,everyone I gave it to is very pleased with the cream,good fragrance and a little goes a long way,will buy again. Patti</li>
    <li> super-creamy balm penetrates my hands quickly and is a extremely effective moisturizer.  I handle paper all day which dries my hands out and I just use a dab of this hand cream and go back to working with paper.  No grease marks. yeah.</li>
    <li> I really thought I would like this product but I found it to leave my hands with a sticky feeling after applying it. It felt sort of like a waxy coating just setting on my hands. Wax, in all actuality is probably what it was. Could have been too much of the fatty alcohols or possibly the emulsifier?? Not sure, but I won&#x27;t buy again. Although I do plan to purchase other products from this company.</li>
    <li> I was given this hand cream as a gift. I usually use pure shea butter on my skin, so this cream was a definite departure for me. It has a pleasant scent, and goes on smooth and light as compared to pure shea butter, which can feel somewhat greasy. However, it doesn&#x27;t have the same kind of moisturizing effect as pure shea butter; people with extremely dry skin might not find it effective enough. And at $23 per 5.2-oz tube, I consider it vastly overpriced (if it were more reasonably priced, I would have given it 4 stars). While I appreciate having received this as a gift, bottom line is I won&#x27;t be buying it for myself when my gift tube runs out.</li>
    <li> Now, where did my tube go? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I received a set of L&#x27;Occitane products for a gift, and now I am hooked! The hand cream is the highest of quality, and it moisturizes my skin wonderfully. I also love the subtle, natural scents of their products. Granted, they are expensive, but I never get the same pleasure or results from using my $3 bottle of ultra-moisturizing store brand lotion. Also, if you crave more of the feeling, try the straight shea butter. My single large tin is going on its third year, and I use it almost every day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;...I just wish I hadn&#x27;t lost my last tube...</li>
    <li> This product has no scent and is very good.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy layer behind.  My hands get super dry in the winter and this is the only thing that works for me.  Along with the 100% shea butter product these are the best products around.  The 100% shea is stronger and I use it for my cuticles.  This cream 24 hour and I re-apply at night.  I also use it when my legs get really dry in the winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this hand cream for a long time and finally decided to give it a try. I can&#x27;t believe it. My dry hands are smooth and soft after only one application several hours ago. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> This is the best, richest hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used hands down.  First of all the scent is positively delicious.  You only need a little bit of this cause it goes a long way.  My hands were very dry, chapped, and my cuticles were tearing.  This takes care of all those problems.  You have to wait a minute for the cream to sink in. I usually use this at night before I go to sleep and I wake up with super silky skin.  I highly recommend this product for people with very dry hands.  I will always use this product and highly recommend this line to everyone. It&#x27;s addicting.</li>
    <li> After drugstore brands left my hands feeling oily but ultimately un-moisturized, I followed the suggestion of several magazines at the time and invested in a tube of this amazing hand cream.  I was hooked the instant it soaked in, and I don&#x27;t expect to ever turn back.  While slightly greasy-feeling at first application, it soaks in within 5 minutes to leave your hands feeling soft and comfortably hydrated/protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price is high - currently $9/tube for 1oz, $25 for the 5oz - a little of this lotion goes a very long way.  I typically use a pea-sized amount each time I use it, which is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using this in conjunction with the Shea Butter Nail and Cuticle cream, as well.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands numerous times per hour -- not per day but each hour -- and use Purel hand sanitizer, and my skin had gotten sandpapery rough and cracked (1/8-inch to 1/4-inch painful fissures). This cream is the one that fixed my skin.   I am a big fan of a bargain and I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena Norwegian formula, Vaseline Intensive Care, Jergens, Curel, Lubriderm, Eucerin, Aveeno and other common brands, but none of them quite did the trick as well.   Pros of the L&#x27;Occitane cream:   1. Moisturizes super effectively.  2. Absorbs well without lots of greasiness.  3. Fragrance pleasant and not too strong.  Cons:  1. Price, price price!  2. Lack of UV protection.  3. Fragrance -- if you don&#x27;t like it.    The only other hand cream that worked about as well was Ahava  (also a gift and also very expensive).  Ahava may be a good luxury alternative for people who don&#x27;t care for the fragrance of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s shea butter hand cream (although I happen to LOVE it.)  If this is too expensive, then alternatives worth trying: Eucerin Calming Cream (which I think is also fragrance free and comes in a nice, large tube) is pretty rich, and Neutrogena Norwegian Formula (also greasier but available in fragrance free version) or Norwegian Formula FAST ABSORBING Hand Cream also work pretty well. Just use more of them more often.</li>
    <li> I have to say, you will REGRET if you don&#x27;t buy this! Before using l&#x27;occitaine, I was just miserable with my dry skin.   I  used a lot of brands, Lancome, Shiseido, Estee Lauder. None of them worked for me. Until I found l&#x27;occitaine in Sephora, everthing changed for my skin. I bought the face cream and tried it. I washed my face and applied some cream. A week later,  everyone was commenting on the good condition my skin was in. L&#x27;occitaine is like my savior.   And now I use the hand cream, body lotion, everything works AMAZINGLY!     one thing I would suggest though, go to a local store and try l&#x27;occitaine first, I know some people dont like the smell of it (its very soft though)  but this is an amazing product...</li>
    <li> Very Poor Service - paid cash for this and several products from L&#x27;Occitane - my wife tried to return unopened items the next day and was refused because I had paid cash.  Customer service was a disaster.  I expect more from a place that sells gifts.</li>
    <li> He loves this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He encouraged my family to try it and it has been wonderful. Despite the high price tag, it is a very good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it isn&#x27;t any better than several other less expensive lotions that I have tried. If you are looking to save money, obviously this one isn&#x27;t for you. It isn&#x27;t magic. It won&#x27;t change your life. But as far as lotions go, it works, smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous hand creams - Avon, Eucerin, Neutrogena, Cetaphil. But, on a recent trip to a big city (I live in a rural area), I walked into a L&#x27;Occitane store in a mall and the clerk asked if I wanted to try the hand cream. I agreed and was impressed right away. The smell is light and pleasant, not overpowering and flowery. The cream absorbs into the skin quickly, but still provides lasting protection. I&#x27;ve been using the cream 3 times a day for a week, and my hands are as soft as my 2-year-old daughter&#x27;s hands. I can&#x27;t believe the change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I felt a little guilty at first spending $21 on a tube of hand cream, but I know I&#x27;ll use every last drop and the tube will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Outstanding for dry or very dry skin.  I wash my hands many times throughout the day and this is the ONLY handcream that prevents my nails from splitting and keeps my hands looking moisturized.  There is no greasy feel and it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I purchased L&#x27;Occitane with average expectations and was immediately disappointed.  L&#x27;Occitane is exorbitant especially when you receive the shipment and actually see the amount you are receiving.  In my opinion, drugstore lotions such as Vasoline or Jergins are better than this.  However, shea butter is the ultimate in skin pampering.  Recently I purchased a shea butter lotion that is all natural, fragrant, and thoroughly conditions my skin and I purchased it at at 1/3 the cost of the L&#x27;Occitane.  L&#x27;Occitane also did not qualify for the free shipping regardless of the dollar amount I spent and shipping locals.</li>
