<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good price but the product loses the smell after 5 hours</li>
    <li> I Love I Love is my signature scent. I&#x27;ve tried many other samples of all types of perfumes over the years, but this is the only scent that I feel reflects my personality. It&#x27;s light, airy, and effervescent. The first and heaviest note is grapefruit, which is my favorite smell in the world, and when I walk through a cloud of this perfume, it just makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it year round, though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s supposed to be a summer scent, but I like to smell like the summer even in our bitter cold Pittsburgh winters. It makes me happy, and if my husband goes to bed without me, he can smell it on our sheets and pillows, and he says it reminds him of me. I love having a scent that he can associate with me all the time--it feels personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a ton of fragrance for a very inexpensive price (especially compared to designer scents that cost $60 for 1.5 oz)--this 3.4 oz bottle lasts me for months of almost daily application, and the bottle itself is probably 6&amp;#34; tall. You can&#x27;t really find this stuff in most stores, so I make sure to take advantage of Amazon&#x27;s great deals.</li>
    <li> I love it! the scent lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Smells really good, reminds me alot of Dolce and Gabana Light Blue!</li>
    <li> I am so sad that they discontinued this fragrace.  It is amazing.  I had been searching for a long time for a citris perfume that wasn&#x27;t a cheap scent from Victoria Secret or Bath and Body Works.  I like D&amp;G Light Blue, but this has a more grapefruit scent.  The price is also amazing.  I will probably stock up on these before they are all gone forever!</li>
    <li> I love this smell so much. It is a light and fruity fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love perfumes, body sprays, and fragrances but only recently started buying perfumes. I bought a sample vial of I Love Love and immediately fell in love with it! So right away I bought a large bottle, which Amazon has an amazing price for! At the time, I&#x27;d never smelled anything quite like it. Recently, someone asked me if I was wearing Light Blue by D&amp;G, so I went and smelled that perfume. They smell very similar, but I Love Love has a more fruity/citrus-y scent that I enjoy more. My favorite is how FRESH it smells after it&#x27;s aired out...like an hour later. I spray my bedsheets too so that I&#x27;d smell it while sleep! I LOVE I Love Love by Moschino! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product.If you wear it one day, you&#x27;ll smell it on your clothes for other 2 days.  Fast shipping. Everything you can expect.</li>
    <li> Hellooo..i sooo in love of this smell. I have a lot of perfum, between then versace gucci and i have to admit that this is my prefered! my boyfriend says that is not too strong, but is a good smell. Something citric but not too strong.! and the price is perfect. Thank you so much amazon for giving me the oportunity to have this eau the toilette.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,</li>
    <li> Love this perfume very light  smell and last all day long ..... I had allergy with a strong perfume but this I LOVE LOVE by moschino was very mild and I can spray it every day....... [[ASIN:B0042SNPI0 I Love Love by Moschino Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz]]</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is my favorite and my signature scent. I always get questions from people about what I am wearing. It is like D&amp;G Light Blue, but I think this has a stronger citrus-y scent, which I love. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fresh, citrus scents. Or to anyone who likes Light Blue, but is working on a smaller budget.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, even if the smell is one of the best among perfumes (from my point of view), it just last for about an hour or so... I know is not my skin type, since I have dozens of perfumes since I collect them and most of them, their smell last up until the end of the day/next day. It&#x27;s a shame, because I really like it.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t rate the product, I&#x27;m sure anyone ordering cologne/perfume online already knows they want that fragrance.  I will say that the these arrived 2 days ahead of schedule, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> This has been my only scent for 10+ years. I love it! Smells like Dolce and Gabbana Blue. I still get a ton of compliments too</li>
    <li> Always have the suspicious that it was fake because the smell doesn&#x27;t last enough. Bought two of this to finally compare very carefully with an old one that i have on my grandma house and came out that it is totally fake the bottles are painted.</li>
    <li> bad product, the smell is lost in minutes, this supplier is a hoax ..... The fragrance in minutes and does not smell ..</li>
    <li> My hubby purchased this \\&quot;Romantic\\&quot; scent for me after I received a sample of it. I get nothing but, compliments when I wear it. The name I LOVE LOVE is the best  description for this scent. Because that&#x27;s pretty much what everyone says once they smell it. If you LOVE citrus &amp; fresh sweet smells than this is the scent for you. If you want more info on the descriptive notes of this perfume go to: [...]&lt;br /&gt;This is a MUST have scent!!!!</li>
    <li> very nice product I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Can not beat the price for the quantity.  I think it smells great, citrusy and light not to overbearing.  Only con is it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> It is an ok perfume. I smelt it and bought it but it is not my favorite. I got tired of it really fast, specially since it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very unique. Smells too much like light blue, which I hate. Try Live in Love by Oscar de la Renta, it is a far better buy and smell.</li>
    <li> Bought it directly from amazon and I got the fake one. The cap doesnt fit right and the smell is not the authentic one I had before. It doesnt smell smooth and delicate. So disappointed! Will never buy any perfume from amazon again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  Clean nice smell that stays with you all day long.  I get a lot of compliments on this perfume!</li>
    <li> A very special person introduced me to this perfume awhile ago.  It is the only fragrance I currently wear, love the citrus, fresh scent.  Not to strong, and can be worn summer or winter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister on Christmas and I purchased it at the mall at Perfume Plus for $61.00 I saw on Amazon that it was half the price so I ended up returning the one I bought at the mall. The cashiers told me there was no way this could be 30$ online and be the real thing. Well it is and you get an amazing deal! Would definitely buy from again!</li>
    <li> Not only is it such a great deal, but it&#x27;s always shipped speedily and carefully. Will continue to buy it here, where I know it is affordable!</li>
    <li> I ordered this last week as a present for my daughter and it arrived today, she is thrilled, excellent product and very prompt service. I will order again with no hesitation.....thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it smells delicious, I find that has a blue light like D &amp; G, but this I like it more and the price is lower. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Every summer I make an attempt to find a new \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance for me.  My taste is very particular as I prefer only clean, citrusy fragrances, such as Cool Water and Clinique Happy Heart.  I purchased Light Blue by D&amp;G, but  don&#x27;t wear it often as it is very popular amongst my crowd. I came across I Love Love one day and immediately fell in love!!!  The fragrance is similar to Light Blue but smells a bit more citrusy and the fragrance stays with you!!  Just about everyone that I have introduced to it has loved it as well.  A great all year round fragrance!!!</li>
    <li> If you like D&amp;G light blue you&#x27;ll love this. They have a very similar smell. It&#x27;s citrusy and light. A great summer scent. I get compliments on my perfume daily by friends and strangers. This is also a great price for this size of the bottle,  Cheapest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> If you love light blue youll definitely love this!</li>
    <li> the fastest shipping ever and the best smelling perfume ever!&lt;br /&gt;very similar to d&amp;G light blue as all reviews state... great for everyday</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s a good product, but it only can last for 2 hours. and i like the smell very much!</li>
    <li> I love love smells amazing I had got a sample of it from macys with some perfum I purchased I went back to the store to buy it &amp; they said that they didn&#x27;t carry anymore so i came home jumped on amazon &amp; there it was for half the price &amp; I was worried it may have been knock-off but,it&#x27;s not this is same originsl scent that received in the sample &amp; people love it everywhere I go it&#x27;s not over-powering &amp; It lingers lightly on you as the day goes on.Great buy &amp; shipping was really fast even for the basic ship price.Thanks amazon thinking I may never buy perfum from Macy&#x27;s again lol!</li>
    <li> This is a light fresh fragrance.  I get many compliments about the scent and that is actually how I found it by asking someone else what they were wearing.  It is hard to find at retailers so I am glad I found it online and will buy again.  The product arrived very quickly from the shipper.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE PARFUME. EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT I AM BUYING IT. THIS TIME I GOT IT FOR MY SELF AND FOR MY BEST FRIEND BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS COMPLIMENTED ME ON THE SCENT AND I KNOW SHE WILL LOVE IT. JUST AWESOME PARFUME!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume and receive compliments regarding its wonderful fragrance. It is similar to D&amp;C Light Blue, but at a much more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000E7SSCQ I Love Love For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces]]So glad this is available through Amazon -- it&#x27;s not in most stores any more and I love it!</li>
    <li> It is a simular fragrance to Dolce&#x27; &amp; Gabanna Lt. Blue, which is the fragrance I had previously used. I have had many occasions that total strangers have complimented me on my cologne and wanted to know what I was wearing. I guess they love \\&quot;I Love Love\\&quot; too!</li>
    <li> I buy this perfume all the time!  I love Moschino scents.  I first smelled this particular one in a sample, but later when I went to Macy&#x27;s to find the perfume, they didn&#x27;t sell this one.  Well, bright idea....AMAZON!  I love Amazon, because they have EVERYTHING! Not only is this a great fragrance (I have received so many compliments), but it is sold at a great price!  It is completely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a light scent, especially good for spring and summer.  I gave it as a graduation gift to a young woman and she was very happy with it!  If you like the more pricey \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, chances are you will like this!</li>
    <li> I love this scent! A lot of people will guess D&amp;G Light Blue but when I tell them what it is the write it down! I even have men stop and ask what are you wearing? You will not be sorry, buy this perfume, you will smell great!! It also stays on your clothes for a long time! Bonus!</li>
    <li> my wife really loves this perfume and I really like the way it smells on her distinct scent not overpowering but turns heads and everyone wants to know what scent she is wearing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for more than 3 years, and I always bought them in DutyFree shops. I needed a new one and I am not traveling so soon, so I decided to buy at Amazon. However, when I received, I notice that the smell was not exactly the same as the one I have. I still had some left from an older bottle, so I could compare.  I don&#x27;t know if this can be possible, but it seems to me this was a fake perfume. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a citrus fragrance and was just about to pay a high price for Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue.  I googled reviews of Light Blue and four reviews of this fragrance.  The review said to buy the large bottle so because of the low price I did and I was so happy I did.  I have since ordered 3 more bottles and gave one to a friend.  This fragrance will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> This smell is totally irresistible, I bought it and got addicted to it immediately. The problem is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long so you have to reapply it throughout the day but it smells totally wonderful. Very very refreshing, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent.  I have previously purchased this same cologne from a store. The scent is the same but somehow it simply did not last very long. My wife also found she needed to put far more than she used to, just to get the same intensity out of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that the product is real but stale.  Maybe that&#x27;s how I was able to buy the product so cheap.</li>
    <li> Smells better then a raw butt</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It is the perfect mixture of sweet and citrus. Not too overpowering. I get compliments on this perfume no matter where I am. I have had men stop me and ask me to write down what perfume it is so that they can buy it for their wives/girlfriends. Oh, and the price! You cannot beat the amazon price of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance. It smells very clean and fresh. Everybody asks me what I am wearing and often confuse it with Light Blue of Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Really happy with my purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> this is my all time favorite scent ..i love it it smells like D&amp;G light blue but its cheaper...but the only downside is that it dosent stay all day you need to apply more though out the day .. i gone throught 4 bottles of this yummmy scent</li>
    <li> I love love! I get compliments almost daily--it&#x27;s bomb dot com yo! Fresh clean upscale--often peeps think its Dolce &amp; Cabana Blue.</li>
    <li> I actually smelled it on a stranger and had to ask her what it was and bought it. Now I always get comments about how good my perfume smells by people who want to get it too. This was a great price!</li>
    <li> Great clean scent. Long lasting. If you&#x27;re a fan of Dolce &amp;Gabana Light Blue, this scent is for you.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume 💞 💯and  it&#x27;s my first time using it because I smelled it on another lady and she took the bottle out of her purse and I took a picture of it with my cellphone in order to get the right bottle. I&#x27;m not sure what it reminds me of because I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that said it reminds them of Dolce and and Gobanna  Light Blue BUT I&#x27;m not sure about that. I love this perfume 💝</li>
    <li> This is the best price I have found online for this perfume that my daughter wanted for her birthday.  If you like this fragrance, then buy this size as this is the best price for the largest sized bottle. She loves it and I must say, it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Really like this scent.  Makes one get  a tingly feeling to smell it.  Very fresh and exhilarating.  Not a calm smell.  Only drawback, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last for hours</li>
    <li> Got it from my boyfriend and it smells lovely, if you are looking for a perfume that smells sweet, yet not too strong, this is the one you should purchase! I&#x27;m very sensitive when it comes to &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; but this passed my nose, which means its really good!</li>
    <li> Not at all! I could swear this perfume is not original....I still had some left on the bottle I had bought at a store before and they smell completely different. Also, after I put it on, the smell goes away in just minutes. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my wife ,this one of the best smelling perfume out there. I would buy this over &amp; over.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Very fresh with citrus and floral notes!</li>
    <li> I have always.... I meant always receive compliments from wearing this scent. I have given this website to everyone who asks, I am proud that&#x27;s why. Really happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this seems not to be the original I love I love by Moschino.  Normally this fragrance last all day, but this one just disappears after a couple of hours and it just smells like alcohol.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> All perfect, shipped quickly</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume at a great price.</li>
    <li> Nice fragance at great price.,</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this scent every time I wear it ! Mostly from my female friends tho, thank you !</li>
    <li> Me and this scent have a history, the first time i was introduced to it was overseas on a very sexy lady. It has a citrus smell but it&#x27;s not overwhelming but it is intoxicating.  If you are sexy and have that it factor this is for you. If you don&#x27;t feel sexy and don&#x27;t have that it factor this is not for you!</li>
    <li> This fragrance has a nice lemony smell and it is very economical. It is replacing Jean Nate that is no longer available in the spray cologne. I Love also comes in a variety of sizes.</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  Wear it every spring and summer.  So glad that I found it on Amazon.  Get a lot of compliments where ever I go.</li>
    <li> I rarely love a perfume that I go through it and end up buying the same brand again. The exception, I LOVE LOVE! This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m sure there will be a third. It is so refreshing. I wear it daily.</li>
    <li> My wife is a huge hippie chic and tommy girl fan and I&#x27;ve always only \\&quot;liked\\&quot; the way they smelled on her. i read one review that said that this was like tommy girl all grown up and i have to say i agree completely. when i first opened the bottle i wasn&#x27;t sure that i liked what i smelled, but after my wife put some on it changed completely. very citrusy at first then a wonderful floral smell that i can only describe as soft, elegant and sophisticated. at first my wife was putting it on frequently because she thought it didn&#x27;t last very long, but after much reassurance from me she only puts it on once or twice a day and it lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did not buy from amazon because i found the 3.4oz bottle at Marshall&#x27;s for $19.99. i do not know if some of the vendors are selling knockoffs, but the real thing is sexy on my wife.</li>
    <li> i love this perfume for Spring and Summer. Great price and packaging as well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume my wife wears, it drives me crazy in a good way...will buy again when it runs out</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.thanxs to my sister who told me about it, after that I had to have it.amazon has a great price and got it just in time!</li>
    <li> wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. wanted it for her bday. saw that the price was exactly the same as it would have been at Target so I just got it online with other bday items. shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Great smell, I can&#x27;t smell it on myself but people have told me they like how I smell.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance . It smells terrific on her and we both like it . How much better can it be than this ?</li>
    <li> If you have ever liked Dolche &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s Light Blue I am sure you will love this one, too! Same family of smells, and it is more stable than Light Blue.</li>
    <li> I love this smell on my wife, very clean fresh daily smell. Not super strong ,won&#x27;t fill the room but catches your attention when someone with it walks by. The price is $40 cheaper than mall so don&#x27;t think about it to long.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again...The smell lasts. It smells fresh and clean .My body chemistry works well with this perfume.I love this...</li>
    <li> This is absolutely wonderful smelling perfume!! I get compliments all day about it. It does smell like DG Light Blue but I think lasts longer. The best is the price!! So affordable!!!</li>
    <li> Love this smell! I bought this originally as a gift fir a friend and ended up falling in love with it, so I kept it and bought her something else. A little selfish I know, but its so amazing I couldn&#x27;t help myself! Will definitely be buying more when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. We both love I Love Love. Have bought it a number of times and never displeased.</li>
    <li> Its my wifes favorite perfume. It had very good price. The only thing that i didnt like it was the plastic cover of the bottle that it looks it had manufacturer problem. It looked like it didnt fit well.</li>
    <li> I love, love this perfume.  It&#x27;s so fresh and light.  I get many compliments on it when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Love!  Light and fresh.  Great summer scent or for those who love citrus.  I always get questions when wearing this, as apparently is resembles Light Blue by D &amp; G.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. What arrived is the same as what I buy in the store at a better price.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was wearing this and I liked it so much I went ahead and bought some as well.  I really do enjoy the scent, but perfumes are a must to try in person first before buying.</li>
    <li> got the best deal in this perfume......  has a good smell and I want to use it everyday even when i&#x27;m sleeping.... so addicted to perfume.....</li>
    <li> Smells good to me....havent worn in public yet. We will see how many compliments I get.</li>
    <li> I also experienced poor quality, I  bought 2 of this fragrance and one of them leaked out of the bottles Co. did not make it right. :(</li>
    <li> Very good&amp;#34; wonderful  smell</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance.  Every time I wear it, and that&#x27;s all the time I always get comments on how good I smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have had to write down the name of cologne and maker for several people.  Great price and quick shipment from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found my fragrance. I can&#x27;t stop buying it. I love it. Everyone compliments me. It has: Lemon, Orange, Red Currant, Grapefruit, Bulrushes, Lily-of-the-Valley, Cinnamon Leaves, Tea Rose, Musk, Cedar &amp; Tanaka Wood. It&#x27;s a clean, fresh, citrus, sweet, cedar fragrence. It may smell different on different people depending on their personal chemistry.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person who loves to smell good all day long. I spray my skin, and the inside of my clothes with this stuff so I know I will smell as delicious when I come home from work as I did when I left the house!</li>
    <li> Simple. Fresh. Fruity scent. Easy to wear any times.</li>
    <li> My absolutely favorite scent!!! Very refreshing smell</li>
    <li> This one is not authentic, i am so disappointed as i know exactly how the original authentic one smells like. I will proceed for a product return. SO BAD EXPERIENCE</li>
    <li> I discovered I love love eau de toilette spray when a friend who lives outside the country asked me to bring a bottle for her when I came to visit. I sprayed before I bought it and love the fruity scent. My hubby he loved the scent and told me this is his favorie scent on me. Anyone who comes near me, family,colleagues at work, friends, my hairdresser and even the servers in the restaurants ask me what scent I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the big stores here in Honolulu. I went to Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom &amp; Macy&#x27;s but they don&#x27;t carry it. I was happy to learn that I can get it on line that&#x27;s why I ordered 3 bottles and will get more to give away as gifts.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based solely on reviews here.  My husband loves the smell and can&#x27;t figure out how I can pick a winner perfume over the internet.&lt;br /&gt;I did and am happy with my purchase, Thank you to all you reviewer!!.  This perfume is a stand out scent for me...different than my usual flowery scents like Pleasures or Dreaming.</li>
    <li> Now my favorite!! I get so many compliments on this fragrrance, only wished the scent lasted longer, but have no problem in re-applying to refresh..</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the first one i got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smell different, the first one I got in chula vista store smell better, I don&#x27;t know why, the package is the same....but smell different, I have the first bottle and I can compare...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Amazon ask your supplyer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was a valentine&#x27;s gift for my wife, and she open it a month after that day, so I can&#x27;t sent it back. Is a shame, I love this fragance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again in the store.</li>
    <li> My most favorite ever...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for probable six years and I&#x27;ve always received a ton a compliments on the smell.</li>
    <li> I love perfumes, and this is the one i get most compliments on. It smell similar to D&amp;G light blue but BETTER!!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts at least 6 hours... I have been buying it since I was in high school and I am still addicted to this smell. I think you will be too!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing,shiping fast,and good price! Was worried at the begining ,didn&#x27;t know if I will like the smell,but its citrusy,kind of fresh smell and unique.</li>
    <li> Not going to lie, the immediate spray of this scent is not very nice at all.  It&#x27;s very sharp and has an unidentifiable generic smell.  When it dries down it changes completely, however, and starts to smell like grapefruit candy.  I love the grapefruit candy!  You just have to get through the first five minutes or so, and then it becomes magical.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> Great service...I love this scent and this is a deal!</li>
    <li> This bottle is a great buy for the amount and price. It will last me years and I&#x27;m so happy it was cheap. :)</li>
    <li> D&amp;G&#x27;s Light Blue used to be my signature scent, until my mom started using it. Also, I realized that it was a commonly worn perfume. I decided to buy I Love Love without even trying it first, mostly because of other reviews. I was very pleased with the purchase! I get compliments from a lot of people whenever I wear it. :)</li>
    <li> Great summer fragrance!!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume at a great, great price. No matter where I go, people ask me if I am wearing Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue. This came fast and I have no complaints. I will be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It has a great, light, citrus scent that I think is ideal perfect for the spring/summer!</li>
    <li> Fresh scent, I really like it</li>
    <li> it smells AMAZING i cant explain it.!  all i can say is that i have found my new perfume to use for awhile !</li>
    <li> Great Service, arrived at time, just what I put in my order, good packing, and good price, thanks for this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was wanting. Love this fragrance and always order it via Amazon.</li>
    <li> One word amazing this has become my spring and summer scent and wherever I go people notice it and I get compliments it&#x27;s soft but noticeable it last 8 hours on me but if I spay it on my clothes it last even longer</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, and so do I. It came in its original box. Nice product to give to someone special.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for years. I always get compliments from others asking what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Great price can&#x27;t be beaten</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells so clean and fresh 💖</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for over 5 years! From the first time I smelled a sample given with a Spanish magazine, I immediately fell in love with this scent and the chemistry with my body. The smell of citrus makes me also feel happy in the mornings, I don&#x27;t know why.... As long as Moschino produces this fragrance I&#x27;m going to be the  #1 fan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a rare thing for this to be found in stores and online and this was definitely the authentic version of the perfume rather than it being an obvious knock-off with a scent that wears off quickly. I always get compliments on this and it is a nice alternative to Clinique Happy - a lot more subtle and very fresh smelling. I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> when I ordered this perfume I chose the free shipping option. When I was checking out it said it will take almost 2 weeks for me to receive it. But I actually received it in 6 days which was a very nice surprise. the perfume was sealed in the original box just like u would purchase at the department store but I paid a lot less. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely use amazon.com again.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years......love it...other people love it.....the name of it speaks volumes! Worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Signature smell!! Love this!! People can smell me coming !! I am a nurse and my patients compliment me all the time. Not to strong .</li>
    <li> I keep buying this perfume for my lady for the past 3 years. WE are Both in love with this fragrance. Very fresh and pleasant. It&#x27;s a morning and a daytime perfume. Will buy again. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> As always! I get compliments every time i wear it! People always ask me what it is I&#x27;m wearing, especially in the summer time !</li>
    <li> The name speaks for itself!! Subtle and similar to Dolce &amp; Gabanna&#x27;s  LIGHT BLUE  A must have on every woman&#x27;s dresser.</li>
    <li> I  love love love it!</li>
    <li> I really do love this perfume!  I received so many compliments when I wear this perfume.  I like to spray it directly on my skin.  It is very citrusy but it has this real tame woodsy scent in the background.  So hard to describe but it&#x27;s now my signature scent. :) I wear it wherever I go, not just the summer time like most people.  You have to try it for yourself.  And I heard a lot of people describe closest as Dolce&#x27;s Light Blue.  I can agree with them on that but I think I love love lasts longer and had a lighter scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume few months ago and I enjoy wearing it since then. The price is great and I dont have to wait long for delivery. I got a lot of attention from my co worker and asking me where I got it.I surely recommend this to everybody who loves flowery and citrusy scent.</li>
    <li> It does not maintain its aroma for very long, but I still like the scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume numerous times as a gift. But this time decided to keep a bottle for myself. I love this smell.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite perfume. Love the orange smell. It&#x27;s not too strong and overpowering. great for everyday wear</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and both my daughters use it as well. It costs almost twice as much at large department stores so a bargain here.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance I&#x27;ve been using the item for years and it still has the same smell as it did years ago.</li>
    <li> I do not like it. I smelled it on someone else and they smelled good.Does not mix well with my body chemistry</li>
    <li> i love this perfume.  it was a gift to me years ago and ive wearing it&lt;br /&gt;every since. its such a nice fragrance for the spring and summer time.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite! (along with Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue) Love it&#x27;s clean, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, and it&#x27;s pretty much all I wear.  I get headaches from heavier perfumes, but this is so nice and light.  Even though it is light, I get compliments on it all the time, so it is noticeable.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for about three years- it replaced another fragrance that I used to use.(Dolce Gabbanna- Light Blue) The fragrances are so&lt;br /&gt;similar that I have been asked if the fragrance was the former that I used.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price- it is more than half of the original fragrance and I absolutely love it and get many compliments. It is a light pleasing fragrance.</li>
    <li> Wonderful gift to put on top of anything else you have purchased for your lovely lady. No matter who has been gifted with this item, the reviews are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this scent. It&#x27;s a fun fragrant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing I Love Love for 9 years now, or since it was launched so I would know how it should smell!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read in some of the reviews that some of the customers have not been so happy with their product and have claimed it as a fake stating the lid doesn&#x27;t fit and that the scent isn&#x27;t right so maybe it&#x27;s just a 50-50 chance that you&#x27;ll get the right product but thankfully I did! I absolutely love it and there&#x27;s nothing fake about it! Packaging, stamp, bottle, lid &#x3D; everything original and perfect and it got here fairly quickly (or in just 3 days).Thank you so much - you saved me a good amount of money there my friend &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I receive compliments every time I wear this fragrance. Many ask if I&#x27;m wearing Light Blue! It last long and is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> When I received the perfume, it was very well packaged. No fear of it being broken at all. The actual packaging of the perfume itself was very good as well. Brand new, wraped in cellophane and unopened. Would recommend to anyone. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It really smells like DG Light Blue, and that&#x27;s what everyone thinks it is. The only problem is, the smell seems to fade unless you a ton on to begin with.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is beautiful.  I do love, I Love Love...that said, it&#x27;s not quite as potent as I like a perfume to be.  I use about 5 sprays of it and still people have to struggle to smell it on me.  More like a body spray than a perfume.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite perfume of life. Super similar to light blue, but slightly sweeter which I prefer. The spray sometimes sticks on me though. I have one bottle I can&#x27;t even use because of that. Aside from that this is glorious!</li>
    <li> I love love love this perfume!!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume. I love love love it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It is hard to find has a clean fresh spring scent. I get so many compliments when I wear I Love Love!</li>
