      <li>Both pomades have significant features.</li>
      <li>I use this gel everyday, and it provides a great hold for fine hair that stays all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> hold&#x27;s hair very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for.my sister and she loves it. It looks smooth and has a very wonderful smell</li>
    <li> Item was delivered earlier than expected. The best holding gel by far!! My daughter is African American with curly hair and this is the only product that lays her hair done perfectly!</li>
    <li> I simply LOVE this stuff! It also smells nice! Would have given it 5 stars but I&#x27;m a sweater &amp; it doesn&#x27;t hold as well once you start to sweat.</li>
    <li> Turns your hair yellow after it dries up.</li>
    <li> This is not extreme hold!</li>
    <li> I was in EL SALVADOR 2 years ago and i purchase this product,by far this is the best in the market i used to get Sebastian bondage but they don&#x27;t make it any more.Get this one is the best you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used this first about 4 years ago. Back then this was the most potent \\&quot;Moco de Gorila\\&quot; (Gorilla Snot, yes, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called). Meaning this one apparantly holds your hair in place longer and better than the other ones. I&#x27;ve tried this one, as well as the red and blue colored one and I can vouch this one is so much better...The other one my hair get&#x27;s all limpy by hours end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gel is yellow colored, and doesn&#x27;t show once mixed in your hair. I prefer this one over the 11.99oz bottle they have, even though that one&#x27;s easier to apply with the squeeze bottle, this one has a better effect on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried 3 of the squeeze bottles, and about 10 of these cans. This hair makes my hair really curly. I have afro-styled hair and a little bit of this gets me to have many \\&quot;curly spikes\\&quot;. It takes about 30 minutes to harden, and once it&#x27;s hardened it won&#x27;t move. You can shake your head like a psycho, your hair will stay perfectly still. Also no flakes come off, no residue, it just makes your hair stick together. Takes a couple of minutes to wash out completly. Lastly, it hurts A LOT having someone pull on your hair with this on. Think of this gel, as glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve cut my afro for now, so I don&#x27;t use this at the moment, but this is the best hairgel I&#x27;ve ever used. Try it!</li>
    <li> Took my hair out everywhere I put it around my edges as if I had shaved my head. Bad product. Needs to be retested.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It does the job and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so messy. It greased my hair more than it laid it down. This is not a good product.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered spilled out of container and jar was messy! Overall product works good!</li>
    <li> you can buy this at cvs or walmart for $2.50! yes $2.50 do not buy form here it was like over $7, i thought i was gonna get a bigger bottle but they sent me the same one i can get at cvs for cheaper</li>
    <li> My husband swares by this stuff and won&#x27;t use anything else for his tough to style hair.</li>
    <li> Great product will order again</li>
    <li> Always loved this product but I just saw it cheaper elsewhere, anyway it&#x27;s really good gel.</li>
    <li> Product is entirely too sticky, turns white on my texture hair. Great hold, just not for my hair type. 4C Natural</li>
    <li> It does hold very well but remember  it is a gel made for spiking hair. I have 4c hair and this was recommended for edge control and it did do the job but my hair felt hard and you have to wash your hair to get it out. It is essentially like gluing your hair to your head and it comes out a lot like glue too. I only use it for high puffs or close to wash day. Does the job a little too well ;)</li>
    <li> A little messy to apply</li>
    <li> Its way too sticky for my likings and it slicks my hair down but its wayy too gluey and when i touch my hair it feels like some type of gum ball stuck on my head... You really have to use it with some water because this alone isnt any good..</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s hair naturally wants to lay down and he likes to spike it, so most gels we have tried last an hour or two and his hair is back down.  This gel spikes it until we wash it out.  It is great!  He loves the name of it lol.</li>
    <li> Good stuff will purchase again, I love this stuff, I gave the first one to my daughter after she tried it and asked for it. I purchased it again. Love this stuff. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... Great on mixed hair really makes fro-hawks stand high all day.</li>
    <li> Not good for 4c naturals</li>
    <li> I love this product will be buying again thanks so much .</li>
    <li> Works well with edge gel, hair stayed in place all day. leave hair stiff, but washes out easily. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> this stuff is super strong, so far i have no issues when I use it my style last all day, I wish i knew about this product sooner</li>
    <li> I agree with the product. It is great .. and comfortable to work, I like it .. Thanks very much</li>
    <li> Discovered this product on You tube , so i decided to try it . Great for laying down edges in between relaxers</li>
    <li> Initial Review: It&#x27;s nice (and gooey*) and has a fruity smell. I haven&#x27;t really used it on my clean hair yet but it&#x27;s nice on my hair, which is curly/coily.&lt;br /&gt;* I didn&#x27;t know it had been delivered for a few hours,plus it&#x27;s hot here so it was probably in the heat for a while)</li>
    <li> i have used  expensive edge controls and none of them work! this product will keep your edges as well as your hair in place for hours even until the next day!  after a couple of days it will build up residue that u will eventually have to wash out of your hair but the product is affordable and does what it states....&amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This pomade is another, equivalent, favorite to Jovinno All Natural High Quality Pomade Hair Styling Wax 5oz. Both pomades have significant features. Gorila is thinner in consistancy, where All Natural is very thick. Both hold well.</li>
    <li> used it on top of edge control bc it has alcohol in it...... it still melts away and doesnt hold....if ur natural it probably wont work...... with a perm it does....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to relax or straighten my edges so they won&#x27;t be damaged, so I thought this will help my edges look good.&lt;br /&gt;It actually is great! I use this with Eco Styler gel and it makes my edges look really great. I will keep using this forever .</li>
    <li> I like it however it causes my hair to have lots of dandruff which other gels this won&#x27;t usually happen.  I think it just works to define and elongate my curls when my hair is wet. I would only use this for my edges and to define my ends in the event I try to blow out or stretch my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, straight hair that is cut into a faux hawk. I need a product that&#x27;s going to make my hair stand up and stay up, this isn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s a slimy glue both in my hands and hair. It makes my hair hard but at the same time weighs it down, so it doesn&#x27;t really work for punk hairstyles. I am also not impressed with the hold. It cakes my hair together for a sort of wet look but it won&#x27;t stay in place. Finally, the stuff flakes and looks like dandruff the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work well for super short hair where weighing it down isn&#x27;t much of a concern. It does not work well for actual punk hairstyles.</li>
    <li> I use this to slick down my untamed edges and it works miracles!!!!! U HAVE TO SLICK IT DOWN WITH A POMADE/EDGE CONTROL *FIRST*!!!!!!! then put a lil of this stuff on top and Ur good to go all day and the next if u Wrap Ur edges</li>
    <li> Does not hold natural hair down well. I have 4C hair.</li>
    <li> Was using this for my daughters tightly coiled hair for styling. It held ok but not as strong as I had hoped. Maybe I need a stronger hold?</li>
    <li> This a good product; however, I did not get the level of hold on my natural hair as I expected from other reviews.</li>
    <li> Leaves flakes and is messy. Also doesn&#x27;t provide the hold I need.</li>
    <li> This is EXTREME hold.  I suggest that you purchase this product in a tube.  It is so much like &amp;#34;snot&amp;#34; until it has a tendency to &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; out like snot and can become very messy, when scooping from the jar!  It also seems to build up very quickly and needs to be washed out of the hair regularly.</li>
    <li> How about a Zero...But that option wasn&#x27;t available....Gorilla Snot...Really...Gorilla....and Snot....So does than not make you think about what does a picture of a gorilla say about how this manufacturer think about a product that is apparently directed at people of color...An animal used historically to demean and portray Blacks, Africans as subhuman, primitive inferior to the human race...and SNOT the term given to the collection of waste filled germs that comes out of  your nose....For Real?...At the very least if you are going to patronize this product with such Racist depiction...insulting to people as well as the gorilla you should demand that the name and image be changed ...otherwise why support such racism and degradation of a people...Have some self respect at least...There are more options that don&#x27;t insult you and take your money at the same ti me</li>
    <li> Will hold hair in place, but expect a residue.</li>
    <li> Messy product , didn&#x27;t suit my needs...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place call day</li>
    <li> its great for buns slicking hair back, and wash and go&#x27;s, instead of mousse or hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear wigs or weave its great to slick your natural edges down to blend in with the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is no joke. My son has natural hair and the stylist uses this to twist his hair. I now use it too to smooth my natural edges when I need to. Love it. It can build up of course so you&#x27;ll need to wash your hair more frequently if you&#x27;re using it a lot but it does what it says and I love it. My daughter got twists without this and her hair lasted only a few days (still looking &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;) while my son&#x27;s hair looked great for a couple of weeks before looking dull.</li>
    <li> I use this gel everyday, and it provides a great hold for fine hair that stays all day.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Don&#x27;t need to use much to hold hair all day long.  Had been using a much more expensive product prior.</li>
    <li> Holds wonderfully on my 4b, natural hair&lt;br /&gt;But it cakes really fast if you add too much</li>
    <li> Works well for my sons hair. Great for an all day hold. Although they did send this without any seal on it or plastic covering and it spilled all over the packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought this to slick down my edges, I have 4C Haitian American natural hair and it does the trick when I first apply it but afterwards my wavy pattern begins to show through. Still trying to find a way to make it last but it slicks lays them down. And btw, don&#x27;t order it online. Little did I know you can find this stuff at Wal-Mart, Walgreen&#x27;s, etc for like $3, smh. I paid $13 .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter,  it&#x27;s the best product on the market to me for natural black hair to lay down without being frizzy.  Better than hicks,  and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Best gel I ever used. It holds very well. It&#x27;s really good for very curly hair and it&#x27;s very inexpensive for it&#x27;s quality.</li>
    <li> This gel is very messy and has no EXTERME  HOLD at all!</li>
    <li> This gel has the strongest hold ive ever seen and keeps my hair up for 3 days straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 5 ounce container lasts me over a year too!</li>
    <li> It really work hold hair in place, I would order again</li>
    <li> this stuff is the truth! It laid my 4a hair down so lovely. I applied the gel and used a bristle brush to brush the hair down</li>
    <li> for a nice hold add a little water rub hands together and apply to hair this is great stuff you only need a little bit it goes a long way with a super hold. I Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says is going to do.....great invention!!!! this product is great for African American women with natural hair it will make your hair look as though you had a perm without one.</li>
    <li> The product is good.  It keeps hair in place pretty much all day.  I recommend it.  Great quality, great price.</li>
    <li> great gel.  need to use it more and then update my review.</li>
    <li> Seen a YouTube video for this product I slick my edges down filled all the steps this stuff works great and delivery was super fast</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but Just because it doesn&#x27;t work for-me it might work for you. nothing holds my hair</li>
    <li> I just purchased this gel and I love it I have my hair in two strand twist and the end result is awesome my hair is very curly and holds in place all day.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop selling this one.</li>
    <li> I have tight coily hair. I purchased this product for my edges. It did sleek them down but they were curly again shortly after applying the product.  This product leaves your hair feeling greasy so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t wash their hair daily . Fast shipping and good price for the amount of product.</li>
    <li> Well it does look like snot. But seriously, my expectations were high. I thought it would&#x27;ve been a cure all for my styles to be frozen but it didn&#x27;t work. It lasted maybe an hour then my hair reverted...and I&#x27;m being generous with the time. I even used another gel to lay and smooth my hair then the gorilla snot but nope. It&#x27;s just not for me. But it does have a pleasant scent. That&#x27;s why I gave it 1 star.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It&#x27;s a little tacky, but very forgiving. It&#x27;s yellow in the jar, but dries clear with all day hold. It also conditions your hair &amp; is never flaky or drying. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> This gel is better than hairspray and I am a woman. I will use this to my frizzy down without making my hair look like its caked with hairspray. Its light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave a white flakey look even after 32hrs of use. Everyone should use this product!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a black woman like me with natural hair we know how hard it can be to sleek down those edges when natural! This \\&quot;relaxer\\&quot; in the jar is the answer! I have tried ORS, Creme of Nature Argan Oil, and Carols Daughters edge control all of them hold until I step outside in the heat and my hair frizz back up. I live in Pittsburgh, so we get four seasons, but those others does not work during the other seasons too! I&#x27;ve recently purchase Moco (Extreme Hold) because of a youtube video and it&#x27;s excellent even on those 90 degree days we had last month it held my edges down all day! This is the best gel I ever used and I have tried many since I&#x27;d been natural. If you&#x27;re natural purchase and if you just want a good holding gel this is by far the BEST! It was package pretty good and it arrived a day early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I apply: You do not need a lot a little goes a long way. Start to apply Moco on your edges or all over if your doing a ponytail use a OLD toothbrush to smooth it down and get it straight! You can use one of the edge controls that I mention above with it as well. Take a scarf and tie it down for about 10 minutes so it can dry. Take the scarf off after 10 minutes and you&#x27;ll have sleek edges or ponytail!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product! It really slicks my hair down without flaking. Will order again.</li>
    <li> The consistency is good and hold is wonderful but it gets a little flaky after it dries. My daughters have said the same thing. May not reorder but would if they could fix the flaking.</li>
    <li> Great product. Glad I got it early. Thank you. Packaging was Awesome! Not a spill in the box</li>
    <li> came very fast will order again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, and left a residue. Jar is a decent size though</li>
    <li> I have natural curly thick hair &amp; it works marvelous on my hair! I lovvveeeeeee it! &amp; it hold as day. &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake in my hair. The shipping was always super fast!! Got it in 2 days!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the expectations that it would work on African American hair after reading other comments stating that it would. It did absolutely nothing for my hair at all. After using it once it&#x27;s been on my shelve ever since. Maybe I can find another use for it later on.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I have natural kinky curly hair. This stuff works so good a little bit goes a long way. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that since I live in a  hot and humid place sometimes my hair will revert which ok because all I do is wrap a scarf on my edges for ten minutes. This helps my hair lay back down. I also dampen my hair just a little this works well with ORS</li>
    <li> Does the job well of keeping my edges smooth.  It leaves your hair with a film though.  Other than that its great.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this 2.99 hair gel.  Glad I tried it.  I have thin hair on top but full on the sides.  The sides above the ears get a bit unruly.  A little bit (tiny amount) goes a long way.  It holds my hair all day with decent shine and tremendous hold.  I found Moco de Gorila (Gorilla Snott) at a local ethnic market for $2.99.  Next time I will avoid the shipping charges. BTW, I am told that the yellow jar is the strongest hold of all the Moco products.</li>
    <li> The product looks good and smooths down edges initially but flakes very badly after drying. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This by far is the BEST hair gel ever!!!! It really does the job and a little goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> Holds well and does leave a tiny but of residue. Nowhere near as much as other products.</li>
    <li> very gooey and sticky, kind of like slime.  held my hair in style nicely but left residue.  would use again but would have to figure out how to mix it with something else that would help minize the residue left on my hair.</li>
    <li> Very good. Can&#x27;t build up or it&#x27;ll flake that&#x27;s the only downfall</li>
    <li> Despite the positive reviews, it didn&#x27;t work well for me...at all. I brushed it down, and it was back to its natural state by the time I walked out the door.</li>
    <li> The gel leaves a sticky residue that I&#x27;m not particularly find of.  It does hold well with olive oil edge control but I wish it didn&#x27;t dry sticky.</li>
