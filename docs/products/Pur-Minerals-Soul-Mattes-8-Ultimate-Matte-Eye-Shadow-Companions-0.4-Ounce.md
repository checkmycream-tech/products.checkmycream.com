      <li>The service was good as well :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and had about given up hope of finding a nice rose tinted matte palette.  </li>
      <li>Blend able, pigmented, gorgeous</li>
      <li>but I wanted to love this palette so much because the colors seemed perfect for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nicely pigmented and blends very good and the colors are lovely and natural.</li>
      <li>Love this matte palette.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.  </li>
      <li>I love this palette of matte shadows.  </li>
      <li>the shadows perform okay</li>
      <li>(I have all three and more)</li>
      <li>Neutral shades I love.</li>
      <li>I also love that it is made by Pur Minerals.</li>
      <li>Depending on what combinations you use, you can have brownish or more rosy neutral looks.  </li>
      <li>Love anything by Pur Mineral.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is ok.  </li>
      <li>Wish they did refill because like many sets there is always a couple of colors you use more often and</li>
      <li>This is a great palette that works really well with my hazel eyes.  </li>
      <li>Great for older eyes and photo looks.</li>
      <li>This pallete is not only a beautiful companion to rose tone colors but also by themselves.</li>
      <li>Great product, vibrant colors.</li>
      <li>This is a palette of beautiful, soft colors.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful matte, soft colors.</li>
      <li>... if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap (and better) alternative, buy from makeupgeek.com.</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors that last 16</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this pallete.</li>
      <li>Love it the package is so pretty and</li>
      <li>Once you reach a certain age, shimmery eye shadows just don&#x27;t cut it any more.  </li>
      <li>This is my first Pur Minerals purchase and now that I&#x27;ve used it and am really happy with it, I&#x27;ll be looking more closely at their other products.  </li>
      <li>Gorgeous, simple palette.</li>
      <li>but for 10$ more you can get buttery shadows that are so much nicer from the balm, lorac, stila, or tarte</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how these rosy tones would look on me, but they really bring out my eyes.  </li>
      <li>This is a great palette to use alone or along with other palettes or shadows.  </li>
      <li>They are all matte colors that do not reflect the light but are more natural looking than ones that do.  </li>
      <li>The application brush is actually useful for travel.  </li>
      <li>The mattes blend so nicely and last all day.  </li>
      <li>It will work fine and the mirror is nice and large, but the plastic and the latch have a slightly cheapish feel.  </li>
      <li>I love it more than my urban decay naked 3.</li>
      <li>All in all, and considering the cost of individual shadows and the price of an eye shadow brush, this is a phenomenal buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Pur Minerals palette is very versatile and although I rarely use the darker plummy colors as shadow, they work really well as liners.  </li>
      <li>I particularly love the compact packaging and that Pur provides such a high quality brush.</li>
      <li>A good matte shadow is hard to find.</li>
      <li>once their gone you have to buy the whole set again.</li>
      <li>The lack of talc makes them much creamier in texture (in addition to noncarcinogenic) .  </li>
      <li>They apply smoothly and last all day (I do use an eye primer underneath).  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Adore and Better Half are nearly identical but the difference may be more apparent on lighter skin tones.</li>
      <li>Palette is cool tones and pigments are a little light.</li>
      <li>These shadows are highly pigmented and very blendable.  </li>
      <li>I like this palette much better than the Naked 3 palette (which I have also) which has only three matte shades.  </li>
      <li>For the older woman who doesn&#x27;t want sparkly glittery eye shadows this is the palette for you.</li>
      <li>In that case becomes a little more costly.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did, allow yourself to spend 10$ more</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice matte palette that enhances green, hazel or brown eyes, then look no further, this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very much a Tarte fan but chose this over the Tartelette  palette and would make the same decision again.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it my teenage daughter complimented how my makeup looked.  </li>
      <li>My favorite look is to use the rosy shade in the crease with the neutral beige on the lid and the highlight shade on the inner corner and a little under the browbone.  </li>
      <li>(the last on on the right), a shade I&#x27;ve been searching for for a long time.</li>

    <li> I love this palette of matte shadows.  I have a problem with lid sensitivity and have had not itching or redness.  The colors go on smoothly with my primer and look great.  You can wear them as a single color or combine them.  I just love them!</li>
    <li> What a great matte palette. For the older woman who doesn&#x27;t want sparkly glittery eye shadows this is the palette for you. It&#x27;s nicely pigmented and blends very good and the colors are lovely and natural. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, vibrant colors. Apply in the morning then only reapply to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; if going out after work. Truly matte, no glimmer which is just what I was wanting. Only disappointment is that can buy any of the color individually. Wish they did refill because like many sets there is always a couple of colors you use more often and once their gone you have to buy the whole set again. In that case becomes a little more costly. Good news it that a the color isn&#x27;t too sheer and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, simple palette. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this matte palette.  If you go to the Pur Minerals website you can also download three looks for this palette, which are just beautiful and take the guessing out of application.  The mattes blend so nicely and last all day.  I&#x27;m fair skinned, grey/green eyes, and 40.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how these rosy tones would look on me, but they really bring out my eyes.

It will work fine and the mirror is nice and large, but the plastic and the latch have a slightly cheapish feel.  The quality of the product is excellent, though and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.  I have the UD Naked Basics 1 and 2.  I think the quality of these shadows is equally good.  I was thinking of buying the Tarte Tartelette matte palette, but decided to get this instead to complement the Naked Basics palettes--best decision ever!  Love it!  Great for older eyes and photo looks.</li>
    <li> Love this matte eye shadow palette!  I also love that it is made by Pur Minerals.</li>
    <li> This pallete is not only a beautiful companion to rose tone colors but also by themselves. I really enjoy this pallete.</li>
    <li> Palette is cool tones and pigments are a little light. All matte.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors that last 16 hours+ when using an eyelid primer (Wet-n-Wild Fergie).</li>
    <li> This is a great palette to use alone or along with other palettes or shadows.  The colors are wonderful and though they&#x27;re matte they aren&#x27;t at all chalky or dry looking. They apply  without kicking up a lot of dust and with absolutely no fall-out. I particularly love the compact packaging and that Pur provides such a high quality brush.

    <li> This is a great palette that works really well with my hazel eyes.  The rosy shades really bring out the green.  I&#x27;m in my 50s and had about given up hope of finding a nice rose tinted matte palette.  I can no longer wear shimmery shadow because it brings out any little flaw in my skin.  Matte shades are all I wear these days.  I found this palette at Ulta and couldn&#x27;t contain my excitement.  This is my first Pur Minerals purchase and now that I&#x27;ve used it and am really happy with it, I&#x27;ll be looking more closely at their other products.  I don&#x27;t think these shadows contain talc because I get no tearing up like I do with talc based products.  The lack of talc makes them much creamier in texture (in addition to noncarcinogenic) .  In addition to the beautiful rose shades, there is the perfect neutral beige as well (the last on on the right), a shade I&#x27;ve been searching for for a long time. These shadows are highly pigmented and very blendable.  My favorite look is to use the rosy shade in the crease with the neutral beige on the lid and the highlight shade on the inner corner and a little under the browbone.  Add a little black mascara and I&#x27;m out the door.  I like this palette much better than the Naked 3 palette (which I have also) which has only three matte shades.  This Pur Minerals palette is very versatile and although I rarely use the darker plummy colors as shadow, they work really well as liners.  I can create both dramatic and subtle looks with this palette.  If you&#x27;re looking for a nice matte palette that enhances green, hazel or brown eyes, then look no further, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Please tell me where I can find more of this product! I am 50+ so anything shiney or glittery, only accentuates my wrinkles. I buy high end beauty products from Sephora, but for some reason, all their shadows are not true matte. These shadows are truly mate, and I can&#x27;t count the compliments I have received..</li>
    <li> Beautiful matte, soft colors.</li>
    <li> I like this pallet.  The colors are neutral and don&#x27;t crease on me.  I have very sensitive eyes and this brand does not irritate them.  The service was good as well :-)</li>
    <li> Love it the package is so pretty and the shade like sue said for women&#x27;s over 50&#x27; Perfect</li>
    <li> Once you reach a certain age, shimmery eye shadows just don&#x27;t cut it any more.  These are perfect.  I have light brown/hazel eyes, and the taupey/pinky/mauvy/plummy shades are perfect.  They apply smoothly and last all day (I do use an eye primer underneath).  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and will definitely be purchasing another palette.</li>
    <li> Love anything by Pur Mineral.  Excellent - goes on smooth and blends well.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: not worth the money. the shadows perform okay but for 10$ more you can get buttery shadows that are so much nicer from the balm, lorac, stila, or tarte... if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap (and better) alternative, buy from makeupgeek.com. This is so overpriced and the colors don&#x27;t show up as they do in the pan, they&#x27;re chalky and produce unnecessary fallout. The packaging is awkward to use because the case doesn&#x27;t open all the way and the lid sort of sits upright making it fall over if you want to lay it on a table. Wish I listened to the youtube reviews before purchasing it but I wanted to love this palette so much because the colors seemed perfect for me. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did, allow yourself to spend 10$ more (lorac has a palette in the same shade range now!) and you&#x27;ll be so thankful you did.</li>
    <li> Neutral shades I love.</li>
    <li> This is a palette of beautiful, soft colors.  They are all matte colors that do not reflect the light but are more natural looking than ones that do.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome pallet a must have in collection.</li>
    <li> Amazing palette! I use it every day and I have a ton of palettes. I love it more than my urban decay naked 3. (I have all three and more) I can&#x27;t say enough things about it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this project because I am getting to the age that sparkly and frosty eye shadow is no longer flattering. A good matte shadow is hard to find. The first time I used it my teenage daughter complimented how my makeup looked.  That said enough for me.</li>
    <li> Blend able, pigmented, gorgeous</li>
