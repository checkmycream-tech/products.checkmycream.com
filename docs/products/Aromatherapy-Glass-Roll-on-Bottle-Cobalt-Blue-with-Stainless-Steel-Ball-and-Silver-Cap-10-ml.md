    <li> These bottles are good, and the metal rollers are good. None of them were damaged or cracked upon arrival, and they are a great size. However, the lids do not fully close with the rollerball attached. I initially messaged the company, and they immediately sent me new lids. That&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars instead of 3. The actual bottles seem to work fine as long as you always keep them upright. I do think that some of my oils evaporate, but that is just a theory of mine. If the lids screwed on correctly,  these would be fantastic.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast delivery.</li>

    <li> I use these to mix my essential oils with jojoba oil.</li>
