    <li> Good set although it seems every few days I need to re-tighten them. However with that said I will buy them again when this set wears out.</li>
    <li> great replacement -- hubby has had old one for years -- what a difference the new one made now his CPAP fits like new again</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Good product. I prefer this headgear as opposed to other brands and models of CPAP masks and gear.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed at a much lower price than the original one that needed to be replaced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same headgear I&#x27;ve been using. It&#x27;s difficult to say I love it but the price was much nicer.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Still using it.  fast delivery. happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Worked great as a replacement for old headgear.</li>
    <li> Received promptly - Excellent Quality</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this headgear.  It&#x27;s exactly what I needed to replace the previous one that came with my CPAP.  While it wasn&#x27;t easy to figure out what I needed the picture helped a lot.</li>
    <li> It fits and holds the mask in place.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable fit.</li>
    <li> Perfect factory replacement. Seems genuine. Works great replacing the old one which was stretched and shredded from years of use.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase, would buy here again bought this for my dad, he need a replacement now and the Dr. was having him wait 2 weeks.  We will be back.</li>
    <li> Works great! Was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> My cpap mask now fits like new again!  Without having to spend a bundle. Same quality as OEM.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The company would not mail directly to Puerto Rico, so I had to go through my son in Florida.  The hooks at the end of the headgeat did not fit my machine.</li>
    <li> Just as it should be! Mine was worn out, stretched to the gills. I now have a few more years in this lovely night attire. ☺</li>
    <li> Fits good and was a great price.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, feels perfect, very comfortable!</li>
    <li> As new and fits like a glove, thanks for the fast delivery as I&#x27;m only in the Staes for a couple of months a year</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to get access to quickly and in expensively.  So I am a happy camper!</li>
    <li> This replacement headgear is &amp;#34;just what the doctor ordered&amp;#34;.  This is a quality product at a competitive price which was delivered on time.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have a C-Pap machine that the only thing that ever needs to be replaced is the headgear as it eventually stretches out.  Please keep available for when we need it again in 5 years.</li>
    <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;I received the item on time and it is the exact thing I need.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Instead of buying a whole new mask assembly, I bought this headgear.  It works just like the original.</li>
    <li> my wife loves her new headgear , I love the price.....great product and you don&#x27;t have to pay retail price........thanks very much</li>
    <li> This item is an exact replacement for the original Swift headgear.</li>
    <li> Very good vendor. Would use again.</li>
    <li> Same old same old....nothing different than the original.</li>
    <li> This is the CPAP part that wears out the quickest. Luckily, they are cheap (on Amazon), easy to obtain (especially now that Amazon carries them), and easy to swap out.</li>
    <li> My item came in earlier than I thought this is great.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased and the mailing procces was great. Will be ording again in the near future. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I normally use a TrueBlue set up for Respironics, but my wife has a ResMed set up with Swift LT and Nasal Pillows.  I decided to try out her set up by ordering new Headgear and using her older Nasal Pillows. (bought through CPAP deals / Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the result and felt less leakage than with the TrueBlue and the tubing interconnects perfectly with my Respironics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am using a Plexon (R) Anti-snore Device ( Mouth piece) a bit getting used to, but helps keep my mouth shut better than a chin strap does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good company to deal with, prompt and honest.  I would consider this company when choosing more replacement parts in the future.</li>
    <li> THIS is the correct headgear for MY cpap. Fits perfect.Immediately comfortable. Does stretch out fairly quickly ... over afew weeks time... have to cinch it in every so often.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as my original. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I saw on the cite and ordered. It fit perfectly. Received the straps in 3 days and it was suppose to take 7 days. I will always order from sleep restfully.</li>
    <li> Makes my old head piece like new again for about 1/3 the cost of new.</li>
    <li> This head gear is the best I have ever worn and the most comfortable fitting.</li>
    <li> Worked great. The exact replacement.</li>
    <li> Seem to stretch out of shape after a couple of months just like the original.</li>
    <li> Five stars for purchase process. This is my 3rd replacement. They are poorly made from cheap materials which fall apart after a few months. The product works great for the time it last.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a well worn version.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was more comfortable and yet sturdier than the original.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit replacement. Soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> It was exactly the part my husband needed for his CPAP.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding this headgear.  I guess they do not make it anymore.  I love it.  it is just what I wanted at a good price.  I am looking forward to buying from this item again</li>
    <li> The price is crazy.  I needed it in a hurry and couldn&#x27;t wait for an appointment for a prescription to be sent to a medical supplier and probably have to answer questions from my insurance company, so I had no choice.  Nothing wrong with the product itself, just the price structure and the greed of those who manufacture it.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait to order this.  The price was great, and I am sleeping well again.  Don&#x27;t wait anylonger.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> great product, excellent service</li>
    <li> OEM &amp; works as described. A bit pricey but what are you going to do?</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;In the past I had to buy the whole set.&lt;br /&gt;and now I found the part taht I needed</li>
    <li> A cheap way to keep a great mask working. Easy to assembly, but you have to keep tour old clips, it doesn&#x27;t come with the headgear</li>
    <li> i was apprehensive about buying this online site unseen. but this is 100% perfect.&lt;br /&gt;my old head gear was terriable, i can&#x27;t belevie how much better this is.</li>
    <li> Love it fits and is comfortable and stays tight on my head. My old was all stretched out. The price was great and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> My cpap head gear was stretched and worn but all of the plastic hardware was still like new. I replaced the elastic head gear with this and it fit perfectly without going through the wasted time and trouble of going to a medical supply and another written prescription. I saved a day off from work and replaced what was worn without dinging my insurance. well worth the 35 dollars.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement, and works very well.  It is also less expensive than in the store.</li>
    <li> It met its description, and was delivered on time. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> great to have a alternative!</li>
    <li> Well constructed and fits like the original product.</li>
    <li> just what I needed at a fair price</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and works great.  No problems.  This part has to be replaced about every 5 years, which is not unreasonble for something that s used every night.</li>
    <li> Good product but did not fit my nasal pillow</li>
    <li> A perfect match to the one provided my the medical supply place and way less $$.  I will buy from Amazon again before paying retail + at the medical supply.</li>
    <li> Original Resmed Part..&lt;br /&gt;Great price &amp; great quality !&lt;br /&gt;Easy install &amp; assembly !&lt;br /&gt;Just swap the parts in 5 mins and mask fits a good as new ☺</li>
    <li> Good value, exact replacement</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Just like the old one, except it&#x27;s new.&lt;br /&gt;It is what it&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;What more do you want?</li>
    <li> Lets face it, there is not two dollars worth of components to these headgears... but I know of nowhere you can buy one for a cheaper price... and it is very well made</li>
    <li> Great product, fair pricing and quick delivery. You would not believe how important it is to keep your equipment up and running. I sleep well again!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the exact same headgear I have used for years. The elastics eventually lose their shape and you need to replace the headset at least once every 2 years. But it&#x27;s the most comfortable CPAP headgear I have found, so it&#x27;s great, and convenient to buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This just came in and I was happy to see that there is no discernable difference between it and the one that cane with my cpap. The quality is good enough,  expect to get a year and a half of regular use.</li>
    <li> Expensive and not all that durable. the elasticity goes away too soon</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> The same as the ones that my local supplier sells for 3 times the price.  I also think the quality is better.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Fast and easy and finally found what we needed for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for less than insurance co- pay</li>
    <li> Very nice replacement, works like the original and was a nice upgrade from my worn out original that was falling apart.</li>
