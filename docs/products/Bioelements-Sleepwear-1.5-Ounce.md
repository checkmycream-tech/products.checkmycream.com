<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Item was as listed. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> Bioelements Sleepwear is the best.  Doesn&#x27;t stay sticky like some over night creams for the face do.  Your skin feels so soft.  I have adult acne and I can&#x27;t use many of the products out there.  Sleepwear works well and doesn&#x27;t cause me to have an outbreak.  Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product! I love it and see results almost immediately. Amazon is so much cheaper than getting it off the retail shelf. Thank you to Amazon to be able to afford this quality product on a budget.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin...not a problem with this product.  This cream feels just as soft in the morning as it did the night before...I have used bio elements products for about 5 years and am very pleased with all the products!</li>
    <li> I recently was recommended this product after a spa facial.  I bought it at the spa (for quite a bit more than here on Amazon) and was immediately impressed by the results.  This is a wonderful product.  Make sure that you tap it several times before applying it to your face and neck and also it is designed to work without light so don&#x27;t put it on until you are ready for the darkness of bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is my nightcream and I love it.  It is rich, smooths on nicely, but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  I use it sparingly, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I needed to change my review. After a few weeks of use- I have broken out worse than anything in my life. My skin has never been in this bad of shape in my life even in my teenage years! Bioelements and I clearly do not work well. I switched back to Dermalogica and instantly cleared up. Never switching again in my life.</li>
    <li> A wonderful night cream: very rich and feels wonderful.  I like this product as part of the Bioelements skin care line.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my face and it smells good. It was delivered on time and in good condition. Not sure if it works yet or not.</li>
    <li> Wow, I really don&#x27;t like heavy moisturizers at all and this is pretty thick but, once it&#x27;s on, your skin absorbs it really wonderfully. This feels very silky. What a great night time moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting a facial where they used Bioelements products.  I have dry skin and I find this really helps keep my skin moist and soft.  I use it along with the Bioelements Sleepwear for eyes and it&#x27;s a great combination together.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, but doesn&#x27;t seem any better than the Ultra-rich Crème Therapy which is a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have tried several night creams, many actually.  They are all OK and I think any night cream will help keep your skin supple to some extent.  My skin is oily but has begun to dry out and sag due to menopause and treatment for breast cancer.  Many of the creams I have tried are too greasy and heavy and there are no noticeable results.  This product does not promise miracles and it does not list any made up ingredients.  It goes on lightly and does not feel heavy.  Best of all, I see improvement when I wake up in the morning.  Some lines are not visible and my skin feels less saggy.  Everyone&#x27;s skin and needs are a little different and products will have different effects on different people. My search and trials lead me to this product and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I cant live without this sleep cream. My skin is so soft after using it. It helps with my Rosecea in a big way. A great product.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and not greasy once absorbed.  No perfume odor.  For very dry skin, this is a good choice!  I need to rub it in well, once applied, for great results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time so yes I am very satisfied with it</li>
    <li> use their entire line of facial care and love their products especially sleepwear.  lightly fragranced with a hint of lavender makes it feel like a spa experience when applied.</li>
    <li> wonderful night cream-- nice texture, good body without being overly heavy. Also, I love the fragrance.  would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great for Dry Colorado weather. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin. Everybody thinks I&#x27;m 20 years younger than i am!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sleepwear for years and it is by far the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. It never disappoints. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for something better, but nothing compares. It glides on your skin and is super smooth; leaving your face soft in the morning. The lavender scent smells like something expensive you&#x27;d get in a special spa treatment. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you owe it to yourself to just once.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and live in a very dry apartment.  This Bioelements is like putting on rich cream, thick and feels awesome.  It hasn&#x27;t clogged my sensitive pores.  And so far has been nothing but good good good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use a lot because it so thick and creamy.  Just three or four dabs around the face and then work it in.  I&#x27;ve never been impressed with a night cream until this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; this product arrived on time.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Results were visible after the first week. My skin looked and felt better.Brings a glow to your skin that is noticed by others.</li>
    <li> This is a top of the line moisturizer full of goodies for your skin.  It has a wonderful, smooth texture, not too greasy, not too thick.  It absorbs into the skin leaving it soft and supple the next morning.  It has a light citrusy scent that is natural to the ingredients in it.  No fragrance is added.  I have oily and aging skin and this has been perfect for me.  No breakouts.  I didn&#x27;t find the Sleepwear for Oily Skin to be moisturizing enough.  Highly recommend this for any skin type.</li>
    <li> Tried using this and I really liked it, however it was a little thick for me even to use at night.  I prefer the Bioelements Absolute Moisture.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Makes a wonderful overnight creme.</li>
    <li> Hydrates skin without feeing too heavy or greasy love it!</li>
    <li> I am happy that I can purchase these face creams through Amazon.  It is the same thing I was buying through my salon, only much less expensive!  Great product!  Especially the night cream.  Keeps my face moist, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I adore this night cream! It delivers everything that it promises to do and your skin feels wonderful---even upon awakening, your skin feels dewy fresh. This is one of those products that you would list if someone asked you what you&#x27;d want if you were shipwrecked on an island. This product is great for women of all ages, but is particularly excellent for women  &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product on the market.  My face is so baby soft after using it. Don&#x27;t ever stop making it!!</li>
    <li> This one is very heavy and leaves my face looking and feeling greasy. I prefer the oil-free version.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and am always on the hunt for good creams that soothe my skin.  This one is rich without being greasy, and absorbs right away.</li>
    <li> ***BUYER BEWARE... SELLER AMAZZIA .. 1ST JAR AND 2ND JAR PURCHASED  HAVE  NOT BEEN THE REAL DEAL.. VERY STICKY AND DOES  NOT ABSORB INTO MY SKIN AT ALL.. I HAVE USE PRODUCT FOR 10 YEARS.... THESE ARE THE ONLY 2 JARS I PURCHASED FROM THIS SELLER....  I WILL NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN... ... ********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best face cream ever.. I use it morning and night.  A little goes a long way.. It feels fantastic and is at a great  price  from this seller.. The price changes from day to day... Not sure why.. That&#x27;s the one and only negative thing&lt;br /&gt;..****I have purchased 2 jars from seller AMAZZIA , NO WAY IS IT THE REAL  DEAL, CREAM IS VERY STICKY AND DOES NOT ABSORB INTO THE SKIN.. I HAVE USE THE BIOELEMENTS SLEEPWEAR FOR 10 YEARS ....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years through the winter months (whenever the heat is on) at night and use Crucial Moisture in the morning under my makeup.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  It&#x27;s a little heavy even for my dry skin during our very hot, humid summers so I use Bioelements Crucial Moisture both at night and in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have very very sensitive skin and this is the moisturizer that makes my skin smile.  I use it night and day and am constantly ordering it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my GO TO product for the evening+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have dry skin and especially so when transitioning seasons; this product is very hydrating and leaves your skin feeling exceptional when you wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I am sensitive to smelly things and this isn&#x27;t the best smelling lotion but the results far exceed the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend with highest regard.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my skin.  I have been using it for a few years and it is really great to put on at night.  Arrived very fast after I placed my order</li>
    <li> I really love all the Bioelements products, including this one. It is a little heavy so in the summers I dont use it every day. It is great in the winter though!</li>

    <li> Quick delivery. Product feels great on my skin at night</li>
    <li> I started using Sleepwear along with the Flash Foam Cleanser, Power Peptide and Sun Diffusing Protector.  After about 8 months a friend asked me what facial products I was using because she noticed a difference in my skin.  That&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Also cheaper price. It is organic recommend by a lady that gives me facials</li>
    <li> Not too heavy but delivers moisture and makes my skin look hydrated. I definitely recommend this night cream. I used to used La Prairie, which I absolutely loved but it got too pricey for me.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Bioelements Sleepwear. It is a fantastic night cream that improves the lokks and feel of your face.</li>
    <li> Clean smelling, feels good, came recommended by a gal who uses bioelements in her facials.</li>
