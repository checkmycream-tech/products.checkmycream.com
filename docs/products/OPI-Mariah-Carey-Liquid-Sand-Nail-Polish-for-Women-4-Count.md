      <li>Nice selection of colors.</li>
      <li>The texture is really nice and</li>
      <li>All liked it.</li>
      <li>The polish goes on very easily, and lasted longer than some of my &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; polishes.</li>
      <li>When you first apply, the color and texture are beautiful, but literally after just one day or so the material starts chipping and fading.</li>
      <li>The product comes with 4 nice colors that i have enjoyed.</li>
      <li>Liked them alot, I will be buying more of the liquid sand polishes</li>
      <li>You can leave it as the stand-alone textured style, which feels amazing, or gloss it up with a top coat.</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors, really sparkly grainy finish.</li>
      <li>(Again no base coat or top coat!)</li>
      <li>I love them all :)</li>
      <li>I love the colors</li>
      <li>Love the colors and the textured look.</li>
      <li>The best colors were the purple and red.</li>
      <li>If the brush worked better I would give it 4 stars.</li>
      <li>Probably looks better on longer nails vs. shorter ones.</li>
      <li>I love these mini bottles.</li>
      <li>A nice cheap way to try the liquid sands.</li>
      <li>Mariah Carey&#x27;s liquid sand christmas was WAY better than this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Stays on longer than shellac if you apply to acrylic nails and apply a gel top coat for protection.  </li>
      <li>Love the sparkles in the colors</li>
      <li>It could be a lot better</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my nails after wearing it.</li>
      <li>I Love OPI Liquid nail polish but not this set.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>but so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I tried to put Seche Vite over it to make it look better but ended up taking it off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>I love all these colors and they look cute..</li>
      <li>Just make sure you do two coats.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>

      <li>I love liquid sand nail polish by OPI</li>
      <li>OPI quality collections are my favorite for quality and are easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I love these and the mini are just the right size for my niece who wanted her own bottles</li>
      <li>This nail polish is my new favorite!!</li>
      <li>It flakes easily, use a good clear coat on top to secure the polish.</li>
      <li>Its okay, just not as exciting as I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Got them to enjoy with my daughter.</li>
      <li>It came fast and it was packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>My biggest issue with this polish is that if you want to keep the fun texture, you can&#x27;t wear a top</li>
      <li>It was cool to be able to try all four colors before investing in the full size bottle</li>
      <li>They are very tiny, but the perfect size for just trying out new things.</li>
      <li>Love the vibrant colours with the unique sandy finish with a touch of bling!</li>
      <li>and I intend on buying full sized bottles when they become available.</li>
      <li>There is no way you wouldn&#x27;t like the unique texture and colors.</li>
      <li>Originally tried out this nail polish when I got a mani/pedi at a salon.</li>
      <li>The mini pack is nice because you can try all four colors before investing in a larger bottle of your favorite color.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product, especially if you want to get a nice sampling of sand nail polish :)</li>
      <li>The liquid sand just gives the right amount of sparkle and is super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>You do need three to four coats to get a good appearance-- otherwise, the &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; bits end up looking nearly white, for some reason.  </li>
      <li>These nail polishes were bought as a trial before purchasing the full sized versions.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great set. All the shades are very nice, especially the impossible. A nice cheap way to try the liquid sands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super fun to have these on. They feel like &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; which is the texture they are going for, so you&#x27;ll get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> The bottles were a little smaller than one I had expected, but I love all of the colors. The liquid sand just gives the right amount of sparkle and is super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love the sparkles in the colors</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be worth what i paid. Tiny bottles and it didnt look that great. And its hard to get off</li>
    <li> The polish got to me very fast and I loved the matte colors. It was cool to be able to try all four colors before investing in the full size bottle</li>
    <li> OMG this nails polish sucked!  I love liquid sand nail polish by OPI but this stuff is really cheap crap!  The color dry on ugly and don&#x27;t look good at all.  Mariah Carey&#x27;s liquid sand christmas was WAY better than this stuff.  I mean NONE of them were good colors when they dry.  Just a shame :(</li>
    <li> Just Perfect! OPI has the perfect liquid sand polishes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and lumpy and hard to apply. I did not like the  texture. I Love OPI Liquid nail polish but not this set. It could be a lot better</li>
    <li> The reciever of this gift loved them. She loves to do her nails and is a big Mariah Carey fan.</li>
    <li> Two of the nail polish bottles arrived smashed with nail polish leaking all over.  The item was sent in a padded envelope.</li>
    <li> Such cute little bottles and packages. I love trying different polishes and with these small bottles I feel like I&#x27;m not going to waste them, since I keep buying polishes lol.</li>
    <li> It came quickly and it was exactly what I wanted.  I would recommend this to all of my friends and family</li>
    <li> These colors are so pretty! Very deep rich sparkly colors. Stays on longer than shellac if you apply to acrylic nails and apply a gel top coat for protection.  I am hard on my nails and its been 7 full days.. with the red color. I love em.</li>
    <li> Love these polishes! Was afraid to try but so glad I did. Easy to apply and a simply gorgeous look! *swoon* I&#x27;m in love. Every color is equally beautiful!</li>
    <li> All liked it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 10 year old daughter through a friends recommendation. She likes it. Nice small bottles. Just the right amount to use for her small fingers. Good price. Nice selection of colors.</li>
    <li> awesome selection... perfect size, great deal, really happy with what i received from the purchase i made]. great deal hgf</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, really sparkly grainy finish. The brush in the nail polish bottles is of poor quality and doesn&#x27;t go into the bottle very smoothly. It flakes easily, use a good clear coat on top to secure the polish. If the brush worked better I would give it 4 stars. Beautiful finish :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the sand trend and this was a great way to do it. I loved the colors and quality of the nail polish. It came fast and it was packaged nicely. I would recommend this product, especially if you want to get a nice sampling of sand nail polish :)</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, liquid sand sticks like glue.</li>
    <li> I prefer the petite size of nail lacquers so i can enjoy a larger variety of colors.  OPI quality collections are my favorite for quality and are easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is a bargain. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the colors BUT.....I painted my nails on Saturday but by Tuesday they were chipped. Not just some wear but big chips. Yes I did not primer, base coat, color and toap coat. They are fun colors just wish they would last a little longer.</li>
    <li> My biggest issue with this polish is that if you want to keep the fun texture, you can&#x27;t wear a top coat-- and then it&#x27;s quite prone to chipping.  I&#x27;ve worn the red (dries to a pink) and black/red polishes so far, and really enjoyed the look and feel of both of them.  It&#x27;s a quicker dry than most OPI, but longer than a matte.  You do need three to four coats to get a good appearance-- otherwise, the &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; bits end up looking nearly white, for some reason.  I&#x27;ll use up what I&#x27;ve got, and I would try future liquid sand polishes if they tinker with the formula, but I won&#x27;t buy more of this series after I run out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t estimate the size of the bottles because they are very small, like kids nail polish. At fist i wanted to return it because of that however I tried each color on my nails and it looks very nice and does appear sand like. I have tons of nail polish so i&#x27;m sure these tiny bottles will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> Nice stocking stuffer! Shipped fast. Great product. Nice sparkle colors!</li>
    <li> I do not like this polish at all.. Even when you put a clear coat over it, it looks like matte finish and it peeled off right after applying it. would not recommend this to anyone that wants a polish to have a shine to it...This is BLAH!!!</li>
    <li> Originally tried out this nail polish when I got a mani/pedi at a salon. I really liked how long it lasted without chipping. Lasted almost a week probably because it&#x27;s so thick from the texture of it. The mini pack is nice because you can try all four colors before investing in a larger bottle of your favorite color.</li>
    <li> First time using the liquid sand polishes. They are very pretty. Took some getting used to for the texture, but after a day or so I was used to it. And if you are prone to chipping, you can&#x27;t really tell it unless it is a big chip. Liked them alot, I will be buying more of the liquid sand polishes I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> This set was when I was curious about liquid sand. It lets you sample some really pretty colors. This is a really neat set to buy if you have never tried liquid sand or if you are unsure of what color to get. After I bought this set, I started adding these colors (full sized) to my vast nail polish collection!</li>
    <li> I love this item. They weren&#x27;t knifing when writing \\&quot; mini set\\&quot;. I love opi to begging with and the liquid sand is great. I love it</li>
    <li> The seller was great...the product not so much. Who wants to wear grit on their fingernails. Try again OPI, this was a miss.</li>
    <li> I love these and the mini are just the right size for my niece who wanted her own bottles (she&#x27;s 11).  The seller communicated very well and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy from them again!</li>
    <li> très bon effet sur les ongles !séchage rapide! que dire de plus ...un excellent produit que je conseille avec plaisir</li>
    <li> After seeing the swatches of this collection I HAD to have it. I am disappointed overall, this polish is extra sensitive to chipping and doesnt look how I envisioned &amp;#34;liquid sand&amp;#34; to look. Its okay, just not as exciting as I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a gift and waiting on Xmas to give it to them, so I did not try it. The polish came exactly as pictured and described in a timely matter and so far am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The sandy texture is a little thick on the nails, but the colors are pretty. Probably looks better on longer nails vs. shorter ones.</li>
    <li> I order these to sample the polish before I purchased the full size bottle I was amazed with the texture</li>
    <li> Great value. My daughter loved them.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  I love these little bottles.  A decent price for the name brand.  The bottles are small, but it&#x27;s a great way to try them out.</li>
    <li> I hated this nail polish! It really makes your nails feel like they are covered in sand paper. It&#x27;s also very hard to remove. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I do recommend these! Got them to enjoy with my daughter. Love the vibrant colours with the unique sandy finish with a touch of bling!</li>
    <li> Arrived with one bottle completely broken. Nail polish &amp; glass all over other bottles &amp; box. Such a mess could not use or return. Had to throw out. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- 1/24/13 after receiving my email they sent me a brand new box. understanding why I obviously couldn&#x27;t send the old one back. No questions asked. They also sent an email apologizing for what happened. Thanks! I love them all :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--G</li>
    <li> I love these colors! They dry matte for a very unique look. The blue one is my favorite, very vibrant. The only one I didn&#x27;t like was the purple one, it was kinda drab.</li>
    <li> like the look of the nailpolish, but a few of them didnt have that sand rough texture feel to them. but over all I like them</li>
    <li> SO I MUST SAY THIS PACKAGE ARRIVED WAY BEFORE THE TIME AMAZON SAID WHICH THAT WAS A PLUS!! HOWEVER I ONLY LIKE 2 OUT OF THE 4 NAIL POLISHES. THE BLUE AND PURPLE NAIL POLISHES ARE MY FAVORITE, THE OTHER 2 COLORS LOOK VERY CHILD LIKE AND ARE DULL.</li>
    <li> Bought a set for myself and one for my daughter for Christmas.  Great texture and colors.  Not as much texture as adding the beads to your nails, but not as much hassle and mess either!</li>
    <li> The nail polish was more like heavy glitter than liquid sand. I tried it with and without a topcoat, really didn&#x27;t like it either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped the product immediately and my rating has no reflection on the seller.</li>
    <li> A new texture to play with. It last a few days. You can&#x27;t put a clear coat on it.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy other colors</li>
    <li> These nail polishes were bought as a trial before purchasing the full sized versions. They are the longest wearing nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used and am totally in love with the Black and red sparkle colour &amp;#34; Stay the night&amp;#34;. Buy them!!!</li>
    <li> I love all of the colors and the texture is different and new. I will definitely buy the full size bottles for me and my mom.</li>
    <li> Out of curiosity, I wanted this set. My mother in law has the impossible, loved the shade, went looking for it, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in store. So, I bought the next best thing, a full bottle of magazine mouse cover, which is close in shade with the exception that it doesn&#x27;t have the stars from the impossible. This set of minis is great. Every single shade can be adjusted to whatever kind of manicure style you prefer.</li>
    <li> I ordered the set and couldn&#x27;t wait for them to arrive I was very disappointed when I realized the impossible(name of color) was different then the regular size bottle it has no stars in it. Not a happy customer :(</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the textured look. Can&#x27;t wait to find more colors since Spring is approaching. The black and purple are my fave. The red is a lil on the pink side to me I have tried two coats will have to see how three look. Two coats def make them look fuller</li>
    <li> I love these mini bottles. They were a perfect size to try it out-so you don&#x27;t spend the money on a large bottle and decide you don&#x27;t like it. But even if you did. There is no way you wouldn&#x27;t like the unique texture and colors. Just make sure you do two coats. It dries to fast!</li>
    <li> I love all these colors and they look cute..I just wish the bottles were a bit bigger, but I can always just get the regular size bottles later..I recommend for anyone who likes sparkles..</li>
    <li> very cute and perfect for weekend trips</li>
    <li> I ordered this sample pack to try out all the colors before purchasing a bigger bottle....all the colors are awesome and now I want them all!  The texture is really nice and the little bits of glitter make it even better.</li>
    <li> I have very thin nails that tend to bend and cause my nail polish to chip within hours of drying.  A friend of mine was wearing this polish and it looked like she had just had her nails done so I asked about it- turned out it was over a week since she painted them and only had done a couple touch ups.  I decided I needed to give it a shot and low and behold this polish stands up. The texture may not be for everyone, it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;liquid sand&amp;#34; for a reason- it&#x27;s not smooth by any means as it&#x27;s chock full of glitter. Taking off the polish requires just a bit more effort than a regular polish but with a professional grade remover (essentially pure acetone) it&#x27;s really not bad. For the price I paid it was well worth it and I intend on buying full sized bottles when they become available. This nail polish is my new favorite!!</li>
    <li> What a great set of nail polishes.  Gorgeous colors.  Very shiny and glittery.  They are hot.  The bottles are very small, but OPI polish goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and decided to wait a bit until I reviewed it. I wanted to REALLY give this Liquid Sand a try before publishing my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I must say I LOVE the texture of this nail polish! I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my nails after wearing it. It dries to a matte finish and the surface of the polish is really hard. And it really feels like sand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as the polish goes I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions on the package. The package says to use a base coat and 2 coats of Liquid Sand. I didn&#x27;t use a base coat. I only applied 2 coats of Liquid Sand on my nails. Perhaps around the 3rd day of wearing it I noticed the polish was chipping around the tips of my nails. Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t too pleased, but my hands also sweat profusely and I do warehouse work. I lift boxes and stock merchandise all day. My job also requires that I wear silicone work gloves, so those factors may have caused the nail polish to chip after only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned home and applied a 3rd coat of Liquid Sand on my nails. (Again no base coat or top coat!) I noticed the color of the polish REALLY stood out. The color was so vibrant on my nails even my coworkers noticed when I returned to work the next day. I got nothing but compliments on them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed the polish last MUCH longer without chipping! (Again mind you I do warehouse work and my hands sweat!) For nearly a week I enjoyed the vibrant color of Liquid Sand on my nails without any problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to those who are experiencing chipping and fading to use 3 coats of Liquid Sand without a base coat. That helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give Liquid Sand 4 out of 5 stars. I had to subtract a star because applying only 2 coats of Liquid Sand didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome polish! Good price! However two bottles got shattered during mailing process so only use blue n purple they are pretty tho!</li>
    <li> I really liked the nail polishes.The product comes with 4 nice colors that i have enjoyed. will purchase again when mines finish</li>
    <li> I did not receive the desired product.&lt;br /&gt;The product received is not what we saw on the screen.&lt;br /&gt;It is the dame brand, but a different product.</li>
    <li> The colors are beatiful! I didn&#x27;t know which one to pick so I went and got all the mini&#x27;s. When you first apply, the color and texture are beautiful, but literally after just one day or so the material starts chipping and fading. Other than that it&#x27;s nice for the price. The best colors were the purple and red.</li>
    <li> Not a bad item.  The minis are the typical OPI quality, but The Impossible lacks the cool star glitter I really wanted it for.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;m not even a nail-trend follower (I completely skipped the magnetic trend, and the bar glitter trend,although I do like matte finishes, which is relevant here).  But these Liquid Sand polishes from OPI - they&#x27;re AWESOME.  I am lucky to have a job where I can wear funky polishes, and I have gotten more compliments on these than any other polishes I&#x27;ve worn. The dark one in particular - Stay The Night - is a real stand-out.  Charcoal asphalt with hot-pink flecks of glitter.  Amazing! If you want to give them a try, this set of minis is the perfect way to do so.</li>
    <li> But I hated the texture. It&#x27;s goopy and hard to apply. And when it dries down it doesn&#x27;t look good. It looks like polish for a little girl. I tried to put Seche Vite over it to make it look better but ended up taking it off. Which was a pain also.</li>
    <li> Great colors by OPI...they are matte, sandy finish, but be aware, they are hard to remove. It takes some soaking in polish remover and I used a nail file to get the stubborn spots. Still great colors and adds a funky finish to your nails</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when these little bottles came in the mail. They are very tiny, but the perfect size for just trying out new things. The polish goes on very easily, and lasted longer than some of my &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; polishes. You can leave it as the stand-alone textured style, which feels amazing, or gloss it up with a top coat. Looks great either way!</li>
    <li> Liquid sand where have you been all my life! Colors are beautiful, quality of polish is, I think, the best OPI has put out, dries super fast and I Love Mariah! Ever since Vision of Love! I love Maiah what a beautiful voice!</li>
