      <li>The product arrived on time in great condition.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful item to have if you stand on your feet most of the day.  </li>
      <li>Lower priced than the mall but just as good.  </li>
      <li>product is good but the delivery service made me feel like as why did i order this product.....</li>
      <li>it was not as good that i was told and it is $100 over priced</li>
      <li>Doing good massage.</li>
      <li>I loved it for the 5 months that it worked...</li>
      <li>My computer time and date is good, so I&#x27;m assuming this is a problem on the Amazon side.)    </li>
      <li>I bought this Legs Beautician product hoping it would provide as good as a foot massage experience as the Brookstone model.  </li>
      <li>otherwise its just as good as brookstones( because i went and tried it again even after getting this one).</li>
      <li>it worked so good that we got another one for my daughter in law who works in the hospital,she loves her unit.</li>
      <li>It is good though for what it does.</li>
      <li>Good Massager Machine and good price, except for hig shipping cost $50.  </li>
      <li>You get hooked on these things as NOTHING else makes your feet and calfs feel so good.</li>
      <li>i find the product very good i would have liked it more if it did massge on calf as good as it did on foot</li>
      <li>this machine works great, i love it, use it almost everynite for my legs and feet</li>
      <li>However, I am very satisfied with the quality of the product.  </li>
      <li>I still love Amazon though!</li>
      <li>Anyone would love this!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>like he was doing me some kind of favor.</li>
      <li>It is always a shame when a seemingly good product is undone by one of its most inexpensive components.</li>
      <li>She liked it a lot when it worked.  </li>
      <li>Best done with socks on from our perspective, but 10-15 minutes with your feet and calves in this product and your feet will feel tingly and ready to go at it again.</li>
      <li>He is so excited and is very pleased with his gift!</li>
      <li>Based on this, it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s an effective piece of machinery.&lt;br</li>
      <li>From all the massagers and relaxing gadgets out there, this has been the one that I found most functional and effective.</li>
      <li>Worked great the first 4 months.  </li>
      <li>Great product and fast delivery!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong and effective.</li>
      <li>, the pressure points this massager applies increases my blood flow beautifly, eradicating most of my pain and leaves my feet feeling rested.       </li>
      <li>That, coupled with muscles weakened by M.S., causes me to often need foot massages-even when my husband isn&#x27;t available to give them!    </li>
      <li>This concept is lost on Magic Wholesale.</li>
      <li>Works better than advertised and is built like a tank.</li>
      <li>Thank you for your service:)</li>
      <li>I must say I was given the best possible service by every-one</li>
      <li>I love the kneading option, but cannot stand the vibration setting.</li>
      <li>Still, I&#x27;m glad I got it for her.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and I love using this machine.  </li>
      <li>I stand in place a lot of the time, so my feet and ankles are killing me most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT KEEP AWAY FROM MAGIC WHOLE-SELLERS AND MEGA WHOLESELLERS.</li>
      <li>I was really enjoying my massager.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this foot massager and within weeks most of my pain went away.  </li>
      <li>That aside, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>We just love it.</li>
      <li>It was working pretty good in the beginning but</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m extremly happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
      <li>It takes a little getting used to and you have to play around with foot positions to get what feels best for you, but once you get it figured out, you will love it.  </li>
      <li>You need to find a spot that it can be easily used but not in the way.</li>
      <li>This item worked fine for about 13 months then it died.  </li>
      <li>I tested the power supply transformer and it was fine.</li>
      <li>I have been using this foot massager for about a month now and still enjoy using it.  </li>
      <li>they did replace it free.</li>
      <li>It has manual and automatic settings that can range the massage from light to quite vigorous.</li>
      <li>My wife used it primarily and had used it almost every day for about 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t totally take the pain away but it does help in restoring my mobility until I&#x27;m able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
      <li>In my case that represents a significant percentage of the unit&#x27;s cost.</li>
      <li>Little noisy for me, but for its price it is very  good deal.</li>
      <li>Magic Whole is NOT one of those companies.</li>
      <li>It is every bit as good as the one selling at Better Image with half the price.  </li>
      <li>and I am sure I will be looking forward to make more purchases in future.  </li>
      <li>This product is great and works as well or better than the much more expensive Brookstone model.</li>
      <li>and I could not believe how fast it was delivered!!  </li>
      <li>i think it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times and it does feel nice massaging your legs but after having it for about a year, the ankle massager stopped working so the only part that was getting massaged were the calves.  </li>
      <li>It mostly has a kneading action in the calves and feet.</li>
      <li>It is just as powerful as Brookstone&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I liked it and use it almost every night, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking to buy.</li>
      <li>The massaging disks are powerful and seem to increase blood flow and the vibrating motion is heavenly.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool for the price.</li>
      <li>Adjustable to be strong or soft on the massage and vibration.    </li>
      <li>It can be very loud with a helicopter like sound.</li>
      <li>I was very very upset about it</li>
      <li>My sons&#x27; love it as well and use it daily.  </li>
      <li>It never fails to get a dreamy, relaxed look from anyone who&#x27;s using it.</li>
      <li>it took 3 months and many phone calls to finally get results.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;m switching my rating to 5 stars (up from 3) for the following reasons...</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;d add to this item is more pressure points on the arch, but I don&#x27;t count it as a flaw since I&#x27;d consider that a plus</li>
      <li>we&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 years and it has never failed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> we&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 years and it has never failed. It has manual and automatic settings that can range the massage from light to quite vigorous. Best done with socks on from our perspective, but 10-15 minutes with your feet and calves in this product and your feet will feel tingly and ready to go at it again. Great product - yes its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. High quality, durable, reliable...I could go on.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received a defective foot massager for which I had paid a heavy price of 250 dollars. Seller does not respond my calls. Foot massager is very heavy and will cost a lot to ship it back. I am still following up with both Amazon and Seller to see if my return shipping will be re-imbursed. Overall a very bad service. I am completely dissatisfied to receive a defective item and the hassles of return\\&quot;</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a less expensive version of Isqueeze, I&#x27;d recommend getting the Legs Beautician.  A great gift idea. Anyone would love this! The only thing I wish it had was have rollers underneath move up and down to massage the soles of the feet - I don&#x27;t think the Isqueeze has that as well. That aside, it&#x27;s fantastic! It never fails to get a dreamy, relaxed look from anyone who&#x27;s using it. This is feet and leg heaven, ladies and gentlemen.     The delivery took a week. Delivery time should&#x27;ve been shorter.  The company managed to pull through by delivering on the very day of the birthday party.  I was getting nervous. I had to keep following up. Now, all is well.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It is every bit as good as the one selling at Better Image with half the price.  I have been using this foot massager for about a month now and still enjoy using it.  The only complain is that there is no warranty information in the package.</li>
    <li> I am very active (mainly basketball and martial arts) and I started experiencing plantar fasciitis in both my feet.  I purchased this foot massager and within weeks most of my pain went away.  This allowed me to continue competing at a high level.  I routinely use the massager 3-4 times a week and my feet feel great.  My son also plays AAU basketball and he uses  it almost daily.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product............using it every day.  Makes my sore and tired feet feel great.  A little hard on the calves though</li>
    <li> Be aware of worst service!  My massager broke after 3 months of using.   It was working pretty good in the beginning but the squeezing mode  stopped working after awhile.  According to the seller the item has a 1yr warranty but he   wouldn&#x27;t pay for the shipping. I just went to the UPS store and  it would cost me about $77+packing about $103 and I called the seller to see if he can help me out with the shipping and his answer was flat NO with lots of screaming. He just wouldn&#x27;t hear my comments and complaints.    Worst customer service experience ever!!! and of course poorly made  product!!</li>
    <li> I bought the leg massager for my parents in early October and it malfunctioned in a month. I called Mega Wholesales for information about my options and the guy kept yelling at me to just return it for repair. They are based in California and I am 3000 miles away. Not only was he completely unprofessional, he said I only get 30 days after purchase to return it- like he was doing me some kind of favor. I thought the warranty was one year, but it&#x27;s hard to tell because warranty info was not included in the packaging. This completely sucks.     I still love Amazon though!</li>
    <li> I loved it for the 5 months that it worked... The power cord isn&#x27;t working and I cannot find a replacement! I have tried contacting Qlive and searching for the model number of the power cord. It is very disappointing...</li>
    <li> Was great while it lasted.    Power cord failed after 1 month of use, but was replaced by the company at no charge. Second cord lasted much longer through extra careful use. However, the device failed completely just short of 2 years, and it was a hassle trying to get the machine powered for almost an entire year prior to the end.    It is always a shame when a seemingly good product is undone by one of its most inexpensive components.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first on the price of this item as compared to those found at Brookstone, Sharper Image, etc.  However, I am very satisfied with the quality of the product.  It is comparable in every way to the more expensive feet massagers.    Great product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of years ago. It does help ease the tension and pain in feet after standing or walking for long periods. I do wish it had some roller massage action on the bottom. It mostly has a kneading action in the calves and feet. It is good though for what it does. It is very heavy and takes up room and is cumbersome to move around so if you don&#x27;t want to move it or see it when not in use, factor that in to your decision to buy it. It can be very loud with a helicopter like sound. I don&#x27;t use it every day but when the feet are really aching it does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit 4 months ago. It suddenly stopped working. Although it has a 1 year warranty, the caveat is you must pay for shipping to California. In my case that represents a significant percentage of the unit&#x27;s cost. Reputable companies I have dealt with in the past cover the return cost for defective merchandise. This concept is lost on Magic Wholesale. My advice is to spend a few dollars more and deal with a company that stands behind its&#x27; products and offers good customer service. Magic Whole is NOT one of those companies. Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a new massager for my brother who lives overseas..SAUDI ARABIA.   I must say I was given the best possible service by every-one and I had a great experience and I am sure I will be looking forward to make more purchases in future.  The product is excellent and I am possitive that \\&quot;HIM\\&quot; and his \\&quot;WIFE\\&quot; must be very happy.  Irfan</li>
    <li> I bought my legs beautician 4 years ago. The cord broke off on the back, (due to rubbing against the couch)I contacted Qlive by finding contact information on Amazon. I shipped the unit to them, they fixed it and mailed it right back and it&#x27;s still running GREAT!! I stand on my feet at least 6-10 hours a day on concrete floors, I use my massager every night. It has saved my feet and legs. Will be buying another for my future salon!</li>
    <li> product is good but the delivery service made me feel like as why did i order this product.....</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time.  Too bad Amazon didn&#x27;t sell it, bc the seller charges about $50.  My wife and I have been using it everyday since Feb 16, 2009.  So far it&#x27;s been great.  I hope that it keeps working for a very long time or forever.  Like the other reviewers&#x27; posts, there is no warranty information.  If it did and the seller at least had a 1 yr warranty with no additional shipping charges, I would give this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great massager.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Adjustable to be strong or soft on the massage and vibration.    My only concern is the lack of any warranty or repair information.  The device had nothing on where to get it repaired, or if it had a warranty at all.  Something this highly mechanical is going to have problems eventually, and I&#x27;d like to know that I can get it fixed.</li>
    <li> we had a shaky start when product came with no manual or cord. they sent cord after i emailed but still no manual or warrenty. otherwise its just as good as brookstones( because i went and tried it again even after getting this one). all in all i think it was worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is great and works as well or better than the much more expensive Brookstone model. Neither have much product support but my last Brookstone lasted for 2 years exactly. You get hooked on these things as NOTHING else makes your feet and calfs feel so good. But if you have chubby to fat calfs, don&#x27;t get it as it will feel like the jaws of death. At half the price of the Brookstone I can only say BUY it and see if it doesn&#x27;t do what it advertises to do. I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit for my wife when she was expecting our baby daughter, Isabella. It worked well for only 4 massages then it died completely. My wife contacted the seller with no luck. I tested the power supply transformer and it was fine. the problem was with the female power receptacle on the back of the unit or the circuit board itself or maybe both. they wanted to charge us $125.00 plus $67.00 charge to ship it to them. Keeping in mind that this only messaged my wife&#x27;s feet 4 times and then it just stopped for no apparent reason. this unit is in brand new condition cosmetically and it was never abused. This QLIVE has to change their name to QDEAD. please do not support this business. they are impossible to deal with and they never attempt to repair anything! $300.00 does not grow on trees but to the manufacturers it seems so because they just picked the hard earned dollars out of my pockets for pure junk that breaks easily. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT KEEP AWAY FROM MAGIC WHOLE-SELLERS AND MEGA WHOLESELLERS.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas gift and I could not believe how fast it was delivered!!  My husband loves this foot massager as does everyone else in the family!</li>
    <li> Doing good massage. Little noisy for me, but for its price it is very  good deal. &lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping too. I hope it will last longer than Brookstone. I&#x27;ll update my review later.</li>
    <li> Half the price of Brookestone Massager and same quality massage.   My legs and feet no longer ache.</li>
    <li> This foot &amp; calf massager is practically identical to the one sold at Brookstone for half the price. I got it for my wife for Christmas and she says it&#x27;s the best gift she&#x27;s ever received! The only drawback is the lack of warranty information. I suspect that if this thing breaks, I&#x27;m out of luck.</li>
    <li> Lower priced than the mall but just as good.  I have fallen arches (heel spurs &amp; bunions, too) and use this to massage my feet after prolonged standing.  This doesn&#x27;t totally take the pain away but it does help in restoring my mobility until I&#x27;m able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  It is tight on my wide calves but I figure they&#x27;ll just get a deeper massage.  Someone who isn&#x27;t able to lift heavy objects might want to put this on a dolly of some sort.</li>
    <li> Good Massager Machine and good price, except for hig shipping cost $50.  Machine works well.  I recommand to buy this massager.</li>
    <li> 1st of all, beware of the $50+ shipping and handling. The product appeared to be new inside packaging but the cord appeared to have been just thrown inside the box unwrapped. When I plugged the unit in, it went crazy making weird noises and started smoking. Needless to say, it&#x27;s being returned.</li>
    <li> If you are smart, you will order this.  Even if you are not smart, you will order this.  I come home and place my feet in the massager, and I feel like I&#x27;m walking on a cloud.</li>
    <li> shiped the next day, product as advertised.</li>
    <li> This foot and calf massager is great for those who are NOT ticklish! I love the kneading option, but cannot stand the vibration setting. However, my boyfriend loves it, especially after a good game of basketball!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much for writing long reviews, but it&#x27;s worth the money and it doesn&#x27;t dissapoint in the power department.</li>
    <li> the foot calf and ankle massager broke after only using it 3 times... I was very very upset about it</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful item to have if you stand on your feet most of the day.  It massages the legs, feet, and ankels and they feel wornderful after using the machine.  I would recommend this to anyone who stand up a lot during the day.</li>
    <li> A side effect of some medication I take is swollen feet. That, coupled with muscles weakened by M.S., causes me to often need foot massages-even when my husband isn&#x27;t available to give them!    This massager does everything it says it will. The massaging disks are powerful and seem to increase blood flow and the vibrating motion is heavenly.    The first machine I received did not work properly after a few days. I contacted the company and they sent a UPS pickup ticket for it. The only problem was that I had thrown away the box the machine had come in and didn&#x27;t have a box to ship it in. Since these massagers are not small, my husband had to take it to a UPS store and buy a box to return it in.    Once the shipping issue got resolved and the company received the defective machine, they promptly sent me another one.    This machine is heavy, so don&#x27;t plan on moving it often once you&#x27;ve got it placed. It&#x27;s not something you place in front of a chair and casually move aside. You need to find a spot that it can be easily used but not in the way.</li>
    <li> the isqueeze provided great comfort for my wifes tired feet and legs. it works fast and is used several times a week.     the isqueeze broke down after 8 months and i agree, customer service left a lot to be desired. it took 3 months and many phone calls to finally get results. they did replace it free. it worked so good that we got another one for my daughter in law who works in the hospital,she loves her unit.</li>
    <li> this machine works great, i love it, use it almost everynite for my legs and feet, It is some noisy but doesn&#x27;t effect the working of the machine. I would recommend to a friend. Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my dad for his birthday. He is an ER Doctor and is on his feet all day and night sometimes. He does turnarounds where he switches from days to nights and it just creates so much pain in his calves and feet. I researched online and found this. He is so excited and is very pleased with his gift! He said it works GREAT! Also, it adjusts to your size when you put your legs into it and weighs about 35 pounds.</li>
    <li> This unit is a must have for people that are on their feet all day long.  Works better than advertised and is built like a tank. I highly recommend this product and use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sitting here using this awesome massager as I type!  I have very tired achy feet almost daily from a foot condition that includes a bone spur.  I spend a lot of time on my feet which makes things worse, but since getting this massager about a month ago, it has helped me so much.  It really gets your blood to circulating and takes away a lot of my pain.  I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now!  I make myself sit down daily at least once or twice specifically to use this machine!  It takes a little getting used to and you have to play around with foot positions to get what feels best for you, but once you get it figured out, you will love it.  My sons&#x27; love it as well and use it daily.  There are several settings to change it up a bit also.</li>
    <li> We just love it. I get bad cramps in my legs and it really helps.  We also bought one for our daughter</li>
    <li> i find the product very good i would have liked it more if it did massge on calf as good as it did on foot</li>
    <li> it was not as good that i was told and it is $100 over priced</li>
    <li> I bought a new one ,it has been out of order in less than two months,because it&#x27;s a gift delivered to me from other city,&lt;br /&gt;hard to repair.</li>
    <li> Broke after only a few uses. Power cord we think, but hard to tell. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my feet all day at work. I stand in place a lot of the time, so my feet and ankles are killing me most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foot calf massager was well worth the money I spent on it. It relieves the pain and relaxes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your feet hurt, this will fix the problem.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m extremly happy with this product.  I have multiple sclerosis and I&#x27;m not able to do exercise much.  With that being the case my calf muscles have tightened up.  I use this product several times a day and it has helped my legs loosen up, actually I believe I can move around abit better. The product was shipped almost as soon as it was ordered.  The only problem I do have with this product (which is really no big deal) is my feet tend to move forward, to help with this problem I take a light throw and lay it over the machine prior to putting my legs/feet in.  This product is very well designed and does what it claims to do.  I don &#x27;t know what is going to happen when the warrenty expires but I feel I have gotten my money out of this thing aready.  I feel if it is taken care of and not allowed to be played with I feel it will last.  Hats off for a wonderful product,</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time in great condition.  It is just as powerful as Brookstone&#x27;s.  Thank you for your service:)</li>
    <li> From all the massagers and relaxing gadgets out there, this has been the one that I found most functional and effective. I&#x27;ve suffered lately of pain on my feet either from stress or just long walks, this massager has proved to be a good solution.       I´ve used it for 15 minutes either at night or morning and have felt my feet rejuvenated, the pressure points this massager applies increases my blood flow beautifly, eradicating most of my pain and leaves my feet feeling rested.       The only thing I&#x27;d add to this item is more pressure points on the arch, but I don&#x27;t count it as a flaw since I&#x27;d consider that a plus</li>
    <li> Feb. 09: Overall, I liked it and use it almost every night, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking to buy. The footbed only provides vibrations.  There&#x27;s no shiatsu component for the foot(just for the calves)which was a huge disappointment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan &#x27;11: Okay, I&#x27;m switching my rating to 5 stars (up from 3) for the following reasons...&lt;br /&gt;1. I (and often, my husband) have used this on an almost daily basis...we&#x27;ve become addicted without trying.  Based on this, it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s an effective piece of machinery.&lt;br /&gt;2. Despite almost daily use it&#x27;s held up for 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;3. I just tried the one at Brookstone for $360 and it&#x27;s nowhere near as good!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said...it still only vibrates at the soles of the feet and the shiatsu is just for the calves.</li>
    <li> It works great for me I use it every morning. No more problems with the Achilles&#x27; heel. If you have big calfs the calf massager Could be two firm</li>
    <li> We bought this for my dad since he has alot of leg pains.  I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times and it does feel nice massaging your legs but after having it for about a year, the ankle massager stopped working so the only part that was getting massaged were the calves.  Highly disappointed in that.  It&#x27;s also pretty heavy.</li>
    <li> I bought this Legs Beautician product hoping it would provide as good as a foot massage experience as the Brookstone model.  I have owned this product for about six weeks and thusfar have no regrets.  It is very relaxing and does what it is advertised to do.  Plus I didn&#x27;t spend $399 on it like Brookstone does on their model.</li>
    <li> Well, this is about half the price of the foot and calf massager they had in Brookstone and other stores that sell superfluous necessities. I purchased this as a gift back in July &#x27;08. The recipient loves it and uses it twice daily. So far, it&#x27;s been a dream for an elderly woman with diabetes.     The only con is the shipping, which is a bit high and was so before the gas hike.     If anything happens within the next year or so, I&#x27;ll update the review.    (Also, previewing this review, it reads that I&#x27;m writing it on May 10, &#x27;08. That&#x27;s incorrect. I&#x27;m writing this on Oct. 1, &#x27;08. My computer time and date is good, so I&#x27;m assuming this is a problem on the Amazon side.)    Addendum:  Went back for Christmas and tried it out. It&#x27;s pretty cool for the price. It should be noted, though, that the multiple settings are more like multiple speeds. It doesn&#x27;t offer different methods of massage, more just three different speeds and an optional vibration. Still, I&#x27;m glad I got it for her. It&#x27;s strong and effective.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife 5 months ago.  Worked great the first 4 months.  But power cord into back went bad.  Seems to be both a cord and connection problem.  Bigger problem -- No Warranty!  And No way to contact QLive.  Beware this product!  I wish I&#x27;d spent more for the Brookstone version - at least I could get that fixed.</li>
    <li> Worked great for awhile. .loved it but acting up..afraid it gonna lick up. Where to fix it?</li>
    <li> The product works great, but the only issue is that it is weak to the feet. But, over all family loves it.</li>
    <li> I was really enjoying my massager.  I wish it had a massage to go under the foot (it would just vibrate), but with such bad feet as I have, this was giving me a lot of relief.&lt;br /&gt;Then, it broke.  The vibration still works, but it seems the motor froze up on me.  I think it occurred just before the warranty expired, but I did not notice until just after it expired (but 10 days after it expired).  I emailed the company and they said it would cost $125 to get it fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Really?  Yes, the warranty is for one year, but this is a big ticket item (at least for me).&lt;br /&gt;If you make a product, there should NOT be an issue with freezing motors after 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could still use this, but am NOT laying out almost half the cost it originally was bought for to have it work for 1 more year.</li>
    <li> This item worked fine for about 13 months then it died.  My wife used it primarily and had used it almost every day for about 15 minutes.  She liked it a lot when it worked.  I painstakingly disassembled the unit to see if there was something I could fix but unfortunately I discovered the component that failed was the main drive motor.  the vibration motor still works but the massage motor died.  From what I could tell, it wasn&#x27;t built to last.  Also, the assembly of the unit was questionable.  They had a washer wedged under the plastic gearbox in an effort to correct a problem they had with the plastic molds.  Overall, the machine worked well for the 13 months that it functioned but I won&#x27;t be purchasing a new machine every year, instead I will find something else that lasts.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my in-laws.  Now we use it every time we go over. They have it out so that all their guests can try it and everyone does and everyone loves it.  The bottom vibrates the soles of your feet while the rest of the machine massages up the calf.  Everyone that&#x27;s tried it ranges from 5&#x27; to 6&#x27;5&amp;#34;.  Our friends who are tall (6&amp;#34; and over) enjoyed using the machine but their legs are so long that it didn&#x27;t reach very far up their calves.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and I love using this machine.  I&#x27;ve used it for 10 minutes or so and felt great.  Your legs might feel a little sore if you sit in it for too long.</li>
    <li> Find it too rough on my ankle area.  Even tried with leggings and it hurt too much</li>
