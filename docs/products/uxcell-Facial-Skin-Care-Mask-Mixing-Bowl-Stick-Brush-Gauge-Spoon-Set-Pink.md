      <li>/&gt;It takes a while to ship because it&#x27;s coming from China and has to go through customs, so if you need it quickly I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
      <li>Tip falls off all the time, buy super glue with this</li>
      <li>Brush head came off before the first use, cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>but I honestly forgot since I was using a small bowl of my own.</li>
      <li>&amp; it was exactly as described!</li>

      <li>Other reviewers have mentioned that the bowl is tiny, but if you are using it for the Aztec Healing Mask, it&#x27;s absolutely the perfect size.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the wait, especially at this price :)</li>
      <li>I recommended this to a friend when i first purchased it because we both do a lot of face masks but after receiving it, i told her not to buy</li>

      <li>the brush fibers started falling out after the first use.</li>
      <li>They still work ;-)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for mixing up facials, masks, etc,,,</li>
    <li> Received it today [April 21] did take a while to ship[coming from China] but I honestly forgot since I was using a small bowl of my own. I think it&#x27;s super cute, yes its small but it&#x27;s the perfect size to mix a one time face mask. Like myself I&#x27;m using the Aztec healing clay and u really don&#x27;t need a whole lot, litte goes a long way. The color is more of a hot pink instead of what the picture shows, but for the price I think it&#x27;s the perfect size. Not to bIG and bulky but can store easily.</li>
    <li> The little bowl, and spoons are fine, but it didn&#x27;t come with a brush, or a bigger spoon. I was looking forward to the brush because I got this for my face masks. Looks like I&#x27;ll have to get another brush elsewhere!</li>
    <li> A little on the expensive side but it is what it is.  It serves its purpose.  Love the color.  I would have rated higher if it was less money.</li>
    <li> I have used this little bowl countless times to make homemade masks and it has more than done its job. The brush is soft and gentle on the face, which is especially useful for those with sensitive skin (believe me, I know). The bowl is small, about the size of my palm. All of the spoons included do come in handy. At first, I did not plan on using them but they help when making DIY masks and dealing with specific measurements of ingredients. Great product! 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely flimsy. I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot for what I paid for it.  It serves the purpose m</li>
    <li> The bowl is ridiculously small. Looks like a bowl from a little girl&#x27;s toy set.  The whole set looks much bigger and nicer on the picture.</li>
    <li> Nothing more than dollar store crap. Quality is HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;Just use a paint brush and measuring glass bowl. Easy clean up and you&#x27;re not wasting money on this crap.</li>
    <li> Too small. Plastic spatula tool has sharp edges that scratch the skin. Brush end was missing. Bowl is about 1 cup size. Company did reimburse me for $1.00. Great concept though.</li>
    <li> I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND I SHOULD&#x27;VE KNOWN ITS POORLY MADE ITS FROM CHINA FOR GODS SAKE.</li>
    <li> This little set took forever to ship (like a month or so?) but arrived eventually and I&#x27;m extremely pleased. Very cute and perfect for any face masks etc :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t absolutely need it right away, get this. It&#x27;s worth the wait, especially at this price :)</li>
    <li> For the price, I suppose it is what it is. This to me seems like a dollar store item. The bowl is TINY. It&#x27;s almost a doll size bowl and measuring spoons. In fact, I think the measuring spoons will be given to my niece for just that purpose. The brush isn&#x27;t quality at all and I&#x27;m not sure it will hold up for any longer than a couple applications. It took almost a month to get to me as well. Over all, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle and the shipping was more than the product. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this. You can get a brush and a larger bowl at the dollar store. I was very disapointed in this product and the amount of time it took to be delivered.</li>
    <li> Okay, I will be the first to admit when I am wrong, and I was TOTALLY wrong about this product.  It took FOREVER to be delivered, but as soon as I contacted the seller, within two days it was in my mailbox.  I opened it, and could not WAIT to get on Amazon to bash this product, but once I began reading the reviews, in all honesty, I could not do that.  I tried it out first instead of going by ONLY what it looked like.  This is a GREAT product, and it is EXACTLY the right size for what it&#x27;s intended for.  I use it for my Aztek Benzonite Clay facials and I use the measuring spoons to measure just the right amounts of clay into the bowl, and then I mix it together with the Organic Apple Cider Vinegar.  I use the spatula to spread it all over my face and it keeps my fingers CLEAN and stops the clay from getting underneath my fingernails.  I use the brush to apply toner to my face afterward and it&#x27;s just PERFECT!!!  FIVE STARS , ) !</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft for applying mask and the measuring spoons help with mixing proportions.  Bowl rInses out easily</li>
    <li> love this for my masks that I can&#x27;t mix with metals. This kit has it all. The bowl is perfect size and the spoon is amazing the measuring cups are great. Only gripe it took a bit to arrive but overall good!</li>
    <li> This set is great, I use it every day. It&#x27;s excellent for combining ingredients to make natural facials; clean up is easy</li>
    <li> Small, practical and works well with all my homeade skin care treatments</li>
    <li> They were smaller than I thought but they do the job I needed, which is making facial masks</li>
    <li> Brush fell apart on the second use. I do like the other parts of it though and the spatula and spoons are useful for face masks and measuring. Was very disappointed that the brush hairs started coming out though and I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> If you do not like purchasing products from China, stay away from this! It came straight from China with Chinese writing on package and a customs receipt. It took forever to be delivered, and this is why. I did not know it was coming directly from China when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I finally used this yesterday and it was good to mix up a mask. Measuring spoons were good sizes. Tiny mixing bowl was good size for my small hands to hold and mix. The brush came broken once I took it out of the bag :-( so I could not use it.</li>
    <li> It seems like it was made from cheap items, but I don&#x27;t mind. I use it to mix my face masks and it does the job!</li>
    <li> I have to say everything is wonderful and easy to use expect the brush. It&#x27;s really cheap and mine fell apart like the second day, other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Its the perfect size for face masks and cleans up so easy! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who regularly does face masks.</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience. I got it right away &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to mix up and apply my masks. It works great for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are complaining about the size of the bowl. It will probably hold about half a cup, so unless you&#x27;re making up a batch of 40 facials, it should be plenty big. I mix mine up one at a time and there&#x27;s more than enough room even with aggressive stirring.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to ship because it&#x27;s coming from China and has to go through customs, so if you need it quickly I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the bowl to be as small as it is, but everything works great for what it&#x27;s meant for. I used it whenever I need to mix my clay mask. Mixing and putting the mask on used to be extremely annoying, but with this set it&#x27;s extremely simple!</li>
    <li> The perfect utensils for the Aztec Indian clay mask preparations! Only downside is the time it takes to arrive. Still I truly recommend it.</li>
    <li> You can buy a better quality product from the dollor store! Let me put this in perspective, THE BOWL CAN FIT IN THE PALM OF MY HAND and im a small girl!&lt;br /&gt;Its a mini set with mini little spoons that looks like it was taken from a kids mini doll set. It was packaged like a cheap dollor store item.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY KEEP SHOPPING! IT TOOK FOREVERRRR TO RECIVE&lt;br /&gt;AND ITS JUNK!</li>
    <li> This is so great to mix your liquid vitamins and oils for your face and hair. Its the perfect size. Love it</li>
    <li> This appliances set is very useful. I like the quality of material and color. Price also is good. I will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this for mixing my Clay Masks and its perfect! The bowl is actually about the size of your hand and it is the perfect size for masks.  The brush is actually surprisingly soft so I do use it on my face.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t met my expectation it was very small and poor quality also it took more than month to arrive , not worthing waiting it</li>
    <li> The bowl is cute along with the spoons and brush! Perfect for my home made masks! I love these! They are so useful! The brush is great too.. Helps with the application of my masks! Definitely worth the buy! :)</li>
    <li> Item came in  packaging that was sticky, with the inside of the packaging was the same. the products had small greyish black particles. this item may not have been used, but it definitely has been tried on. It&#x27;s cheaply made. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom. She mixes her Aztec Secrets mask with Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar. She stated the bowl and brush are easy to clean after use.</li>
    <li> This little set is perfect! Other reviewers have mentioned that the bowl is tiny, but if you are using it for the Aztec Healing Mask, it&#x27;s absolutely the perfect size.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and it has really come in handy and has held up wonderfully!  It&#x27;s really cute, too. :)</li>
    <li> This bowl is the right size for a face mask. And I use another one for holding paint for my craft projects too.</li>
    <li> Very, very, very small, looks like something that belongs in a dollhouse or something a child would play with, with their dolls.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! I use it for my Aztec secret Indian clay mask, which can&#x27;t touch metal. It works and is actually good quality.</li>
    <li> The shipping took forever - well no wonder since it&#x27;s coming from China, but the bowl is way smaller than what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this bowl its just the right size for my face and easy to clean up. The spoons are perfect for measurements but i havent used the brush yet</li>
    <li> Very small, but useful. Came faster than I thought. I use the brush to apply my masks to my face more efficiently than just my hand.</li>
    <li> This product arrived to me 4 weeks early, also it was packaged nicely. All the part of the kit are well put together and they work well. The bowl is a nice small bowl and makes it so you don&#x27;t mix too much product for your face. the  measuring spoons, brush, and mixer also work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> love the color.  be prepared for the bowl to be smaller than you expect but it does the job so it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Decent little set.  Plastic is very thin; but for the price worth. It does take awhile to get to you.  I use mine To mix my nakeup: easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I can have something to mix my face masques in and it definitely serves the purpose! The shipping and packaging was also nice, it came within the date stated. It is very small but it is very resourceful. If you are looking for something to mix face masques or hair deep conditioning masques, this does the job :)</li>
    <li> Great tool to have for your at home beauty facial treatments.</li>
    <li> For the price the quality of this is expected, but the picture really makes it look so much better than it is. I recommended this to a friend when i first purchased it because we both do a lot of face masks but after receiving it, i told her not to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> received shattered a month later.</li>
    <li> Besides shipping taking a LONG time to arrive, this is a great little set for the apple cider vinegar and aztec healing clay mask I wear 2-3 times a week. Quality is meh, but the mask leaves the brushes stiff after washing anyways.</li>
    <li> This item is a POS to sum it up, much rather using kitchen utensils. The shipping took literally forever, would&#x27;ve been alright if the product was worth it but it isn&#x27;t. TINY TINY TINY BOWL, not even the same as the picture, If I could rate it negative I would.&lt;br /&gt;Very Disappointing, was really expecting more out of it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself. I enjoy mixing my homemade mask with this. The only reason why I gave it a 4 star and not 5 is because its cheaply made which I already expected and it took months for it to get deliver. But it is really cute :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great set but not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is smaller than I thought. But it works well.</li>
    <li> Tip falls off all the time, buy super glue with this</li>
    <li> It does what it says is does, I would recommend it to all my friends, it was cheap cost! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Cute bowl, perfect for making 1 mask, anymore than 1 and you should get a bigger bowl</li>
    <li> what can I say it is what it is</li>
    <li> my wife loves these no complaints so far better than others she had bought on a beauty supply store for double the money.</li>
    <li> The brush was missing</li>
    <li> It is small and convenient to make the clay facial mask. Bowl is the right size, not too big or small. Added measuring and mixing utensils are very useful. I don&#x27;t really see the point of the brush because it will have to replaced soon if you plan on using it. For those who that cares about the color of the product, it is the same as seen in the picture shown. Good for the money and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> This mask bowl is perfect for applying make-up generously to your face. It has a variety of tools that assist the user in putting on make-up.</li>
    <li> Ok so I def thought this was going to be bigger than what I received. It reminded me of kids play toys but it did the job I needed it to do, I guess I thought the bowl would be bigger but like I said it doss what I need it to do and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Shipping was slow but it did come from China and it was free. I had order it and forgot about it and then like 3 weeks later I was like ummm wha&#x27;ts this? and bang! It was like a surprise for myself. haha! Everything works great. The bowl is small but the perfect size to make 1-2 masks. I love the measuring cups that come with it, it makes my mask more precise and help it feel perfect.</li>
    <li> Perfect size a little dirty when I received it but nothing I couldn&#x27;t get off. Super small bowl but perfect for one face mask</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to mix the clay with water. It is the perfect size. Smaller than we thought it would be, but ended up being more than enough. I read other reviews that said it was small, but it still ended up being smaller than we imagined.</li>
    <li> the brush fibers started falling out after the first use.</li>
    <li> Bought this set at the same time I bought a clay face mask mix. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t want to try a new clay mask mix with the bowls I have now, and stumbled across this little set. It is perfect for mixing and applying face masks. The bowl is small enough to comfortably hold while applying a face mask, the flat spoon thing is awesome for mixing, and the brush allows you to paint your face without getting your hands covered in whatever you&#x27;re using. Plus, you don&#x27;t have to potentially ruin more expensive items you already have lying around! This set even comes with matching measuring spoons which came in handy as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend this set. It is cheap and it gets the job done. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the materials are obviously very cheap - which I completely expected and am fine with for the price I paid. They still work ;-)</li>
    <li> It was not what i thought. I should have paid a little more attention to it. The plastic is firm and not at bendable that I would have liked. Oh well, still does the job.</li>
    <li> Brush head came off before the first use, cheap plastic. Only reason that I gave it three stars is because it was a cheap and I should&#x27;ve known better.</li>
    <li> This little stuff is perfect and very useful in many ways. Highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars if the brush wasn&#x27;t so terrible BUT you get what you pay for. I use the bowl, spatula and scoops every time I mix up a mask, really helps with not making too much. Really like this product.</li>
