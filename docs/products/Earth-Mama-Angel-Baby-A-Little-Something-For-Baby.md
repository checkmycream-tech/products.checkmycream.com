<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great way to try the EMAB brand. The bottom balm and massage oil are exceptionally good products! I&#x27;ve used them every day with cloth diapers/wipes and they keep my daughters skin moisturized and protected. The soap and lotion are lovely if you like citrus scents, but my baby seems irritated when I use them on very sensitive skin (I suspect this is because orange is acidic) so I don&#x27;t recommend those for daily use. I&#x27;ve had no other problems otherwise. Definitely no harmful chemicals to worry about.    Overall, I think this product is an excellent small gift for any parent-to-be or caregiver. It&#x27;s difficult to find ingredients this good in products these days.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little more &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; than I was hoping for, but this is why I got sample sizes!</li>
    <li> Loooove that Amazon carries this brand.  I send these to all my expectant mama friends and family.</li>
    <li> I was happy to have found the travel size of these.  I don&#x27;t really ever use the bottom balm, and have never used the oil, but it&#x27;s been nice to have the small sizes of the body wash and lotion for traveling.  It has a nice orange scent.  If your not into the small sizes, just order the wash and lotion separately though.</li>
    <li> The best gift for a new baby</li>
    <li> This little kit has most of the toiletry essentials needed while traveling for a baby--the shampoo/body wash, body oil, body lotion, and diaper rash ointment (this can also be used for scrapes and other ailments).  I like that the travel size is small but has plenty of what you need, and I like the fact that the ingredients are pure and natural.</li>
    <li> My son has ezcema and its so hard finding products without fragrance and or alcohol in the ingredients! Been using these for a week now and have seen zero breakouts! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The only baby shampoo/oil/lotion/bottom balm I will use on my babies, ever.&lt;br /&gt;I could not recommend a baby item more. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And the smell is incredible!)</li>
    <li> I am sure this is an excellent product for many people! Unfortunately my baby had a reaction to it. She started getting a rash after using the lotion.</li>
    <li> Safe ingredient. Love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the body wash on my 2 month old for the last month and the bottom balm and oil since he was a few weeks old and we love it.  The bottom balm smells wonderful and even though he hasn&#x27;t had any rashes yet I put it on him every week or so where the diaper touches his skin to prevent irritation.  The oil I use for massages after his baths and the body wash smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Wonderful little set. I&#x27;d heard great things about EMAB so wanted to try their products.&lt;br /&gt;This set was perfect &amp; a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Loved all of the products particularly the lotion, smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect travel or sample kit if you like Earth Mama Angel Baby. The only downside is the soap goes much quicker than the other products.</li>
    <li> Travel size of everything I need!  This is great because I really wanted healthy products for my baby and I had purchased most of these in a larger size.  Now I have everything I need on the go- something we do frequently.  What I killer deal for a little bit of everything.  I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when mine run out!</li>
    <li> Love this little kit to gift to new mas to introduce them to these safe products for baby! I often include some nipple butter or tea for the mama as well.</li>
    <li> I used this when I had my babies and loved it. Got it as a gift for a dear friend.</li>
    <li> it is perfect and my daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after being introduced to earth mamas products at my hospital. I purchased their nipple butter after having my son and loved it so much I started ordering their products. This box comes with everything you need for baby&#x27;s skin and it lasts a while! I had it for a few months before I needed to order more wash. Their products are good for your baby&#x27;s skin, non toxic, and better than any baby products than I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I liked most of the products included in the kit. The bottom balm does not smell great. What&#x27;s worse- the baby oil got bad really quickly and started smelling awful.</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy a bigger size of the massage oil, it&#x27;s fantastic.  All the other items are also great, just as one would expect from Earth Mama</li>
    <li> This kit was my intro to EMAB and I love every piece!  I ended up purchasing larger of each item and these are now part of our travel kit.  I will also say, the bottom cream is great for any boo boo and works well with cloth diapers.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The smell is great and the lotion is very light. My baby had a lot of dry patches and they cleared up after a few uses with the wash and lotion. I had tried all kinds of other products too, but this stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> I love EMAB products.. they smell and work great, and they get a 0 rating (that&#x27;s the best) from the Environmental Working Group based on harmful chemicals used in their products, so you know they&#x27;re safe for your baby. I love them, but I hate to get preachy with friends who have newborns, so I like to give this sampler instead. It&#x27;s the perfect way to introduce new mama&#x27;s to a safe baby product!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who was trying to go more natural with her baby products. I have used earth mama products for about a year now and I&#x27;m so happy with them and knowing my babies aren&#x27;t being bathed in chemicals! The kit is nicely put together and the perfect starter gift for anyone looking for a more natural way to take care of baby or their self!</li>
    <li> Worked great for my little one&#x27;s sensitive skin.  He was breaking out from the big name brand stuff &amp; after looking at the ingredients I see why.  This company has mostly all natural ingredients &amp; that&#x27;s what I want on my baby&#x27;s skin.  Your skin absorbs everything you put on it- it&#x27;s the largest organ.  This Baby kit is great, you can sample the product without spending a ton off money.  I use the oil on my face in the winter- it helps moisturize without clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> I marked this down on my baby-registry (amazon of course!!!&amp;#60;-- love their registry). My MIL got it for me and took set with us to hospital when delivering my first child. MLO was born well past her due date and was born with scaly dried out skin. Her skin was actually cracking: bloody &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; marks on her chest and painful looking hands and feet with cracking skin. I used the lotion on her (which BTW made her smell like orange cookies). Her skin healed up properly before we even left the hospital (4 days later...due to c-section protocol.) Even the hospital staff took notice and asked what I was using, and added she smells delicious (not overwhelming at all..and I was caking on the lotion!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diaper cream is fantastic...we use it daily to the very day (she is now 5m old). She never had a red tushy.  We also love the shampoo/ body wash. Super easy to use and very convenient to use the pump, so you can maneuver baby in one hand and wash her with the other safely. (we use the puj flyte tub to make things easier)&lt;br /&gt;Have not used the massage oil yet...but I am certain it will come handy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most everything we used lasted about a month or two despite their tiny looking size.&lt;br /&gt;I still have some of the lotion left as her skin healed up so nicely I only use it when the weather dries her skin out too much. Our pediatrician complimented her gorgeous skin, and heaven knows that is not how she arrived. I  could not be happier with this gift set, and can only highly recommend it to all expecting moms.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my diaper bag since I wanted a smaller size of the big ones I had ordered...This is seriously a small set, though. Definitely suitable only for your diaper bag or if you are traveling, not for use at home. But my plan is to refill the small containers, anyway, so I suppose it&#x27;s not that big of a deal; I was just surprised by how small everything was.</li>
    <li> This is my go to gift for baby showers. I love the earth mama angel baby products and this is a great way to give a mama to a sample of what the company has. The baby soap is the only soap I will use on my little ones and the bottom balm is the only rash cream that I have gotten to work on my two year old&#x27;s sometimes very stubborn diaper rash. It is also worth noting that the bottom balm is safe for cloth diapers. I love know that there are products out there that are full of chemicals for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Love this product, however the small jar of ointment was not in the package.</li>
    <li> Earth Mama Angel Baby a Little Something for Baby Kit,good，i like it&lt;br /&gt;Earth Mama Angel Baby a Little Something for Baby Kit,good，i like it</li>
    <li> This brand is the best ever. All organic and natural, and the smell is amazing. All the products are great and I have purchased the lotion, wash/shampoo, and bottom balm all in larger sizes. This is a great gift for a new baby!</li>
    <li> Love all products from earth mama angrlrl baby. They use all natural and organic ingredients which they deserve 5 star for that. I also likr the smell of their products and lavander is my favorite.  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This is too small&lt;br /&gt;It also presents a shame</li>
    <li> I found angel baby by accident after trying over 30 products for my older son when he was a baby..&lt;br /&gt;It works like magic on diaper rash and even helps rashes you need a prescription for!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my younger son faithfully since Day 1 and he has never had a rash.  Unlike my first kid, poor guy had some bad rashes before I found this stuff!</li>
    <li> I really like it, especially the diaper balm. It has a menthol-type smell.</li>
    <li> Great little sampler to test out great products. Love the body wash (though I wish it was tear free) and the lotion...it smells so good!</li>
    <li> This is a great little gift for that granola momma. It smells delicious. I used this on my son and then used the salve on my eczema. works fantastic.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend whose baby is coming soon, because I love this brand. I have the bottom balm and shampoo for my baby, and I think those work wonderfully. The bottom balm fixed rash after only 1 to 2 applies, while the shampoo is safe for baby and easy to wash away. EWG rates this brand for 0, which is the best. Have already bought the lotion for my baby, which is on the way, and I can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Product design humane, quality and price amount, suitable for children. Beautifully packaged, safe to use.Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Product design humane, quality and price amount, suitable for children. Beautifully packaged, safe to use. Children very much.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my aunts baby shower, I love how its organic and great for cloth diapering. WIll be purchasing some for my own newborn. :)</li>
    <li> I love Earth Mama products and actually put this on Subscribe and Save so I can keep my daughter&#x27;s diaper bag stocked with smaller sizes and continually have a supply to give for baby showers! The scent is awesome and I trust the brand and ingredients.</li>
    <li> I LOVE all of the products in this bundle! The lotion smells like an orange dreamsicle - so yummy! And it actually works, too. The bottom balm works in no time at all and hasn&#x27;t affected my cloth diapers or wipes. I use the oil in my cloth wipe solution - great. And the wash smells delicious, too! My youngest has SUPER sensitive skin and she does fine with all of this. I give this bundle as a gift whenever I can, too! I can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
    <li> I like everything in the box.The smell of shampoo is perfect. The oil and lotion makes body very smooth. I also recommend to many of my friends.</li>
    <li> do not ruin your babies skin they smell horrible, causes break outs. the bottom cream is good for yeast infections but can not be used as a diaper cream. these products sting and stink. your baby deserves much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this set before my baby was born and now I buy it for all my new mom friends. I trust the ingredients and the scents are lovely. I use the bottom balm as it is safe for cloth diapers. Love this company and it&#x27;s mission.</li>
    <li> I got this to try out Earth Mama Angel Baby products.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lovely gift set! Smells pleasant with a light scent. Baby loves the massage oil and lotion. Great to use for traveling as it&#x27;s all in small bottles.</li>
    <li> This was another present I ordered for my sister, for her baby shower. Great price because just one of those little bottles runs $10-$15! Came quick &amp; exactly how it looks. She loves Earth Mama Angel Baby &amp; these products are perfect for a baby shower gift!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these products! I wanted to sample them before I purchased a larger bottle. Very happy with all of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this right before I had my first baby. We have yet to use the diaper cream, but only because I haven&#x27;t run out of what I&#x27;ve currently got open. I like ho the shampoo is dispensed, as a foam, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell. I found that after I washed my baby&#x27;s hair with this it smelled like baby barf. The lotion and oil however I used every day until she was 12 weeks old. Both are great for baby massage, which was our night time ritual the entire 12 weeks. My only wish is that the oil was lavender scented, great for calming baby.</li>
    <li> Love all Earth Mama Angel products, I do wish the shampoo/body wash was tear free but other than that we love this product. We bought this while still pregnant trying to figure out which products to use for our newborn, as it was not tear free we did not use right away after baby was born but instead used california baby (which we also love) my baby developed dry scalp (which is normal in newborns) and we added coconut oil and kept washing his hair with califonia baby shampoo, after a week or so (maybe a little longer) I decided to give this one a try and by the next day the dry scalp was almost gone.. within 2 washes it was all gone and I realized  by being careful soap would not go in his eyes.. now that he is much older it is a bit harder to keep out of this eyes as he wiggles so much but we love this product and the EWG rating so we will continue to purchase this products.&lt;br /&gt;Love the lotion as well as the baby oil.. We usually  apply baby oil then lotion after each bath and it leaves skin so soft and smooth our baby smells good all day.</li>
    <li> Had my daughter early and this arrived just on time. The scent is wonderful and different so it makes it even more awesome. Bae said baby smell like orange and creme Popsicles lol anyways only four stars because the oil came with a pump top. Overall I love it and will be purchasing more, especially the lotion</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful intro kit to Earth Mama Angel Baby toiletries for baby.  It&#x27;s great for travel and all of the products are wonderful.  The soap is great because is comes with a foaming bottle, which makes the soap go farther.  The diaper salve is great for cloth diapers.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the orange smell.  I wish the travel kit had the lavender smelling products.  I have tried a lot of baby products and these are my favorites.  I hate the smell of the Burt&#x27;s Bees baby products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Mamas. The baby bottom balm is especially awesome. Not only good for tushies and diaper rash prevention (or treatment as needed), but also is great as a balm on &#x27;owies&#x27;. Heals them up quickly and smells so good!</li>
    <li> Very happy with all the products!</li>
    <li> We got this as an add on the other day and come to found out, we really needed it.  Not for us, but for a baby shower we attended the other day.  The packaging is the perfect size for a nice little bag and what it comes with is a nice assortments of things for your future baby.  The Angel Baby Shampoo and Body Wash, Angel Baby Bottom Balm, Angel Baby Lotion, and Angel Baby Oil all were a HIT with the future mom to be.  Also, the size of each product is perfect, so just in case they don&#x27;t like it, which will never happen, they are not stuck with a huge amount.</li>
    <li> Really great product. Loved every item in this gift set and its a great way to test each item to see what u like</li>
    <li> I loved all the products specially the shampoo it has a nice smell and lasts for months.</li>
    <li> Bought this sample kit to try out this product. I loved it all, especially the diaper rash balm. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> love the scent!! Great baby shower gift. Packaged well and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Love EMAB! Noticing lots of people rating lower because the shampoo is not tear free. Just a small tip...The ingredient in tear free formulas is actually a chemical numbing agent. Probably not the best thing to be getting into babys eyes.</li>
    <li> I kept one and gave one for gift, great product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good gift for my little baby</li>
    <li> I always give this as a gift when I have friends who are expecting. It&#x27;s a much better price here than I have seen in stores.</li>
    <li> This baby kit is great, and priced much cheaper than from other sources.  However, the sizes are rather small.  I would recommend purchasing full sized items, I think it would save money in the long run.  The bottom balm is amazing, my son has very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t take much for him to get a rash.  He also had a food allergy that was causing acidic bowl movements that left blistering, the bottom balm would soothe and heal it within 24 hours, it was the only thing that actually worked to do both quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion and wash are both great as well, they smell lovely, the citrus scent is very light and pleasant.  Castile soap does a great job cleansing, just don&#x27;t let it get in your little ones eyes!  The oil is great that is sprays on and its good for a relaxing, after bath massage.  I am not too crazy about its scent, but it could be worse.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the products are great, just very small in size.</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this little kit and it introduced me to the Angel Baby line and I fell in love.  These are great travel sizes and last a long time.  Plus the products are awesome.  I ended up buying full sizes of all of them.</li>
    <li> I love all the products in this kit and have purchased the full sizes.  My favorite is the bottom balm, my son was having a mild reoccurring diaper rash and this ointment took care of it and keeps his bottom smooth and rash free. It&#x27;s also not thick and sticky like some other rash ointments. It goes on oily and absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
    <li> I got my item today three days earlier than the estimated delivery date which was awesome! Ive been using aveeno baby by Johnson and Johnson on my baby cuz I didn&#x27;t know any better. I was wat hing the news last week and they said that aveeno baby wash and other Johnson and Johnson baby products have THC!!!! Like omfg!!! Who would put that compound found in marijuana on baby products!!!! Johnson and Johnson is the freaking devil!!!! Thank goodness I did some research and found this beautiful healthy non toxic baby products by earth mama angel baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to start using it and keep my baby safe from those toxic chemicals by Johnson Johnson products!!!</li>
    <li> Gave my daughter a rash and its NOT tear free! There are other natural options that are tear free so go with those!</li>
    <li> The best baby skincare products ever used. Better than California baby, Aveeno, burt&#x27;s bee in my mind.</li>
    <li> This and Shea Moisture products are my very favorite baby products! Well to be honest, I use these baby products on my entire family, myself included! The baby lotion, orange vanilla, smells like a divine orange creamsicle! The baby bottom balm is the whole reason I originally bought the bundle and I&#x27;m glad that that product (which is great for diaper rashes and can be used with cloth diapers!) was the gateway to Earth Mama Angel Baby products because I just LOVE using this stuff!</li>
    <li> Seems to be handy when I go traveling I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think it would be great as a gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a tree hugger per se but when I became pregnant I started researching and learning about safe products for my baby. My research lead me to this company. I love this sampler pack, because I was looking for a product that WORKS and is safe, this is it and it smells good not over powering (except for the massage oil which is fragrance free). The only product i wasn&#x27;t into was the diaper cream but that&#x27;s just personal preference. It&#x27;s not tear free so I gave it 4 stars. I use lafe&#x27;s to wash my baby s hair and face.</li>
    <li> Much too scented for a newborns sensitive skin! Even if it is just citrus and other natural things, taciturn is acidic and probably not good for young skin. My little one started having skin issues shortly after one use of this stuff, coincidence maybe, maybe not.</li>
    <li> I love the products, especially the diaper rash ointment!  LOVE the smell and works great.  Also love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural for my baby</li>
    <li> The absolute only thing I use on my baby since birth! I give it away at every baby shower and this size is perfect for traveling. Smells great and totally works!</li>
    <li> I got this to go into a baby basket I&#x27;m making and this will go nicely in it. I hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> recomment a lot for baby, espcial the baby oil. I use it to my baby after shower, this make her skin very smoothy.</li>
    <li> This little kit is a great gift for a new baby. The kit is affordable and all the products smell great and are all natural. I use the baby oil on my little one after he gets out of the shower and it leaves his skin very soft.  The lotion goes on great too. The only thing you have to be careful with is the shampoo. It&#x27;s not a no-tears formula so you don&#x27;t want to get it in babys eyes. My baby started getting cradle cap so I had to stop using it. I might steal it for my hair! Last but not least, the bottom balm is cloth-diaper safe. It&#x27;s a nice little kit for a diaper bag.</li>
    <li> Love the products! I&#x27;m not due for another three months and had to try them out on my toddlers :) They smell and feel great, only complaint would be the dispensers on the bottles were difficult.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this kit.  It&#x27;s perfect for just trying out to see before you buy a big thing of baby wash, shampoo, or oil.  I LOVE the shampoo and lotion.  I also bought a bigger jar of the butt balm.  These products are great and I never feel bad using all natural products on my baby.  Plus she just smells great after using them.  The shampoo and lotion smell like sweet orange to me.</li>
    <li> Received my products on time which was very important as they were part of a Baby Shower Gift.  The mom-to-be loved it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Must buy for any new mom, new baby.</li>
    <li> All wonderful products. Great EWG rating. The vanilla mandarin has a great scent that is not harmful to infant boys.</li>
    <li> I love the products, they have a pretty good lemony smell to them. However, if your looking for something that&#x27;s going to last this is not it. Although even the soap seems to go far (by the way it&#x27;s foam) these are all teeny tiny. That is my fault for not looking at the sizes and in all honestly it&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me, but I was shocked considering the hefty price that it normally costs.. thankfully I got it on sale. Aside from that these are pretty good products and for an all natural soap, lotion, oil and rash oil against your baby&#x27;s skin I would say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells like an orange dreamsicle - so yummy! And it actually works, too. The bottom balm works in no time at all and hasn&#x27;t affected my cloth diapers or wipes. I use the oil in my cloth wipe solution - great. And the wash smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I chose to include this in a gift basket I made for a girlfriend. Earth Mama Angel Baby products are made all natural and safe so I know when she tries these products on her new little guy, she&#x27;ll be hooked like I was. She absolutely loved this kit.</li>
    <li> Ultimate shower gift that includes travel sized all natural Shampoo &amp; Body Wash, Bottom Balm, Lotion and Oil. Zero toxins and wonderful for baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this brand and the products in this line.  We keep the bottom balm in two locations in our house and in the diaper bag.  I use the wash on both of my children and as a solution for our cloth wipes.  The lotion makes a great hand cream as well as a body lotion when paired with a few squirts of the oil.</li>
    <li> Only problem it&#x27;s a bit pricy. Other than this it&#x27;s a great product and worth buying to try everything before you spend money on a big bottles. It also gives you sense what you will use more and what less. For example, we did not use lotion at all, so good we didn&#x27;t buy it in a big bottle first.</li>
    <li> We have friends that use Earth Mama Bay Angel and it came highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the little starter pack to check it out for ourselves. I&#x27;m not sure if it was because my baby was coming off of a sinus infection or not and her BM were just that much more potent but it really did not protect her little bum. We use cloth diapers from Charlie Banana and so we try to use bottom balms that protect both her and the diapers. This was fine on the diapers but my baby ended up with diaper rash a lot which had never happened before. Also, I don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to be grainy or not but it was and I think that is worth noting on your products. It made me unsure if it was still good or if the product we received had turned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try the new, new to me, baby oil as well. We were just switching from Johnson &amp; Johnson baby bath and oil products, as we saws they use cancer causing formaldehyde, and thought this would be the way to go. However the container doesn&#x27;t pump very well. When you have a little squirming baby the last thing you want is to fight with the pump on the baby oil container. It got to the point where we were just opening and trying to pour a little on her... so messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, we do enjoy the head to toe shampoo and bath wash, the lotion is great and not overwhelmingly fragrant, the oil is nice on her skin, and as for the bottom balm... well we have forgone it. I would like to continue using most of these products and I will give the bottom balm another try once she is feeling better.</li>
    <li> I love earth mama angel baby products. They leave my baby smelling so good. I love that they are organic and certified non gmo. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Useless, also see other mother&#x27;s comments, should be good, such as baby was born, try again.But, the feeling is simple packaging, not sealed.</li>
    <li> This little kit is perfect for a new mom. Made me so happy to receive it. The bottom balm cures yeast rashes, use for two weeks and always dry skin thoroughly before applying this or any cream. Try to let your little one go ten or fifteen minutes free of their diaper at each change.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and was so disappointed when it arrive. Baby kit was small sample size products.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a mother to be and she likes this product.</li>
    <li> Generous amount of a great  product, especially for the price! I love the mild scent.</li>
    <li> The size was too small.</li>
    <li> These products smell wonderfully and work so well. I love the lightweight feeling and they don&#x27;t leave residue behind. The shampoo is my favorite .</li>
    <li> She wanted to try this for her first child and now, a year and a half later, she still uses these products.  The soap is great for bathtime.  And the lotion makes the baby smell like a dreamsicle!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I typically use the unscented body wash for my baby, but wanted something to take while travelling. I wish they made the non-scented in these trial sizes. The smell is like an orange creamsicle. Also, the bodywash pump seems to leak during travel.</li>
    <li> This kit would make a great gift for an expecting mommy! Smells wonderful and works well (like most of their products). Great sample sizes but you don&#x27;t need much for a newborn so they&#x27;ll still last a while.</li>
    <li> Goods will soon be received, like very much, packing also is very good, not bad, this is very good, I hope my baby will like this product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using these for traveling with a little one.  They smell great and are perfect for air travel.</li>
    <li> The best stuff if you can&#x27;t make your own supplies...</li>
    <li> Love these products.  Have been using them since the beginning and my daughter hasn&#x27;t had any issues with irritation and we know we aren&#x27;t covering her body with chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love Earth Mama products and this is the perfect little kit for a new mom and baby.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo for my baby! The other products are good too. We use cloth diapers and the Bottom Balm is perfect! Been using since my baby was born...now 8 months. Just switched to the shampoo bc I was so happy with Bottom Balm</li>
    <li> Great little travel kit!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and the new mom loved it! I will definitely send this as a gift again.</li>
    <li> Every new baby in our family gets this from me. I hope their parents like it and ditch the J&amp;J chemicals. They call it Baby Magic for a reason. Magic is fake and so it their baby lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very highly rated, but i dont know why. I bought it for my LO and everything was just nasty. The bottom balm is disgusting...and didnt work at all. It smelled bad and eventually molded, even though it didn&#x27;t expire for another year.  Mistake with this product, didn&#x27;t care for the other products either.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells good and works when there is just a slight of redness. My babies bottoms have never been red.</li>
    <li> Smells great to me and enjoyed varied of products to try. Really disappointed the bath wash wasn&#x27;t tear free- wont be using. I don&#x27;t want to risk it...</li>
    <li> Bought this as a baby shower present among other things and this was so appreciated by the baby mothe, smells really good! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is very useful, especially the Bottom Balm. The eczema on bottom of my baby will be swept away after used one or two times.</li>
    <li> I use these for traveling with my little one, as well as gifts for friends who are expecting. The products are all very highly rated by Environmental Working Group, which is very important to me, especially when you&#x27;re talking about products that will be used on little babies.  My favorites are the lotion (I admit to using it on myself sometimes, the orange creamsicle - like scent is so amazing!) and the bottom balm, which can also be used to dab on cuts and scrapes. It works very well for us in either capacity. The bottom balm is an absolute staple in my diaper bag. It has a very pleasant, mild herbal scent.  My daughter has had a couple of really nasty diaper rashes, and I have found that a layer of this bottom balm topped with a layer of the white stuff (Desitin, Boudreaux Butt paste, etc) clears them up more effectively than either product does on it&#x27;s own. I can&#x27;t really review the  oil, as I&#x27;ve pretty much never used it. The shampoo/soap works just fine, but the scent is a  stronger orange and not nearly as nice as the scent of the lotion. It is a foaming soap and has a pump dispenser, which I do like. One thing to note: the shampoo is not tear-free, so you do want to be very careful to avoid getting it in your baby&#x27;s eyes. I used to think that this was a drawback of the soap, until I learned that the tear-free formulas actually use chemical numbing agents to make them tear-free (yes, even in baby soaps). So, despite the potential for stinging eyes, this is the soap I use to bathe my baby every day. Overall very good products and it makes a nice little luxury add-on to a baby shower gift.</li>
    <li> My favorite products!  Love to use these on my kiddo</li>
    <li> love love their products. all natural and so worth it, and you dnt need to use a ton unlike cheap Johnson. im never going to use Johnson s*** again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my newborn after discovering the EMAB Bottom Balm for myself. I am now a big fan! Yes, the items are tiny, but it&#x27;s a nice way to try a variety, and they would probably be good for travel, too (plus, how much baby oil do you really need?). The lotion has a great scent (like a creamsicle), the shampoo/wash requires only a little bit and rinses very clean. The oil is unscented and does not leave a greasy feeling. And the balm seems soothing.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and makes for a great trial kit or travel kit.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of these bath products.  I will be giving this and the Mama sample package to every new Mama I know.  The oil worked great to give our little girl a massage that stimulated her first at home poop! She is a breast fed baby so the doctors were concerned that she hadn&#x27;t pooped in a week, which is normal for breast fed babies.  We really wanted to get things going so we gave her a nice warm bath with the baby wash, put some lotion on her and proceded with a massage...and low and behold we got the desired results!  But best of all this product makes our angel smell amazing.  We are not fond of the smell of most baby washes, but this one is great and leaves her skin moisturized and smooth!</li>
    <li> it is my second time ordering.  It smells good.  Baby has no reaction to it. Goes light on the skin,  does not leave a residue  or a film on the skin unlike pharmacy bought brands.  I like the fact that it is natural no harsh ingridients. I like the balm for the butt, oil and shampoo.  I use balm each time when i notice redness after the baby poops, and oil after bath time.  do not care much for the cream.</li>
    <li> I love the Earth Mama Angel Baby line!  Their morning sickness spray was a god send and the diaper cream is hands down the most effective we&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Earth Mama Angel Baby a Little Something for Baby Kit  was a gift for my 4th grandchild.  Great for a diaperbag and such.</li>
