      <li>Most of my family and hers have switched after staying the night and trying our toothpaste and noticing the difference.</li>
      <li>I, like many others, will be looking for something else.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure anymore.</li>
      <li>I guess it keeps more people dependent upon the dental industry when their teeth are falling apart.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You better believe I am calling them tomorrow</li>
      <li>was purchasing Biotene products for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to see if either Tom&#x27;s or Squigle are better for my mouth.</li>
      <li>It feels much better to brush.</li>
      <li>so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I will buy more when I need it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to order it at a reasonable price and not have to look for sales all the time.</li>
      <li>My food tastes much,  much better now</li>
      <li>Could help more.</li>
      <li>Very clean refreshing taste, and helps keep your mouth moist.</li>
      <li>This product was great until the new formula for the toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Biotene dry mouth toothpaste is an excellent product to use after radiation treatment in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is awesome, it has helped me with my dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>I have used Biotene toothpaste and other products for many years and had a perfect oral balance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a shame that you took a good product and replaced it with this junk.  </li>
      <li>Easy find.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously the old formula was working and keeping people&#x27;s mouths healthy, which is why the pharmaceutical shills had to tamper with a good thing in order to make it ruinous to dental health.</li>
      <li>The best thing above all the price was right</li>
      <li>Biotene use is important to my Husband who has had head and Neck Cancer.  </li>
      <li>The Biotene that we have been using for yeas has been reformulated to basically be a SLS free toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>give 2 stars just because it is still SLS free.  </li>
      <li>It is important to use it every day, as its effectiveness increases over time.  </li>
      <li>GSK took a great medical product needed by millions of people and destroyed it.</li>
      <li>Biotene used to be great but because of corporate greed has been reduced to an over-priced tube of garbage.</li>
      <li>The website claims that the toothpaste is free of sulfates</li>
      <li>It also kept me cavity free.  </li>
      <li>the good the old product did has been undone.  </li>
      <li>Very good product for those who have canker sores or other irritations in the mouth.  </li>
      <li>(2) Crest polishes and keeps my teeth feeling clean and smooth (when used in conjuction with my Sonicare toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My gums are receeding, which they had stopped doing with the use of the original product.</li>
      <li>Again, this is NOT the original Biotene.  </li>
      <li>Laclede Inc. The original developer.</li>
      <li>It did nothing and after even using the toothpaste, my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean at all.</li>
      <li>but it leaves my teeth feeling clean with no aftertaste.</li>
      <li>If you have a dry mouth situation this product would be great for you.</li>
      <li>The original Biotene toothpaste has been stolen and an inferior product surreptitiously inserted, exploiting the original Biotene&#x27;s good name and loyal following.</li>
      <li>Yes, the old formula was also SLS free, which is good, but it also contained Xylitol and certain enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bought a biotene 4 pack two months ago and Amazon still refunded me my full purchase price + shipping $25.89 - Five stars to Amazon and...</li>
      <li>All of us that loved and used it should start a campaign to get it back!!!!</li>
      <li>I have used Biotene for over 7 years because of a medical problem and loved it - a lot.  </li>
      <li>Biotene (Fresh Mint Original) toothpaste now contains MILK and EGGS.  </li>
      <li>With my Prime Membership, I received the order quickly without a shipping charge.</li>
      <li>Most likely done to reduce production costs, boost the profit margins and lower the unit price so that it would be more &#x27;competitive&#x27; on the grocery store shelves - probably the brain child of some Stanford MBA.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you with a strong mint taste, so your mouth feels clean and &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>It was just damned good toothpaste, and worth the extra money per tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and he gave me my first free sample.</li>
      <li>It was a great product, the one thing that cured my severe gum disease back in the mid 1990&#x27;s and kept my gums healthy ever since.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Avoid this product like the plague, and if you want them to bring back the old Biotene that so many of us loved, I suggest you nag the powers that be at GlaxoSmithKline until they cave.</li>
      <li>I had a couple of other new tubes awaiting use and decided to use those up before buying more of any kind and am still working on them after more than a year.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the new formula after radiation.</li>
      <li>Good toothpaste, helps with dry mouth.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Biotene!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light mint flavor and it does foam a little bit - unlike most SLS free toothpastes that seem to just dissipate in your mouth -</li>
      <li>I was having a great deal of trouble with sensitivity in my mouth, which caused pain as well as food not tasting as well as it should.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really distressed that they would screw up such a good product.</li>
      <li>found Jason Sea Fresh at swansonvitaminsdotcom.  </li>
      <li>All natural, fluoride free and SLS free.  </li>
      <li>I have used and recommended the old formula for years -shall not buy any more.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is useful for my husband post treatment for throat cancer.  </li>
      <li>like others who have written, BIOTENE has re-formulated their product - both the gentle mint gel and the original mint paste.  </li>
      <li>nope, I ordered the right product....</li>
      <li>Anyone who tried it could tell the difference right away between it and everything else.</li>
      <li>it has CERTAINLY provided more relief than this new form of biotene and even though it wasn&#x27;t covered by my insurance</li>
      <li>it has CERTAINLY provided more relief than this new form of biotene and even though it wasn&#x27;t covered by my insurance</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to report not a single canker sore since I switched over to this product several years ago.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order this 4 pack in the hope that it is the original rather than the misleading new packaging which says original flavor but isn&#x27;t really.</li>
      <li>For years, I have paid a little more to balance whatever wacky side-effect was happening since menopause.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It tastes good, it behaves just like a toothpaste should, and I have used it for several years as my ONLY toothpaste ... because it&#x27;s identified as a DRY MOUTH toothpaste (I definitely have dry mouth) and my dentist recommendeds it. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doesn&#x27;t CURE dry mouth, but I think it probably doesn&#x27;t irritate dry mouth like some &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpastes might.</li>
    <li> It is the best tooth paste available. It has no detergent in it like all the other TP. Thus it is vewry gentle on the mouth.</li>
    <li> Be advised, new gel formula dangerous! Biotene has removed the ingredients that mad the product a gel which coated the tongue at night. The new formula melts into a liquid very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using the new formula gel after I woke coughing. The gel melted and ran down my windpipe into my lungs! Very dangerous stuff.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; but I am very prone to canker sores and I used to get a few at once. Every one of them were red and painful.  If you suffer from cankers and you don&#x27;t know what SLS is, I emplore you to find out. The last two years I have been relatively pain free just by switching to toothpastes that DO NOT contain SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate).  It&#x27;s a foaming agent that is put into most toothpastes and it also dries your mouth - exacerbating a \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; or chronic canker condition.  I still get a canker here and there, but I would say it&#x27;s 10% what it was, and when I do get them the pain is 20% of what it used to be.    Biotene is not the only SLS free toothpaste, but it is a very good one and it is common enough to rely on the fact that your local retailer will carry it if you need to replace it quickly.  It&#x27;s a very light mint flavor and it does foam a little bit - unlike most SLS free toothpastes that seem to just dissipate in your mouth - so you almost feel like your using a regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this for my dry mouth and it may help during the day, but unfortunately when using it before bed, I still have such dry mouth that it actually wakes me up--so why the 5 stars?  The very greatest thing about this toothpaste is that it doesn&#x27;t foam up.  At first that seems a little weird because we&#x27;ve mostly gotten used to having a huge mouthful of suds dripping all over the place.  It took some getting used to, but the toothpaste is effective as a cleaner and keeps my mouth healthy if not moist during the night.  The huge benefit is that once I became used to the low foam situation, I vastly preferred it and found that I could use just the tiniest nib of other normally foaming toothpastes instead of the brushful we&#x27;re trained to use and get an ideal teeth and mouth cleaning experience for a fraction of the cost because the tube lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drop or two of one of the other Biotene products helps my dry mouth at night and I think this toothpaste is a good one to use, but in the end, I don&#x27;t use it all the time.  I had a couple of other new tubes awaiting use and decided to use those up before buying more of any kind and am still working on them after more than a year.  Turns out a very little bit is effective and goes a long way.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for my use of this product, I&#x27;d never have known that and would still be going though expensive toothpaste far more rapidly than I needed to.  I recommend the product for mouth health and future money savings, although I suggest one of their other products that is specifically for saliva enhancement to alleviate dry mouth.</li>
    <li> The Biotene that we have been using for yeas has been reformulated to basically be a SLS free toothpaste.  Yes, the old formula was also SLS free, which is good, but it also contained Xylitol and certain enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new version contains no Xylitol... it has been replaced with sugar alcohol, sucralose, and saccharin.  The new version contains no enzymes, and the \\&quot;rinse once\\&quot; instructions have been removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all is the film.  Whatever they put in it now as a foaming agent leaves a slimy film on your teeth for a few hours.  The old toothpaste did not foam at all, it would run out of your mouth, it was messy.  We lived with that fact for the benefits it provided.  The new formula feels like brushing with shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give 2 stars just because it is still SLS free.  I will be searching smaller drug stores for the last few tubes of the old formula though.</li>
    <li> I was having a great deal of trouble with sensitivity in my mouth, which caused pain as well as food not tasting as well as it should.  My doctor told me that my mouth was dry and sensitive and to use Biotene toothpaste, and boy was he right!  It was a minor miracle!  It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you with a strong mint taste, so your mouth feels clean and &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  My food tastes much,  much better now and I no longer have tongue pain.  I am SOLD on this product!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed.  I have been using Biotene Toothpaste for over 20 years, post cancer treatment and it is (was) the only toothpaste I could tolerate without pain and helped me so much with dry mouth.  It also kept me cavity free.  I buy it regularly, and about two months ago after my most recent purchase, I noticed that the inside of my cheeks and tongue would burn when i used it and left me feeling irritated all day and all through the night.  I decided to compare the new ingredients label against an older tube that I keep at work and voila!!  They changed the formula entirely, added straight fluoride and Sucralose (Splenda) and saccharin, along with other ingredients that don&#x27;t even resemble the original formula.  They even removed the wonderful bio-active enzyme system.  I have looked all over town for perhaps some of the old formula still on store shelves but none was there.  Only this new disaster that burns your mouth, and is loaded with chemical sweetener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a customer service number on their website and invite questions and feedback, 1-800-922-5856, M-F 9:00am-4:30pm ET.  You better believe I am calling them tomorrow and I hope others will do the same.  I have no idea what I am going to do now. There just isn&#x27;t much else out there.  I have no idea why they did this, unless of course, it is cheaper to manufacture, thus making them more money.  I know I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I had to change my toothpaste after developing sensitivity to the sensodyne I had been using.  Biotene is the only toothpaste I can use without experiencing a burning sensation on my tongue.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great for preventing canker sores. I suffered from them my entire life and I experience them considerably less now that I am using this toothpaste. This is because there is no SLS in the toothpaste. I highly recommend this product if you suffer from canker sores.</li>
    <li> My wife has dry mouth and the products from Biotene were the only ones that helped her to feel better...</li>
    <li> Like others have said, the positive reviews written earlier than October 2013 should be ignored. Biotene used to match its “#1 Dentist Recommended” marketing, but now? Not so much. Between the replacement of Xylitol with saccharine, the terrible chemical taste, the foaming and the lingering burn, it’s been turned into an inferior product that positive advertisement for is nothing short of untruthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used this product for years, but now I’ll be looking for something else.</li>
    <li> Biotene used to be great but because of corporate greed has been reduced to an over-priced tube of garbage. The new formulation of Biotene has caused all of my old mouth problems to return. The website claims that the toothpaste is free of sulfates but I&#x27;m not so sure anymore. The old Biotene used to state right on the package that it was SLS free, but the new formulation does not say this anywhere on the package or the tube itself. I cannot say for sure but I suspect that SLS has indeed been added to the new formula. I would urge anyone who is looking for a sensitive toothpaste to look elsewhere. I will not purchase this product again until they restore the toothpaste to what it once was.</li>
    <li> After I got dentures I found that I was slurring my words until I wet my mouth so I found this tooth paste that said it controled dry mouth, didnt seem to work at first but continued use for about 1 month proved that it was working, seemed a little expensive but because I work by talking to people it proved to be invaluable. I used to get comments that people thought I had been drinking and that had to stop, this product seemed to be the answer.</li>
    <li> Very clean refreshing taste, and helps keep your mouth moist.</li>
    <li> Just adding my voice to the chorus. Discovering Biotene 5+ years ago was a totally godsend in how it totally halted the horrible cycles of mouth sores regular toothpaste had inflicted on me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so much for that - with this new formulation, I might as well go back to using Crest!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who suffers from dry mouth, he uses it along with the Biotene Dry Mouth Rinse.</li>
    <li> If you are prone to canker sores, this toothpaste will help them be less frequent.  I have been using it for over a year and have noticed less.</li>
    <li> You should ignore any positive reviews you read about Biotene toothpaste written prior to October 2013, because the product has completely changed and is now ruined. I have used Biotene as my toothpaste for over 15 years. It was a great product, the one thing that cured my severe gum disease back in the mid 1990&#x27;s and kept my gums healthy ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to say, Biotene has recently undergone major changes for the worse and is now an awful product. If you read the other one star reviews written in October 2013 and later, my experience is similar. The toothpaste used to be soothing and made my mouth feel healthy, the new product is irritating and has a chemical sweetener taste. I brushed my teeth with it several hours ago and my gums still feel irritated. That NEVER happened with the old formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene is marketed as \\&quot;#1 Dentist Recommended\\&quot; for dry mouth. This is false advertising, because the product that dentists were recommending no longer exists. The Wikipedia page on Biotene is false, because the product it describes no longer exists. Even the product description here on Amazon is false as of this writing, because it describes the old product where the enzymes were front and center, not the new product where all the enzymes are removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-bacterial enzymes, which were a key feature of the old product, are now completely gone. Xylitol has been replaced by saccharine. What was soothing to the gums is now irritating. It is a fraud to market this inferior, very different, product based on the success and achievements of a older product that unfortunately no longer exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene has lost a loyal fifteen year customer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because i suffer from dry mouth. I so regret the Biotene Products and this was just the icing on the cake. It did nothing and after even using the toothpaste, my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean at all. Stop scamming people biotene!</li>
    <li> Biotene has recently changed its toothpaste formula.  Xylitol has been replaced by saccharin and sucralose, and the enzymes have been replaced by emulsifiers and a foam booster.  How the new formula will help with dry mouth is hard to understand.  I tried the \\&quot;new\\&quot; product once and discarded it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Biotene for more than ten years to help with dry mouth caused by radiation therapy, and am now looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed by the recent change of the Biotene formula.&lt;br /&gt;Glaxo Smith Kline has just completely revised the formula. Not only they have changed the active ingredient, but the tooth paste has become significantly more sweet and foamy, exactly as many other products on the market. Although the company still claims that the paste does not contain SLS, the taste of it is indistinguishable from all those Colgate and Crest products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have called the customer service today (800-922-5856) and they have confirmed that recent change.&lt;br /&gt;So beware of the \\&quot;New Improved pH Balance\\&quot; red label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was purchasing Biotene products for more than 10 years. During this time I have significantly expanded the circle of their customers by recommending the toothpaste to the friends and relatives.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, now I stop purchasing Biotene toothpaste until any further developments (which are very unlikely).</li>
    <li> I started using this in 1997 when I was having radiation for breast cancer and my mouth got extremely dry. My dentist recommended it and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s great to be able to order it at a reasonable price and not have to look for sales all the time.</li>
    <li> I must chime in with all the other unhappy Biotene brushers.  I have used Biotene toothpaste and other products for many years and had a perfect oral balance.  Suddenly I have dry mouth again, the roof of my mouth seems to have a crack and my lips are dry and my mouth burns.  These problems are constant and I have been trying to pinpoint when the symptoms started thinking perhaps there was a change in my medical situation causing the problems.  Nope, my issues appeared when I started using the new product and has gotten progressively worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the good the old product did has been undone.  I have searched store shelves and can&#x27;t find the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product.  Now what?  I&#x27;m going to order this 4 pack in the hope that it is the original rather than the misleading new packaging which says original flavor but isn&#x27;t really.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotene exclusively for 14 years because it used to be so much better than any other toothpaste. Anyone who tried it could tell the difference right away between it and everything else. My wife switched to Biotene after meeting me. Most of my family and hers have switched after staying the night and trying our toothpaste and noticing the difference. All are now (or were!) exclusive Biotene users and none (including me) would have described themselves as suffering from dry mouth before switching. It was just damned good toothpaste, and worth the extra money per tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, the toothpaste in this last shipment was horrible. And don&#x27;t even get me started on the PBF stuff - that is even more nasty than the newly formulated regular stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did they do it? They took everything that differentiates them from other toothpastes and took it away. Now nobody is going to seek out Biotene because it&#x27;s different, and if I&#x27;m going to buy regular foamy toothpaste I may as well not pay a premium for it. I may as well just get the cheapest stuff. And that&#x27;s never going to be Biotene. So everyone loses.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs to lodge formal complaints to the manufacturer and also the FDA or your regulatory agency in your country about the formulation changes Biotene have made. If people do not lodge formal complaints nothing will happen. I was advised they changed the formula because dentists wanted a more balanced pH level for the mouth. I have not read anything anywhere that verifies this. NOR have they run any trials on consumers to see if this new formulation works. It is a whole new product!!!</li>
    <li> I suffer from &amp;#34;drymouth&amp;#34; due to medications.  This product is a considerable help in combating that problem.  While not a solution, its effects in stimulating saliva flow extend beyond the time of application.  If it has a drawback, it is that it is not very abrasive and seems actually somewhat slippery - not ideal for cleaning teeth.  However, my dental hygienist suggested dipping the toothbrush into baking soda after squeezing on a strip of Biotene and the combination works very well - the Biotene provides increased salivation, the baking soda does the cleaning.  Try it.</li>
    <li> Beware,  the Biotene dry mouth products have been changed.  The new formulas are not any help to dry mouth.  The mouth wash actually causes large mouth sores.  Biotene is now being advertised on TV commercials.  It should come out with warnings.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from anything that doesn&#x27;t have the enzyme system on the label.  May as well use any old product that&#x27;s on sale, can&#x27;t be worse than the NEW Biotene</li>
    <li> The new toothpaste is really awful.  Why did you take a good thing and make it so much worse?  The new formula really burns your mouth unlike the original formula.  I, like many others, will be looking for something else.  It&#x27;s really a shame that you took a good product and replaced it with this junk.  Sorry, Biotene, but you&#x27;ve lost my business.  I only gave you one star because it&#x27;s required.  However, I really feel you should get no stars.</li>
    <li> Biotene (Fresh Mint Original) toothpaste now contains MILK and EGGS.  I&#x27;m not kidding... Milk and Eggs - Read the package label, not the above description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, they changed Xylitol to Splenda, reduced size from 4.5 to 4.3 oz, raised the price by 10 bucks and kept the word \\&quot;Original\\&quot; on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Jason Sea Fresh at swansonvitaminsdotcom.  All natural, fluoride free and SLS free.  It&#x27;s a spearmint paste somewhat similar to the stuff my dentist uses when he cleans my teeth.  Not the same as biotene but it leaves my teeth feeling clean with no aftertaste. I hope this helps someone find a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a biotene 4 pack two months ago and Amazon still refunded me my full purchase price + shipping $25.89 - Five stars to Amazon and... One star + Shame On You to GlaxoSmithKlineox.</li>
    <li> I have been using biotene a long time and it helps me a lot with my dry mouth.  I not only use the toothpaste, but I use the mouth wash, gum, spray and the gel.  My only complaint is not being able to find the Sensitive toothpaste anymore!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BIOTENE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Biotene (the paste and the gel formulas) for dry mouth.  Was VERY happy and relieved to find there was a product that wouldn&#x27;t turn my mouth into a sticky, dry situation like any other regular toothpaste.  For years, I have paid a little more to balance whatever wacky side-effect was happening since menopause. (as if there aren&#x27;t enough!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... like others who have written, BIOTENE has re-formulated their product - both the gentle mint gel and the original mint paste.  The taste and reaction are different now... I&#x27;m left with an after-taste and feel which encourages me to spit LONG AFTER I have rinsed.  My interior lips feel that \\&quot;old\\&quot; film and astringent sensation that I am very displeased with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a new tube of the \\&quot;gentle mint gel\\&quot; for $9.00 in hopes that the gel hadn&#x27;t changed as much as the paste version.  Not so.  Both no longer work for me.  Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will search for another product.  I have written to GlaxoSmithKline (biotene.com) in hopes that their former loyal customers have done so as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biotene Toothpaste for at least 6 years, and it is the only thing I have found to relieve dry mouth caused by prescription medications.  It is important to use it every day, as its effectiveness increases over time.  The price is a good one for the 4-pack.  The product arrived promptly, and was packaged well.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product for those who have canker sores or other irritations in the mouth.  It feels much better to brush.</li>
    <li> Chemotherapy left my mouth very sore and I had a case of thrush.  Regular toothpaste burned my mouth so badly I cried when I brushed my teeth.  One of my chemo nurses recommended this toothpaste by brand, so I tried it.  Next thing you know I&#x27;m ordering it on Amazon so I can get 4 at a time, and a better price.  If you have dry mouth or chemo mouth, try this.  It will change your life, or at least the life of your poor mouth!</li>
    <li> Caveat Emptor!  This is NOT Biotene.  The original Biotene toothpaste has been stolen and an inferior product surreptitiously inserted, exploiting the original Biotene&#x27;s good name and loyal following. Corporate greed, and our oh so Wunderbar capitalist system, strikes again.  Very very deceptive advertising - you have to really search their website to find that they&#x27;ve done the Big Switch.  Again, this is NOT the original Biotene.  After being &amp;#34;bought out&amp;#34; by one of the big pharma corporations,  the new &amp;#34;owners&amp;#34; quickly and covertly changed the ingredients.  Now it&#x27;s little more than a rebranded &#x27;Cr*st&#x27;.  Most likely done to reduce production costs, boost the profit margins and lower the unit price so that it would be more &#x27;competitive&#x27; on the grocery store shelves - probably the brain child of some Stanford MBA.  I started using Biotene eight years ago on the advice of my Dentist after heart surgery and began taking medications that created severe nocturnal dry mouth.  At first I was suspicious of the original product&#x27;s claims, but I was surprised to find it really worked.  I think it was the enzymes, which are now completely missing. Too expensive I presume.  Or patented.  Also the product now has artificial, petroleum derived, sweeteners!  Great.  Guess they thought they might as well throw in some poison while they were at it!  So much for &#x27;consumer choice&#x27;...</li>
    <li> I have been using Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash for the last 3-4 years! Once had a major problem with mouth sores constantly. Since using Biotene regularly I almost  never have a problem. Even convinced my dentist and he gave me my first free sample. I cannot use any toothpaste with &#x27;sodium laural sulfate&#x27; in it.  Thanks to Biotene!!</li>
    <li> The old formula was one of the only toothpastes (in my non-prescription price range) that I could use without my mouth and nasal passage getting painfully dry. Now it&#x27;s ruined. Way to go.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, it has helped me with my dry mouth.  The best thing above all the price was right and I received it in a timly manner.</li>
    <li> I hope and pray the company that makes this product &#x27;wakes up&#x27; and starts making their original Biotene formula again because it WAS a wonderful product. I relied on and was so grateful to have a toothpaste that was truly gentle and I could use. I didn&#x27;t notice on the box that the ingredients had changed-I saw the New Improved pH Balance but thought nothing of it until I used it. OMG-first that horrible taste-I recognized that strong saccharin bitter taste immediately but went ahead and used it. Almost immediately my gums started to hurt and pain was shooting though my mouth. My gums became very irritated and the pain and tender gums lasted for days. This new formulation actually does the opposite of what it should do. It causes dry mouth and makes your gums painful and irritated (my guess is it is also the Titanium Dioxide they added too). PLEASE GlaxoSmithKline bring back the old Biotene-. All of us that loved and used it should start a campaign to get it back!!!!</li>
    <li> It did not help my dry mouth, I did not like the flavor &amp; I ORDERED THREE TUBES.... will not order it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is free from Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), which I read is a major cause of canker sores, and incidentally is the exact same ingredient that makes shampoo foam! I&#x27;m happy to report not a single canker sore since I switched over to this product several years ago. It really works. This product is costly, however; much more than regular toothpaste. I wish the price would come down. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Dry Mouth (whatever that is), so I can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
    <li> Like many others reviewing here, the new formula is TERRIBLE. The saccarine taste is awful and I don&#x27;t like the foaming. I&#x27;ve been using Biotene for 10 years and I will look for another brand. Thanks to others for posting the phone number, I will be calling tomorrow to state my dissatisfaction with the new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, please ignore any reviews prior to October 2013, those older reviews were for the older formula.</li>
    <li> The words &amp;#34;NEW Improved pH Balance&amp;#34; on the label did not prepare me for the harsh wintergreen flavor or the copious foaming of my newest tube of Biotene toothpaste.  I have been using Biotene for 5+ years because it doesn&#x27;t make me cough and gag afterward like Crest and Colgate do.  It used to have a mild peppermint flavor, slightly sweet, and hardly foamed at all.  Very nice stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that maybe this was some other brand of toothpaste put into a Biotene tube by mistake, and contacted the manufacturer to alert them, but based on all the reviews I am seeing this was an intentional change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I´ve tried many toothpastes and I´ve found that Biotene is the one one that fills fully my needs.Delivery was as fast as I can be expected.</li>
    <li> I have problems with any sodium laurel sulfate toothpaste, which is most. This doesn&#x27;t contain SLS, and helps me avoid canker sores. Like the flavor, although it takes time to get used to the non-foamy toothpastes without SLS.</li>
    <li> I just want to add my voice to the chorus and warn everyone that this product has been reformulated and no longer brings relief to those who suffer from dry mouth, canker sores, or irritation of the gum tissue. In fact, just the opposite is true -- the new Biotene will actually contribute to dry mouth and irritation. Avoid this product like the plague, and if you want them to bring back the old Biotene that so many of us loved, I suggest you nag the powers that be at GlaxoSmithKline until they cave. Another very VERY unhappy customer. I guess I&#x27;ll try Tom&#x27;s. :(</li>
    <li> I have used Biotene toothpaste, gum, mouthwash and spray.  They really work.  I have a dry mouth, cause unknown. I have used the toothpaste religiously twice a day for about 8 months. It has helped so much that sometimes I have a little too much saliva. I highly recommend this toothpaste--and any other of the Biotene products you decide to try.</li>
    <li> I added the ingredient list to the review just before mine, but I hope people realize the formula changed, and for the worse for people like me who get canker sores from standard toothpaste.  I found two old formula tubes that I will go through while I&#x27;m searching for a new brand of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This product was great until the new formula for the toothpaste and mouthwash. It seriously burns my mouth and aggravates my burning mouth syndrome and dry mouth. Anyone experiencing the burning should write the company. I did.&lt;br /&gt;I am at a loss what to use.</li>
    <li> I never had a cavity in my life until I was put on a medication that causes severe dry mouth. When I wake up in the morning my mouth feels awful, and Biotene was the only thing that helped. Until now. I just bought a tube of the new formula and it&#x27;s nothing like the old one! My mouth still feels dry even after brushing, and the taste is awful. What am I supposed to use now? Where are the enzymes? I will not be buying this product again unless they go back to their old formula. It worked so well--I have no idea why they&#x27;d start making a clearly inferior product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist because he gets canker sores. We tried it and it reduces the number of cankers he gets. It is a little more expensive than regular toothpaste, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Tried it without it&#x27;s companion mouthwash, but felt the results weren&#x27;t as effective -- the mouthwash, at least for me, was what really seemed to work to take care of the dry mouth -- but it&#x27;s fine as toothpaste, so...</li>
    <li> The item clearly says \\&quot;(Pack of 4)\\&quot;, but only one (1) was received.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product before and the order was correct.&lt;br /&gt;Please ship the other three (3) items ASAP!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was recommended to me by an oral surgeon for oral lichen planus. It is very gentle and soothing. Also, the price on Amazon is a lot less than at any local store in my area.</li>
    <li> The new one is disgusting;it burns, it tastes like artificial sweetener and is unnecessarily foamy. I have used and recommended the old formula for years -shall not buy any more.</li>
    <li> Call up and complain! I got my money back. So should you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told them how awful their reformulation is, especially how the nasty aftertaste lasts 20+ minutes. The only reason I cared enough to call their customer support line was due to how great Biotene used to be, and in the hopes they revert back to the old formula. Until then, I&#x27;m looking for a new toothpaste. Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> The ingredients in Biotene toothpaste has changed entirely in the last couple of months.  It was once a wonderful toothpaste for mouth/tongue sores, but now no longer works. I&#x27;m so disappointed, and until Biotene returns to its original ingredients, I will be looking for a new product that works!</li>
    <li> I have a very bad dry mouth and this toothpaste helps along with the mouth their rinse and mouth spray.  At night I also coat my gums and teeth with a petroleum jelly to keep moisture in.</li>
    <li> Biotene is no longer produced by Laclede Inc. The original developer. Glaxosmithkline took over the biotene product line and removed the enzymes from their product. My gums are receeding, which they had stopped doing with the use of the original product. Biotene is now the same as any other toothpaste. But they still charge the higher price. Join the boycott!!!</li>
    <li> I have NEVER taken the time to write a review on anything I have ever ordered or any place but this one is warranted. I was recommended this product by my dental hygienist as I have a chronic medical condition that requires me to get treatments that makes my mouth severely dry.  At times I have difficulty swallowing because my mouth is so dry.  She gave me a couple sample bottles of Biotene mouth ease and toothpaste  and after using it for a week I was so excited and happy with it I ordered the largest bottle possible plus a 4 pack of the toothpaste!  I almost ALWAYS read the reviews on a product but since I had tried it, I ordered without reading the reviews....my products arrived in a very timely fashion...and I began to use them.  I noticed a very different taste from the sample I had used and the feeling of a grimy film after using the toothpaste.  Worst of all, different from my experience with the sample, MY MOUTH WAS JUST AS DRY as it was without using this rinse and toothpaste.  I thought maybe I had ordered the wrong thing, so I looked at one of the sample bottles I had not yet tossed and there were different ingredients!  Thinking this was my mistake ordering the wrong product I went back to Amazon to check my order....nope, I ordered the right product....so I went to actually read the reviews.  Just as I had seen comparing the ingredients of my sample vs my order, the INGREDIENTS had changed!!!  Now I have a huge bottle of biotene mouthwash and 4 tubes of toothpaste that I&#x27;m throwing away!  I also called my dentist (who I spent a lot of time searching for a very knowledgeable and reputable dentist) to inform her and the hygienist about the change and my experience with it no longer alleviating my dry mouth.  She said it was enzymes that have now been taken out of the product that were so helpful for the dry mouth.  She thanked me for taking the time to call and give her this information as she will no longer be recommending it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO LOOK INTO: she called into my pharmacy a prescription strength fluoride toothpaste.  This is both to prevent the damage that a dry mouth causes on the teeth and she told me it would  provide some alleviation of my dry mouth symptoms.  So far I feel it has helped some....it has CERTAINLY provided more relief than this new form of biotene and even though it wasn&#x27;t covered by my insurance it was MUCH less expensive than ordering 4 useless toothpaste and a large bottle of mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very upset.  I believe there should a note to the customers when a product that has been on the market for quite some time makes such drastic changes to a formula.  I plan to also inform Amazon....I hope others read these reviews and save their money!!!!e called into my pharmacy a prescription strength fluoride toothpaste.

    <li> A class action lawsuit is really the only solution to the BIOTENE reformulation problem. GSK took a great medical product needed by millions of people and destroyed it. They are causing us all actually physical pain and suffering. We could take all their billions in a heart beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d trade it all for just to get some of the real Biotene back though.</li>
    <li> While it is a little pricey, it does a good job as a toothpaste and it helps with dry mouth caused by many prescription drugs. The Biotene mouthwash is a good supplement to this product.</li>
    <li> The dentist suggested we purchase this product and it works as described. If you have a dry mouth situation this product would be great for you.</li>
    <li> I used to have one or two large, painful canker sores in my mouth at all times. When I switched to Biotene years ago, those became blessedly rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one of the reformulated tubes of Biotene when my old one ran out, not realizing it had changed. Within a week of using the new formula, my gums are so inflamed and tender from a massive canker sore outbreak that I can&#x27;t even chew solid foods. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended switching toothpastes again, so I&#x27;m going to see if either Tom&#x27;s or Squigle are better for my mouth.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from the awful side effects of dry mouth, Biotene Toothpaste will help keep your mouth feeling more comfortable.  There is nothing in the toothpaste to irritate your gums.  I have been using this for years, and the price per tube is cheaper on Amazon than it would be if I purchased it at a wholesale club.  With my Prime Membership, I received the order quickly without a shipping charge.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is useful for my husband post treatment for throat cancer.  It really helps him to keep his mouth in a more healthy condition as the saliva glands were so badly damaged by the radiation treatments.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and it does the trick for me.  I would recommend it over other similar products.  RTR</li>
    <li> I have been buying Biotene from a local store which has now dropped the product so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  Although this seems slightly different in density than the product I was accustomed to, it still does a god job of helping me keep my chronically dry mouth moist.  I will buy more when I need it.</li>
    <li> Yes, it has been reformulated, across the line, too. Biotene was bought out by a large corporation which is apparently attempting to increase its bottom line by removing expensive ingredients. It removed the enzyme ingredients and now produces overpriced garbage.</li>
    <li> Biotene use is important to my Husband who has had head and Neck Cancer.  This was recommended as the best source for his Dental needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and loved it...&lt;br /&gt;But it has change so much that now I hate it...&lt;br /&gt;They lost me... I&#x27;ll never use it again... Uck it taste bad now....</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Much better than the new formula after radiation. New formula stings and gives me ulcers.</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the reviewers who hate the new formula, I wish I could give it negative stars. I started using this while battling cancer in 2009 and loved it, sticking with it even after the treatments ended. I&#x27;m back in treatment now for a recurrence and find that even though I&#x27;m not on harsh chemo now, this new formula burns my mouth terribly, it&#x27;s painful to brush my teeth. They ruined a great product.</li>
    <li> While the Biotene toothpaste does seem to reduce dry mouth, I found that it left a film on my teeth.  I prefer to use a slightly more abrasive toothpast such as Colgate Total along with Biotene mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotene for over 7 years because of a medical problem and loved it - a lot.  However they recently changed the formulation and it is disgusting - awful at best.  I am in search of another dry mouth toothpaste, but I am doubting I can find one.  Extremely disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great Buy.  Convenient way to purchase.  Easy find.  Great options.  Would recommend to family and friends. Not available at all stores.</li>
    <li> Item description says it is for 4 boxes. Only 1 box was shipped. Do not purchase as others have had the same problem.</li>
    <li> I innocently bought Biotene yesterday thinking it was the same formula as usual. It wasn&#x27;t until I noticed the formula foaming way more than usual, and burning my mouth, that I looked at the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol and the beneficial enzymes have been replaced with sucralose (splenda, unbelievable!!!), foaming agents, and sodium hydroxide which actually corrodes your teeth! There is nothing about this formula that prevents dry mouth anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the old formula was working and keeping people&#x27;s mouths healthy, which is why the pharmaceutical shills had to tamper with a good thing in order to make it ruinous to dental health. I guess it keeps more people dependent upon the dental industry when their teeth are falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointed... this was the best toothpaste out there. Now I&#x27;ll have to make my own. Shame shame shame on GlaxoSmithKline for doing something so unethical!</li>
    <li> biotene gel used to work like a charm but they changed the formula for the worst.  It is now of a runny consistency and it&#x27;s sort of spicy.  It immediately drains into my throat and causes it to sting.  It&#x27;s also not easy to swallow so I have to keep trying to gulp it down to stop the stinging.  I used this to help me sleep at night.  If my mouth felt dry, I would could squeeze it into my mouth without fully waking.  Sadly, the new formula  is so problematic, I have to wake up and drink water to get the biotene residue out of my throat.  I&#x27;m really distressed that they would screw up such a good product. It&#x27;s a real drag for people who relied on the old formulas, particularly the mouth gel.</li>
    <li> I suffered from very painful canker sores for years. It was so bad there were times I couldn&#x27;t even eat. After switching to Biotene they are completely gone. This stuff was a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste, helps with dry mouth. Could help more.</li>
    <li> Biotene Dry Mouth toothpaste does what it says it will; it keeps my mouth moist even though I have a tendency to breath through my mouth when power walking or hiking the hills near my home. This is important because dry mouth is a cause of gum recession (ask your dentist). My two complaints are that (1) it&#x27;s about 4 times as expensive as a large tube of Crest, and I&#x27;ve been using Crest for 50 years. (2) Crest polishes and keeps my teeth feeling clean and smooth (when used in conjuction with my Sonicare toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the dry mouth during the day, I could just use a Life Saver when walking, BUT Biotene keeps my mouth moist even when I sleep, and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive or allergic to SLS (Sodium laureth sulfate; the stuff that bubbles up in other toothpastes), you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
    <li> Biotene dry mouth toothpaste is an excellent product to use after radiation treatment in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for making my life easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pieter Swart&lt;br /&gt;Cape Town&lt;br /&gt;SA</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the Dentist to help alleviate dry mouth due to medications given and person may not be drinking enough fluids.</li>
