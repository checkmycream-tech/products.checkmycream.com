      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>

      <li>KBShimmer, you&#x27;re better than this.</li>
      <li>I have (candy cane crush) which I love.  </li>
      <li>I bought a bunch of KBShimmer polishes for Christmas presents this year and love how packed they are with glitter.</li>
      <li>I want more from this company.</li>
      <li>I love this polish!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>This nail polish is super cute and comes with lots of snowflake pieces inside!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait till it snows to wear this fun polish!!</li>
      <li>The snowflakes are adorable, but flake off easily (as does the rest of the nail polish).</li>
      <li>But very cool.</li>
      <li>also if you do the come off to easily,.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and dries out very quick.</li>
      <li>and even when I was able to reach full opacity, the color just wasn&#x27;t anything too special.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite nail polish!</li>
      <li>I was so excited for this</li>
      <li>My first attempt I tried to get the snowflakes on top</li>
      <li>I love that the polish has a slight amount of tiny holographic glitter added to it to give the perfect glisten and shimmer needed to make this polish look like snow!</li>
      <li>When you do get a snowflake, it will not lie flat, no matter how many layers of top coat you apply.  </li>
      <li>very pretty and fun to wear too</li>
      <li>Fun polish that i bought for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>Fun for winter.</li>
      <li>So much fun for those winter days and nights</li>
      <li>The color was a nice electric blue and although I was okay with having to fish for snowflakes, I did not like the final outcome.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t come out exactly like the picture, but maybe it just takes some practice to have it look that way.  </li>
      <li>plus clear coats made it smooth.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more baby blue but it was more of a sky blue.</li>
      <li>Nifty color and lots of snowflakes and &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; make this polish really festive!  </li>
      <li>You need a base coat and a top coat for best durability.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I love this polish, its very pretty.</li>
      <li>Very clumpy, pretty but clumpy.</li>
      <li>And thank you so much for the fast service  Thanks again</li>
      <li>Thank you I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Need a light blue undercoat..</li>
      <li>The polish was very goopy</li>
      <li>Such fun polish!</li>
      <li>It looked cute on (although thick to apply), but it didn&#x27;t stay on even one full day.</li>
      <li>Everyone loved the little snow flakes mixed into the nail polish.</li>
      <li>therefore the snowflakes and other tiny fun pieces took many coats to achieve the look as pictured in the product description.</li>
      <li>The snowflakes (which are... sort of recognizable, I guess) are too large for my nails--they inevitably end up sticking out on one side or the other, which makes them prone to catching and ripping up enough to start all my polish chipping.</li>
      <li>only putting 2 coats of clear on top wasn&#x27;t enough to smooth it out and the snowflakes were peeling up a little and getting snagged on things.</li>
      <li>The blue tint doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, despite the fact that I used a light blue undercoat.</li>
      <li>Go to the actual web site for the seller first because they give clear instructions of how to get the look in the picture.</li>
      <li>I found if I got the snowflakes on in the first coat, putting 2 thin coats on top of that</li>
      <li>(It definitely does not come out that vibrant turquoise in the picture.)</li>
      <li>Overall, this polish was fine for a little winter wear, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it again.</li>
      <li>OK a bit too thick and not enough snowflakes.</li>
      <li>Everything Is stuck to the bottle , barely any snowflakes and they fall off, the polish  doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to wear this polish because of it&#x27;s poor consistency.  </li>
      <li>Without the snowflakes, it works really well and is still pretty, but the snowflake glitter is very stiff and does not flex at all, leaving the points sticking up to catch on things and feel rough even after many coats of Seche Vite and other heavy thick top coats.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, this is a subtle but fun way to add some wintertime whimsy to your look!</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the snowflakes don&#x27;t lay down flat and eventually flake off no matter how many layers of clear polish you put over them.</li>

<li> The snowflakes (the reason I bought this) are few and far between.  </li>

<li> The product took a long time to deliver as well.</li>

<li> Obviously giant snowflakes are going to be heavy; you should expect that.</li>
<li> and I found the glitter to be on the sparse side compared to the other KBShimmer polish  </li>
<li> but it fell a little short for me :/</li>
<li> snowflakes &amp; glitter are so heavy they all sank to the bottom and does not come out on the brush.  </li>
<li> Coverage was poor and took forever to dry.  </li>
<li> Blur isn&#x27;t very dark and hard to get snowflakes</li>
<li> /&gt;It sucks.</li>
<li> I had hoped for snow, but at least got some on  my toes.  </li>
<li> however it was on the thick side</li>

    <li> You don&#x27;t need anything else</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Obviously giant snowflakes are going to be heavy; you should expect that. If you follow the directions, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on and dries out very quick. Looks really nice as well! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite nail polish!  I want more from this company. Best polish I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this polish! I wanted a polish that Elsa would wear just for fun and this one was perfect!</li>
    <li> Need a light blue undercoat.. But very cool. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> It looked cute on (although thick to apply), but it didn&#x27;t stay on even one full day. My daughter put it on one evening and went to school the next day (meaning she didn&#x27;t use her hands for anything rough that would chip the polish). By day&#x27;s end, the polish had almost entirely peeled off.</li>
    <li> I like the way this one layers. The largest pieces are the hardest to paint, however the end results is great. Go to the actual web site for the seller first because they give clear instructions of how to get the look in the picture.</li>
    <li> So much fun for those winter days and nights</li>
    <li> This nail polish is super cute and comes with lots of snowflake pieces inside! I love that the polish has a slight amount of tiny holographic glitter added to it to give the perfect glisten and shimmer needed to make this polish look like snow!</li>
    <li> This is a little difficult to use to cover your nails. You will need to apply several coats.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear with my Elsa Costume and received tons of compliments. I did have to turn bottle over and fish for the snowflakes, but I was able to pile on several coats and they looked great!</li>
    <li> Before I bought this I read the reviews and everything was between bad and some others okay so I just give it a try and I get the most beautiful nail polish ever! ... my daughter just to try it  applied one layer on and the snowflakes just got perfectly fine and also the color is beautiful. What you have to do with it is read the instructions and follow as well and that it!</li>
    <li> I had hoped for snow, but at least got some on  my toes.  very pretty and fun to wear too</li>
    <li> I love this polish!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the snowflakes would snag all over my clothes if I could not contour them somehow to the shape of my nails.</li>
    <li> Everything Is stuck to the bottle , barely any snowflakes and they fall off, the polish  doesn&#x27;t stick. The product took a long time to deliver as well. Not worth the money at all so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nifty color and lots of snowflakes and &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; make this polish really festive!  You need a base coat and a top coat for best durability.  Color is great and funky!</li>
    <li> This looks beautiful in the picture and in the bottle, but not so good on the nails.  The polish was very goopy and I found the glitter to be on the sparse side compared to the other KBShimmer polish  I have (candy cane crush) which I love.  Coverage was poor and took forever to dry.  I have not been able to wear this polish because of it&#x27;s poor consistency.  The snowflakes (the reason I bought this) are few and far between.  When you do get a snowflake, it will not lie flat, no matter how many layers of top coat you apply.  So sorry I wasted my money on this polish.  KBShimmer, you&#x27;re better than this.</li>
    <li> color matched the picture, polish is good quality, she loved it, and it looks good on her hands.  Perfect gift!</li>
    <li> Love KBShimmer glitters!!! Will have them all!</li>
    <li> Beautiful nail polish! My only complaint is that the snowflakes don&#x27;t lay down flat and eventually flake off no matter how many layers of clear polish you put over them. Other than that I love this polish, its very pretty.</li>
    <li> The color was a nice electric blue and although I was okay with having to fish for snowflakes, I did not like the final outcome. It was bumpy and bothered me all week..The worst part was trying to remove it. I am use to glitter polishes and know they are more difficult to remove but OMG this one too FOREVER!!! You have been warned,</li>
    <li> Beautiful,love the color,and the glitter&lt;br /&gt;Awesomeness</li>
    <li> People were loving this color when I wore it. Everyone loved the little snow flakes mixed into the nail polish. I did notice this one was a bit more difficult to work with. Getting the snowflakes on each nail was a little tough, as well as getting it smooth since the snowflakes are so big. I found if I got the snowflakes on in the first coat, putting 2 thin coats on top of that plus clear coats made it smooth. My first attempt I tried to get the snowflakes on top so you can see them well but only putting 2 coats of clear on top wasn&#x27;t enough to smooth it out and the snowflakes were peeling up a little and getting snagged on things. Once you figure it out, awesome and so worth it.</li>
    <li> I like the nail polish however it was on the thick side therefore the snowflakes and other tiny fun pieces took many coats to achieve the look as pictured in the product description. Once the look was achieved I did recieve many compliments.</li>
    <li> Thank you I really like this product. And thank you so much for the fast service  Thanks again</li>
    <li> I love this color. Fun for winter.</li>
    <li> very hard to get a snowflake on every nail. also if you do the come off to easily,.</li>
    <li> Fun polish that i bought for my daughter.  KBShimmer is quality polish.</li>
    <li> Wish it came out of bottle like picture shows, too difficult to get flakes out, more just blue polish</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this but it fell a little short for me :/ beautiful concept but the color was very sheer and goopey and even when I was able to reach full opacity, the color just wasn&#x27;t anything too special. I was hoping for a more baby blue but it was more of a sky blue. I haven&#x27;t tried layering it over a baby blue polish; maybe that will work better, but definitely a miss for me :(</li>
    <li> The picture makes it look like there are snowflakes in this polish.&lt;br /&gt;NO snowflakes. It was the only reason I paid the $9 for this polish.&lt;br /&gt;It sucks.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t come out exactly like the picture, but maybe it just takes some practice to have it look that way.  The snowflakes are adorable, but flake off easily (as does the rest of the nail polish). I would still recommend this polish - just make sure you use a good topcoat to seal everything in (this would probably contribute a nice sheen, too)! Otherwise, this is a subtle but fun way to add some wintertime whimsy to your look!</li>
    <li> Love it can&#x27;t wait to us elitist looks great on my display</li>
    <li> just love this polish it so beautiful for the winter.</li>
    <li> Not fond of this polish,  snowflakes &amp; glitter are so heavy they all sank to the bottom and does not come out on the brush.  YOu can shake it all day, still does not stick to polish brush.  The polish itself is watery blue.  Looks nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish!  It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of blue ... just as nice in the summer as the winter even though it&#x27;s named for snow!</li>
    <li> Such fun polish! Got tons of comments and everyone wanted to know where I got it!</li>
    <li> I usually love KB Shimmer polish, but this one is not as good as the others.  Without the snowflakes, it works really well and is still pretty, but the snowflake glitter is very stiff and does not flex at all, leaving the points sticking up to catch on things and feel rough even after many coats of Seche Vite and other heavy thick top coats.  I still use it, but I am sure to pull out the snowflakes if they do end up on the brush before they are applied to the nail.</li>
    <li> Love this polish , the color is awesome</li>
    <li> Very clumpy, pretty but clumpy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait till it snows to wear this fun polish!!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite nail polish! It is the perfect color and lasts the week! Wearing snowflakes in summer is fabulous!</li>
    <li> There are a couple of problems with this nailpolish. The snowflakes (which are... sort of recognizable, I guess) are too large for my nails--they inevitably end up sticking out on one side or the other, which makes them prone to catching and ripping up enough to start all my polish chipping. The blue tint doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, despite the fact that I used a light blue undercoat. (It definitely does not come out that vibrant turquoise in the picture.) It tends to glob up over the snowflakes and obscure them. Overall, this polish was fine for a little winter wear, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it again.</li>
    <li> OK a bit too thick and not enough snowflakes. Still like it</li>
    <li> Blur isn&#x27;t very dark and hard to get snowflakes</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of KBShimmer polishes for Christmas presents this year and love how packed they are with glitter.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The glitter polish has it&#x27;s challenges but once you get the hang of it.  They actually can last a really long time.</li>
