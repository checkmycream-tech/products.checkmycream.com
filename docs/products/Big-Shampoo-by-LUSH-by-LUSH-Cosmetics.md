<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading some amazing reviews for this product on this website and the Lush website (as well as a few blogs), I was really eager to try this product.  I have fine, thin, highlighted hair and have tried tons of products over the years to give my hair that extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself looks less like it does in the picture and more like chopped garlic in olive oil.  Mine didn&#x27;t smell like a margarita or like lemons/limes like some other reviewers mentioned...I suspect there may have been a new formulation at some point and they changed the scent.  Mine is more of a floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a small amount because I didn&#x27;t want it to over-dry my hair.  It lathered up pretty well, left my hair feeling very clean after rinsing out, and it definetely felt like I had more hair.  So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after blow drying it, I must say that I didn&#x27;t really notice any more body or volume than usual.  And I definetely didn&#x27;t get the amazing shine that other reviewers mentioned.  I didn&#x27;t even really have a good hair day.  It didn&#x27;t add body or take any away.  It didn&#x27;t over dry my hair or moisturize it.  Bottom line: I kinda can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this and using my normal Pantene or Dove shampoo.  And they cost a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes for this product, but for me...it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype, unfortunately.  I am interested in trying other Lush products, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase Big again.  I kind of wish I could return it since it&#x27;s pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> I got a pretty generous sample of this when in the LUSH store and I used it for almost 10 washes before it ran out. A little really does go a long way and I finally dished out the money to get the full sized tub of BIG.  It is amazing for my perfectly straight and boring limp hair- BUT, I can&#x27;t use it in back to back washes.  It frizzes out my hair if I use it too often so I stick to once or maybe twice a week (I use Seanik solid shampoo also from LUSH on the off days or a 2-in-1 liquid shampoo) and can even skip washes in between because it removes all the gunky oil build up you normally acquire over time.  The volume is like other volume treatments for hair but I find that it actually KEEPS your hair voluminous, whereas most products have you falling flat within just a matter of hours.  The smell is my favorite part. It kind of smells like a margarita but more like limes and fresh ocean smell I think. The smell does linger on until the next time you wash, even for over 2 days it seems like. The tub will last you forever it seems and is super heavy because of all the salt. It is one of the few beauty things I will splurge on.</li>
    <li> Yep it is wierd at first to use this (like body salt) shampoo, and when I first received this I was really leary.....but after the 1st use, I was HOOKED...it lasts along time because you don&#x27;t use it everyday (this should be used a couple times a week only.. because it really scrubs out the oils) it really cleans!!!I love the smell and wish they made the same smell in an every day shampoo...I&#x27;d be all over it. I gave this 4 stars because I have bought it over and over again for 2 yrs now and figured someone should say something about it. I personally like it LOTS!!</li>
    <li> Have used this 3 times now. The first time around it made my hair feel kind of dry / coarse, with super straight ends (it doesn&#x27;t normally have those). It added no shine and, if anything, removed rather a lot of volume. My hair looked flat and dull the very next morning. So I decided to help BIG along. The second time, I used conditioner afterwards. Same thing. The third time, I used a mask which I leave in for about 45 minutes before washing, and have been really happy with to date (lots of shine). A single wash with Big undid the benefits I usually get from the mask. Same old same old - dry-ish, unimpressive looking hair which looked even worse the next day. It was clean and stayed that way for a few days but it looked so dull I had to braid it. My hair is normal - neither dry nor oily. It&#x27;s not too fine or too hard, and has always been easy to please. My verdict - if your hair answers that description too, don&#x27;t spend money on BIG, even if it does smell like, what&#x27;s the name... Lily of the valley.</li>
    <li> Loved this shampoo. My thin hair looks so thick now and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Suitable for all hair types, but especially for limp locks. Fresh lime juice delivers instant shine and leaves your hair feeling extra clean. This product is available directly from the manufacturer for less than twenty-seven dollars.</li>
    <li> I have loved and purchased this shampoo for years but will stop using it until Lush can figure out how to make it without potentially harmful ingredients: PERFUME, COCAMIDE DEA, and SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE. Data indicates that each of these 3 ingredients on their own can cause neurotoxicity, allergies/immunotoxicity, cancer, organ system toxicity, and irritation of the skin, eyes, or lungs. Used in combination, or along with other potential toxins we are exposed to throughout the day, it&#x27;s unclear what damage these ingredients can do to our health. It is not worth it to continue using the product. Please, Lush, reevaluate and change the ingredients you use in Big. I&#x27;d love to buy it again.</li>
    <li> The salt/lemon/lime combo really seems to \\&quot;roughen\\&quot; up the hair cuticle, and create volume.   It was apparent even in the shower&lt; with my hair soaking wet&lt; that the strands were more voluminous&gt;  I could literally feel it.  It probably does damage the hair, but if your hair is silky fine like mine that&#x27;s exactly what you need.   Will be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> I have fine, oily hair. As in I choose to wash it every morning and by tomorrow 1pm, my hair will have oil streaks. Thus I wash it every morning to prevent those oily streaks. I have used this shampoo 4 times now and my hair responded WELL the first time! WOW-O!! Big INDEED!!! My hair felt so clean and when I styled it, it was voluminous, bouncy, lovely! I skipped a few days and used a different shampoo because I had heard that this shampoo, if used too often would make your hair feel like straw. It would get dry and tangled. So I waited. I then chose to experiment to see if this straw-like hair would happen to my oily hair, so I used BIG 3xs, for 3 consecutive mornings, each time using it with conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time of this 3 consecutive day trial, my hair, again, did GREAT!! Clean (squeaky), bouncy when blow dried, lovely, BIG, wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd time I could feel at the top there were a few stringy-straw like feel but not really. I just put Veganese conditioner (the LUSH conditioner that was created to pair with BIG) and again all was good with same results as the first- squeaky clean, bouncy when blow dried, lovely, BIG, wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd time? OH MY!! Straw-like hair!! It was tangled on top! It felt like it had gotten chemically treated! OH OH MY. But no worries, I just put conditioner in my hair and it was back to being wonderful. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I am chipper about this product and have given it 5 stars although it turned my hair straw-like the 3rd time I used it is because this stuff is STILL amazing!!!!! I just can&#x27;t use it as an everyday shampoo. I can use this 2-3xs a week as a pick me up for my hair, to get out any grime and residue. It makes my hair do AMAZING things... but it also makes my hair a bit dry and straw like if used too often and consecutively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I most DEFINITELY WILL NOT be writing this off. NO WAY! This stuff is GOLD!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these cons, and I&#x27;m still giving 5 Stars, that means that this would&#x27;ve been a 6 star rating with one star knocked for the straw hair. ;)been a 6 star rating with one star knocked for the straw hair. ;)</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, but a ton of it so I look like I&#x27;ve got thick hair.  My hair tends to be oily at the scalp and dry and limp everywhere else so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. My hair is shiny, smooth and smells amazing. I&#x27;m using this with the Retread conditioner.  It is a little difference, and they mean it when they say it&#x27;s mostly salt.  Big grains of salt!  But once it disolves the lather is super rich and smooth.  Great stuff!  Will be using from now on I think.</li>
    <li> I am a reviewer for Meg&#x27;s Makeup, a huge and amazing site for women, where we discuss cosmetics and life issues (give it a try and fall in love!).  A fellow reviewer sent me some of Lush&#x27;s \\&quot;Big\\&quot; in a bottle.  I felt like a moron standing in the shower with rock salt on my head.  Then the light dawned--use water liberally, Gigi!  When I did, there was a rich lather and delightful scent.  Moreover, I could actually \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the salt base pulling impurities and residues from my hair--old shampoos, conditioners, mousses and gels, sprays, you name it.  My hair was returned to its virgin state, simply clean and soft, with nothing heavy to weight it down.  Now I leave it in for several minutes as I shower and use it to prepare my hair as a canvas for whatever I choose to do next.  Other products work beautifully once more after being cleansed by this!  Expensive?  Yes!  But worthy every penny and then some . . .</li>
    <li> This shampoo is seriously INCREDIBLE! It made my hair, which is baby fine and oily, extremely shiny, bouncy, and stunning! I have already gotten 3 compliments on my hair today and i&#x27;ve only been at work for an hour! While it&#x27;s a bit strange at first using the product as it does have natural sea salt, you&#x27;ll be amazed at what a tiny little scoop of the product will do. This lathers extremely well and smells delicious, like a margarita! I am a convert- I love love love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Degreases without stripping hair. Smells wonderful as well!</li>
    <li> I have used BIG for years now and cannot do without it! I use it a couple times a week and wow!! My hair looks so full of body.. shiny and years younger! Seriously.. you will be surprised at how this stuff makes your hair feel and look. Don&#x27;t worry about the little scrubbies inside. you do not even notice..</li>
    <li> smells yummy and clean. i noticed after washing with this shampoo and blow drying my hair, that it was really clean feeling, more so than usual when i wash my hair. my hair smells really good after using this product! i love it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this shampoo.  It smells great and it left my thin hair full of body.  I also received several compliments on how shiny my hair looked.  Unlike the other reviewer I use the shampoo every day but I have naturally oily hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo out there!  I have been using it for about 2 years and LOVE what it does for my oily hair.  This stuff makes your hair squeaky clean and gives you volume.  I also love the way it smells..you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo.  You only need to use a small amount which means it will last you a long time!  $20 well spent.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  Gorgeous volume and clean clean clean hair!  If you have very oily hair then you can really use it daily if you like but if your hair is normal or dry you might want to space out the days that you use this shampoo.  I won&#x27;t go without this in my shower, it is my favorite shampoo ever! :)</li>
    <li> Just started using this stuff this week.  I am so impressed after just using four times.  It leaves my hair shiny and fuller.  I will buy this again, it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awesomely surprised first time trying this best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used ! There products are amazing</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gets your hair squeaky clean, and makes your hair so thick and full. Will reorder!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad and you do get some volume but it&#x27;s kinda drying so I never used it a lot..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have fine,thin hair,when i saw this i thought..well i dont know,but i love other products by Lush so i gave it a try.it made my hair full of body and after i curled it i didnt even have to use hair spray,it just stayed!!usually i have to wash my hair everyday since it is so fine,but i got up the next day and all i had to do was curl it a little and it looked great! i know its expensive but you only need a little bit to get alot of rich lather.i will buy this again!!</li>
    <li> I love this product...I only use it about once a week if that. It leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh. It smells great. When they say sea salt, they mean it. Dont open your mouth when using...make sure you wash your lips and stuff. You can taste the salt. But other then that. This is an A+++ product in my book.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited when this product came in the mail and even more excited when I used it for the first time.  The texture is a little weird but the smell was AMAZING and it truly does clean, there is no discrepancy on that part.  But I also have fine boticelli curly hair and it dried my hair out to the point of almost frizz... but boy, does it smell good.  I also bought the jasmine and henna fluff ease to use thinking it might condition my curls to help them sit right on my head, but it didn&#x27;t really condition my hair at all, just left it feeling kind of \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; but smelling EVEN MORE AMAZING.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to give your hair body AND curls, this might not be the right product for you.  But if you just want something that smells absolutely fantastic, then go for it!!!  The scent stays in your hair for a while!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, but do note that it is $15 cheaper on Lush&#x27;s website/store for the same size.&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine limp hair and have used all kinds of high end shampoos that barely do anything - this actually does something! My hair feels so light and flowy and looks like it has actual volume. I didn&#x27;t think my hair knew what volume was!</li>
    <li> This is a really interesting and original shampoo.  It has huge hunks of salt suspended in a creamy base, which give a really invigorating scalp massage.  The scent is light and fresh- I think it smells of clean laundry.  My only complaint is that I have to use quite a bit of this to really get it worked through my hair, which is unfortunate because the shampoo is rather pricey.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair and scalp feeling clean for days. It&#x27;s expensive, but only a very little bit is needed, a dab on the end of one finger, to clean a full head of long hair.</li>
    <li> Okay seriously-this item is insanely overpriced. It looks as though it comes in a MUCH larger container than it does..sadly, it dos not. It is very very tiny-so if you have med-to long hair...I do not recommend bc I little dab will not do you. For $25 dollars-(I am editing this to write it only cost me $25 bc I used rewards points. Otherwise it would have been $40 something! Who made this?! Elves!!)I understand it was hand made but it doesn&#x27;t contain anything spectacular in it that the average person couldn&#x27;t make for much less than that or find at a home made shop for less. I really thought it was a larger container based on the pic so shame on me for not examining that more closely. One reviewer stated she got over 6 months of hair washes out of this container...i do not see how unless she has VERY short hair. When you apply it-it is like a very course sea salt so it won&#x27;t move around on your scalp. You have to keep applying &amp; adding more water. The container cannot be more than 3\\&quot; tall. I AM going to say it smells WONDERFUL. It is a mixture of lemons, limes, citrus &amp; sea salt &amp; unicorn horn. Also, I would like to add-and this was awful-after my first use I noticed a lot of hair in my tub/drain. More than usual. I didn&#x27;t think too much of it..maybe stress. It smelled so good &amp; was organic! Couldn&#x27;t be right? The second time...twice as much. I tried once more and had just as much hair come out as the second time. I had enough to put in a ziplock Baggie! I tried to send it back to the company bc of what was happening but nope. I didn&#x27;t want another product but I didn&#x27;t want my money back. I couldn&#x27;t use their remaining product bc at the rate I was going I would be buying wax next for my bald head. No luck. It&#x27;s hard to throw away an expensive product but I couldn&#x27;t give it away knowing what it did to my hair-even if my scalp was just being a sensitive little jerk bc a lot of ppl really love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I first read about this shampoo on a fashion blog of a girl who has AMAZING hair. She uses this for herself and since my hair is prone to limp lifelessness I definitely wanted to give it a try.     A lot of people comment on the smell. It definitely smells pretty good - but since it&#x27;s handmade I find it reminds me of a little hippy-esque patchouli fragrance. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that. The boyfriend thought it smelled nice so that&#x27;s a plus!    It&#x27;s a little odd to think of using at first because it feels like mushy sea salt. Don&#x27;t let the oddness fool you though - just a nickle sized dab of this stuff will lather like nobody&#x27;s business! It worked up more of a lather than my regular buy-at-Target shampoo.     Mostly I was excited about the volume - especially at the crown of my head. My hair is straight as a pin for the most part and I hate the way it lays flat as a sheet of paper on top of my head. I wouldn&#x27;t say it added VOLUME so much as it added all over BODY. Are those the same thing? Probably. I just feel like BODY is a more accurate description though. As an added side bonus, it made my hair shine like I couldn&#x27;t believe. And man is my hair super soft. Usually after I blow dry it&#x27;s a bit frizzy and it needs a few hours to settle down and get nice and smooth. No so with this shampoo. It was immediately soft, smooth, and dazzling all the natural colors of my brown hair.     I still have to tease to give my crown a boost - which is really what I bought this to try and avoid. Still an amazing shampoo and I&#x27;m definitely hooked. Would recommend to girls with similar hair: straight, on the thinner side, and flat especially when grown past the shoulders.</li>
    <li> I bought this pricey shampoo because I was sick of my limp, blah hair and, well, it made promises. Promises I could not resist. Here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size matters: Suitable for all hair types, but especially for limp locks. Once you go BIG you never go back.&lt;br /&gt;Shine on: Fresh lime juice delivers instant shine and leaves your hair feeling extra clean.&lt;br /&gt;One of your five a day: Full of vitamins, minerals and trace elements, Tooth Wracked Seaweed strengthens damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell me, could you resist all that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my hair is baby fine and mid back length so you can imagine how blah it looks when left to dry naturally. I typically wash it every other day, adding a little dry shampoo at the roots for \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; on day 2 and using a headband around the head and wrapping the hair around it, spritzing with a bit of water and leaving it alone to dry while I get ready. This gives me pretty spiral curls and a little lift without damaging my weak hair further. Day 2 looks pretty good. It&#x27;s Day 1 that is the problem. I don&#x27;t blow-dry so it usually just hangs there pin straight or gets tucked into a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I tried out Big Shampoo. It smells like heaven. Yes, I know what heaven smells like. Heaven smells of coconuts with a wee hint of limey sweetness. The texture is a bit strange, seeing as 50% of the base consists of genuine sea salt crystals (the large kind). I wet my hair before scooping out a bit and rubbing into my scalp. I massaged it to melt the salt and it lathered up nicely and rinsed out easily. I followed up with a bit of Veganese conditioner on about 6\\&quot; of the ends because, let me tell you, my hair felt dry. If I hadn&#x27;t used the conditioner, I doubt I would&#x27;ve been able to get a comb through it without resorting to a detangler. So be warned.  After combing, my hair did feel more voluminous than usual (which isn&#x27;t saying much, to be honest but I&#x27;ll take it) and now that it&#x27;s completely air dried, the texture feels different, almost like I&#x27;d spent a day at the beach. It definitely has a bit more life than usual. I think with a blow dryer, it would be noticeably voluminous. As is, I am quite happy with the results. The scent is subtle and lovely and my hair has a little more bounce and isn&#x27;t lying flat against my head. It doesn&#x27;t look any shinier than normal but I&#x27;m okay with that. Shiny, for me, usually means it needs a wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does BIG keep its promises? Well, it keeps the first one. The jury is still out on the other two. I&#x27;ll update the review after I&#x27;ve used the entire tub which may take me awhile because my hair is so fine and I don&#x27;t wash every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a LUSH boutique nearby I recommend grabbing a sample to see how it works for you before buying the entire tub.almost like I&#x27;d spent a day at the beach.

    <li> I love this and wish I could use it every day but it dries out my hair way too much. I am using Daddy-O and Fair Trade Honey both from the Lush line now but wish every day that it could be this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three days now. So far it&#x27;s fabulous. I have baby fine stick straight hair and it actually has some body now. On top of that my hair is extremely soft, shiny in a non greasy way, and smells wonderful. I have mid back length hair and it only takes a little scoop for me. Big lathers up wonderfully and leaves my hair squeaky clean. That said I would definitely not use it without conditioner and I&#x27;ve noticed a fair amount more hair in the drain. I suspect that is just the hair I usually shed throughout the day since I&#x27;ve been finding less elsewhere and I seem to have as much hair as ever.</li>
    <li> NOT ALL NATURAL OR ECO-FRIENDLY AS PRESENTED ON THEIR WEBSITE where ingredients like ethylamine oxide are oddly listed as such, but a simple web search will show you that actually such ingredients are quite the opposite and likely toxic.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I just bought Big yesterday - based on reviews from this site as well as their company site.  What a great product!!  I have long hair so it&#x27;s extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a volumizing shampoo to fo much to my hair...but this one does!  There is noticibly more volume.  Another great aspect is that my hair looks like i had a salon blow out - and trust me, I do not do any extras when blow drying...no round brush, etc.  It feels wonderful!  The smell is good...though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting the lemon/lime smell others have mentioned.  Just a noice clean fragrance.  I also bought the Veganese conditioner to go with it - love it too.  The girl at the lush store recommended it since it&#x27;s their lightest conditioner so you don&#x27;t weigh down any of the volume you&#x27;re getting from Big.  I will definitely buy this again - and plan to check out more of the Lush products!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is my favorite shampoo in the world! At first you will be like what kind of consistency is this? Seriously seems so inappropriate.  But it lathers up wonderfully. It makes your hair so luscious and squeaky clean. I use it on my color treated hair and I feel it makes it more vibrant. Follow it with American conditioner for an amazing combo</li>
    <li> The most wonderful smelling product ever. Nice idea and it feels good on scalp and hair. Probably a little drying over time, but for occasional use it is awsome.</li>
