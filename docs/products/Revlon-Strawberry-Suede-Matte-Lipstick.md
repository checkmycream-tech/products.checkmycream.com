      <li>Perfect color for the spring and summer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame, Revlon discontinued the shade \\&quot;Strawberry suede\\&quot;, it was their best shade in the matte lipstick collection.</li>

      <li>came on time, very cute color!</li>
      <li>The price was great, but I mix it with something else to get the color and texture I want or need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I knew how great the lipstick holds during the day.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Great buy &amp; Great condition.</li>

      <li>The lipstick arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>and well now I&#x27;m a very satisfied costumer</li>
      <li>I 1st want to say I Love This lipstick!</li>
      <li>It is especially intense and beautiful if worn with a pencil underneath.  </li>
      <li>When you use a more coral color lip pencil the lipstick will definitively look coral!</li>
      <li>Although nice it is not as pictured.</li>
      <li>friend of mine had this but was discontinued in Ireland - was delighted to find it online :)&lt;</li>
      <li>and it is a nice shade I reccomend you to order it</li>
      <li>However, they save the day by kindly reship my item to my house.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very bright, but pretty.</li>
      <li>I came across this discontinued lipstick thinking it was going to be fantastic since many of the reviews were saying how great the product was.</li>
      <li>It would be perfect for a young girl.</li>
      <li>Strawberry suede is a beautiful orange toned red, which is great for the spring and summer months.</li>
      <li>The matte texture really helps this very bright color look sophisticated, but sometimes the formula can feel a bit drying.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a very matte color, which I think is a good thing for a bright color.</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>I love both colors</li>
      <li>This is the perfect shade somewhere between coral, red, and orange.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these lipsticks for my daughter and she&#x27;s really enjoyed them.</li>
      <li>I love Revlon&#x27;s lipstick, I&#x27;ve almost used all brands and wasn&#x27;t satisfied,</li>
      <li>Love the formula .</li>
      <li>and I thought a matte lipstick would look better on me than it does.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color</li>
      <li>I almost passed on trying this lipstick because it was discontinued, but I am so glad that I gave it a try.  </li>
      <li>and I love it as a summer shade.</li>
      <li>there orange on me that it looks more clownish than it does statement.</li>
      <li>This lipstick goes on smooth and is a nice shade.</li>
      <li>Personally love  matte color lipsticks.</li>
      <li>can not wait until spring to wear it more often, its not a winterish color</li>
      <li>This is THE BEST red!!</li>
      <li>I paired it with a covergirl brighter shade, and it looks absolutely stunning.</li>
      <li>, I never had a lipstick like this one, and I actually love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Every time I wear it, I get so many compliments and &amp;#34;what color are you wearing?&amp;#34;s.</li>
      <li>It looks better when I add a bit of lip gloss after applying the lipstick.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lipstick and I am so glad I was able to get it from here considering this color was discontinued.</li>
      <li>Before wearing it I make sure to really condition my lips with a good balm, then blot the excess off before applying.</li>
      <li>It has a very special color that I never saw nowhere before.</li>
      <li>its ok look fine on u</li>
      <li>Very nice texture and good color to mix with other lip colors</li>
      <li>Good quality, smooth, perfect orangey-red for day or night, vibrant matte colour that doesn&#x27;t dry your lips.</li>
      <li>2nd of all I love the fact that the customer service is great.</li>
      <li>BUT they are very warm which makes teeth appear more yellow.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried about this lipstick because I have a darker skin tone, but this color is just beautiful!</li>
      <li>Just the perfect red, and as per usual, just a beautiful quality matte lip from Revlon.</li>
      <li>I bought this lipstick because a You-Tuber Beauty Guru said that it was fabulous.</li>
      <li>but when I put it on my lips it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Great for any gal who likes shades of red.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic matte lipstick.</li>
      <li>It is my new favorite color!</li>
      <li>the best lipstick out there - competes with all the high end products but doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like MAC does.  </li>
      <li>it is such a beautiful warm red</li>
      <li>Just the right color to go with my nail polish!</li>
      <li>Wear it boldly for retro red lips or lightly for a beautiful natural &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; color.</li>
      <li>But when I received it, it looked more like a geranium red to me, nothing special, nothing to be excited about.</li>
      <li>I already own another red color of this matte range of Revlon</li>
      <li>&#x27;s say if you like Revlon, and the mat kind of subdued geranium red lipsticks which look like suede, then this thing is for you!</li>
      <li>By the way, I still find Revlon&#x27;s matte lipstick formulation far superior to any other and often more expansive brand&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I am very glad I decided to get this and recommend it to anyone looking for a matte (but not overly dry) red-pink-coral lip</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and makes lips look gorgeous without the use of any gloss.</li>
      <li>While it is a bright color, but it can be toned down or built up.</li>
      <li>And more I wore it, more I loved it, because it is much more than a simple geranium red, it is rather mat, and has something subdued, the color is not as simple as a geranium red, it really looks like suede (hence its name)</li>
      <li>Great summer product -hard</li>
      <li>No ma&#x27;am, the consistency of this lipstick is more sheer</li>
      <li>and I really luv this shade!</li>
      <li>Also, it seems to stay pretty well, but I don&#x27;t tend to lick or smack my lips often ;)</li>
      <li>What I do is use it first, then</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty &amp; I received compliments the first day I wore it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a lovely color &amp; it definitely gets worn out a bit!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like it, as Strawberry Suede is such a cult favorite, but it&#x27;s so out-</li>
      <li>I was actually pleased to see that it was staying a rather long time on my lips.</li>
      <li>certainly don&#x27;t regret to have it!&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>Unless your smile is super white, or you don&#x27;t mind bleaching, pick a cooler color.</li>
      <li>The SLEEK true color lipsticks have one similar but a tad more pink called Papaya Punch, I guess you could make it make it more red by wearing a lip liner but the texture and color for the price</li>
      <li>I loved this color and was hard to find in store.</li>
      <li>I expected more of matte finish, instead it was quite glossy.</li>
      <li>It looks straight up orange on me.  </li>
      <li>I really like this lip stick because of the color</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it. I paired it with a covergirl brighter shade, and it looks absolutely stunning. Great buy &amp; Great condition.</li>
    <li> If you already know the color and it is a nice shade I reccomend you to order it T Y</li>
    <li> I loved this color and was hard to find in store. So ordered from amazon and got the wrong color. It is a lipstick so its not worthy to return it back. But may be I will not purchase from amazon again. Dissapointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered these lipsticks for my daughter and she&#x27;s really enjoyed them. They were discontinued earlier this year and are impossible to find anywhere except online.</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick from Amazon because by the time I had seen beauty bloggers raving about it Revlon had already discontinued it. The lipstick arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I will definitely be buying back-ups. The matte texture really helps this very bright color look sophisticated, but sometimes the formula can feel a bit drying. Before wearing it I make sure to really condition my lips with a good balm, then blot the excess off before applying. I like to use Weleda Everon lip balm over matte lipsticks, if my lips should get dried out during the day, because it has a matte finish also. Strawberry suede is a beautiful orange toned red, which is great for the spring and summer months. It&#x27;s also nice to have a red that isn&#x27;t  dark or dramatic looking; it&#x27;s a very cheerful, wearable color, especially with my pale skin. Other reds I have tried can make me look a bit goth, but never this color. I love wearing it during the day with a casual white top and loose beachy hair, or a messy bun or braid, and simple makeup elsewhere; just some concealer, mascara and well groomed brows looks very modern and pretty. I like to tap some of the lipstick color from the tube very lightly onto the apples of my cheeks and blend it in with fingers to make the look cohesive and keep me from looking too pale. I am in my mid-twenties, and I only started being interested in lipsticks in the past year or so. I almost passed on trying this lipstick because it was discontinued, but I am so glad that I gave it a try.  I absolutely love this color and I wish Revlon would distribute it again.</li>
    <li> I really like the color of the Revelon STRAWBERRY Matte Lipstick, but I find it is too dark for old people.  I don&#x27;t like the Matte part.  What I do is use it first, then put a lighter color on and it becomes just the perfect shade for someone in their 70&#x27;s.  It would be perfect for a young girl.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, no complaints!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic matte lipstick. I&#x27;ve purchased this in Strawberry Suede and Pink About It. I love both colors BUT they are very warm which makes teeth appear more yellow. I do not drink coffee when I wear these shades. Unless your smile is super white, or you don&#x27;t mind bleaching, pick a cooler color.</li>
    <li> The color is not great on me and I thought a matte lipstick would look better on me than it does.  The price was great, but I mix it with something else to get the color and texture I want or need.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend if you have lip lines or porousness around your lips, it&#x27;ll definitely bleed but it would look much better on someone younger (probably).</li>
    <li> I found swatches of this lipstick on blogs and was bummed out when it discontinued before I had a chance to get it. I tried searching for similar duplicates but came out empty handed. The SLEEK true color lipsticks have one similar but a tad more pink called Papaya Punch, I guess you could make it make it more red by wearing a lip liner but the texture and color for the price is a steal. I am very glad I decided to get this and recommend it to anyone looking for a matte (but not overly dry) red-pink-coral lip</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous. I wish Revlon hadnt discontinued this color!</li>
    <li> I read about this color on pinterest (where else?!). It&#x27;s very bright, but pretty. It was in an article about coral colors. I have dark brunette hair with some redish highlights and fine skin tone. It&#x27;s pretty &amp; I received compliments the first day I wore it. It&#x27;s much more color than I&#x27;m used to wearing though, and I feel a little like my lips are jumping off my face haha. But, I&#x27;m going to keep trying it and see if it will grow on me a little more. I like the weight and it&#x27;s a very matte color, which I think is a good thing for a bright color. Also, it seems to stay pretty well, but I don&#x27;t tend to lick or smack my lips often ;)</li>
    <li> I love Revlon&#x27;s lipstick, I&#x27;ve almost used all brands and wasn&#x27;t satisfied, however there a small thing, this is not pure red, this is somehow orange mixed with red, but, still love it anyways.</li>
    <li> friend of mine had this but was discontinued in Ireland - was delighted to find it online :)&lt;br /&gt;So delighted I bought 3!</li>
    <li> It looks straight up orange on me.  (For reference, I have medium yellow-toned skin.)  I really wanted to like it, as Strawberry Suede is such a cult favorite, but it&#x27;s so out-there orange on me that it looks more clownish than it does statement.</li>
    <li> I came across this discontinued lipstick thinking it was going to be fantastic since many of the reviews were saying how great the product was. The colour was nice, however, I was so disappointed when it came in the mail completely melted and smushed in the tube!! I tried everything to try and sculpt it back to a useable/ presentable way but I was just so annoyed I ended up trashing it.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST red!! Sometimes with a matte finish your lips can look dry but it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and makes lips look gorgeous without the use of any gloss. Every time I wear it, I get so many compliments and &amp;#34;what color are you wearing?&amp;#34;s. I recommend this- the color is just one of those colors that will look good on just about every one. FYI, it is a bit of a pinkish red - (thus the &amp;#34;strawberry&amp;#34; in the strawberry suede). Wear it boldly for retro red lips or lightly for a beautiful natural &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; color.</li>
    <li> No ma&#x27;am, the consistency of this lipstick is more sheer then anything and the color swatch is a no-no. I like revlon lipstick because they have a decent line of matte lipsticks but this is a dud.</li>
    <li> Color appears orange-red on lips. Although has a Matte finish, still misleading . I&#x27;m  woman of color. Never purchase again!</li>
    <li> I just luve red lipstick and I really luv this shade!</li>
    <li> This lipstick goes on smooth and is a nice shade. Although nice it is not as pictured. The picture shows it as a darker red which is what I was looking for but I got a orange-red. I mean its called \\&quot;strawberry\\&quot; but the picture is more of a raspberry or dark cherry ... I mean if you are ok with a lighter orange-red color then shoot for it the quality is great but if you want what is pictured keep looking.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shade somewhere between coral, red, and orange.  It is especially intense and beautiful if worn with a pencil underneath.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> Just the right color to go with my nail polish! Product is as advertised and is reasonably priced. Great for any gal who likes shades of red.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip stick because of the color it is such a beautiful warm red but when I put it on my lips it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. It makes my lips looked chapped even if I put lip balm on before. It looks better when I add a bit of lip gloss after applying the lipstick.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lipstick and I am so glad I was able to get it from here considering this color was discontinued.</li>
    <li> the best lipstick out there - competes with all the high end products but doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like MAC does.  Great summer product -hard to find in the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I ordered and expected!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is more sheer than matte, was disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame, Revlon discontinued the shade \\&quot;Strawberry suede\\&quot;, it was their best shade in the matte lipstick collection. By the way, I still find Revlon&#x27;s matte lipstick formulation far superior to any other and often more expansive brand&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This color is not Strawberry with hints of coral. It is orange. Like pumpkin orange. Needless to say I will not be wearing this at all.</li>
    <li> A red shade that is not overwhelming and is great for every day wear.</li>
    <li> I llike the suede (matte) look to this lipstick but the color was almost a coral/red rather than the strawberry/red I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I expected more of matte finish, instead it was quite glossy. Also, the color looked a bit orange, but I do have blue undertones to my skin. It does stay on a long time!</li>
    <li> came on time, very cute color! can not wait until spring to wear it more often, its not a winterish color</li>
    <li> This was perfect! They dont make this one anymore and i was so happy to find it. She was shocked, impressed and surprised...</li>
    <li> I 1st want to say I Love This lipstick! Is the perfect lipstick for a night out... To glam up your outfit! Love the formula . 2nd of all I love the fact that the customer service is great. I had a problem with my order not been able to be delivered at my job because of the post office :/ having issues with it. However, they save the day by kindly reship my item to my house. It was faster than I expected and well now I&#x27;m a very satisfied costumer will repurchase  again and again!</li>
    <li> its ok look fine on u but if u want something classy dont go for this coz in this money u can get classy look hat i returned it ....</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find color in stores.  I would recommend this matte type lipstick to any lady because it stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> Personally love  matte color lipsticks. The perfect bright shaw of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect spring and summer pop of color. With a black outfit&lt;br /&gt;✌🏻 💋</li>
    <li> Beautiful color but it&#x27;s not as matte as I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Good quality, smooth, perfect orangey-red for day or night, vibrant matte colour that doesn&#x27;t dry your lips. One of my forever basics.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about this lipstick because I have a darker skin tone, but this color is just beautiful! It pops wonderfully, and I have gotten sooooo many compliments!!</li>
    <li> With this color lipstick you are taking a risk! A good risk! Perfect color for the spring and summer! Its a reddy orangy looking color and I think it looks good with my mocha skin!</li>
    <li> False advertisement the actual lipstick color isnot</li>
    <li> This is THE lipstick I go for when I want to add just a bit of color to my face...especially on those days I don&#x27;t want to put that much makeup on or on those days I&#x27;m just feeling blegh. While it is a bright color, but it can be toned down or built up. I absolutely love this product. And I must add that I am very disappointed with Revlon for discontinuing this color and I hope they bring it back as permanent in their matte line.</li>
    <li> I already own another red color of this matte range of Revlon so I knew how great the lipstick holds during the day.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t bleed! This color is marvelous because it changes with the color of your lip pencil. When you use a standard red the lipstick melts into the red and the general color will look redish. When you use a more coral color lip pencil the lipstick will definitively look coral! It is my new favorite color!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot more pink &amp; brighter than the picture shows. It&#x27;s still a lovely color &amp; it definitely gets worn out a bit!</li>
    <li> Makeup is a tricky thing to buy online, especially lipstick. The color is different in pictures, depending on monitors, and not all of us see color the same exact way. I can say that this lipstick was a gorgeous strawberry/coral color and I love it as a summer shade. It goes on smoothly but might dry in certain areas and would be benefited by a coat of lip balm over it.</li>
    <li> I will return it&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted orange lipstick I would have ordered it, I&#x27;m not please at all about this.</li>
    <li> Had to try this after hearing rave reviews from several youtube beauty vloggers. Was so sad to hear it was discontinued, but that doesn&#x27;t mean anything if the internet&#x27;s on your side! Wore it to work on a whim the day I got it, and could not stop getting compliments. Just the perfect red, and as per usual, just a beautiful quality matte lip from Revlon. I love it, want to buy two more before they become impossible to find.</li>
    <li> Very nice texture and good color to mix with other lip colors - it can be a little extreme..better if you have a pale skin tone</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick because a You-Tuber Beauty Guru said that it was fabulous. So, I was really curious to see what was all the fuss about. But when I received it, it looked more like a geranium red to me, nothing special, nothing to be excited about. I was a little disappointed but wore it anyway. And more I wore it, more I loved it, because it is much more than a simple geranium red, it is rather mat, and has something subdued, the color is not as simple as a geranium red, it really looks like suede (hence its name), I never had a lipstick like this one, and I actually love it.&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews saying that is was orange. It wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me to have an orange one, but I can&#x27;t really say it is orange, even not dark orange. It has a very special color that I never saw nowhere before. It is rather long-lasting, as much as a lipstick can be, all depends on how you treat it, if you go and eat right away, it will last less than if you do nothing special. I was actually pleased to see that it was staying a rather long time on my lips. And anyway, it is always possible to make touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;It is not drying on the lips, I didn&#x27;t notice that. But don&#x27;t hope it to be super-moisturizing either, it is a lipstick, not a balm or a lip butter. And it is rather opaque, with a very soft look.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don&#x27;t regret to have it!&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s say if you like Revlon, and the mat kind of subdued geranium red lipsticks which look like suede, then this thing is for you!</li>
