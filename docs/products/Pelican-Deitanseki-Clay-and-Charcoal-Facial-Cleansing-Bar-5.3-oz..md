      <li>more than one should, however if you want to use it for your body then its not a bad product.</li>
      <li>- Does a fine job.</li>
      <li>Great product, have already bought several times, will continue to use!</li>
      <li>This even works great on his back.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use anything else to keep my skin free of blemishes.  </li>
      <li>This Japanese soap is so great on skin....</li>
      <li>This facial bar really works great for both of us!</li>
      <li>I like how light scented it is, plus it is smooth to wash with and it makes my skin feel clean.</li>
      <li>It will leave your face clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love this face soap - it cleans well without drying out your skin and will remove make-up gently.</li>
      <li>unblocks pores and leaves skin super clean.</li>
      <li>before I forget there is a smell to it, not bad, but herbal.</li>
      <li>This has done wonders for my sons mild acne.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not offended by the mild woodsy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have the most sensitive skin and nose in the world</li>
      <li>Feels very clean, but not harsh.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m on my first bar.  </li>
      <li>at first it smelled like the Indian ayurvedic soap</li>
      <li>We have tried several prescriptions and over the counter acne treatments and have had ok results.</li>
      <li>I absolutely cannot live without this soap!!!</li>
      <li>- This soap leaves your skin clean, not tight.    </li>
      <li>So, when I saw this soap and read the positive reviews, I thought that I had nothing to lose.</li>
      <li>It works great for a deep cleansing of the face, but don&#x27;t overuse, or use for a few days in a row then break.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive with this method.</li>
      <li>It is very drying</li>
      <li>He uses the soap as a whole body cleanser and it does not aggitate his exzema.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for selling this item.</li>
      <li>I use it for showering for the whole body....</li>
      <li>So, for those looking for a mild soap that can possibly improve light to moderate acne, this might just be the product for you.</li>
      <li>It really does draw impurities out of the skin and keeps me smelling fresh for the entire day.  </li>
      <li>Leave my hands soft and I slapped it on my hair and it left my hair soft too (far better than the shampoo they do offer the soap doesn&#x27;t have the lousy Sodium Laureth which is the cheap suds found in most shampoos).  </li>
      <li>every day face and neck really gets the dirt off and leaves your skin soft</li>
      <li>I have been using this fabulous soap for a number of years now and would not use any other soap on my fave.  </li>
      <li>I bought one bar and cut it in half for us to use separately and it is more than enough for us.</li>
      <li>-  Helps clear acne spots.</li>
      <li>The smell is hinoki wood and natural, I assume.</li>
      <li>Bentonite helps your skin retain its natural moisture.  </li>
      <li>This bar of soap is hard to find, but worth the search.  </li>

<li> i feel like it is just like normal soap with some black color added.</li>
<li> The shape is a little unusual, it is about a regular bar of soap and then twice as long.</li>
<li> Then he simply pats his face dry with a towel before putting on moisturizer.</li>
<li> It is a hard to find product and the smell is very spa-like.</li>
<li> One bar lasts a very long time, I cut each one in thirds and get almost 4 months out of one bar.</li>
<li> &gt; If you have dry skin, you&#x27;ll need to moisturize afterwards.</li>
<li> Dry skin, oily skin...</li>
<li> I also noticed that there isn&#x27;t an overwhelming or unpleasant smell.</li>
<li> Not super sudsy, just enough to do the job.</li>
<li> I use it all the time for a face cleanser when I am feeling a pimple come on; I usually have dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me feel dry; actually it is cleansing without stripping the moisture.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days</li>
<li> I did not feel any difference, it is even worse than other normal soaps I had.</li>
<li> not worth the money spent at all.</li>
<li> It does seem antiseptic and a little drying.</li>
<li> Some may find the soap a little pricey, but it lasts for quite some time.</li>
<li> It cleans well but does not strip your skin like some other soaps do!!  </li>
<li> It is an all natural alternative to \\&quot;other\\&quot; acne applications that can be harsh and expensive.</li>
<li> My son usually wets his face with lukewarm water, rub the bar of soap in his slightly damp hands, and applies the suds to his face.</li>
<li> Try it and you&#x27;ll never go back to what you were using in the past!!!</li>
<li> While I will not say that the improvements have been immediate or obvious to the casual observer, I have noticed a gradual improvement in the texture and look of his skin.</li>
<li> Really hard to find in the US.</li>
<li> The company doesn&#x27;t even indicate whether they mean skin or hair condidtioner.  </li>
<li> Have you ever seen a Japanese woman with bad skin?</li>
<li> is a regular alcaline soap base, with kaolin clay powder, carbon powder, and papain enzymes added.</li>
<li> but i ordered the wrong quantity.</li>
<li> Usually spend $$$ on french milled soaps but the perfume is horrible and I hate smelling like a lemon verbena.</li>
<li> This soap cleans your skin well and you can use it with cold water.</li>
<li> And we haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This soap is the very best bar:) none!  Suitable for any skin type.  Japanese women have been using it for centuries.  Have you ever seen a Japanese woman with bad skin?</li>
    <li> My boyfriend never asks for me to find a product.  I am a product guru and I was suprised when he begged me to find this.  He has severe exzema and we have tried everything.  He uses the soap as a whole body cleanser and it does not aggitate his exzema.  I use it all the time for a face cleanser when I am feeling a pimple come on; I usually have dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me feel dry; actually it is cleansing without stripping the moisture.  My friend just went back to Japan and I had her buy me 25 bars!  It is a hard to find product and the smell is very spa-like.</li>
    <li> i feel like it is just like normal soap with some black color added. I did not feel any difference, it is even worse than other normal soaps I had. not worth the money spent at all.</li>
    <li> It is very drying and I do not recommend it at all for someone with sensitive/oily skin. You will find yourself reaching for the moisturizer more than one should, however if you want to use it for your body then its not a bad product. Oh yeah before I forget there is a smell to it, not bad, but herbal.</li>
    <li> I notice people with OILY skin problems are discussing this product but I have the dryest skin and HAIR of all persons on earth.  $200-300 dollar creams don&#x27;t help and neither do doctor&#x27;s prescriptions but this stuff DOES.   Don&#x27;t ignore this part of the claim-   ...Bentonite helps your skin retain its natural moisture.  Leave my hands soft and I slapped it on my hair and it left my hair soft too (far better than the shampoo they do offer the soap doesn&#x27;t have the lousy Sodium Laureth which is the cheap suds found in most shampoos).  Does it cure eczema and psoriasis? NO I have not seen evidence of that yet but I&#x27;m on my first bar.  What I&#x27;d like to know is what about the Conditioner?  The company doesn&#x27;t even indicate whether they mean skin or hair condidtioner.  Anybody know?</li>
    <li> It really does draw impurities out of the skin and keeps me smelling fresh for the entire day.  It never feels over-drying on my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this soap and I like the lather of it. I hope it makes me beautiful. :-)</li>
    <li> I quite like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Here is my description:&lt;br /&gt;It is a regular alcaline soap base, with kaolin clay powder, carbon powder, and papain enzymes added. The shape is a little unusual, it is about a regular bar of soap and then twice as long. The color seems to keep changing from greenish to greyish. It lathers very easily. The smell took me a while to figure out...at first it smelled like the Indian ayurvedic soap Chandrika but now I realize it smells like Pine Sol (Dettol, if you&#x27;re from the UK). I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days but I like it. It does seem antiseptic and a little drying. I bet it is amazing for stopping blackheads and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I got a bar at the Japan store in Epcot for $12.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I received some these soaps as a gift.  My wife, who has very fair skin, is very happy with them.  Feels very clean, but not harsh.  Only problem.  Really hard to find in the US.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fabulous soap for a number of years now and would not use any other soap on my fave.  It cleans well but does not strip your skin like some other soaps do!!  I love love love this product and have bought bars of it as gifts for friends!!! Try it and you&#x27;ll never go back to what you were using in the past!!!</li>
    <li> I love this face soap - it cleans well without drying out your skin and will remove make-up gently.</li>
    <li> I used this soap while stationed in Japan.  I am so glad to have found it again on Amazon.     - This soap leaves your skin clean, not tight.    - It has a l nice smooth texture, feels good and refreshing.     - No astringent or medicinal smell or feel.    -  Helps clear acne spots. No residue.      - Does a fine job. Lathers nicely. Does not smell like charcoal/clay, but you know these elements are at work.   Very good purchase for those who want a soap that is not frilly, but very functional.   - Love it.  I&#x27;ve been using Asian products for years, and this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> If I can buy 10 years stockpile of this soap, I would. This is the best soap, bar none (no pun intended). Usually spend $$$ on french milled soaps but the perfume is horrible and I hate smelling like a lemon verbena. This Japanese soap is so great on skin....esp. on face....unblocks pores and leaves skin super clean. The smell is hinoki wood and natural, I assume. I have the most sensitive skin and nose in the world and I&#x27;m not offended by the mild woodsy fragrance. This is the finest soap you can buy. Lasts longer than most soaps I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have dry skin, you&#x27;ll need to moisturize afterwards. If you have normal to oily skin, this leaves your skin feeling great for many hours.</li>
    <li> This  is the second bar of Pelican Deitanseki Clay &amp; Charcoal Facial Cleanser that I have purchased for my 14-year-old son. We have tried several prescriptions and over the counter acne treatments and have had ok results. So, when I saw this soap and read the positive reviews, I thought that I had nothing to lose. And we haven&#x27;t been disappointed. While I will not say that the improvements have been immediate or obvious to the casual observer, I have noticed a gradual improvement in the texture and look of his skin. Some may find the soap a little pricey, but it lasts for quite some time. My son only uses this product on his face, twice a day, and doesn&#x27;t leave it in the shower where it would likely dissolve. I also noticed that there isn&#x27;t an overwhelming or unpleasant smell. My son usually wets his face with lukewarm water, rub the bar of soap in his slightly damp hands, and applies the suds to his face. Then he simply pats his face dry with a towel before putting on moisturizer. So, for those looking for a mild soap that can possibly improve light to moderate acne, this might just be the product for you.</li>
    <li> Use this to shave, works better than anything out there. It works great for a deep cleansing of the face, but don&#x27;t overuse, or use for a few days in a row then break. Breaks your face out because its pulling all the impurities out. Unless you cleanse from inside out, you will always be pulling stuff out of your skin :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely cannot live without this soap!!! I suffer from dyshidrotic eczema with systemic dermatitis and this is the best soap I&#x27;ve been able to find in 20 years!! Dry skin, oily skin...whatever...this soap, pricey as it is, is the best you&#x27;ll find for any skin type.</li>
    <li> Very nice bar of soap.  It will leave your face clean and smooth.  I have been using for about a week and no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of problems with oily skin and sebum secretions.  I get occasional acne on my back and chin.  This bar of soap is hard to find, but worth the search.  I don&#x27;t have to use anything else to keep my skin free of blemishes.  I use it daily and swear by it.  If you have these problems...try this product.  It is an all natural alternative to \\&quot;other\\&quot; acne applications that can be harsh and expensive.</li>
    <li> Bar soap-----What can one say about it? But I love this product! I use it for showering for the whole body....not just facial....I like the aroma and texture and sudsing........good, practical bar soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and my teenage daughter to use. I am almost 40 and she is 13, and so with our different ages we have different skin types. This facial bar really works great for both of us! I like how light scented it is, plus it is smooth to wash with and it makes my skin feel clean. My daughter has the normal teen acne and she loves it as well, her skin has gotten clearer over the months and is breaking out less. I bought one bar and cut it in half for us to use separately and it is more than enough for us. Great product, have already bought several times, will continue to use!</li>
    <li> This soap cleans your skin well and you can use it with cold water. If you travel, this is a good soap to take along</li>
    <li> every day face and neck really gets the dirt off and leaves your skin soft I will buy it again i just did but i ordered the wrong quantity.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Not super sudsy, just enough to do the job. Cleans without stripping the basic moisture out of my skin. One bar lasts a very long time, I cut each one in thirds and get almost 4 months out of one bar. Very inexpensive with this method.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my sons mild acne. We have tried all kinds of different soaps. This even works great on his back. Thanks for selling this item.</li>
