      <li>This stuff is amazing holds like nothing I have ever used before.</li>
      <li>This Gel by far is some of the best stuff on the market.</li>
      <li>The best edge gel I have used thus far.</li>
      <li>All I can say is that it is by far the best hair gel to manage his wavy, easy to friz hair!</li>
      <li>i AM CURRENTLY DEPLOYED  in Afghanistan, and my hair is perfectly in a sock bun all day.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this gel for my son&#x27;s hair, I tried looking for it all over</li>
      <li>So glad that this company has this product. . .</li>
      <li>The hold is okay</li>
      <li>LOVES the product, and I&#x27;m glad that he will take care of his hair.  </li>
      <li>Fell in love with it immediately.</li>
      <li>Holds perfectly all day long!  </li>
      <li>It works great, it is cheap and it was shipped fast.</li>
      <li>good price fast shipping</li>
      <li>It has a really gross consistency, but it smells great and it really works!!!!</li>
      <li>Holds my short spiked front hairstyle great, and if my hair gets messed up from hats or whatever</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Both of us enjoy our wet-look curls that stay smooth and well-defined all day...and even through a night of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My 9-yr-old son has wavy hair that frizzes super easy.</li>
      <li>This gel is thick and provides the perfect amount of hold for his hair.</li>
      <li>I got a 6pk for the same price I can get 1 bottle of a not so good product at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>Luckily I found it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My hair wins and flops every time until GSG.</li>
      <li>order more when supply gets low.</li>
      <li>i love it, extra mega hold.</li>
      <li>Ok, I have tried several gels for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>this gel works so well that I literally haven&#x27;t showered in at least 4 days and my hair still looks great</li>
      <li>So much so, that we jokingly have battles:</li>
      <li>He loves it so much, he wants to grow his hair out the way it was when he was a baby (he had &amp;#34;Maxwell&amp;#34; looking hair).</li>
      <li>It really does keep your hair in line.</li>
      <li>My son is, also, very tender-headed, so combing it is out of the question.</li>
      <li>so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
      <li>and so I didn&#x27;t want any flakes as so many other gels will cause.</li>
      <li>I had tried so many products to help tame it without much luck.</li>
      <li>, it doesnt turn to white flakes like so many other gels.  </li>
      <li>I stumbled across it at a beauty show in Puerto Rico, and it is HUGE down there.  </li>
      <li>I would spend a little extra money on something better.</li>
      <li>I have semi-curly hair, but I can actually use this stuff to make it straight</li>
      <li>son has naturally curly hair, as well.</li>
      <li>Ok, so the name is retarded, but this seriously is the best hair gel i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>many other gel&#x27;s this was another selling point for me other than price</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t live flakes or white residue.  </li>
      <li>Being African Amercian with natural hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s naturally curly and it either falls flat or frizzes throughout the day.</li>

    <li> good price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. i love it, extra mega hold.</li>
    <li> I found this product in my local hispanic beauty shop. Fell in love with it immediately. This stuff is like glue! Just what I wanted. lol</li>
    <li> Ok, so the name is retarded, but this seriously is the best hair gel i&#x27;ve ever used.  I stumbled across it at a beauty show in Puerto Rico, and it is HUGE down there.  Holds my short spiked front hairstyle great, and if my hair gets messed up from hats or whatever, it doesnt turn to white flakes like so many other gels.  I&#x27;m hooked for good.  I use to use spiker, or dep...but now i&#x27;m moco or nothing</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this gel for my son&#x27;s hair, I tried looking for it all over once I moved from the west coast to the east and couldn&#x27;t find it! Luckily I found it here on Amazon. My son has thick hair that stands straight up so we cant use any thin or water gel. This gel is thick and provides the perfect amount of hold for his hair. The scent is a plus, it smells great.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product and I can honestly say its the best stuff I have ever used.  At first  was skeptical but gave it a shot and now its the only thing I use.  Best part about this product is it does not flake like many other gel&#x27;s this was another selling point for me other than price</li>
    <li> My 9-yr-old son has wavy hair that frizzes super easy. I had tried so many products to help tame it without much luck. Someone told me about the \\&quot;Yellow Gorilla Snot\\&quot; hair gel so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. All I can say is that it is by far the best hair gel to manage his wavy, easy to friz hair! It gives it the semi-wet look and holds all day! We have received so many compliments on his hair style since we embraced the curl using this hair gel!</li>
    <li> Bought this once at a market when I ran out of gel on vacation. This stuff is amazing holds like nothing I have ever used before. I have semi-curly hair, but I can actually use this stuff to make it straight and it holds for hours (you can even add water the next morning which is gross but umm it was vegas...) No flaking!!I have tried lots of other product but nothing holds like SNOT!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, it makes your hair as hard as concrete. I don&#x27;t think a hurricane could mess your hair up with this gel.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with 3c/4a hair. It&#x27;s naturally curly and it either falls flat or frizzes throughout the day. I have a mohawk now, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to stand up high...until Gorilla Snot Gel. Man, this stuff is the bomb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has naturally curly hair, as well. His is always turning into a bushy afro as soon as it dries and he steps out the door. My son is, also, very tender-headed, so combing it is out of the question. With GSG, I can wet his hair, put in some curl activator, pull the comb through it like butter and it dries into &amp;#34;wet-look&amp;#34; curls. He loves it so much, he wants to grow his hair out the way it was when he was a baby (he had &amp;#34;Maxwell&amp;#34; looking hair). Both of us enjoy our wet-look curls that stay smooth and well-defined all day...and even through a night of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all kinds of gels on my hair. So much so, that we jokingly have battles: My Hair vs. The Gel. My hair wins and flops every time until GSG. As a matter of fact, one curl at the base of my neck was so stiff it poked me in my neck all day and hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you want super, serious, gravity-defying hold.</li>
    <li> For the money a great gel that washes out with water and doesn&#x27;t flake.  Good purchase for my tween son</li>
    <li> So glad that this company has this product. . . couldn&#x27;t find it locally anymore. . . and a GREAT price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He LOVES the product, and I&#x27;m glad that he will take care of his hair.  It&#x27;s a WIN/WIN for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company, on-time delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order more when supply gets low.</li>
    <li> you get so many of these for a great price.  It works great I actually prefer the one in the jar but this is one is good and again plenty to share.</li>
    <li> great product great price!</li>
    <li> Great!!! Only gel that stays!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair gel! I love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t live flakes or white residue.  Holds perfectly all day long!  I would buy again and would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy  curly hair and this product holds hair in GREAT place!!! i AM CURRENTLY DEPLOYED  in Afghanistan, and my hair is perfectly in a sock bun all day.</li>
    <li> This Gel by far is some of the best stuff on the market. I still havent gone threw 2 bottles packaging was not that great but the product A++++</li>
    <li> It has a really gross consistency, but it smells great and it really works!!!!</li>
    <li> I would spend a little extra money on something better. The consistency of the gel is just gross. After it dries up and when you get it wet again, (like if it rains or in the shower) it goes back to that gross gooey texture. The hold is okay but a little flaky.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have tried several gels for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She competes in gymnastics and needs hair that will stay in curls for several hours while competing. I tried this as a setting gel for her hair and LOVED it. Plus, she has dark hair and so I didn&#x27;t want any flakes as so many other gels will cause. Her hair stayed perfectly curled for the 4 hr. meet and beyond. I am definitely now sold on this product. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff beats out all of the rest.It will make a hair stand up on a table.Ha-Ha But very true it is the best for holding even the toughest hair where you want it.The only thing is that someone said they puchased it at Walgreen&#x27;s for $2.00 per bottle and I paid $4.00 per bottle.Bummer.</li>
    <li> they are the best gel ever</li>
    <li> It works great, it is cheap and it was shipped fast. I got a 6pk for the same price I can get 1 bottle of a not so good product at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! The best edge gel I have used thus far. It really does keep your hair in line. Being African Amercian with natural hair I needed something to keep my edges slick and this definitely did the job. I ordered this stuff the beginning of the summer and it wasn&#x27;t until now that I realized the affect it has on my hair. I now have NO EDGES because of this stuff. I&#x27;m very sad, I loveeee it but had to throw it out because of how my hair reacted to it. Wonder if this has happened to anyone else.</li>
    <li> this gel works so well that I literally haven&#x27;t showered in at least 4 days and my hair still looks great</li>
