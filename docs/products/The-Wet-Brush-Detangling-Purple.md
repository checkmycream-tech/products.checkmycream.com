      <li>so easily i would always cringe when a stylist would try to rake a brush through my hair knowing it would hurt</li>
      <li>From the moment I started using it my girls noticed a huge difference.</li>
      <li>2 women at the store, one with 2 kids next to her, said how great it works.</li>
      <li>like I do with all my many other brushes, which is great</li>
      <li>Best of all, no more pain.</li>
      <li>Believe me, this brush is well worth the $9!</li>
      <li>My daughter has very fine straight hair</li>
      <li>and it comes right out!</li>
      <li>He loved being brushed by this brush when I was playing with him one morning.</li>
      <li>This brush is so good, I am thinking to buy a 3rd one just in case they stop making it.  </li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s not a bad brush, it just didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I loved the new wet brush; it works amazingly</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more of these in the future :).</li>
      <li>Love my new brush.</li>
      <li>It really does a great job of detangling my fine, but very thick hair that gets tangled very easily.  </li>
      <li>Definitely one of my better investments!</li>
      <li>The Wet Brush is a great product for your hair, it actually detangle your hair, and I love the colors</li>
      <li>; well worth it.</li>
      <li>i didnt even like brushing my hair because i have a sensitive scalp until this brush its like magic</li>
      <li>I have to order a few more, so I can have my own, and one to keep in my bag as well.</li>
      <li>this is a great brush, my daughter loves it, no more fussing with her to let me brush her hair</li>
      <li>Overall I absolutely LOVE this brush now.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist first told me about it</li>
      <li>and I love all the different colors for all of the family!</li>
      <li>Overall satisfied with the brush.</li>
      <li>they tell me it fels much better than a regular brush.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than a regular brush</li>
      <li>This has improved her daily brushing routine, and is great after a shower with wet head.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out of wet hair very easy at all.</li>
      <li>well wish the quality was a little better after 1 use a couple of bristles fell out however this has been the best design for my daughters very thick hair</li>
      <li>I had no idea there was a market of gentle brushers.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very curly, wavy and often frizzy.</li>
      <li>I poured the detangler stuff on, and all that really did was make my hair oily.</li>
      <li>Today, after most of my friends raved about it, I purchased The Wet Brush...</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not completely tangle free, it does not hurt my daughters head</li>
      <li>My old brush was the goody ouchless; it worked pretty well</li>
      <li>My hair is not very thick, straight hair with little texture, and it knots VERY easily.</li>
      <li>(she is 5), and I use it myself as well, and I can tell a difference, it even adds some more volume to my hair, and I don&#x27;t have the mess of hair in the brush</li>
      <li>It has less pull and feels a lot better than a comb or a normal brush.</li>
      <li>We have tried a few other brushes for wet hair and this one seems to be the best.</li>
      <li>The handle is very soft.</li>
      <li>We brush her hair wet or dry and it is practically magical.</li>
      <li>I purchased this  for my granddaughter who has long, long wavy, fine hair that always tangles.  </li>
      <li>My 10 year old granddaughter has had sensitive head/hair brushing issues since she was a toddler.  </li>
      <li>With a lot, I mean a lot, of spray detangler we were able to comb through her hair with this brush without her screaming.  </li>
      <li>The Wet Brush goes right through my hair without getting caught and pulling on my hair.</li>
      <li>Works much better than any other brush we have tried to use on long wet hair.</li>
      <li>My family is full of curly haired women and it pains them to brush it after a shower, got this and no more</li>
      <li>Maybe Ok for thin hair.</li>
      <li>Today when I took my hair out, I brushed through it quickly once and it looked as if it had just been blow dried.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a spare for the same brush that I bought locally for my young daughter.  </li>

    <li> LOVE! best brush in the world. it was received in perfect condition and looked exactly like the picture provided online.</li>
    <li> I have long Thick blonde hair that tangles so easily i would always cringe when a stylist would try to rake a brush through my hair knowing it would hurt i didnt even like brushing my hair because i have a sensitive scalp until this brush its like magic</li>
    <li> My daughter has very fine straight hair and she wakes up every morning with a birds nest in the back. I spray a little watered down conditioner in her hair and use this and it comes right out! I was ver skeptical about it and put off buying it for a while, but last week I was determined to find something because I hate that she screams and cries every morning. 2 women at the store, one with 2 kids next to her, said how great it works. Glad I got it! Finally, no more tears!</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush is a great product for your hair, it actually detangle your hair, and I love the colors</li>
    <li> Slips through my waist-length hair SO EASILY, no matter if it&#x27;s wet or dry! Using it EVERY DAY. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a spare for the same brush that I bought locally for my young daughter.  She is 8 and has waist length hair and no tolerance for it being pulled while brushing.  This brush is so good, I am thinking to buy a 3rd one just in case they stop making it.  We brush her hair wet or dry and it is practically magical.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my daughter who has very long hair. It works well for brushing it either wet or dry. I also like using it on my own hair which is medium length. The handle is very soft. Overall a great brush for a good price. I will be purchasing more of these in the future :).</li>
    <li> This brush works perfectly for fine hair. I got it for my wife who was always saying &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; when she brushed her hair after washing. Now she says &amp;#34;this brush works great!&amp;#34; No more ouches while she tries to untangle her wet hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My little cousin has hair that is like straw she is 4 and has the longest and thickest hair before we ordered this her hair was so hard to brush but now it glides through her hair without a problem this brush is the best we love it!!!!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m an average 14 year old girl, i like doing different styles with my hair and things like that. for the longest time, I had trouble styling it because it was so knotted. My hair is not very thick, straight hair with little texture, and it knots VERY easily. My old brush was the goody ouchless; it worked pretty well but it still hurt when i tried to get knots out. I also found myself using loads of detangler spray every time i tried to brush through my hair. Today, after most of my friends raved about it, I purchased The Wet Brush... it is the best brush I have ever owned. The Wet Brush goes right through my hair without getting caught and pulling on my hair. I also play competitive travel softball so my hair is often in a ponytail. In the past, when i took my hair out of the ponytail it stay in an odd shape until i brushed, and brushed, and brushed it, and even then it would look funky. Today when I took my hair out, I brushed through it quickly once and it looked as if it had just been blow dried. Overall I absolutely LOVE this brush now. It is a gift from the hair gods and everyone should buy it! Believe me, this brush is well worth the $9!</li>
    <li> This does a great job and exceeded expectations. Works much better than any other brush we have tried to use on long wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for detangling hair by far that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s a miracle!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> My daughter was given this brush as a gift and it was such a miracle I was sneaking in to her room to use it. I bought this one for myself and no longer want to use any other brush. Not only does it painlessly brush out tangles it also makes your hair look beautiful for hours.</li>
    <li> Glides through hair very nice. Although it&#x27;s not completely tangle free, it does not hurt my daughters head and we found less hair breakage! Overall satisfied with the brush.</li>
    <li> The brush lives up to it&#x27;s promise.  My hair is very dry and when I get out of the shower, it&#x27;s all balled up.  The Wet Brush softly untangles my hair.  WITHOUT pain!! Love my new brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick hair the product works well wish the quality was a little better after 1 use a couple of bristles fell out however this has been the best design for my daughters very thick hair and I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly, wavy and often frizzy. I like how this brush can glide through my hair wet or dry and not pull hair out. When I&#x27;m pulling my hair back for a bun or ponytail and need smoothness this does the trick.</li>
    <li> This brush has made getting the tangles out of curly hair SO much easier &amp; less painful. Loved it so much I bought 3 more so everyone with any kind of hair length here has their own. My hair stylist first told me about it &amp; I&#x27;m very glad she did; well worth it.</li>
    <li> WHAT MARVELOUS WITCHCRAFT IS THIS?? I bought this brush by happenstance, based solely on Amazon reviews, and holy mackerel this thing WORKS! I used to pull out chunks of my fine hair trying to brush it out after showering- ouch! I poured the detangler stuff on, and all that really did was make my hair oily. But now I don&#x27;t even need detangler. And my hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged and pulled out. Best of all, no more pain. AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT WORKS. It looks like a regular brush. It FEELS like a regular brush. I am mystified, but I&#x27;m always showing it to people now and I plan on buying more as gifts. Spread the magic around!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this  for my granddaughter who has long, long wavy, fine hair that always tangles.  With a lot, I mean a lot, of spray detangler we were able to comb through her hair with this brush without her screaming.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than a regular brush - it&#x27;s not a bad brush, it just didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I loved the new wet brush; it works amazingly and I love all the different colors for all of the family!</li>
    <li> I have long bleached hair. Any other brush would take 10 minutes to brush my hair, and then my hair would break off so badly from tugging. But the wet brush cuts my brush time in half, without ripping my hair out. Definitely one of my better investments! Very happy!!!</li>
    <li> My family is full of curly haired women and it pains them to brush it after a shower, got this and no more oh&#x27;s, ouch&#x27;s and ah&#x27;s...now it&#x27;s just aaah and oooooh and done in half the time...LOL</li>
    <li> My girls love this brush. From the moment I started using it my girls noticed a huge difference. No more tears!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush so I&#x27;d have a second one in the bedroom for when I rinse off at night (my other brush is in my office room).  It really does a great job of detangling my fine, but very thick hair that gets tangled very easily.  I&#x27;m actually thinking of getting another one to use on my Maine Coon who has just recently started getting mats.  He loved being brushed by this brush when I was playing with him one morning.</li>
    <li> Works well on my children&#x27;s wet hair- they tell me it fels much better than a regular brush. We have tried a few other brushes for wet hair and this one seems to be the best.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old granddaughter has had sensitive head/hair brushing issues since she was a toddler.  I had no idea there was a market of gentle brushers.  This has improved her daily brushing routine, and is great after a shower with wet head.  It doesn&#x27;t eliminate tangles, but it is easier on her to brush.  Wish I had one years ago.</li>
    <li> this is a great brush, my daughter loves it, no more fussing with her to let me brush her hair she does it herself, then I just go over it (she is 5), and I use it myself as well, and I can tell a difference, it even adds some more volume to my hair, and I don&#x27;t have the mess of hair in the brush like I do with all my many other brushes, which is great, I know this sounds stupid, and I don&#x27;t know what it is about this brush, but it does what it says, and I use it on wet and dry hair both, with the same results! I have to order a few more, so I can have my own, and one to keep in my bag as well. I recommend this for anyone with kids, and for everybody else as well! :)</li>
