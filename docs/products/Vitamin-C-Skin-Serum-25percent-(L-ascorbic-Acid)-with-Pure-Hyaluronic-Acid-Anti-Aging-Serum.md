      <li>I was looking for a high vitamin c concentration serum for a good price and subsequently bought this to eradicate nodular basal cell carcinomas on my arms.</li>
      <li>The consistency of this serum is more gel-like than water-like, which I love because it isn&#x27;t as messy and runny to apply.</li>

      <li>It really works well.  </li>
      <li>Very sticky feeling</li>
      <li>and I find it to be of high quality.  </li>
      <li>Rather than a light watery serum, like other L-Ascorbic acid serums, this one is gooey.  </li>
      <li>It came fresh and clear, as it should be, not yellow and smelly (when it&#x27;s oxidized).</li>
      <li>It is clear when you apply it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product especially for mature skin over age 50!  </li>
      <li>The strange thing is that I compared the ingredients listed on the old bottle with those listed on the new bottle, and no changes were listed.</li>
      <li>You can actually feel a slight sting when I first apply it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started to use this product for the past three weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes to my skin as yet. I&#x27;ll continue to use it a little longer</li>
    <li> Using this in conjunction with phytoceramides. Life is an experiment.</li>
    <li> This product is simply perfection. Absorbs easily..You only need a couple of drops and three are visible result just after a week or two. i&#x27;m a happy camper!!!</li>
    <li> Had a wierd smell, and felt strange when applied.  Maybe it works, but I was too put off by it.</li>
    <li> Very sticky feeling and it stings my face.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t bother to finish the bottle, a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product it really works</li>
    <li> I was looking for a high vitamin c concentration serum for a good price and subsequently bought this to eradicate nodular basal cell carcinomas on my arms. I&#x27;ve used this for approximately one month and it is doing its job.</li>
    <li> Good product. Tightens my skin a bit once it dries so I need a moisturizef on top. Leaving my skin with a nice texture.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I originally bought it to use on my face, and it is working beautifully.  My skin looks brighter with a more even tone so I decided to try it on my arms which showed a lot of sun damage.  Within a few weeks, that permanent tan that I&#x27;d been looking at for years slowly started to fade as well.  I&#x27;ve only been using this once a day for about a month so I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in 6 months.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in my skin or improvement in wrinkles. It was delivered quickly and in one piece. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s actually suppose to do because I see no difference or improvements.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing has my skin glowing and looking very much younger I love it,and the price is great.i will continue to use this product,I love it.</li>
    <li> Very thick and feels great on your skin!  I have only used this for a short time, but I like it.  I also use this serum when I micro-needle my face!</li>
    <li> I am in the process of making my own face cream and want to eliminate many of the fillers and unecessary  ingredients  which manufacturers add to make more profit by cutting back on the amounts of the active good ingredients. One of the ingredients is Vit. C and the other is hyaluronic acid. So this product will fill both needs.</li>
    <li> Really excellent purity and results.  I have used many vit C creams and products.  I have gotten the most wonderful results with JJ products.  Thank you for your products.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this two weeks but disappointed as no noticeable results as yet. Perhaps a higher strength product would be more effective...do JJ Labs have a higher strength one? Reasonable price though.</li>
    <li> This product is pure gold, saw a great improvement in my skin with in a week clearer brighter, smoother and soft .the lines around my eyes and top lip GONE even the two lines from my nose to the side of my mouth nearly gone ,I love this product will buy again great value for money, everyone asking what have you done you look great just the effect I wanted .</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Vitamin C Serum and use it every day. Just cant go a day without it now. Love it! Its too soon to know but am hoping it is making a differance on how I look and I will know if people start commenting on it how I look. Thank you again for this product.</li>
    <li> This a truly great skin care product.  I was using the Obagi C Serum 20% previously but felt I really needed something a bit stronger.  I love JJ Labs Skin Solutions Vitamin C Skin Serum 25% (L-ascorbic Acid) with Hyarlonic Acid.  What a great combination and it arrives so fresh and pure.  You can actually feel a slight sting when I first apply it so I know it it potent and doing its job!  I highly recommend this product especially for mature skin over age 50!  It really works well.  I buy the 2 ounce bottle as I tend to use it liberally and I use it for the entire neck, chin and face areas (from the very bottom of my neck to the top of my farhead).  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It is priced extremely fairly which keeps me coming back month over month to buy it.  I give this product 5+ Stars!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly and see results.  I would  highly recommand theis product to anyone who wants smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing - great results in less than 2 months.</li>
    <li> Love Vitamin C, especially when it adds HA to it.  Searched online for some time and found good reviews about this seller.  I use the product every day and I find it to be of high quality.  I am a licensed Aesthetician; so, I know what is good.....and this product is.....THANKS.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this item for abt 3 weeks, I havent noticed any difference yet, I m going to give it a little more time to let it work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before and really liked it, but I just repurchased and the texture and consistency of the product has changed. The strange thing is that I compared the ingredients listed on the old bottle with those listed on the new bottle, and no changes were listed.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. The consistency of this serum is more gel-like than water-like, which I love because it isn&#x27;t as messy and runny to apply. It is sticky though, but that isn&#x27;t a problem with my since I am using it before bed and once it dries I apply my night moisturizer over it so it isn&#x27;t sticky at all. It came fresh and clear, as it should be, not yellow and smelly (when it&#x27;s oxidized). This also has LAA which is the most pure and proven to be the most effective form of vitamin C. Aside from the product itself, the shipment arrived lightning fast. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this. I&#x27;m 49 years old with smooth bright skin. Zero breakouts and faded my tiny scars and freckles !</li>
    <li> Rather than a light watery serum, like other L-Ascorbic acid serums, this one is gooey.  I apply this at night, and when I wash my face in the morning there are yellow stains my washcloth.  This leads me to believe that this serum does not soak into your skin. It also stains my pillowcase.  It is clear when you apply it.  As you know, Vit. C turns yellow when it is no longer effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a different brand and threw this away.</li>
