<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Any good hair product that can make natural hair sleek is a must have and Design Essentials has the best edge control. You won&#x27;t regret buying.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected but its ok..</li>
    <li> I always use this for my edges and when i twist my hair back. It holds and you can still brush through it the next day.  My 6yr old daughter cut her hair and I put this on it to hold the short part down and it held all day.  Smells really good also.  I wanted my own since my hair stylist uses this brand in my hair anyway.</li>
    <li> it makes my hair itchy to be honest. its too late to return it ugh. it does not last and work well only on front of my hair like baby hair and not for long lol. i dont like it. it is also so sticky</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really hold my edges down.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hairdresser uses it, and I was buying it fr her because O couldn&#x27;t find it in the beauty supply stored I&#x27;m my strs&lt;br /&gt; Last ALL DAY!/And it&#x27;s not greasy!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have a perm and this leaves my hair tangled free</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It keeps my edges nice and smooth without becoming flaky (liek with gels).  It also has a very nice scent.  A little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I had been shopping around to find an edge control that would work on my hair while it was straightened. After failed attempts with many others, I finally heard about Design Essentials! It&#x27;s able to give my hair a lasting hold throughout the day. I night reapply once for an extra slickness. I selected 2-day shipping and it can me it one day. Super please, I love it!</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Let white residue! What a waste of money. Never again.</li>
    <li> I Love this product, I am in the process of going natural, and this product, really helped with keeping my edges under control.It straightened my hair as if I had relaxer in it. I would recommend this product if you are in need of a great edge control gel.</li>
    <li> This product does not hold your ends down.  You will be replacing it every hour.  Leaves a white sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I am African American/Panamanian. I have course hair. This product works good for me. I use Hicks and then Design Essential to catch the little fly away hairs. I really like it. I do, however, have to wash my hair more often because of the build up. I did have one small issue the last time I ordrered it. The top was cracked and now the top does not fit. Thus, I have to put it in a plastic zip lock to keep it protected from dust, etc. -- paying so much for a product and then having to place it in a zip-lock bag does not sit well with me. But, regarding the product...it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is OK.  If your goal is to smooth your edges down at the end of styling, it does that.  My issues:  I find that I have to use a lot of it, much more than I expected.  Also, it&#x27;s a product that I have to use everyday.  I wanted something that would hold for at least a day or two.  In fact, I carry it in my purse on long days so that I can reapply.  Also, it is prone to build-up.  After a few days, I want to just wash my hair to get it out.  I&#x27;m going to try another edge control product when I finish up the last of this one.</li>
    <li> Does not hold my edges very well. Lasts only a few hours.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Love the product!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I wanted...it was used at a salon and I had to have it! A very little bit of product is needed to smooth down the edges...if you use too much it will be flaky! Shipping was super fast.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> The best out there after optimum.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great...laid my edges down very well! I&#x27;ll defiantly purchase this item again.. Whoever created this stuff is a genius</li>
    <li> The best so far n I have tried many</li>
    <li> Great gel and works well for black people hair. I love it and I order it for my daughter too!</li>
    <li> i love the way this product feels and it doesn&#x27;t take much to hold your edges in place. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great gel for natural hair.  Does well for my edges.</li>
    <li> To me this product is just okay, the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is very oily and makes the hair look wet/greasy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more like a jam on natural hair soon as the humidity gets to it, it is no longer sleek and laid. It&#x27;s shiny and oily</li>
    <li> it flakes, dries with a white residue &amp; doesn&#x27;t hold. I was very surprised because I love Design Essential products, but this one lands a big fat ZERO! The only upside is it smells nice...</li>
    <li> it lays your edges down but you need to put a headband on for 5 minutes to make sure it dtsys slicked down. its an PLAY product/average not bad.</li>
    <li> Love this product...by far the best I used soo far</li>
    <li> This product was expensive, and does not perform as expected. There are cheaper products on the market that does a much better job of molding hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think edge control is meant for my hair. Used this product and 30 minutes to an hour later my hair was back to its original form.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> For those that are saying its too greasy or oily &amp; etc.. its probably bc this product is made for a more ethnic hair type. Thin or Caucasian hair would be weighed down by this product, whereas with thicker &amp; kinky-er or curly hair this product is perfect. I have used several types of edge controls &amp; gels...but this works best. Only need to apply once, &amp; it holds all day. So dont let the negative reviews scare you. This is a professional salon product and can not be purchased just anywhere so this is a steal!!!</li>
    <li> This edge control is rather pricy but you just need a little to use on your edges to keep it going so its worth the price</li>
    <li> This works just OK. It&#x27;s so thick and doesn&#x27;t really keep the edges down for very long. So maybe you have to apply more, but its so thick that it&#x27;s just too much buildup on your hair. I&#x27;m going to keep looking. I prefer a lighter gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an edge control that doesn&#x27;t flake nor turn white.  Well I found it and this is it. The complaint I have is that it&#x27;s too costly. . But it works. .</li>
    <li> I have thick hair; and no matter if I recently had a relaxer or not, this product gives me great edge control! I love it! It also doesn&#x27;t leave that white film that some other edge control products do. Great product. And I&#x27;m overjoyed that amazon sells it because I was purchasing it my stylist; but I stopped going to her. So thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold but it will at least put them down initially, which is more than I can say for anything else I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I was instructed by my younger sister to try this for the &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; of my hairline so that I would not have to chemically straighten my hair as often. It worked!!! It smooths my edges nicely. It does not last as long as I would have hoped but it certainly prevents me from having to drag out my flat iron as often in the morning and that saves me time. When you only need your edges straightened but want to &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; your hair, this is the answer.</li>
    <li> PERFECT for my edges- no residue, no white build up</li>
    <li> I have ethnic hair somewhere between a 3 and 4 hair type I guess. All natural, no chemicals,  just heat from blow drying and the occasional beveling/curling.&lt;br /&gt;Two main issues with my \\&quot;natural look\\&quot; are \\&quot;summer frizz\\&quot;(or anywhere hot) and my unruly edges, so I tested this product. At first it was great, but by the end of the day I had a dull white sticky film on my edges. Other users on here suggested using a bit more product to rectify that issue,  and that did work...but just for a few hours. Again, by the end of the day the dull white film is back, and now its&#x27;s caked up.  I think this will work best on wet hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m returning this and moving on to the KeraCare Edge Tamer I purchased from here also. I&#x27;ll let you know how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you all!</li>
    <li> smells nice but i find it leaves a white residue if my hair isn&#x27;t completely clean other than that it keeps my edges all the way down my whole day  would buy again</li>
    <li> I love this Edge Control. It is perfect for my natural hair and i was really surprised it even worked well with me because of my really thick hair. Definitely would recommend to all natural hair people.</li>
    <li> Like this better than any other I have tried so far</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Discovered it about 2 years ago and I purchase it by the load. I started my natural hair journey about 6 months ago and it makes my edges look like I still have permed hair. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> Very good product for controlling edges. Best edge control on the market.  Keeps hair in place fora week without reapplying.</li>
    <li> Not as sticky and putty like as others! Best when used with a tiny little brush-- sometimes i use a toothbrush to brush this through my edges and that works well (not my normal toothbrush, one designated for this purpose). I found that it&#x27;s best when i brush the baby hairs then while the hair is held taught, just smooth this right over.</li>
    <li> This straightens my edges and is an excellent product.  It is effective and not greasy.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with natural hair. ...this product smells so good and works so well. It doesnt flake and doesn&#x27;t look like you put a bunch of gel on your edges...it keeps my edges smoothed down however I do recommend brushing your edges down after you apply it. I will definitely keep using this!</li>
    <li> If I order some more of this product, I will have a hole in my head</li>
    <li> Ok, this works unbelievably well. I have locks and my ends are very coarse. Also it really creates an illusion of thickness, my fine hairs and the slight balding I have in front..it covers it up perfectly. No crazy, greasy residue, no leakage on pillowcases or clothes.. Last almost 24 hrs.. u can even add a little water and it&#x27;s like u put on more!.. Also u never need to use alot . It lasts really long. My daughter and I both use it.. FYI.. we&#x27;re both 100% black..</li>
    <li> best edge control you will ever buy, pricey but worth it it will hold on natural an relaxed hair, the only thing is you have to wash you hair to get the build up out</li>
    <li> I wear weaves a lot so my edges need to be on FLEEK. lol. So I always try new edge controls, I had high hopes for this one because it had good reviews but is okay its not anything special works just as well as the creme of nature argan oil. However its good that it doesn&#x27;t leave that build up on your hair.</li>
    <li> It is awesome!  Can&#x27;t find anything on the market that&#x27;s better!</li>
    <li> Great product to lay your edges down. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since my stylist introduced me to it</li>
    <li> didnot know do what i thought it would, my hair didnot lay down.</li>
    <li> I am very satified.  I love this.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it, lasts all day. Great control!! I&#x27;ve tried a ton but none works like this. Will definitely buy more when I finish this stash.</li>
    <li> In love with this stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t cause greasiness and does exactly what it says!</li>
    <li> The best gel on the market! No other gel can smooth out your edges. It does not dry your scalp out around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering 3 more!</li>
    <li> Must have for African American ladies!!! I never use gel anymore for my edges! Long-lasting hold and no flakes!!! Definite must have!</li>
    <li> It is just what i needed to keep my edges laid. You should only use a little, to much will turn your hair white.</li>
    <li> I used it my daughter&#x27;s hair and those unruly baby hair sat down.</li>
    <li> Hi, great product on natural hair but does not really hold through out the day as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I love dessigne Essential Products. I also love the edge control also. It smells very good and does the job for hours at a time without leaving any flaky messes afterwards.</li>
    <li> My cousin, who works in a salon, recommended this to me. I use it when I get my weave done, because I keep my edges out and I don&#x27;t always perm my hair before I get it done. It works great at first, but by the next day it look all buildup-y and sticky. I want to reapply more, but I feel like it isnt going to do anything but make the front of my hair look all caked up and icky. And so my search for another great edge control product continues.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was first introduced to it by my hair dresser and was committed to locating it myself ever since.  Most local beauty supply stores around me don&#x27;t carry it, so I&#x27;m so happy I found it on amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market! Be careful though, too much will cause your hair to become stiff.</li>
    <li> I must say my stylist recommended this to me on one of my visits..and at first i thought it was just... ok!!  I have been natural for nine years and I had not had a product that i loved that would control my edges when I had a wash n set style!!  But this is definitely it I love this better than the Arganics Brand product which is the only other product i was using to control edges! Design essential edge control works great for me its not greasy or flaky just a bit on the high side but worth it has i love supporting Moors(Black) owned companies!&lt;br /&gt;Oh! I do however, use the whole line of products they offer for natural styles in combination with this..which in turn makes my hair look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Last year I purchased this from my stylist but I stopped using it because (1) it stopped working and turned white, (2) it doesn&#x27;t hold my natural edges all day, and (3) the build up is serious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about DEEC is that it moisturizes my edges instead of drying them out, unlike other brands that will hold my edges but dry them out. I guess I have to pick my battles.</li>
    <li> This edge tamer makes it obvious that u have in edge tamer. It flakes up at times.</li>
    <li> This is the only edge control that lays my 4C natural hair! I love it, and it smells so good. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or turn white.</li>
    <li> Pretty good may need to be reapplied but overall good</li>
    <li> GREAT on freshly relaxed hair! Melts easily though....</li>
    <li> My cousin LOVES this stuff. Her mother even swipes it. When I drove over 40 miles to buy it for the first time, the place that sold it was out and they said that they could not keep it in stock. For me and my natural curly hair it was ok, did not straighten my end like I thought. But for people with straight hair, like my cousin and her mom, it might work better than it did for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smooths the edges without drying out the hair. It doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard or brittle. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Keeps my hair line  in check.  Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I prefer this edge control over the many other choices I come across in the stores. It is challenging enough to find already prepared products that work on black American, natural hair.</li>
    <li> No flakes or build up!  Great product?</li>
    <li> Another Design product...the bomb! You just can&#x27;t go wrong with them! What can I say...it tames my &amp;#34;natural no chemical&amp;#34; hair. It&#x27;s best to put on and smooth with a rat tail fine tooth comb....it keeps those edges flat and it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;gunked up&amp;#34; on like other products!</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVEEEE this stuff and it smells so good. The only problem I had was I left the lid off for about 3 hours and had to waste quite a bit b/c it dried up and now I notice it doesn&#x27;t quite work the same. But I still love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product best ever shipping was fast will order again</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve come across so fair!</li>
    <li> My favorite product to use on just washed hair. I have natural hair, So the hold was limited. But I will still purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Great for my edges and i have 4 C natural hair which is the most coarse hair texture! but it does a excellent job smoothing out the edges before i release the afro</li>
    <li> This is the best edge control ever. No flaking at all. You only need to use a little bit because it&#x27;s thick. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great buy does an excellent job</li>
    <li> Design makes such wonderful products. This edge control works great for unruly edges. A little dab will do, this product should last a long time if you keep the top on and closed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOOOOVEEE this product.. MUST HAVE!! It makes the hair sleek and shinny it tames rough edges and does not put your hair hard I LOVE IT... I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
    <li> Its good in the initial stages.  It does keep your edges down.  But, I find that after a few hours, the edges dont hold as much; I guess thats not too bad idk.  Now, you do have to put quite a bit of this on your edges.  Oh and dont let this product last for too long; it starts to cake up, dry up, and give off a nasty sweet stink smell.</li>
    <li> Gel works great and doesn&#x27;t turn your edges white.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel hard or brittle.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a stronger hold but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave build up, it last all day for me, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair creasy, it keeps my hair sleek/slick, I don&#x27;t have to put much, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make my hair poof up after a while...this is my favorite edge control, Oh&#x27;yea &amp; it also lasted me for about 3 months</li>
    <li> Love love love......ladies don&#x27;t let this product slip by. A little goes a long way. I use on my clients</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this.  I bought this for someone, but I keep dabbing in it.  I Love it, it works and holds down all those unruly new hairs!!!  I will be buying my own.</li>
    <li> My life . I have African American hair . Natural nd this has my hair LAID !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight your edges first with heat ( flat iron or straightening comb) straightening comb works best . Put a little on as needed and it lays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For perfection use a rat tail comb to lay it better. Jus comb thru the spot where u are laying it after !</li>
    <li> I am natural &amp; NO edge control works for me. I ended up liking this one. It actually holds my baby hairs &amp; etc. Wish it wasn&#x27;t that exact price, but Its honestly worth buying .</li>
    <li> This gel is very good at what it sets out to do. I don&#x27;t like the fact that its so small but I would recommend it for &amp;#34;sleek edges&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Smells nice and really straightens edges.  Perfect for creating a sleek look and in a hurry.  Glad I bought this product. It&#x27;s a time saver and a keeper.</li>
    <li> It is just what I expected and it arrived on time. I will recommend to others. There are many places I can order from but I prefer ordering through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am a African American with natural hair (very kinky). The salon I go to use design essential products, and I love the way my hair turns out so I decided to try the edge control. I brought it from my local beauty supply store a little cheaper than what this retailer have it for. But anyway, I didn&#x27;t like it. My edges would stay down for a little while, and they would flake up. Maybe this stuff is good for people with relaxed edges but it didn&#x27;t do much for my natural edges.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product lays my edges down! The control is amazing and it lasts a couple of days. If you have natural kinky curly hair this is the product for you!!!</li>
    <li> So far my experience has been poor.  I kept checking my tracking number; only to find out the item never shipped.  I called today and they stated they would resend.  Once received I will review the product.  So far the service is lacking</li>
    <li> love this edge control more than any other!!!  but its expensive and too small of an amount.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is soft. It holds my natural edges in place and is easy to comb out!! I&#x27;m glad I found it!!</li>
    <li> The jar was half full . I will not purchase again.</li>
