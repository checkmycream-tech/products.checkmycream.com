### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>awesome product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>It is the best thing I ever used to improve my hair.</li>
      <li>(it doesn&#x27;t go up to 450 degrees) and it still works perfectly.</li>
      <li>this point your hair looks and feels great.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product!  </li>
      <li>I have to re-iron my hair after each moisture exposure, but it is in much better shape (pun intended!)</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>But it added amazing body and softness to my hair, plus made it so silky that detangling after washing was a</li>
      <li>and THEN my hair felt amazing, like I</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried it with my own products and</li>
      <li>I am pretty happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>it makes my hair more manageable.</li>
      <li>The more you do the Keratin treatments,</li>
      <li>the more you wash your hair the faster</li>
      <li>So my expectations buying this product was that it would make my hair look healthy (shiny), make it stronger, softer, and easier to manage.</li>
      <li>Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results</li>
      <li>Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results</li>
      <li>After washing my hair, this product allows my hair to be wavy but smooth without frizz which I love, and if I straighten it, my hair won&#x27;t frizz or curl up at all like it used to.</li>
      <li>I have used many Keratin products this is by far the best at keeping my hair soft and manageble!  </li>
      <li>(I forgot this step and it turned out fine</li>
      <li>My hair is normally very curly and frizzy and on any sort of humid day, it just has a mind of its own and my hair is out of control.  </li>
      <li>hope this detailed review helps you decide which treatment to try.</li>
      <li>hope this detailed review helps you decide which treatment to try.</li>
      <li>While you do have the inconvenience of doing this yourself (always nice to sit in a salon chair and have someone else do it for you!), the results to me are almost the same.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve done the 30-Day treatment another 2 times and each time my curls get looser, more touchable and really luscious!</li>
      <li>but really, I just like for it to look orderly and healthy</li>
      <li>After the second treatment, I loved the way my hair looked and felt and was SOLD on Keratin</li>
      <li>this product alone might be good enough.</li>
      <li>It is very smooth, healthy, it takes just 5 min to dry, it is fantastic</li>
      <li>received quickly.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for more manageable, smoother hair!</li>
      <li>If you have light hair this is a real danger.</li>
      <li>So now i spend only about 5 minutes on my hair each morning (including washing and conditioning) and my hair looks amazing.    </li>
      <li>It does work and worth the price</li>
      <li>but price is right.</li>
      <li>It does what it says, I&#x27;ve done almost every keratin treatment there is over the last 3 years, &amp; this one works great, not bad for a 30 day one, wasnt nearly as damaging as more professional ones but its not suppose to be as it only lasts 30 days &amp; not 3 months,</li>
      <li>It worked Good the first time and slightly loosened my curls.</li>
      <li>works pretty darn well for me, and for the price.  </li>
      <li>The smell did keep me up most of the night, but the next day all was well, just ran a brush through my hair and off to work</li>
      <li>Do strand test first.</li>
      <li>Fast forward to my first Keratin treatment by this brand</li>
      <li>Reasonable expectations.</li>
      <li>this point your hair is straight but is poufy and feels sticky.</li>
      <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;6-</li>
      <li>I have tried it with the whole kit</li>
      <li>I have very curly frizzy (ethnic) hair.</li>
      <li>You wear it straight for 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>i use a quarter size of the Aveda Damage Remady Repair mask as a leave-in, comb through with a fine tooth comb and let it air dry as i commute to work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very simple to use, and definitely has kept my hair much smoother and more relaxed when I use it every 4 weeks, even now at 4 months out from that Brazilian keratin treatment.</li>
      <li>It may not last the full 30 days as it say&#x27;s</li>
      <li>find I redo my Keratin treatment whenever there is too much unruly new hair growth or when it starts to look frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>find I redo my Keratin treatment whenever there is too much unruly new hair growth or when it starts to look frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It usually gets better by the next day, and then it&#x27;s completely fine after 48 hours when I wash it.</li>
      <li>I have wavy, curly and kinky hair (particularly in summer months), while I admit it doesn&#x27;t hold up for 30 days for me; all in all</li>
      <li>I have to say this product does the same exact thing!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not strong, very frizzy and breaks easily.</li>
      <li>It can be a conventional, cheap shampoo like what you get at a hotel or a \\&quot;White-person\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
      <li>It can be a conventional, cheap shampoo like what you get at a hotel or a \\&quot;White-person\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
      <li>Sure it gets frizzy sometimes, and yes it&#x27;s a little damaged from the ends because living in general tends to do that,</li>
      <li>So while it&#x27;s less damging than chemical straightening, I have to use the flat iron every day, which damages it more.</li>
      <li>I used to use perms until my hair was so damaged, I grew it out natural.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels the same and hasn&#x27;t really improved its manageability.</li>
      <li>It did NOT irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With chemical straightening I did not have to use a flat iron because it really relaxed my hair.</li>
      <li>Took a shower on third day and my hair is EXACTLY the same as it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>or so i can let my hair air dry, straight.</li>
      <li>Now my hair is completely weather independent.</li>
      <li>process took me a whole afternoon, but I did other things while my hair bonding and air-drying.</li>
      <li>Whereas the 30-Day treatment can be left in your hair for days and feels silky and fabulous; the 60-Day treatment feels thick like a cream and makes the hair sticky.</li>
      <li>You can over-flat iron your hair at too high a temp and loose your curls!</li>
      <li>OK, so I am a Mixed Chick with really tight curly hair with a few wiry grays.</li>
      <li>I have curly frizzy hair and do the Bikram Yoga (hot and sweaty) almost everyday.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product turned my hair orange.  Do strand test first. Flat iron is when it happens.  If you have light hair this is a real danger. Doesn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have to re-iron my hair after each moisture exposure, but it is in much better shape (pun intended!) than it was before.</li>
    <li> I bought Liquid Keratin 30-day treatment to use about 2 months after I had had a Brazilian keratin treatment, when my hair was starting to get curly again. It&#x27;s very simple to use, and definitely has kept my hair much smoother and more relaxed when I use it every 4 weeks, even now at 4 months out from that Brazilian keratin treatment. I use it with my iron set at 420 (it doesn&#x27;t go up to 450 degrees) and it still works perfectly. The only downside, for me at least, is that immediately after you do the treatment your hair looks a little greasy, although it&#x27;s stick straight. It usually gets better by the next day, and then it&#x27;s completely fine after 48 hours when I wash it. After washing my hair, this product allows my hair to be wavy but smooth without frizz which I love, and if I straighten it, my hair won&#x27;t frizz or curl up at all like it used to. I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for more manageable, smoother hair!</li>
    <li> I have very curly frizzy (ethnic) hair. I had been chemically straightening it, but switched to this product in hopes of damaging my hair less. I&#x27;e been using it over a year. It only relaxes my hair a little bit. So while it&#x27;s less damging than chemical straightening, I have to use the flat iron every day, which damages it more. With chemical straightening I did not have to use a flat iron because it really relaxed my hair. I think if someone&#x27;s hair was only somewhat curly and frizzy this product alone might be good enough.</li>
    <li> I have curly frizzy hair and do the Bikram Yoga (hot and sweaty) almost everyday. the salt from sweat and washing it meant my hair was like straw. I stared using this over a year ago, with my relaxer. When I get a relaxer touch-up, i have the hairdresser put this in after the neutralizing shampoo, to act as a deep conditioner and repair damage from relaxer. I let it sit for 30 minutes and then blow dry and flat iron myself when I get home.    Over the next four weeks or so i can let my hair air dry, straight. My daily routine is to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair with water and use the Naked Naturals Keratin conditioner to condition. To style my hair i use a quarter size of the Aveda Damage Remady Repair mask as a leave-in, comb through with a fine tooth comb and let it air dry as i commute to work. So now i spend only about 5 minutes on my hair each morning (including washing and conditioning) and my hair looks amazing.    p.s. My hair is about 3-4 inches past my shoulders now, before I was having a hard time growing it because of sweaty yoga, daily washings and constant blow-drying. I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Keratin treatments for the last two years. Every time it has been applied at the beauty salon. I bought this product to do it at home. I was not pleased with the results. My hair was frizzy after the treatment. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> OK, so I am a Mixed Chick with really tight curly hair with a few wiry grays. It&#x27;s not strong, very frizzy and breaks easily. I used to use perms until my hair was so damaged, I grew it out natural. But combing out my hair after washing it was a nightmare! And my curls would shrink up from mid-back to above my shoulders - Not a great look. Fast forward to my first Keratin treatment by this brand, the 30-Day treatment. It worked Good the first time and slightly loosened my curls. But it added amazing body and softness to my hair, plus made it so silky that detangling after washing was a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done the 30-Day treatment another 2 times and each time my curls get looser, more touchable and really luscious! But, the process is lengthy and I have to work up the energy to do it. So, this time I purchased the **60-Day** treatment hoping it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 60-Day treatment works just as well but the process is different. Also, the feel of the Keratin is different. Whereas the 30-Day treatment can be left in your hair for days and feels silky and fabulous; the 60-Day treatment feels thick like a cream and makes the hair sticky. After flat-ironing my hair, it looked like Klingon hair and I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it. But the process calls for washing out the Keratin after flat-ironing it and THEN my hair felt amazing, like I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 30-DAY AND 60-DAY TREATMENTS:&lt;br /&gt;30-Day process is&lt;br /&gt;1- Pre-wash to strip the oils and products out of your hair&lt;br /&gt;2- Apply Keratin and comb through. Keratin is a silky liquid you spray. It did NOT irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;3- Blow Dry (works just as well if you air-dry naturally)&lt;br /&gt;4- Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results&lt;br /&gt;At this point your hair looks and feels great. You wear it straight for 2-3 days. If it frizzes up, re-flat iron it. This is bonding the keratin to your hair. Then...&lt;br /&gt;5- Wash out keratin and condition hair. Style and wear as you like.&lt;br /&gt;The process (steps 1-4) takes about 2 hours. I find the 30-Day treatment lasts about 6-8 weeks. After the second treatment, I loved the way my hair looked and felt and was SOLD on Keratin treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60-Day process is&lt;br /&gt;1- Pre-wash to strip the oils and products out of your hair&lt;br /&gt;2- Blow-dry to damp-dry. (I forgot this step and it turned out fine anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;3- Apply Keratin and comb through. Keratin is a sticky cream you pump, rub in your hands and spread on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;** This Keratin feels stronger and stung my face a little, but with no lasting harm.&lt;br /&gt;4- Blow Dry (works just as well if you air-dry naturally)&lt;br /&gt;5- Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results&lt;br /&gt;At this point your hair is straight but is poufy and feels sticky. But, you are going to wash it out after like 15 minutes anyway so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;6- Wash out keratin and condition hair. Style and wear as you like. I ended up re-flat-ironing my hair after it air-dried.&lt;br /&gt;The process took me a whole afternoon, but I did other things while my hair bonding and air-drying. I don&#x27;t know how long this treatment will last because I just did it. But, my curls are loose, silky, long and I can run my fingers through them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO REMEMBER&lt;br /&gt;- The more you do the Keratin treatments, the silkier and looser your curls will become.&lt;br /&gt;- You can over-flat iron your hair at too high a temp and loose your curls! I did this in some spots, so be careful not to use the flat-iron to \\&quot;bump\\&quot; your hair under at the ends or twist the flat-iron as you move down the hair. Lesson learned for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTH KERATIN TREATMENTS WILL WORK WITH OTHER SHAMPOOS AND CONDITIONERS. NO NEED TO BUY THE KIT!!&lt;br /&gt;Both Keratin treatments work with other pre-shampoos, after-shampoos and conditioners. I have tried it with the whole kit and I&#x27;ve tried it with my own products and both techniques work equally well. Here are the guidelines: The pre-shampoo is to strip all product build-up and oils from your hair. It can be a conventional, cheap shampoo like what you get at a hotel or a \\&quot;White-person\\&quot; shampoo. After the Keratin treatment, you DO NOT USE THIS TYPE OF SHAMPOO EVER AGAIN! You must use a shampoo that does not contain sulfates, i.e. sodium lauryl sulfate. This the the chemical that makes the shampoo suds up a lot. I use WEN conditioning cleanser and leave-in styling cream and it works equally well as the products in the Keratin Kit. If you use a shampoo with sulfates, it will strip the Keratin protein from your hair and undo the Keratin treatment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I redo my Keratin treatment whenever there is too much unruly new hair growth or when it starts to look frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this detailed review helps you decide which treatment to try. If the 60-Day treatment lasts A LOT longer, I&#x27;ll do it again even though the process takes longer and I don&#x27;t like the feel of the Keratin product. If it lasts about the same time as the 30-Day treatment, I prefer that product because it takes less time and I prefer the silky feel of the 30-Day Keratin product.rip all product build-up and oils from your hair.

    <li> awesome product. received quickly. only thing is it does not keep my hair from swelling after I&#x27;ve worked out or sweated.</li>
    <li> It is the best thing I ever used to improve my hair. Now my hair is completely weather independent. It is always the way I want to have it. It is very smooth, healthy, it takes just 5 min to dry, it is fantastic</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have wavy, curly and kinky hair (particularly in summer months), while I admit it doesn&#x27;t hold up for 30 days for me; all in all it makes my hair more manageable. I do hate the smell, but at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconuts! My biggest complaint is that I find the bottle design very hard to work with. I usually pull out the sprayer and apply by hand.</li>
    <li> It does work and worth the price</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. I read and followed the instructions very carefully, process took about 90 minutes (also didn&#x27;t wash hair for two days). Took a shower on third day and my hair is EXACTLY the same as it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I have done the salon permanent treatments (bio ionic and keratin) and they work but definitely damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think the truth of the matter is there is no quick fix.</li>
    <li> Product does have an unpleasant smell after using flat iron, BUT completely worth the money. I paid $20 at the salon just for one treatment. Because I keep my hair short so it&#x27;s less frizzy in humidity, this bottle will last me months for less money! I used as directed and had no problems. It gave me the salon quality and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I did not use their other products with it.</li>
    <li> I used this and saw no difference at all in the frizz or smoothness of my hair. Not worth the money. Plus I couldnt wash my hair for 2 days and this stuff smells kinda bad.</li>
    <li> I am pretty happy with my purchase.  I use primarily on sides of my hair where it seems to always frizz in the least little damp weather (Illinois typical).  works pretty darn well for me, and for the price.  I will order again, and this was my second order of this product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  After having had my hair straightened a few months ago via a salon, for the same treatment and $200 (plus tip) I have to say this product does the same exact thing!  My hair is normally very curly and frizzy and on any sort of humid day, it just has a mind of its own and my hair is out of control.  While you do have the inconvenience of doing this yourself (always nice to sit in a salon chair and have someone else do it for you!), the results to me are almost the same. Only thing is, this product smells after you dry and flat iron your hair.  The smell did keep me up most of the night, but the next day all was well, just ran a brush through my hair and off to work I went.  For the price of this product, versus the same results as a salon, you can&#x27;t beat it.  I only used the straightening spray, did not use any of the Keratin shampoo or conditioner products.  Not sure you really need it &#x3D; I didn&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> It does what it says, I&#x27;ve done almost every keratin treatment there is over the last 3 years, &amp; this one works great, not bad for a 30 day one, wasnt nearly as damaging as more professional ones but its not suppose to be as it only lasts 30 days &amp; not 3 months, even if try to use it following the directions of the 3month treatments it dosent help making it last longer, just dont shampoo as often, the more you wash your hair the faster it wears off</li>
    <li> My hair is not really problematic. Sure it gets frizzy sometimes, and yes it&#x27;s a little damaged from the ends because living in general tends to do that, but really, I just like for it to look orderly and healthy which this product seemed to champion. So my expectations buying this product was that it would make my hair look healthy (shiny), make it stronger, softer, and easier to manage. Reasonable expectations. Nothing crazy and no radical changes. That said, I&#x27;ve been using the product for a month and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between my hair now and my hair before it started. It looks and feels the same and hasn&#x27;t really improved its manageability. I mean, it didn&#x27;t make my hair worse either, or make my hair smell funny or anything like that, but definitely no improvements for such an expensive product.  I gave the product two stars because I didn&#x27;t see an improvement with my hair, but also didn&#x27;t make my hair worse (which apparently did happen with some people).  Also, the bottle it comes in is such an awkward shape that I had a really hard time applying the product because I couldn&#x27;t get a good grip on the bottle. Seriously. Really inconvenient and super annoying.</li>
    <li> I have used many Keratin products this is by far the best at keeping my hair soft and manageble!  It may not last the full 30 days as it say&#x27;s but price is right.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my (European ethnicity) hair.</li>
