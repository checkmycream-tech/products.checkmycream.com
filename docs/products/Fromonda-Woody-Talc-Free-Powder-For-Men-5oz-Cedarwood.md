### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;Demoisting dangling plums&lt;br /&gt;Fromonda is joy</li>
      <li>So u was hoping this would be great</li>
      <li>Smells nice!</li>
      <li>I was happy to find something that is refreshing like gold bond, but doesn&#x27;t carry the risks of talc-based products.</li>
      <li>My boys could not be more happy.</li>
      <li>This is nice smelling very fine powder with a manly scent of cedarwood!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>The scent is amazing.</li>
      <li>Also works to keep feet smelling nice.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>It clumps nicely in your hand and applies evenly on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Scent is very mild, but pleasant.</li>
      <li>Very strong woody smell that can be cloying at times.</li>
      <li>the smell is very strong.</li>
      <li>Best, natural product I have tried.</li>
      <li>Unlike most body powders, this is a scent that&#x27;s quite pleasing.</li>
      <li>I find the scent pleasing and the feel refreshing.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a product that does not do its job well, is gritty, and want things to smell like a lumber mill this is the perfect product for you.</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
      <li>Good add-on after a shower or before bedtime on hot nights.</li>
      <li>first thing I liked about the powder was the texture:</li>
      <li>The lid isn&#x27;t terribly secure, fell off in shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fresh</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this product</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite scent and importantly, it is also talc free.  </li>
      <li>I purchased both the Woody and the Cool Mint scents, and I like them both.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong going on but it mellows throughout</li>
      <li>As a motorcycle rider, I am an avid user of body powder during the riding season to keep things comfortable while riding an aircooled bike in traffic.  </li>
      <li>Great for fleshlights and other sex toys, no talc!</li>
      <li>Seems to do a good job with keeping me dry, it is winter time now.</li>
      <li>I use it on hot days  for a refresher to my colognes!</li>
      <li>B00A8OGM5A Fresh Balls Lotion</li>
      <li>This is NOT and antifungal and does nothing for jock itch but it is worth having on hand at the gym</li>
      <li>This makes this product fairly expensive but this is a good product from a good company.</li>
      <li>There was no trace of this product keeping me fresh an hour after application.  </li>
      <li>or whenever you need to feel a little fresh and smell nice!</li>
      <li>I may not have read this right</li>
      <li>Coarser than typical talcum powder, the scent is pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is very strong initially, but it fades out during the day.</li>
      <li>Its cooling and comfortable and will definitely order again if available.</li>
      <li>Product has a great scent like being in the deep back woods.</li>
      <li>The smell when applying this is very much like opening a cedar chest or the door to a cedar-lined closet.</li>
      <li>The Solution for Men - 5 oz tube]] and the most helpful review of that product is (a) very funny and (b) from a woman complaining that her husband&#x27;s daily regime of applying powder leaves a film of white dust all around her home.  </li>
      <li>Husband really likes it.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate that Fromonda included this with the shipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many: gold bond, Balla, clubman, and jack black.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, my October 2014 Amazon order of this powder didn&#x27;t include the smaller bottle reported by one of the other reviewers, but it did come with a nice insert from the Sean Kimerling Testicular Cancer Foundation.</li>
      <li>Smell more like a pine forrest down there, even in the summer!</li>
      <li>I bought this product and it even come with a little bottle of powder extra and the bigger bottle that i ordered and it smells very nice</li>
      <li>live in south texas, where the temperature routinely rises above 100 degrees in the summer, so anything that helps me smell fresh is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live in a world like this.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised.  </li>
      <li>high temperatures begin to roll in, I&#x27;l update this review if necessary.</li>
      <li>The smell is not bad but you its a certain smell where you either hate it or love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Husband really likes it.  Its cooling and comfortable and will definitely order again if available.</li>
    <li> It may be me but has no smell.  I was very surprised.  I may not have read this right</li>
    <li> I find the scent pleasing and the feel refreshing.</li>
    <li> So u was hoping this would be great but it is gritty and the smell is very strong. If you don&#x27;t mind a product that does not do its job well, is gritty, and want things to smell like a lumber mill this is the perfect product for you. It got two stars because I like the smell of lumber and my wife was not home to complain about it.</li>
    <li> Ever-refreshing&lt;br /&gt;Demoisting dangling plums&lt;br /&gt;Fromonda is joy</li>
    <li> Smells nice! Great for fleshlights and other sex toys, no talc!</li>
    <li> Worked well for me. Nothing really last all day when you&#x27;re working out, but I usually touch up after a hard workout and it last until I get home. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Scent is very mild, but pleasant.</li>
    <li> The smell is not bad but you its a certain smell where you either hate it or love it. It does work well though and I would buy again</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. The scent is amazing. Also there is conflicting evidence about talc-based &#x27;down there&#x27; powders, even for men. I chose this one because it is corn starch based. I was happy to find something that is refreshing like gold bond, but doesn&#x27;t carry the risks of talc-based products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this powder after shopping around. I like the cedar-like scent it has. Seems to do a good job with keeping me dry, it is winter time now. I will see how it does this summer!</li>
    <li> Not bad. Very strong woody smell that can be cloying at times. Nothing special about this product</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it even come with a little bottle of powder extra and the bigger bottle that i ordered and it smells very nice and it shipped on time i would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> As a motorcycle rider, I am an avid user of body powder during the riding season to keep things comfortable while riding an aircooled bike in traffic.  I&#x27;ve tried many: gold bond, Balla, clubman, and jack black.  This is by far my favorite scent and importantly, it is also talc free.  I&#x27;m such a fan I&#x27;ve started using it daily rather than just when I ride.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> I like the scent and cooling properties of this powder but the scent may not be to everyone&#x27;s liking.  The smell when applying this is very much like opening a cedar chest or the door to a cedar-lined closet. It&#x27;s pretty strong going on but it mellows throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s one piece of advice. There&#x27;s another product here on Amazon called [[ASIN:B00A8OGM5A Fresh Balls Lotion The Solution for Men - 5 oz tube]] and the most helpful review of that product is (a) very funny and (b) from a woman complaining that her husband&#x27;s daily regime of applying powder leaves a film of white dust all around her home.  I&#x27;ve found that using a Neck Face Duster Barbers Brush Salon Stylist Hair Tool ([[ASIN:B00NKXYVPO Neck Face Duster Barbers Brush Salon Stylist Hair Tool]]) allows me to apply products like this without kicking up a dust storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my October 2014 Amazon order of this powder didn&#x27;t include the smaller bottle reported by one of the other reviewers, but it did come with a nice insert from the Sean Kimerling Testicular Cancer Foundation. This insert is similar in style to the \\&quot;Do Not Disturb\\&quot; door knob hangers from hotels and it explains how to give yourself a testicular examination. I really appreciate that Fromonda included this with the shipment. I hung mine on the bathroom door knob to remind me to perform this self exam on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this here on Amazon in October of 2014 and paid $8.75.  Shipping was $4.84 for a total of $13.59.  This makes this product fairly expensive but this is a good product from a good company. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Coarser than typical talcum powder, the scent is pleasant. Good add-on after a shower or before bedtime on hot nights.</li>
    <li> I purchased both the Woody and the Cool Mint scents, and I like them both. Unlike most body powders, this is a scent that&#x27;s quite pleasing.</li>
    <li> This is nice smelling very fine powder with a manly scent of cedarwood! I use it on hot days  for a refresher to my colognes! Also works to keep feet smelling nice. This is NOT and antifungal and does nothing for jock itch but it is worth having on hand at the gym or whenever you need to feel a little fresh and smell nice!</li>
    <li> It has no staying power.  I work hard and play hard.  There was no trace of this product keeping me fresh an hour after application.  Yes, there was plenty of white dust down there - but no freshness.  I can&#x27;t live in a world like this.  Back the the drawing board.  To quote Guns N Roses, &amp;#34;You know where you are?  You&#x27;re in the jungle&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. I may shop around for a different scent.</li>
    <li> Been using the woody powder for two weeks now. Product has a great scent like being in the deep back woods. My boys could not be more happy. Would recommend for active males who have chafing.</li>
    <li> The powder is not good. I didn&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> Nothing like what is advertised as other than the fact that it is powder. It smells like talc, not man,  not forest and not woodsy...talc. The lid isn&#x27;t terribly secure, fell off in shipping. I was not happy about cleaning talc out of my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday present. (It was in the same shipping box) I will not be buying this product again, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smell more like a pine forrest down there, even in the summer! Best, natural product I have tried.</li>
    <li> 1. Not as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;2. Has fake wood smell that gets worse when wet.&lt;br /&gt;3. Tends to form pills or clumps.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend other brands.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in south texas, where the temperature routinely rises above 100 degrees in the summer, so anything that helps me smell fresh is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked about the powder was the texture: it&#x27;s heavier and denser than talc, so you won&#x27;t be leaving white trails everywhere. It clumps nicely in your hand and applies evenly on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very strong initially, but it fades out during the day. It&#x27;s very fresh but it is also sharp, smells almost citric.&lt;br /&gt;I see no cons for the product, I would defintely buy it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As high temperatures begin to roll in, I&#x27;l update this review if necessary.</li>
