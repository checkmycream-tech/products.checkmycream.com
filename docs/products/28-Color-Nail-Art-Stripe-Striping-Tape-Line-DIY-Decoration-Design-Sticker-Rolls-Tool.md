      <li>I love these stripe.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Tape peels often no matter how much top coat I apply</li>
      <li>plus they love this stuff</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cute, I haven&#x27;t tried them all though.</li>
      <li>They work okay, lots of repeat colors though, make sure your nails are clean otherwise they wont stick but</li>

      <li>Well worth the price and lots of tape!</li>
      <li>Each color is individually wrapped in its own plastic and I love them, I was worried about the colors</li>
      <li>clear coating on top, the more curling or puckering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>My daughter loved the different color nail art stripe striping tape.</li>
      <li>and I loved the different colors!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
      <li>Overall pretty good, lovely colors, and fairly easy to use just have to have a steady hand.</li>
      <li>Next time I will use a better top coat to see if that will  help.</li>
      <li>Really buy!!</li>
      <li>It came exactly as described!</li>
      <li>It did start to peel pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>they are very easy to use and they last</li>
      <li>When I first read this, I said to myself,</li>
      <li>I have tape I&#x27;ve had for 30 years that sticks better, but I was running low</li>
      <li>Even white :-)</li>
      <li>Fast US shipping!</li>
      <li>The only thing I would say I wasn&#x27;t too happy with was when I left the tape on as decoration and put the clear coat over it.</li>
      <li>I bought these and they came in pretty fast.</li>
      <li>but they were very cheap and as long as you don&#x27;t mind a week or less worth of wear, they might be okay.</li>
      <li>If they had cost a lot I&#x27;d be very upset</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me that there are multiple colors, I enjoy having a vast selection of striping tape at a cheap price.</li>
      <li>They adhere very well.</li>
      <li>They make it very easy to make designs on nails, whether they&#x27;re short or long.</li>
      <li>for delicate work it is fine, but for stripping its too thin.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted more time trying to get tape to lay flat and not curl up at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
      <li>Met my expectations:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to the nail decorating</li>
      <li>I live in Hawaii and striping tape is nowhere to be found.</li>
      <li>: apply a little bit of top coat where you want to stick the tape on because the tape itself is pretty weak &amp; of course apply a little more once you place the tape to smooth out the edges.</li>
      <li>All the colors are different and is really pretty.</li>
      <li>She can do british flags and other cool designs.</li>
      <li>i use this product for nail striping and a general nail accent!</li>
      <li>much happier then expected from over here 😃</li>
      <li>This is a LARGE variety of striping tape that will last me a very long time.  </li>
      <li>I have all these little rolls of tape now that I really cannot use on my short - medium nails.</li>

<li> solid colors, sparkles of the all the solid colors, black, white, silver, gold..</li>
<li> I was not sure if it would work with gel polish, but I have not have any issues thus far.  </li>

<li> But other than that, I think every girl should have some of these!</li>
<li> Got these earlier then expected...expected to be semi disappointed from other reviews but figd</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit hard to find where the tape starts, but I&#x27;m a bit challenged</li>
<li> when packaged arrived,  I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IT SAID.</li>

    <li> I love these stripe. it took some time to use them properly once i got it all my nail design came out great</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me that there are multiple colors, I enjoy having a vast selection of striping tape at a cheap price.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect!!! All the colors are different and is really pretty. And I have product for all my life!!! Really buy!!</li>
    <li> Tape peels often no matter how much top coat I apply</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii and striping tape is nowhere to be found. I am happy with my purchase and will review if I have any problems with wear. I don&#x27;t plan on leaving it on my nail I just want to use it to tear out a design from this opi liquid sand that I have no idea how to do any nail art with!</li>
    <li> The tape is great for making awesome designs and stripes! Good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a LARGE variety of striping tape that will last me a very long time.  It is very easy to apply and remove.  I was not sure if it would work with gel polish, but I have not have any issues thus far.  You can see me use the nail stripes in my YouTube video: http://youtu.be/WCiJFH9vg1U  AND another video at:  http://youtu.be/yvP2jl7ebQo</li>
    <li> The title says it all! i use this product for nail striping and a general nail accent! The quality is great, the color&#x27;s don&#x27;t bleed and I just like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I thought the stripping would be a bit wilder. for delicate work it is fine, but for stripping its too thin.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted more time trying to get tape to lay flat and not curl up at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;More clear coating on top, the more curling or puckering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when packaged arrived,  I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IT SAID. The package came from&lt;br /&gt;Singapore and it listed the item inside as a telephone cover.  When I first read this, I said to myself, I didn&#x27;t order&lt;br /&gt;a phone cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made me wonder if the supplier was on the up &amp; up.</li>
    <li> Got these earlier then expected...expected to be semi disappointed from other reviews but figd hey only $2...I think I received only 3 of the same colors...and the rest were different...solid colors, sparkles of the all the solid colors, black, white, silver, gold..even those had sparkles to match....much happier then expected from over here 😃</li>
    <li> Finally purchased some stripping tape to do nail art!  Love it but I did get 4 of one color and I thought that I would get 28 different colors.  Fast US shipping!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the different color nail art stripe striping tape.</li>
    <li> This tape is not very easy to manage for nail art and not very clean for stripes or designs on nails.  Also, this items ships from CHINA and takes forever to arrive in the U.S. I have all these little rolls of tape now that I really cannot use on my short - medium nails.</li>
    <li> I really liked the variety of tapes.  Unfortunately they don&#x27;t stay on for a full week, the tapes tend to peel up at the nail edges (I&#x27;ve done nails for 30 years).  I have tape I&#x27;ve had for 30 years that sticks better, but I was running low so I thought I&#x27;d try these.  If they had cost a lot I&#x27;d be very upset but they were very cheap and as long as you don&#x27;t mind a week or less worth of wear, they might be okay.</li>
    <li> These work perfect for me because I can do my own designs without paying the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;You can keep the tape on your nails as designs or you can use it as guide lines.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit hard to find where the tape starts, but I&#x27;m a bit challenged and I&#x27;m sure not a lot of people have this problem LOL&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, great product:)</li>
    <li> I love these striping tapes! They make it very easy to make designs on nails, whether they&#x27;re short or long. The only thing I would say I wasn&#x27;t too happy with was when I left the tape on as decoration and put the clear coat over it. It did start to peel pretty quickly. Next time I will use a better top coat to see if that will  help. But other than that, I think every girl should have some of these! And the value cannot be beat for the price.</li>
    <li> love love love!! would recommend to all my friends!! cant wait to do my nails and my three daughters nails!!</li>
    <li> They work okay, lots of repeat colors though, make sure your nails are clean otherwise they wont stick but neat colors</li>
    <li> It came exactly as described! The strips are definitely alot thinner than I was expecting but still looked GREAT on my nails. I love it. The product arrived very quickly which was even more awesome.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves nail art and this product is an excellent addition.  She can do british flags and other cool designs.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of nailart and with this stripe I made very nice and unique nail art in my own nail they are very easy to use and they last</li>
    <li> These are great! They adhere very well. The designs are unlimited! I would recommend this product to anyone who does nails!</li>
    <li> I love them!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and perfect price</li>
    <li> Well worth the price and lots of tape! I&#x27;ll be using this for years!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute, I haven&#x27;t tried them all though. tip: apply a little bit of top coat where you want to stick the tape on because the tape itself is pretty weak &amp; of course apply a little more once you place the tape to smooth out the edges.</li>
    <li> I am soooooo happyyy whith this tape ford nails. Very good. Niceeeeeeee</li>
    <li> it was a gift to the nail place i go to . they are so caring about me . plus they love this stuff</li>
    <li> Each color is individually wrapped in its own plastic and I love them, I was worried about the colors but they have so many colors! Even white :-)</li>
    <li> I find this tape to not be sticky enough and the nail polish tends to seep underneath it.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to the nail decorating and I loved the different colors!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely what I wanted and more!</li>
    <li> I bought these and they came in pretty fast. Overall pretty good, lovely colors, and fairly easy to use just have to have a steady hand. Gotten compliments on it already, so I&#x27;m pretty satisfied :)</li>
