<li> i like this fragrance and been using it for a long time.</li>

<li> if u r careful while putting clothes on then no problem.</li>

<li> Ordered this product along with other products to send my son off to college.  </li>
<li> Other than this issue Dove is my my preferred deodorant.</li>
<li> does leave spots on dark color clothes.</li>
<li> Lasts a very long time, even after showering... Doesn&#x27;t burn your armpits like one of my past deodorants.</li>
<li> I wish I read the previous review.</li>
<li> Scent won&#x27;t drop any shorter people you hug; it&#x27;s subtle, but there when you need it.</li>
<li> careful and don&#x27;t get disappointed like I was for expecting something &#x27;as pictured&#x27;.</li>

    <li> great product, great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Nice scent and effective antiperspirant</li>
    <li> Great Price shipping QUICK!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant ever. It never stains my white t-shirt, it smells great, and it is truly long lasting. Even when I sweat throughout the day my arms continue smelling good all day.</li>
    <li> Why does the price fluctuate on this so much? I can&#x27;t find these anywhere in stores anymore, and now on amazon the price goes from $4.18 to $7.31? what&#x27;s goin on here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the best freakin deodorant i&#x27;ve ever used though. Scent won&#x27;t drop any shorter people you hug; it&#x27;s subtle, but there when you need it.</li>
    <li> I wish I read the previous review. I also expected two products due to the picture but only received one. Please remove the second product from the picture.</li>
    <li> same as the other review, picture shows 2 only recieved one. Other than this issue Dove is my my preferred deodorant.</li>
    <li> What I like best about this item is that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering or smelly like some other antiperspirant deodorants.  Controls sweating pretty well, too.  I would like it much more, however, if it were a gel; hence, the four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant very effective great smell I use one  time at day and the keep me dry all day I spending a lot of money to find the right one I glad I have dove I really highly recommend</li>
    <li> the fragrance last long. does leave spots on dark color clothes. its ok. if u r careful while putting clothes on then no problem. i like this fragrance and been using it for a long time.</li>

    <li> Great product. Goes on very generously. Lasts a very long time, even after showering... Doesn&#x27;t burn your armpits like one of my past deodorants. Smells quite nice. You can definitely rely on this to keep you fresh; I&#x27;ve gone a day without applying and I was fine!</li>
    <li> Smells so gosh dang good i love it</li>
    <li> rip off. One item for $7</li>
    <li> The only downside to this deodorant is that it is powder instead of a gel.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product along with other products to send my son off to college.  Two &#x27;sticks&#x27; are pictured, and price is higher than buying &#x27;retail&#x27; locally, so assumption was that with bulk purchasing, there was a significant discount for two.  Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful and don&#x27;t get disappointed like I was for expecting something &#x27;as pictured&#x27;.</li>
    <li> It does the job and is fresh scented. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I thought this was deoderant, it is not. It is antiperspirant. I am not a fan of antiperspirants but this one is great. Does the trick.</li>
    <li> This Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant is now my favorite product to wear for exercise and everyday use (work, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product provides full protection from sweating and the odors caused by sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is masculine and is actually quite nice.  Its a fresh, clean smell (reminiscent of a rushing waterfall).&lt;br /&gt;It is also not overpowering.  I can smell the product when I put it under my arms and when I lift my arms in a T-shirt, but it doesn&#x27;t wear like a cologne (like other scents from Dove Men+Care).  This is a real plus for wearing it at work (where people with varying opinions are in close quarters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short.&lt;br /&gt;A nice masculine smell that does it&#x27;s job very well without being over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Started using entire Mens line from Dove; imagine introduced as female but now is great for men. In fact, this line is recommended for both and my wife loves the hand soap for her shower. Excellent; better product than Old Spice.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant.. Just ran out but have a new order on the way!</li>
    <li> Good non irritant deodorant.  Not sticky and did not experience any reaction or rash with this product, keeps you dry and has nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> product is NOT like the original, a completely different formulation.  Also,  the push pin rams through the deodorant so you have to pull it up with your fingers.</li>
    <li> Great Antiperspirant. Great Smell!</li>
