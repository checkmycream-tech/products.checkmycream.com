<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great toothpaste, I enjoy the flavor of cinnamon to the usually minty flavor found in other toothpastes. Makes me feel refreshed and my mouth clean night and day.</li>
    <li> I just HATE that this brand and flavor is being discontinued so had to stock pile!</li>
    <li> Crest Brand Name This is hard to come by in the bottle.</li>
    <li> My favorite flavor of toothpaste. The Colgate one was better but it has been discontinued. This one is hard to find also.</li>
    <li> Love the bottle application</li>
    <li> So I went to my store AGAIN today trying to find this toothpaste.  On a whim, I checked Amazon.  Thank you Amazon for carrying ALL my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paste is easy to use in a container that will sit upside down so it is always ready for you; never drips and produces just the right amount.  The flavor is cinnamon clean and fresh with whitening and fluoride as a bonus.  I always feel fresh and ready to go.</li>
    <li> I feel so silly ordering toothpaste from the internet, but none of my local stores stock this gel \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; version anymore! Our local pharmacy usually has the Cinnamon Rush in a tube, which is okay, but I really prefer the texture of this gel. And the multi-pack price is really generous (at least compared to what toothpaste sells for individually at retail).</li>
    <li> i really like the taste</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t really like the mint taste of most toothpastes.  I like cinnamon.  This tastes like cinnamon and cleans your teeth.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flavor of toothpaste. I don&#x27;t like all those \\&quot;minty\\&quot; toothpastes. It is hard to find in the stores. Using the Amazon.com \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; program is convenient and saves you money. There is no risk. If you change your mind, you can always cancel. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Crest Cinnamon is always a favorite. No cavities, fresh breath, happy client. The package arrived on time and packed perfectly.</li>
    <li> Received it and am currently using it.</li>
    <li> I was in the mood for changing up my toothpaste. Love cinnamon flavor, so I thought I would try this. Very glad I did. Now I have new toothpaste. Very good at cleaning and leaves my teeth feeling very clean and smooth. And, the best part is the taste and flavor last into the morning.  Thanks, Amazon. Please keep in stock.</li>
    <li> Guys, this toothpaste is as good as it looks :-D If you love cinnamon so much as I do, you&#x27;d be astonished.</li>
    <li> MUCH better than the minty stuff.  It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re chewing on one of those cinnamon gummy bears (remember those?) AND cleaning your teeth at the same time.  Win win!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like mint, I do like cinnamon, so I&#x27;m happy to see toothpaste with a non-mint flavor. Crest made a great lemon flavor (discontinued) they should bring back. I would like a larger size, but this fits easily into any cabinet. It&#x27;s convenient to buy several containers in a package online, and the price is good. Why waste gas going to a store, only to find they don&#x27;t have what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tubes are messy and take up way too much space. Most stand up products are for children and taste like bubble gum - yuk. This is a good one!</li>
    <li> Can not get in stores.... this is the ONLY tooth paste I like.  I am stocking up for the long haul.  My kids are teasing me.  I LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love cinnamon flavored stuff, and its hard to find cinnamon toothpaste, so I ordered this product.  I like the smaller size and how it sits up.  However, the actual toothpaste was really soupy and liquid-like in texture, not a thick paste.  So I did not like it.</li>
    <li> I much prefer cinnamon toothpaste to the normal mint versions and since I have trouble finding this particular one in stores, Amazon makes it super convenient to order online. The best part about this toothpaste (other than the taste) is definitely the container which makes squeezing out tootpaste much simpler than using the old tubes you have to roll up as you go along. You can just keep this one upside down and gravity will do the work for you, plus the hole where the toothpaste comes out of is smaller than the ones on the roll up tubes so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting those big globs that sometimes come out of the other kind of tube.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this toothpaste seems to be hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is much better than other mint pastes, and the container is easy to store in medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leak and the cover doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> The best flavor in a convenient dispenser.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find locally.  Great</li>
    <li> best toothpaste if you are not a mint lover- great taste and does the trick plus- most of the time -but not all- it gets thru TSA at the airport and is not taken away from me</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the stores.  However, I found out the hard way that some folks can have a sensitivity to the cinnamon portion of the gel.  We are one for one at our house.</li>
    <li> They discontinued this at Target and I thought... never had Cinnamon toothpaste, gotta try me some of that.  It&#x27;s actually pretty good and a nice change of pace from wintergreen or whatever.  I actually prefer having this taste in my mouth for an hour afterwards more than the minty stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a gel. It tasted a bit strong, but doable. I have switched to the paste, which seems less strong. If I couldn&#x27;t get the tubes, I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> excellent product, easy to use, no mess does not require squeezing the tube, great for weak hands and kids. would recommend for all ages</li>
    <li> I love this cinnamon flavor (and they said cinnamon is an appetite suppressant!).  I love not having a messy tube of toothpaste on my bathroom vanity!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste but I have such a hard time finding it in the stores. As soon as I noticed this on Amazon, I bought a pack of four, I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful  flavor and i like the size of the bottles for travel and they stand on the lid so the product is always easy to get out and with very very little waste at the end perfect design</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste and its hard to find in the stores.  Great price and glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my sister, she can not find this item in the local stores anymore. She was so happy to get this as a gift and will be purchasing more as needed.</li>
    <li> girlfriend loves this flavor.</li>
    <li> Look forward to using this good tasting and good performing toothpaste. Particularly like the dispenser.  Hate tubes that always look like trash on the sink. This container is best used upside down.  Unfortunately the label and dispenser doesn&#x27;t let you see the see when you&#x27;re almost empty.  Other than that I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Amazon is the only place I can buy these as drug stores don&#x27;t stock them.</li>
    <li> Great price for this toothpaste that Crest decided to drop from their product list.  I think I might place another order so I can brush with my favorite toothpaste for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Best to store it upside down for instant use. Glad Amazon still has it in stock!</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> My wife thinks I&#x27;m nuts buying toothpaste online, but once again, I can&#x27;t consistently find the flavor we like at retail.  I mean, it&#x27;s not like Crest is an obscure brand, right?  The unit cost was just a little higher but well worth it to me.  And once again brick and mortar loses a sale by being out of stock.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy brushing my teeth because I have a very bad gag reflex but, with this great flavor of cinnamon Crest toothpaste it sure makes it easier. I hate mint toothpaste, so if you are one of those ones who needs a good taste try this Crest cinnamon.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore. It tastes better than most mint toothpastes and is packaged in a conveient standing up container instead of a messy tube.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for this item.  I couldn&#x27;t have gotten it for this price at the local stores so was very happy with it. Also, over half the time, all the local stores are out of the cinnamon rush, which is my fave. And fast shipping as well. Thanks so much for the great service!!   Sincerely  A whiter brighter smile</li>
    <li> Only source I could find for cinnamon Crest!!!  Love it!!  So glad I could get it from Amazon</li>
    <li> Can hardly find this product in the stores.  My favorite toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I like the taste, it works good for me.  Ordering is easy and it is shipping promptly.  It&#x27;s the one for me.</li>
    <li> Nice spicy toothpaste, beware if you dont like cinnamon gum or candy you wont like this either.</li>
    <li> This truly smells and tastes like cinnamon, and there is no lingering chemical flavor. The packaging is great and much cleaner than a toothpaste tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think cinnamon candies are spicy I would not recommend this toothpaste. I also would not recommend this for children because of the strong flavor.</li>
    <li> I love the cinnamon flavor.  I recommend storing with the top down as it make it easier to dispense.</li>
    <li> Regular toothpaste flavor is so boring. I also like the way it easily comes out of the tube. This stuff has pazazz!</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother who likes cinnamon and can not find it in the local stores.  Easy to use bottle when she brushes.  Lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s right. I&#x27;m a grown man in his sixties, who has never liked the taste of mint! When I was younger, I tolerated spearmint, but I&#x27;ve outgrown that, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest is one of the few toothpaste/mouth-rinse companies who realize and accept that and instead have provided this group with a tangy cinnamon flavor toothpaste. But this is no kiddy toothpaste akin to their &amp;#34;Hanna Montana,&amp;#34; version. This is a fully, teeth-whitening toothpaste that does everything it is supposed to do for oral hygiene, without force-feeding the user with a sickening &amp;#34;minty-fresh&amp;#34; taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we in the minority? Without a doubt. However, this company realizes we&#x27;re out there and our money is as good as that of mint-lovers. Crest knows a niche market when they see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Crest for your Cinnamon Rush Liquid Gel!</li>
    <li> Nearly all other toothpastes make me gag.  While I have no temptation to swallow this one, it let&#x27;s me finish my teeth brushing job!  Great product for fussy flavor people.</li>
    <li> Nice Cinnamon  flavor.  I like this form factor...better than nasty tubes.  This flavor and form factor not generally available in local stores.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite flavor and apparently isn&#x27;t being carried anymore, none of the stores in my area had them on the shelf.</li>
    <li> Favorite type of toothpaste dispenser  - although I need to remind family members it is designed to be stored upside down for ease of dispensing.</li>
    <li> If you like cinnamon, this is for you.  Great liquidy/gel toothpaste.  I quit using mint due to acid reflux, and don&#x27;t like the taste of fruity toothpastes.  This was really the only other option (besides my kids bubble gum, etc.) for flavors.  I used Tom&#x27;s for years, but Crest is a trusted brand and this one tastes great and works great.</li>
    <li> this is the best toothpaste ever made.  It does the trick.  I can&#x27;t buy it local so was very happy when I found it so easily on here and affordable</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my teeth feel clean, I love the cinnamon flavor and how fresh my mouth feels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years, both the product and the packaging are great.</li>
    <li> I love the gel toothpaste with the cinnamon flavor!</li>
    <li> finally got toothpaste the family likes. Hard to find locally in Miami Florida. Price is high but I got it.</li>
    <li> I love cinnamon and when I saw this at Walmart in this cute little bottle I was elated!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold when I went to buy it again all I saw was an empty hole on the shelf. ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, thought &amp;#34;wait a minute....amazon!!!!&amp;#34;. I was sooooooooooooo happy when I found it here. Now I stock up with 4 at a time and I don&#x27;t have to stress...or cry as to where I am going to find my next bottle. YaY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yummy flavor I have used for years now, not sick of it yet... and I think it does help keep my teeth white because I am a coffee drinker and I don&#x27;t whiten them. It&#x27;s a little spicy but not too bad.,,besides I love spicy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivered right to my door!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste gel.  Most of all I like how it dispenses from the bottle in a smal controlled fashion.  It&#x27;s as clean and mess free as it gets.  The taste is also nice leaving your mouth feeling very fresh and clean.  price was OK, shipping was fast.  A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27; m so glad Amazon carries this toothpaste in these containers!  I started using this Crest product years ago, but all of a sudden, could no longer find it at my local stores.  When I could find it, I&#x27;d buy the tubes but always found these to be messy, and couldn&#x27;t avoid wastage.  I tried other products, both different types and even brands when I couldn&#x27;t find my cinnamon flavored Crest Complete gel - and never found anything that I liked.  I now purchase this in bulk as part of my Subscribe &amp; Save.  So easy for a product I want and use regularly.  I&#x27;m a happy camper, and so&#x27;s my dentist every time he says, &amp;#34;No cavities!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Been getting this for a while now, since we prefer cinnamon to mint flavor and like the squeeze-bottle convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I noticed today that the label doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;Made in USA,\\&quot; which seems curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says only:  \\&quot;Dist. by/por Procter &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, OH 45202.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me that smacks of a sneaky way to avoid saying that it&#x27;s not made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I notice that the Amazon listing for the Crest cinnamon in a tube specifies  \\&quot;Origin: USA.\\&quot;  This one, however, doesn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;Origin\\&quot; info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, suspicious........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I called the questions line at P&amp;G.  They say that this is made in Greensboro, NC.</li>
    <li> A standard MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> This is practically the only toothpaste my kids will use.  If it works for them, it works for me. This multi-pack was a good price.</li>
    <li> Another thing not available in my area.  Nice to be able to purchase it from home.  I do not like mint, so this is a blessing.  Thanks for making it available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I hate most mints save for peppermint - which is not the flavor of most toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon flavor isn&#x27;t horribly overwhelming, the gel is nice.  The dispenser area easily gets a bit icky but you can wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t give you an overpowering sense of having your bad breath blasted away so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for... you&#x27;ll be disappointed.. however, I assume most of use mouth wash and won&#x27;t need that kind of a kick.</li>
    <li> I like cinnamon toothpaste, and it&#x27;s getting to be hard to find in in stores.  This is a convient way to get it!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to mint, so I tried this cinnamon flavored gel. I really like the taste, but it is hard to get the product out of the rather thick plastic container. I keep it upside down to keep the gel towards the opening, but I could not get the bottom third to fall, so I had to discard it.  I got some more, and I am storing them upside down from the beginning. As for whitening, it keeps my teeth clean, but not as white as a whitening treatment.</li>
    <li> I am extremely picky about my toothpaste.  Most of them I actively loathe, but this stuff is my absolute favorite.  I was extremely upset when my local stores stopped carrying it.  But I found it on here in 4packs.  Every 6 months they ship me another pack and I don&#x27;t have to go without.</li>
    <li> This flavor is a wonderful break from everything mint. Whole famiy prefers this one and convtenient container keeps toothpaste flowing.</li>
    <li> When drug stores in our area stopped carrying this toothpaste, I was distraught.  I am so happy that you carry it and send it on an auto refill basis.</li>
    <li> I have trouble finding this in the stores.  I do not like mint flavoring so this is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I like the cinnamon toothpaste b/c I feel like all the other toothpastes taste weird/bad.  First time to buy toothpaste on Amazon. went well.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used Crest Complete Cinnamon Rush Liquid Gel tooth cleaner for many years.  We like the way that it feels in your mouth, moist rather than dry like a paste. It also does a wonderful job of cleaning your teeth and giving you fresh breath.</li>
    <li> I like the taste of cinnamon, and seems to keep my teeth staying white but as far as that goes i would probably go with the true whitening products if you want that.  It tastes great though.</li>
    <li> Been using these squeeze bottles for years and out of all the other flavors we like the cinnamon the best.  All you do is turn the bottle upside down when finished and the toothpaste will settle towards the lid and be ready to use for the next brushing.  We really hate tubes and the bottles make it super easy to dispense the liquid gel toothpaste.  Also not every place in town carries the bottles and Amazon makes it easy with free shipping (prime member).  We have this item on a scheduled automatic delivery every so many weeks.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste prevents my mouth from tasting like mint after I brush my teeth.  I really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this fine product will not arrest your decent into madness, it can help cut down on the mint in your life.  (Is there anything besides Thin Mints that should have mint?  I cannot think of anything.)</li>
    <li> I got a rash on my mouth after using this product.  I will never use or recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I USE IT AND MY 93 YEAR OLD MOTHER USES IT. WITH OR WITH OUT TEETH IT JUST TASTE GOOD!</li>
    <li> If you stop at one of those places that makes cinnamon buns and eat one, you might think that your teeth are being cleaned by the experience.  No, man -- they&#x27;re not.  But if you like the taste and would like clean teeth, I recommend this product.  Don&#x27;t drink coffee with it.  Man, that would be bad.</li>
    <li> I became accustomed to using these dispensers a few years ago when that seemed to be all that was available.  I still like them because they are clean and neat.  There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;sag in the middle of the tube&amp;#34; to deal with.  I just don&#x27;t seem to be good at squeezing from the bottom.  I like the cinnamon flavor too.  I use both this one and the herbal mint in the same dispenser.</li>
    <li> All as expected and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I have used this cinnamon flavored Crest for years and would use no other!</li>
    <li> Perfect, I have been using the product for years!!!</li>
    <li> I have always used crest.  I feel it more beneficial for my teeth. I would hjghly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Out of all the toothpaste choices out there, our family finally agrees on this being the one that we all can use.  This is even including our grade school girls.  It also doesnt give quite as much of an awful taste to your morning juice as the minty type pastes out there.</li>
    <li> Was really bored of all the mint flavored toothpaste so I gave this a try. I enjoy the cinamon flavor but the consistency of the gel is a little watery and not really sure if its actually whitening my teeth.</li>
    <li> Love the cinnamon taste. Good whitening, and cleaning.  Good check ups. I like the taste instead of the mint toothpastes.  Prefer the gel and this kind of dispenser is great.</li>
    <li> If you like cinnamon, try this flavor. Nice for anyone with a \\&quot;sweet tooth.\\&quot; Has the same ingredients as the others.</li>
    <li> If you like Cinnamon toothpaste, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
