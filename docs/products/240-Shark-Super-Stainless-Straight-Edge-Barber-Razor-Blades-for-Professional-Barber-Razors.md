      <li>Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
      <li>Fast ship, cheap price, close shave.</li>
      <li>If I really push it I can get 4-5 shaves out of each blade, but 3 is about the limit for a really smooth shave.</li>
      <li>I stocked up on these babies seeing as the price is right</li>

      <li>The blades are extremely sharp and keep there edge, they are good for multiple shaves.</li>
      <li>The razors stay sharper than most other ones I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>Decent blade for starters</li>
      <li>I purchased these blades not knowing what to really expect but after using about 30 of them, I have been pleasantly surprised to the point of recommending them to friends.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s had a few issues using them, but he thinks it&#x27;s mostly the lather, not the blade.</li>
      <li>blade are great very sharp heavy beard</li>
      <li>I purchased these razors for the new razor I bought</li>
      <li>My husband likes his straight razor a lot &amp; these are super sharp, he says.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t massacer your face its good to use with the parker blade and don&#x27;t get the one that has the plastic back to it because it is no good</li>
      <li>Normally the first shave is rough.  </li>
      <li>I switched to a straight razor based on a recommendation from my dermatologist to help preclude razor bumps and any further scarring of the skin on my neck area.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend these to anyone that is looking for a disposable blade to use with their straight edge razor.</li>
      <li>This is my second purchase of disposable straight razor blades.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t hold much of an edge for long, but then again there are 240 of them.</li>
      <li>I can only get two shaves out of each normally, but if you do the math you&#x27;re saving quite a bit of money on the store bought gillets, schicks, and so forth.      </li>
      <li>Super sharp and can be used two times, possibly three but with the price why risk it.</li>
      <li>These razors are not nearly as sharp as I remember.</li>
      <li>Their \\&quot;not-so-sharp\\&quot; edge is actually a little safer to use than some higher quality products.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;The first shave is rough due to sharpness</li>

<li> Yet being the key word, I mean, you are putting a extremely sharp blade against your skin, but these make it a little more forgiving if you&#x27;re a novice like me.  </li>
<li> Like the fact that these blades are cut in half far safer than snapping a double blade in half bu hand.</li>
<li> I use them in the straight razor and use the double edge in my De razor can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> I use one blade every other shave.</li>
<li> These are no better or worse than any other disposable straight blade.</li>
<li> They are VERY sharp and packaged so you don&#x27;t cut yourself when changing out the blade.</li>
<li> Bought two packs of these after starting to slice my face with razors instead of paying outrageous prices for the latest 3,4,5,55 bladed gizmos at the store.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bit dull but still works.</li>
<li> The four boxes in this purchase, plus the 100 blade box I already have mean I DO NOT spend big bucks for the next few years on stupid razors!  </li>
<li> Some poor schmo in Egypt has a job and is doing it well making these blades.</li>
<li> Tried a fourth with very painful results.</li>
<li> Using these blades isn&#x27;t as bad</li>
<li> These aren&#x27;t terrible, but go with Feather instead, I think you&#x27;ll be happier.</li>

    <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
    <li> I have purchased Dovo straight-edge disposable blades at Macy&#x27;s. I paid $20 for at most 30 blades. These Shark blades are of a better quality than the Dovo blades and the price is absurdly cheap.</li>
    <li> Interestingly, these semi-sharp blade turn out to be a pretty good value.    Their \\&quot;not-so-sharp\\&quot; edge is actually a little safer to use than some higher quality products.    First shave is excellent.    2nd is OK.    Don&#x27;t go for a 3rd unless you&#x27;re just skimming off adolescent peach fuzz.</li>

    <li> Great blades for the price. Super sharp and can be used two times, possibly three but with the price why risk it. This package will allow you to shave for over a year and your cost is 17 bucks. Suck on that Gillette.</li>
