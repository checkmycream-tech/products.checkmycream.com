<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THERE WAS NO CHANGE,IN IT IRRITATE MY EYES.BURNS THEM,WHERE AS I HAD TO USE, TEAR DROP FOR RELIEF.&lt;br /&gt;A WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> Removing wrinkles with fast results usually takes time spent looking for the actual product, but when buying a product that gives remarkable results, that time spent can be spent admiring your own looks, that is what this eye cream can give. It works great because it tightens the skin around the eye which prevents sagging and even less wrinkling.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful eye cream. I loved how it went on smooth and didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down. I noticed right away how it works wonders to remove wrinkles. This is a must try product!</li>
    <li> As a woman I always like to look my best, and because my job I&#x27;m required to be up all hours of the night under which leaves me with dark circles under my eyes, I was scepticle of this product at first but it works great and has really helped with my tired eyes!</li>
    <li> This eye cream I have been applying form 2 months.. It removes all dark circles and wrinkles. Therefore my suggestion is its works great and quickly..!</li>
    <li> This product is great. My mom loves it and swears by it to every one. she gets it for gifts at christmas time for all her friends. It really does work smoothing your face and removing wrinkles around your eyes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles, and this product has helped, however I am young so I cant attest to how it works on wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products that wasted my money. Best eye cream did what none of the others could. It removed the dark circles and tightened up my skin in no time. I am a user for life now and highly recommend others to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Oh this is THE EYE CREAM!!! It definitely works great. Ir removes wrinkles and dark circles really quickly. I truly loved it!!!</li>
    <li> This product is the best by far for anybody looking to get rid of some of those nasty lines around your eyes.  Not only is it a modest price, but it has very fast results.</li>
    <li> i love this product it makes your skin feel so soft, it really suprised me how well it actually worked. it  removed my dark circles almost over night. five stars.</li>
    <li> The item Best Eye Cream is definitely a sure winner in my book. It is a great value for the quality of good you are getting. This product provides fast results and you&#x27;ll be sure to love it!</li>
    <li> This product works great! I recommend it to all of my friends. It also makes a great gift just in time for the holidays!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have started to notice the results, eyes feel less puffy and the it seems to have removed darks circles. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. Extremely fast results and works great. It will tighten your skin and remove wrinkles. Recommend for anyone.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to do nothing at all, and I am very certain, that even though I have used it for two months now, it is not even moisturizing to my eye area, in fact causing it to itch and sting sometimes. I am not sure if this is a scam or if these reviews are all real, but what I am certain is that I got tricked into buying this product because it did not deliver any noticeable results at all. The texture is slimy but worst of all, becomes very sticky and dry after leaving it on for a while. There are definitely tons of products better than this.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked for my hangover eyes on work Sunday mornings, this product removed dark circles and helped me look more professional when I work the weekends1</li>
    <li> Although skeptical at first (and who isn&#x27;t with a product promising these types of results) this product surprisingly came through just as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;It removed wrinkles, dark spots, tightened my skin and worked great. My skin is healthy and better looking now, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  This creme exceeds all expectations. Not only did it remove wrinkled but it worked quickly. Say goodbye to crows feet!</li>
    <li> I tried this product to get rid of some of the dark circles under my eyes and it worked wonders. The dark circles went away so fast, plus it made the skin under my eyes look rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> I used to use so many different anti aging creams to treat all of the symptoms of old age. This one does it all! It even tightens your skin!!! I couldnt be happier with the product. I am feeling younger each and every day.</li>
    <li> I got fast results! I can already see thar it removed dark circles. I recommend this product to anyone! Everyone who has tried it has loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, and agree with the other reviewers who think the positive reviews are a scam.  I have not noticed any difference in the area around my eyes, and I&#x27;m pretty sure all it is doing is drying out the skin around my eyes.  The consistency is exactly like hair gel and I would not recommend using this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product. It works great and really removes wrinkles. I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s concerned about wrinkles and aging.</li>
    <li> it does exactly what is says on the product description, its like the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; of &#x27;eye care&#x27;, works great first first time and all the time, giving better results each time.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams and this product does wonders instantly. I immediately noticed how supple and tight the skin around my area felt. My husband even told me that my skin looks different. This is truly the \\&quot;Best Eye Cream\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always fought with the dark circles under my eyes, and tried this product nearly out of desperation...but was not disappointed! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This eye cream helped me removed dark circles, and made my skin look great! I recommend this to anyone who wants better looking eye lids.</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with dark circles under my eyes forever. This removes those dark circles. I have tried many products but finally the search is over. This is the one for me.</li>
    <li> The puffiness under my eyes seems to be a bit less.  The shadows are still there, but may be a bit lighter.  Hoping that as I continue to use the product, the results will continue to improve.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend of mine and she really likes it! It worked very quickly at removing wrinkles and generally tightening the skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> The review of this eye cream looks so fake. To me it looks like someone keeping posting positive reviews to this product that no one ever heard of. I should suggest who ever doing this should stop or he/she could end up being sue by the FTC. Good luck!  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The product reviews (just as some other customers stated) are definitely fake. Seriously, do any of you believe that this many men are commenting on behalf of their wives/fiances/girlfriends? Look at any other legitimate eye cream or face cream reviews and you will not see this...&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still not convinced, take a look at the other products that the \\&quot;customers\\&quot; reviewed. They are all from the same seller!! How this has not been reported to Amazon already, I have no clue but I just did so hopefully they will do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;I ACTUALLY did order this eye cream and there&#x27;s far too much in the bottle for it to be good at $30.00. No instant results either. It&#x27;s actually making my eyelids burn and drying my eye makeup out. I can barely get the pump on the bottle to work. I will be disputing this with my credit card company if I don&#x27;t get a refund ASAP when I send it back.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something for the wrinkles I just started getting around mt eyes. I am amazed at the fast results. It is really tightening the skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Ok, the reviews on this didn&#x27;t look genuine, so looked at several of the people that submitted 5 star reviews and ALL of the ones I looked at had all given  several 5 star reviews for several other products~and most of them gave only 5 stars for all products reviewed~~ and here&#x27;s the clencher~ Many of the different people all reviewed them the SAME products! So this list of amazing, unbelievable reviews is unbelievable.  Something is really fishy~ check out the reviewers yourself.</li>
    <li> I use this product morning and night.  It is a gel, not a cream.  It is refreshing to use, not sticky.  A big container for the money.  I have been using this product for about two weeks and see some improvement.  I would consider buying it for maintenance purposes and because it works better than drugstore brands if you are going to spend your money on a product like this one.</li>
    <li> This cream is a God-sent! I have been using it for a few months now, but I was seeing results in only a few weeks! My skin is looking younger than ever and I feel great!</li>
    <li> My eyes always feel smooth and young because of this product  it removed wrinkles and dark eyes. I got fast results I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about trying this eye cream.  I used it for 2 nights and ended up having a black eye from it.  People thought I had been punched in my left eye.  I stopped using this immediately and the bruised look is slowly diminishing.  Worst thing EVER!</li>
    <li> I used to have really bad dark circles under my eyes I think they were from lack of sleep, after using this cream it has completely removed dark circles and now my eyes look fresh. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this product. It&#x27;s not every day you find something that actually does what it says it will do. The fact that anyone needing to get rid of dark circles or wants fast results is going to love Best Eye Cream. For me the fact it tightness skin is the best part. It feels great and at a great price.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m the mother of 5 children so I have had plenty of experience with dark circles around my eyes. I heard about this cream and figured I would give it a try. The circles disappeared in days I was so happy. I don&#x27;t look like a tired worn out mother anymore!</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely a.m.a.z.i.n.g. Not only does it REALLY get rid of wrinkles but it left my skin feeling soft and looking great. I love this product and now I don&#x27;t use anything else. I promise, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. It got rid of my dark circles, tightened my loose sagging skin, and it did all of that super fast! Ladies, believe me, you want in on this magic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, this one is one of the worst I&#x27;ve tried.  I think the reviews are scams.  It feels like putting aloe vera on your eye area and when it dries it&#x27;s shiny and sticky.  You want to put a moisturizer over it or your makeup will clump in it.  This really is a poor product!  Recommend do not buy at all.</li>
    <li> Hey I picked this up for my girl and she loved it. I will be reordering soon I am sure and might get some for my sis too!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and I already see results - less puffy and a decrease in the lines around my eye.  I am hoping it works to get rid of my dark circles - I will check in again after a few weeks!</li>
    <li> I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.  THIS PRODUCT MADE MY EYES LOOK WORSE. CAN&#x27;T UNDERSTAND ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS.  I HAVE GONE BACK TO MY USUAL EYE CREAM FROM LANCOME WORKS AS LONG AS I PUT IT ON EVERY NIGHT.  I HOPED FOR GOOD RESULTS WITH THIS PRODUCT DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I am at an age that dryness, sagging and wrinkles are common problems.  The \\&quot;Best Eye Cream\\&quot; works as well, or much better in most cases than any eye cream I have used in the past, and at a fair price as compared to some of the \\&quot;department store\\&quot; brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a review that says it is a scam, etc.  My suggestion is to look at all the \\&quot;five star\\&quot; reviews like mine and take the advice of the majority.  Really think you will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for over nine months I wish I could say all the sagging was gone but the dryness and wrinkles are improved dramatically and the sagging is improved just from the moisture or something, but it is certainly better.</li>
    <li> I always have problems with dark circles around my eyes, but not anymore. This has removed dark circles from my eyes almost right away. I was pleased to see that it works great.</li>
    <li> This product has a thickness like hair gel - very sticky. I&#x27;ve tried it for a few days and it makes the skin around my eyes shiny and makes wrinkles more apparent.  Almost all of the reviews of this product are fake.  I am really upset that I was taken by these fake reviews. If you look at the reviews almost all of the positive (4 &amp; 5 star) ones are also reviewing something from \\&quot;Health Advantage\\&quot;, \\&quot;Health Depot\\&quot;, or \\&quot;M&amp;M Beauty and Wellness\\&quot;.  This appears to be a scam.</li>
    <li> Until I found this product, the circles around my eyes made me look like I was wearing a mask. After only a few days, my dark circles started to DISAPPEAR!!! It works very quickly, thank goodness. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with how this cream worked. I was anxious about trying it out, especially with the name and how sensitive my skin is, but the cream worked quickly and got rid of the dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s a must have ... like tooth paste ...</li>
    <li> This product has been so amazing in the removal of wrinkles and making my skin tighter. I believe more will be pleased in the results that received after a few use applications, dark circles under my eyes are most gone. I was skeptical but they have truly made me a believer of this eye cream. It was priced very comparable or less than other product that promise the same results, shipping was fast and secure I love it and will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my a close friend and she has had nothing but great things to say about it, she absolutely loved it. I think I will be picking up a few more for stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  It worked so quickly to tighten the skin near my eyes &amp; it removed the dark circles that have plagued me.  It works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Gets rid of dark circles and wrinkles and helps me feel good about myself.  Bought some for my girlfriend too.</li>
    <li> WOW. online has he greatest things. magic does exist haha. Any who this is really nice. It does what it does if you do it the right way of course. buy it. buy it now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream for my mother and she loved it. Works well at diminishing dark circles. Product recommended.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT!!! MY WIFE KEPT HINTING THAT SHE WANTED IT SO I BOUGHT IT FOR HER... SHE HASN&#x27;T STOPPPED TALKING ABOUT IT SINCE!</li>
    <li> This product was great and helped remove dark circles under my eyes I tend to get from chasing around my 1 year old all day!</li>
    <li> Like the product description states, this eye cream won&#x27;t take 30 years off your face, but I have to say, that at age 57, it did tighten the skin around my eyes and removed some of my undereye wrinkles. I was happy with the results.</li>
    <li> One of my good friends have tried it and it works great. I already noticed a smoother appearance around her eyes. She likes it as well. I recommend this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had some issues with small wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes..this product really diminished them and tightened my skin noticeably with regular use. Loved it! Highly recommend..much better value than similar products I&#x27;ve tried. Thanks!</li>
    <li> this eye cream works great on removing wrinkles , removing dark circles and results are fast i love it. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS REAL RESULTS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with dark circles under my eyes, until now. This product works great. I look better so I feel better. If you&#x27;ve tried other things that just didn&#x27;t work, try this. You get fast results and it helps tighten skin and remove wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Loving it, It is actually bigger than what it looks like, I thought it was very small but this is a big thing is great for your eyes and feels amazing.... So far wrinkles are going down and dark circles slowly fading</li>
    <li> I tried this product as it was recommended to me by a friend.  The dark circles under my eyes were getting worse (in my opinion) and so I bought this product.  I have been using it for 4 weeks now and it has almost removed my dark circles.  I am hoping that, given a few more weeks, they will go completely.  I am really happy with this product.  I have tried others and they had no affect at all.</li>
    <li> My experience is that this is not the \\&quot;Best\\&quot; ,but  the worst eye cream&lt;br /&gt;which I have tried. I was comparatively lucky because  I paid around $32&lt;br /&gt;instead of its regular price which was  around $79..This much  price reduction&lt;br /&gt;should warn  me . I made a mistake.</li>
    <li> I am getting older and have been having to try many different eye creams. This is by far the best product out there. It works great to remove wrinkles and age spots. It is fast acting as well so you don&#x27;t have to wait around for results. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and have not seen one bit of difference. I can only imagine the great reviews are a scam....</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. It works so well. There isnt anything better out there. Every one should use it. Works great!</li>
    <li> The Best Eye Cream lives up to its name. I bought it and I love it. I especially like how it diminishes the fine wrinkles that I have. I really don&#x27;t look my age. It works great and I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great.  Not only was it less expensive than the department store brand I had been using, it works so much better.  I got fast results - the wrinkles around my eyes, the dark circles that I sometimes get - both gone!  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Best Eye Cream is truly the BEST I have ever used.  I love it.  It tightened the skin around my eyes and I no longer have &#x27;crows feet&#x27; when I look in the mirror.  My face feels great and the skin much tighter.  I highly recommend Best Eye Cream.  It makes me feel younger.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it!  Ever since the birth of our child she has been up all night and got dark circles under her eyes and this help with the problem with super fast results!   Amazing and worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Oh my! I use to have the worst dark circles under my eyes and this cream works wonders! It&#x27;s tightened my skin noticeably and made me feel much more confident :)</li>
    <li> This product works great and really helped me.  I had problems finding something that would get rid of my dark circles and not bother my eyes really bad.  I suggest any one with similar problems to at least give this a try!</li>
    <li> Recently I have had a problem with my wrinkles that were pretty bad and I could never get rid of them. I also had a problem with dark circles that started to get worse, which was followed by tightened skin. I was surprised with the fast results of this eye cream and I would definitely recommend it to everyone because it really does work. I love this cream.</li>
    <li> Best Eye Cream did the trick for removing the dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is the only product that works. I feel and look a lot younger. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Although some of the reviews on here claim this is a fake product, I thought it was fantastic. After only a week of using it, I noticed fewer wrinkles and tight skin! Felt younger than ever. I&#x27;m prone to dark circles under my eyes from stress, but this product made them disappear. I was impressed and loved the product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything.  It seemed very watered down and thin.  Didn&#x27;t do anything for bags under the eyes or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product works great and loved it. Iam already 46 and because of stress at work and climate changes my skin is not that smooth and like oldy for my age. This removes wrinkles and stretches the skin to look smooth and young. Highly recommend the product</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very smooth and nice to use. Compare to the price and the use its very fair price.it works great too.</li>
    <li> I never would of thought this product would remove wrinkles so fast, but it really worked on my skin. I will be giving this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> One of my friends order d Best Eye Cream and called me to try and it works great rite away started seeing results good product thank you.</li>
    <li> After having spent a small fortune on eyecreams and lotions and potions, i was very impressed with discovering \\&quot;best eye cream\\&quot;. I have battled with dark circles for a long time now and always got frustrated about having to heavily conceal. Thanks to \\&quot;best eye cream\\&quot; i saw drastic results in a very short period of time. And as an added bonus, the skin around my eyes looks and feels much tighter and wrinkles have virtually disappeared into fine lines.</li>
    <li> It may seem strange for a guy to use this sort of product, but age is starting to catch up with me and I admit I don&#x27;t want those crow&#x27;s feet yet. I&#x27;ve tried other products and honestly only purchased this one because it was available at a good price. I was really surprised with the results. I think this cream works great at a great value. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This cream works great!  I love that&#x27;s its not greasy, and it does what i want it too: to remove my wrinkles and the dark circles around my eyes.  I would tell others to buy this!</li>
    <li> This cream worked great at tightening my skin after a few applications. I never experienced the same before; I will make sure to order it again. It&#x27;s priced right and gives fast results.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product. It removes wrinkles with fast results. You will not be dissapointed. I loved it.I will reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> My problem was Dark circles under and around my eyes....my husband asked me if I had bruised my eyes somehow...this made me very aware of them.  I tried other products but this worked so fast that within a couple of days I could see a big difference.  I love the product and so happy that I finally found something that actually worked.</li>
    <li> My skin responded really well to this product. I had a lot of wrinkles under my eyes before using it and it only took a few weeks to clear them up. I was surprised to look in the mirror and see a face that I hadn&#x27;t seen in years. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove wrinkles,and tighten skin, particularly noticeable around the eyes &#x27;crow&#x27;s feet&#x27; and&#x27;laugh lines&#x27; near the corners of your mouth. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to the &#x27;over 30&#x27; crowd, like me! Although I am quite a bit older than that :-)</li>
    <li> There is something very wrong with this product.  Here are my concerns:  1.  The product has the consistency, appearance, and stickiness of clear hair gel.  2.  After applying it at night on a clean face, the stickiness remained above and below my eyes for several hours, until I washed it off.  3.  It began to burn after about two hours.  I had to wash it off.  4.  The bottle itself is very large, in a too-much-product-to-be-true sort of way.  I believe this product is bogus, as are the positive reviews.  I contacted the seller requesting a refund and return, and have not heard back. I would stay away from the hassle of a return for something that is not going to work.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this eye cream.  She has tried everything and nothing is up to her high standards.  She says this woks great though!</li>
    <li> As I have got older I have noticed that I have more and more bags under my eyes and tired looking eyes.  I ordered this as a trial and found that very quickly those dark circles under my eyes began to fade away.  This is a great product, it was quickly delivered and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with dark circles under my eyes, until now.  This product works great.  I look better so I feel better.  If you&#x27;ve tried other things that just didn&#x27;t work, try this.  You get fast results and it helps tighten skin and remove wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I ordered some of this cream last week and I have had great results! I love it! It works great! Before, I had little darks circles under my eyes. Now, they are completely gone! It truly doesn&#x27;t get any better than this!</li>
    <li> As an IT engineer I spend so many hours watching laptop. Even I use glasses. Due to this I had wrinkles around my eyes. It was looking horrible when i saw my face in the mirror. I searched a lot and bought this product. With in one week I saw a change around my eyes. The wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing slowly. I would recommend this product to any one. Very quick results I had ever with any other product I used.</li>
    <li> I know you might have used different creams of this type. I am going to make a recommendation of this cream as it works fast and makes a big difference between the ones you have used before.</li>
    <li> Man i loved it, you get fast results, tightened skin, it really works great.  Removed Wrinkles and Removed Dark Circles...my Fiance has never looked better!</li>
    <li> tightened skin fast like real fast i was skeptical but WOW!i would like everyone to purchase this cream! they should give out free samples so everyone else that is skeptical can find out like i did.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love how quickly it works to remove wrinkles and dark circles. Love it! Tightens skin and works fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Best Eye Cream for several weeks and I&#x27;d like to say I saw a difference but there is none.</li>
    <li> it is the best face cream ever, i really like it and i will use it in the future too...it works great....i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I found that this works pretty well for the price. It was able to remove a few faint wrinkles that I had around the eyes. It was shipped out promptly which is also great. It&#x27;s nice to find a good eye cream that is under $50 that still works wonders. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are looking to look and feel younger.  It will remove wrinkles and dark circles with fairly fast results.  Works great and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried \\&quot;Best Eye Cream\\&quot;. I&#x27;m definitely seeing great improvement in my under eye area. It&#x27;s definitely removed dark circles, I&#x27;ve never had a product do that until now! This stuff is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews here and didn&#x27;t notice one review where it says scam after I received the product, So I figured I might just as well try it. Well it works for me. I have had eye bags for the longest time, my right eye bag is 3x bigger than the left. After using this twice a day for a week now, I hardly have any bags under my left eye, and the right is half the size. It doesn&#x27;t remove the dark circles though, thats why Im giving it 4 stars, but 5***** for removing/decreasing the eye bags. Be careful putting it too close to ur eyes, it has alcohol in it and it kinda stings and dries up my eyes.</li>
    <li> I began working nights about 6 months ago. A couple months into working the shift, I started getting dark circles under my eyes! I tried this cream and it helped remove the dark circles fast! Very happy girl right here!</li>
    <li> I received the eye gel on time on June 6th, and started using it that evening. I put a dab under my eyes, and massaged it in, per the instructions on the bottle. I did this twice a day for 2 weeks, with no visible results. I&#x27;ve been ordering from Amazon for years, and rarely returned anything. This item, I had to return because it just didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve used other products for dark under eye circles, and there were some improvements. I thought this product might have worked better than those, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005Q06WBU Best Eye Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is literally the best eye cream I have used. Using it for one week morning and night with no eye irritation and seeing a smoother, firmer look is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a nite owl so I&#x27;ve always had issues with dark circles under my eyes.  I was skeptical, but after using the product and seeing results, I am now a believer.  It removed my dark circles and I look at least 5 years younger! Why waste money when you don&#x27;t have to!</li>
    <li> This seems like hair gel in a bottle. The biggest eye cream container ever seen. No boxes or panflets explaining a thing about the product. It does feel like I just put hair gel under my eyes - is thick and feels weird. The delicate skin around my eyes never felt so dry before and the lines seem to be multiplying - worst product ever and the reviews seem to be hoax. I&#x27;m returning this asap! FYI, my skin is olive-y with bronze tendencies when I get a tan and I&#x27;m in my early 30s.</li>
    <li> this product has good quality as well quantity . it works faster than other eye cream &amp; cheaper than other brand in store .</li>
    <li> This is some great eye cream! I always have dark circles under my eyes and this works great! Great and fast results. I love it! As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the only eye cream I will ever buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a scam. It seems like nothing but petroleum jelly. Do you really think hundreds of people would rate this 5 stars unless it was a well known product??</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but this product really removed the dark circles under my eyes and tightened the skin. I was really impressed with the results!</li>
    <li> as you get older you need a cream that removes wrinkles and this is definately a cream that does the job, a cream i would buy again</li>
    <li> This cream works waaaaay better than the others I tried for bags under my eyes. I&#x27;ve been experimenting for YEARS trying to find a product that actually works, and this cream removed the bags and dark circles under my eyes in no time. Love it, thanks!</li>
    <li> After about two weeks of use I can&#x27;t see the dark spots around my eyes anymore. It also helped with wrinkles, people say I look 10 years younger! Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but this product really does work well. Usually I look very tired because I am a very&lt;br /&gt;busy person and don&#x27;t get a whole lot of sleep, so those dark circles under my eyes aren&#x27;t very flattering at&lt;br /&gt;all. Just a few dabs of this cream and it starts to work right away. Great product, and would recommend to&lt;br /&gt;friends. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff. It removed dark circles from under my eyes, a problem that has plagued me for a while. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Got this product for my wife and she absolutely loves it, the wrinkles have gone down substantially around her eyes and she couldn&#x27;t be any happier. She saw this and wanted me to get it for her, so I did and she is amazed at the results for it!</li>
    <li> This product noticeably reduced the darkness and puffiness under my eyes.  However, it&#x27;s been most effective on my left eye.  My right eye is a bit more resistant to complete reduction of puffiness but the dark circles have disappeared.  I will just continue using it and hopefully both eyes will be unpuffy soon.</li>
    <li> My wife was not happy with some of her \\&quot;experience\\&quot; lines that were showing up on her face.  A co-worker recommended this product and my wife could not be happier. To test it she did just 1/2 of her face and the results were amazing.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it removes wrinkles and eliminates dark circles. It will give you a fast result and guaranteed to work in the first 30 minutes.  You will feel your skin is firmer and tighter. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This cream is very effective in removing dark circles and wrinkles from your eyes and will be your best and most effective weapon against all signs of aging! Use it as directed and you will see improvement in just a few days!</li>
    <li> This cream is truly the best eye cream. Its the best, I am truly amazed. I will tell everyone about this. It removed all my wrinkles around my eyes and what i liked most was how fast i got results. Loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife as she gets dark circles when tired, and I know she doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable with it, but this cream works great and removed dark circles.</li>
    <li> I read a few &#x27;bogus review&#x27; alerts below, and sure enough, after checking, I&#x27;ve found that many of these reviews are exactly that: BOGUS.  Hey Amazon, you&#x27;ve just lost LOADS of credibility in my eyes.    Sincerely,  Tired of Being Lied to by Big Business</li>
    <li> This is the best facial/eye area product I&#x27;ve ever used.I am a 58 years old male; but look like 40. Because I learned to take care of my skin and nutrition at a very early age. I have tried many well known products before and they were ok...and $$$$$ !However I was not really pleased with the results. Best Eye Cream is a winner. It is so easy to apply ( a little goes a long way )And it lasts !! I love to tan, and I am telling you...no fine lines around my eyes thanks to this product. Hey guys..if you are reading this..skin is skin; take care of it ! Try this product, you will be happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Best Eye Cream rates 10 out of 10 !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had wrinkles and sagging skin for years but I haven&#x27;t really looked to find products for relief until now! I was given this product from a friend and have been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> This product is a real break-through. Was skeptical at first, but five star review got me to try it . And wow! It really works! It makes your dark circles disappear as you watch it! Love it! Works good on wrinkles too!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is fine. It is moisturizing &amp;, like all reasonably good eye creams, removes fine lines. I don&#x27;t have dark spots, so I can&#x27;t remark on that particular quality. I am 25 and mostly avoiding wrinkles. I recommend this product for the price/quantity &amp; the packaging is attractive.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eye creams I have ever used. My eyes feel so comfortable and relaxed. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I tried about every product for eye wrinkles. The best eye cream by far is THE BEST EYE CREAM. It is a very light serum, and it actually  tightens my wrinkles under my eyes, I wait about 10 minutes then I apply a foundation over it and the rest of my face.I love this product and the price is right. I am not wasting anymore money and time buying products from drugstores or department stores. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> During the past two years, I have been on a \\&quot;quest\\&quot; to find an effective eye product to lighten the darkness underneath my eyes and to generally improve the appearance in that area.  The two best products that I tried are Obagi 5% L-Ascorbic for dark spots and Neocutis Lumiere Eye Balm. Both work quite well. (I also tried a caffeine product, which works well for many people - but did not work well for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often read Amazon reviews before buying products.  Since I find them very useful, I am a frequent Amazon customer.  However, the other reviewers who cite the \\&quot;Best Eye Cream\\&quot; reviews as bogus are entirely correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used this product for two months.  It \\&quot;does\\&quot; burn the eyes; and the bottle \\&quot;is\\&quot; too big to be taken seriously. In addition, none of the ingredients listed have any known utility in improving the undereye area. Too bad the product isn&#x27;t as good as the marketing.</li>
    <li> My sister uses best eye cream and she says it is the best thing she has ever done to tighten her skin.  Her birthday is coming up and I plan on getting her a couple of tubes of it at the discount price it is now. Ebay may have everything under the sun, but, Amazon always has the best as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely wonderful. My wife bought it on a whim hoping to see some great results, and she could not be more satisfied. It has really worked wonders to remove the wrinkles around her eyes. She used to always be complaining about how bad the skin in that area looked, but now she can&#x27;t stop smiling. Just a great product that guarantees outstanding results. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Please, do not spend your money on this gel (sorry, I cannot call it a cream because it doesn&#x27;t look and it doesn&#x27;t feel like one). I bought it because of all the great reviews (most of which ARE a scam - just spend a minute and you will see it yourself). Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t look at \\&quot;one star\\&quot; ones until I received the product and gave it a try. It is weird and sticky, not very pleasant - just not a type of solution you would want to use on your skin, especially under your eyes. It came in wrapped in bubbles: no paper box, no instructions on how to use it (well, I DO know how to use an eye cream, but I still want to make sure that a seller is serious about his product and provides me with all the necessary information, even if I know it by heart). As if this was not enough, the pump broke and came off on the first try! Honestly, I think this product is VERY-VERY far from what its name states.</li>
    <li> I agree with the rest and this is coming from a guy. The product works, it is not abrasive like some things I have tried and as many have said this little bottle holds a lot. I am guessing it will last a very long time. Maybe 6+ months. I almost want to buy another to make sure I have it when I run out, but it will be so long until that happens I have not pulled the trigger.</li>
    <li> dIDN&#x27;T WORKED AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;I WAS USING IT DAILY (TWICE)&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL IT FINISHED , MY DARK CIRCLE STILL DARK UNFILLED&lt;br /&gt;DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE TEXTURE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES&#x27;T WORTH IT AT ALL</li>
    <li> Hate it! Does not work for me.Wish I never bought it. The best eye cream is Yalmeh.. Love Love Yalmeh!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a faithful customer for years and I totally agree this was the best eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;But the recent batch of Best Eye Cream has been degraded.  Size is smaller (or the bottle&lt;br /&gt;is shorter) and it stings the delicate eye area.  I was shocked: what&#x27;s the matter?&lt;br /&gt;I posted this to bring the attention to the manufacturer.  If they don&#x27;t keep up, sorry, I will&lt;br /&gt;look for somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Another confusing thing is caused by Amazon.  The price I paid was $24.95 but if you roll down&lt;br /&gt;a little bit, you will find $19.95, both are Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> I seriously think this is just jelly in a jar!!! It made NO DIFFERENCE!!! NO RESULTS!!! Personally it was a complete RIP OFF and WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product even though it states it&#x27;s a cream but it&#x27;s a gel.  I knew that before I ordered by reading other reviews.  I do like the product.  I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s doing anything magical at this point (I&#x27;ve only been using it about 3 weeks)  but I do feel like it&#x27;s plenty moisturizing even though it&#x27;s a gel. Sometimes when I have used gels in the past my skin feels like it was dry around my eyes and it made me itch my eyes during the day.  This totally feels great!  It has great ingredients and I&#x27;m going to keep using it.  I don&#x27;t see where it pulls the skin tight when it dries like some other reviews.  I believe that I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! this is like water.  no absorption into the skin it is like a slimy watered down gel.  So disappointed, you just know when something says &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; it is the worst.  I now use olay regenerist eye cream and LOVE it and it is worth the extra money.  Or just use a little vasaline on your eyes, it is cheaper and better than this CRAP!  I am shocked by the five star reviews!! who paid them to put those up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 27 and my skin is fairly normal.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this eye cream.  It irritated the skin under my eyes.  Red and itchy.  The worst stuff ever.  It should be taken off the market.</li>
    <li> Nothing except this one has made much of a difference with the darkness under my eyes. The consistency is somewhat smooth yet slightly thick so you don’t need to apply a lot each time. And I really like the pump-less bottle. I have tried a number of other products. This is a really great eye cream.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product when i saw all the great reviews but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. If it did work for others then great but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Luv my best eye  It wroks well for me , bags under my eyes , wrinkles. I woud a given it a 5 but it didnt really do much for my dark circles.</li>
    <li> This as a great eye cream (although it&#x27;s more like a gel instead of a cream) for those who haven&#x27;t been able to use other eye products due to sensative eyes and skin around their eyes. I have tried numerous ones that irritated mine, but this one doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all! This is my second bottle and although it&#x27;s not magic, it does soften the wrinkles around my eyes. I will continue to use it as long as it stays at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job at all. It supposed to help with dark circles, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks and it has worked wonders for my dark circles. No other product has done this good for me.</li>
    <li> got this to work on some wrinkles around mo eyes ... seems to be really helping and I think my skin looks a little better. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about a month now.  The area around my eyes is definitely looking better - very soft and lines/wrinkles have been reduced.  I like it!</li>
    <li> This product unfortunately did not work for me. The skin below my eyes dried out and I had to stop using it. I know it works well for some people, sad it couldn&#x27;t work for me, but we all have different skin types.The company contacted me promptly about my concerns and rectified the issue above and beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me. I am having dark circle. As 100 + user had given 5 star to this product so tried for 2 months with no positive result. Hence not worth to buy this product .</li>
    <li> this is a great product, i see HUGE results in about 20 or 30 minutes. the reason this lost a star is because the effects do not last long. my dark circles come back in around 5 hours. Other than that, great size, great price, great non-lasting results.</li>
    <li> Product works well. Bottle is cheap.</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement in the firmness of my eye area shortly after using this product.  There was also a reduction in fine lines.  Now that I have been using it for about a month the change is less noticeable because I have probably gotten used to how my skin looks at this point.  I would reccomend this eye cream because it is effective and comes in a large volume.  I am not sure how effective this product is on skin over 40 though.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy this eye cream until something suspicious caught by eyes.  I noticed that almost all of the 4-star and 5-star reviews were written by reviewers that only give 4-star and 5-star reviews on every single product and most of these 31 reviewer have also wrote reviews on same products such as \\&quot;Paleo Diet recipe &amp; Cookbook\\&quot;, \\&quot;60 minute expert: simple Spanish\\&quot;, or \\&quot;Green Tea\\&quot;.  It is pretty obvious that most of these positive reviews are FAKE! Not much information about this product can be found online too.  To those who are paid or volunteered to write false reviews, please STOP!</li>
    <li> Best eye cream works great with removing wrinkles. It only took less than a week too. Even if you don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet I would suggest using this cream. It&#x27;s never too early to think of your skin!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used many \\&quot;professional\\&quot; eye creams, and this is the first that has actually showed results quickly.  This product works!  It tightened my skin and lightened the dark areas.  You really have to try this product. I loved it!!</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels, it has tightened  up my skin and smoothed out my wrinkles. Im in my late 30&#x27;s and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I seem to constantly have these awful dark spots under my eyes even though I&#x27;m only 19. One of my friends gave me some of this creme to use and it completely removed my dark circles and I saw really fast results! I would definitly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Best Eye Cream has worked great in removing wrinkles, those crow&#x27;s feet type, and has removed dark circles from under the eyes. The tightened skin and fast results were like added benefits. Loved it.</li>
    <li> This cream works great and I loved it! It removed my wrinkles and removed my dark circles from underneath my eye. It also tightened my skin and gave me a young, healthy glow. I also saw fast results within one week, I was amazed! This cream is highly recommended and worth the price. A great value, you will not regret your purchase!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, AFTER 4 MONTHS THIS GEL GIVES ME MORE WRINKLES THAN BEFORE. THE NAME IS DECEIVING, THE SIZE IS A GIVE AWAY.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about one week, two times per day. So far, the product has been helpful in removing some of the puffiness around my eyes caused by seasonal allergies. It also helps remove the dark circles under my eyes without feeling heavy or oily. I recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I bought ths product looking for something that would tighten underneath my eyes and remove the dark circles from lack of sleep. This product may work wonders, but after I read the ingredients on the back, I wasn&#x27;t happy that I didn&#x27;t know what most of them were, except for the paraben. I&#x27;d much prefer to put something more natural underneath my eyes for longer term helath benefits.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple top-of-the-line eye creams and always hold the highest expectations for the products I purchase when they promise to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and crow&#x27;s feet, while also firming and tightening skin.  I have tried Estee Lauder Time Zone Eye Cream, Cellex-C Advanced C Eye Firming Cream, Dermadoctor Wrinkle Revenge, and Perricone MD Eye Serum just to name a few.  I have had good results with some, and have been disappointed in others, especially given the money I invested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why I was surprised by Best Eye Cream by Michelle.  I tried it because it guaranteed results or my money back.  And, when I studied, as I always do, the reviews on this product, I was impressed.  I  purchased the product, and I was not disappointed.  It is notably affordable, yet it makes good on its promise to noticeably improve the appearance  of the eye by reducing wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet, firming and tightening the eye, and diminishing dark circles.  I truly did see the firming and tightening effect within the first 30 minutes, and I was surprised by the improved luminosity around my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product again, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an exceptional eye cream at an affordable price.  I am in my mid-50&#x27;s, and I know what it means to achieve noticeable results.  If you have any of the concerns I have listed regarding the aging of the eye, you will benefit from this product.</li>
    <li> I am 56 years old and have tried so many different eye creams trying to find one that actually worked and have found none that really work to get rid of my brown circles (which I inherited from my dear mother) and the bags under my eyes but I finally have found the Perfect eye cream (Best Eye Cream).  I have been using Best Eye Cream for over a week now and in that short time, my eyes are brighter and the skin under them is much less puffy and I honestly believe the brown circles are decreasing.  What I really love about Best Eye Cream is that it doesn&#x27;t make the skin under my eyes feel \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.  Best Eye Cream makes my below my eyes feel softer and smoother.  Before I bought Best Eye Cream, I read the reviews and because of all the positive reviews, I knew I had to try it and I am glad I did. I will continue to use Best Eye Cream for the rest of my life.  My self-confidence has increased after using Best Eye Cream because I feel so much more beautiful and \\&quot;alive\\&quot; not old and haggard. Thank you Michelle for creating this wonderful \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; of Best Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> I dried out skin under my eyes and only helped a little with the rings.  I bought it based on other&#x27;s reviews.</li>
    <li> As we get older one of the first things that shows our age is round the eyes area; bags, dark skin, bagginess and other associated problems.  Since using this product I must say that I love it, it works great and it removes wrinkles and dark circles in a record time.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a product not only does it work great but it also gives you a fast result and very affordable. I purchased it just recently I am already noticing that my dark circles are slowly receding.It also looks like I used an early prevention of eye wrinkles and crows feet since the skin a round my eyes are nice and tight. It looks so youthful! I really love this product. All the ladies out there, wrinkles, dark circles or not, If  you take precautions it&#x27;ll save you lots of money. I say start with this product.</li>
    <li> After having problems with my skin, such as visible pores and dark circles around my eyes, I tried this eye cream. I was impressed after two weeks of using this eye cream that it had tighten skin and removed the dark circles around my eyes. I loved it and would definitely use it for a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes all my life, and my teenage daughter has started to develop them too.  So I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find something both her and I could use.  This stuff worked great and we&#x27;re going to try it on my daughter next.</li>
    <li> After using other more expensive \\&quot;branded\\&quot; eye creams. I&#x27;ve discovered that this eye cream is far better. I&#x27;ve introduced it to a few of my friends and family and got nothing but positive response. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used so many eye creams, including spa and dermatologist formulas. Most recently, I was using four different ones, each costing $100+.  I only tried this because of the reviews.  Honestly, I was skeptical that a reasonably priced cream could be as effective as claimed, but thought I would give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Within two days, I am noticing an improvement. Less crepiness. Lines much softer. And the gel feels good on (not weighty like some creams). At night I still put a cream on under because it is not super moisturizing. Strongly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> The Best Eyecream is the last in a long series in my attempts to get rid of the wrinkles/ dark circles/ puffiness around /under my eyes.  It is the last because I &#x27;VE FOUND IT! This is the best for me.  I &#x27;ve only used it 3 days and it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It does not hurt, leave a weird color, make my face kind of pinch when I smile, or make my eye area look like I am wearing one pound of icing.  It simply works.&lt;br /&gt;My enthusiasm for this product could partially stem from my  smoking cessation.  But I have tried a myriad of facial products during previous sessions of smoking cessation, and none have helped with the almost instaneous and complete results.  Also, the \\&quot;Aquasentials cool/warm gel eye masks \\&quot; soothes and relaxes the eye area, allowing Best Eyecream to do its magic.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again and on a regular basis and encourage anyone seeking relief from \\&quot;tired eyes \\&quot; to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is the Best Eye Cream!</li>
    <li> Applying a small amount under my eyes twice a day has diminished the dark circles under my eyes. However, without proper sleep and less stress it does not appear to work as well. I still have dark areas under my eyes but they do look better since I&#x27;ve used the cream.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye cream a while back. I have dark undereye circles. It had no effect on reducing the intensity of my undereye circles.  After a while the pump stopped working altogether.  In short, this is a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have had dark undereye shadows since I was a kid and this is the first thing that has EVER made the shadows disappear. I like the cool feel of this gel and how quickly it absorbs. My eye look so much better when I use this product. This really is &amp;#34;the best eye cream!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am using this gel for more than 3 months, and I don&#x27;t see any improvement.  Perhaps it works better on some people than others. Sorry, but I am not the one.</li>
    <li> This light non-greasy translucent  eye gel helped me reduce my  \\&quot;dark circles\\&quot; remarkably. I store the container in the refrigerator and when I apply it my skin feels amazingly revived! All my tiredness disappears. I would strongly recommend this product! Just feels GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Monique</li>
    <li> So disappointed .-0000000000*****</li>
    <li> We purchased this about a month ago and are still trying it (along with some other eye creams).  We believe that the jury is still out as to whether this product has really earned its name.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I do believe that this eye cream does work. I&#x27;ve only used this for about 5 days and could really see that this cream has so serious tightening effect on my morning puffy eyes. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> i gotta say guys this is the best product i have ever bought from amazon really it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;after using it for a week it removed all of my dark circles this is amazing really.&lt;br /&gt;in less than a week there was a result :)&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend it to every one.</li>
    <li> I used this eye cream and it is wonderful as it gave fast results.  Would highly recommend this to remove wrinkles and tighten the skin.  Delivers fast results and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes all my life.I am very happy with the way this cream eliminated the dark circles under my eyes. It was also very easy to apply and very natural looking. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the reviews.  Michelle must have alot of friends that posted reviews, because it doesnt work for me.  I have never had dark circles under my eyes, but while using this product I sure did.  Its called best eye cream, but it is a clear serum.  I am very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t buy. I was sucked in by all the positive feedback too. I have NO idea what these people are going on and on about. Firstly, the product is LARGE for eye cream. I have never in my life seen such a large eye cream product. Secondly, how the heck are you supposed to get the product out of the bottle?  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can get the product out since the opening of the bottle resembles that of any ordinary body lotion bottle. But shouldn&#x27;t there be an applicator? Some help on the amount to apply? I tip the bottle over , shake, and can cover my face with the product that lands in my hand. Not that I would recommend that. I have been using the product for about 3 weeks now and can honestly say that the skin beneath my eyes looks worse than ever before. If you want an eye product that makes you look older than your age, intensifies crepes around the eyes, this is your eye cream! I am 45 and do not have a problem spending hundreds of dollars for results. I was taken. This product is pure snake oil. Perhaps I will use the remainder on my feet. I just hope my toenails don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> very useful, it can Substantially improve dark circles, wrinkles, creases, firms and tightened skin for obnoxiously luminous skin, one of my friends started to use it from last month, and recommended it highly, it is worth a try</li>
    <li> This product worked very fast and removed dark circles, it has got to be one of the fastest working products of it&#x27;s kind. would recommend for anyone to use.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and I must say my dark circles are gone. I am recommending this everyone I know that has dark circles. It is very reasonable and price-worthy. I&#x27;m so just amazed that it removed my dark circles!!</li>
    <li> My eyes never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a problem with other creams...that will make my eyes itch. I like this because it&#x27;s a gel and I am not allergic to it. It also does a great job on making my eyes look fresh, which isn&#x27;t easy due to my life style. I will continue to order this.</li>
    <li> I spent  about 30 dollars on \\&quot;Best Eye Cream\\&quot; . I hope it brings me the \\&quot;best \\&quot; result. After several months using, i didn&#x27;t see any improvements around my eyes.  It wastes my money. I &#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s in this product.  It doesn&#x27;t even work.  It feels and smells like hair gel.  I paid $30+ for it and it hasn&#x27;t done anything to reduce dark circles or puffiness. I am very skeptical about the reviews. I cannot return for a refund as I don&#x27;t have the packing slip and it says that returns will be partially refunded.  With the postage in returning, there&#x27;s no point in returning this item to get a partial refund.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for some eye cream that would make my dark circles go away. This product has improved them. I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I was not confident buying eye cream but the reviews pointed to this on multiple websites. After a week using as directed my eyes didn&#x27;t look like I crawled out a grave. The dark circles were crazy diminished. I make this stuff a routine application next to my deodorant. Try this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is not a cream, but a gel. The large tube contains a lot of product, which made me suspicious about the quality for the price.  This gel has no effect on dark circles, it is not even effective as reqular eye cream, since it provides no moisture.</li>
    <li> 1st - This is not a cream, it is a gel.&lt;br /&gt;2nd - It made the dark circles under my eyes so dark that it looked like somene had given me a black eye.&lt;br /&gt;3rd - The reviews are definately fake. Had I read them carefully, it would have been obvious. All the reviewers refer to &amp;#34;the product.&amp;#34; No one calls make-up or face creams or eye creams as &amp;#34;the product.&amp;#34; I am very disappointed that Amazon allowed these fake reviews to be listed.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY IS THE BEST EYE CREAM.  i DO NOT HAVE THE WRINKLES OTHER 66 YEARS OLD HAVE. RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> i got great customer service when my bottle showed up with a faulty pump, and they immediately replaced it. That said, I don&#x27;t particularly care for this cream. It&#x27;s more of a gel than a cream, and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin. I haven&#x27;t seen improvements of any kind since I started using it. That said, it&#x27;s innocuous enough. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and although mixed reviews I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It is a giant bottle and lasts about 7++ months. I received some eye&lt;br /&gt;cream for the holidays just finished it and went back to this. I don&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;have bags or dark circles, but at 53 am starting to show a little loosening&lt;br /&gt;and I think it helps. Feels nice and cool and in my opinion is hydrating&lt;br /&gt;enough for me.</li>
    <li> This bottle is HUGE, it&#x27;s basically your yearly supply if you use it twice a day. Unfortunately after using it for several months I can safely say it doesn&#x27;t really do anything (for me, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Jewish Guy, 30&#x27;s, dark circles under eyes probably due to allergies)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this stuff to be much more effective:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/RoC-Multi-Correxion-Night-Treatment-Ounce/dp/B0018SAJAY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1368468154&amp;sr&#x3D;1-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;RoC+dark+circles</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great feeling on the skin around my eyes. Lately my skin feels thin and fragile . this is very nice and I feel \\&quot;working its magic\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; follow up!&lt;br /&gt; I use this gel morning and night and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell any difference and my container is half full right now. I purchased this Best Eye Cream for the dark circles under my eyes. 3 months later after using this product morning and night I still have dark circles.</li>
    <li> This is the first cream I have used that makes the skin around my eyes feel really soft. I am noticing a difference already in the wrinkles and dark areas under the eye. I like the clear color and pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit it but when I looked in the mirror I saw a woman looking back with a lot more wrinkles than what I started off with.  I asked my hairdresser for some tips and she recommended this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say that all of my wrinkles were gone in a few minutes but they weren&#x27;t. But since I knew they did not appear overnight, I figured I should give it a fighting chance.  I am glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I put it on there was a reduction in the wrinkles around my eyes, but the next morning they would be back.  Knowing this I simply put on before I went out.  The good news is in about 3 weeks I started to notice less severity in my wrinkles.  In fact there are some photos my husband took of me where you can see a noticeable different in the wrinkles around my eyes compared to vacation photos that were taken of me earlier this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to recognize that lady in the mirror again.</li>
    <li> Just got it today....Applied it per instructions once...absorbed fast ....puffiness almost gone....this can&#x27;t be for real...Will try it again two times per day as per instructions...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS EYE CREAM I AM ON MY SECOND BOTTLE, WILL DEFINITELY KEEP PURCHASING. I HAVE ALLARGIES  SO I WILL ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DARK UNDER MY EYES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THIS EYE CREAM MAKES MY EYES LOOK VERY BRIGHT AND SMOOTH, AND SOFT BRIGHTENS THEM JUST LIKE IT SAYS.</li>
    <li> This is probably a better beginning cream for those that are in their 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s.  If you have not started having aging signs it may possibly help maintain youthful skin.  If you have started showing signs of aging then a better option would be Skin Perfection 20% Pepha Tight and Retin-A cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their claims:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diminishes dark circles, wrinkles, creases, and crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;***have not noticed anything diminish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable results in the first 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;***nothing happened after 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firms and tightens skin for obnoxiously luminous skin.&lt;br /&gt;***nothing is firmer or tighter or luminous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin, lightweight serum also works wonderfully as a makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;***yes! it is thin and lightweight and may work well as a primer (I have not tried)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this:&lt;br /&gt;It has some good ingredients, but not enough for aging skin.  You&#x27;d probably be better off and save some money by buying a tub of organic Shea butter and a jar of raw honey, and use that nightly, you will probably start to see results faster than with this cream (gel).</li>
    <li> I have been amazed that this eye gel has noticeably  lessened the puffiness under my eyes and the deep lines aside of my nose down to my mouth.  I have had the puffy eye pouches for years and have tried many creams that have promised to erase them. Some of the eye creams were big brand names and quite expensive but none made any difference.  Although &amp;#34;The Best Eye Cream &amp;#34; has not removed these problems it has definitely helped reduce them.  I would say that this gel has  about halved the noticability of both the puffiness under my eyes and the deep lines from nose to mouth.  I have used this faithfully morning and night for about a month and I am very pleased with the results.  Hopefully things will keep improving over time.  This really is a good eye cream (gel) so give it a try.</li>
    <li> Before making the decision to purchase this product, do yourself a favor and notice that the vast majority of the negative reviews are written by \\&quot;Amazon Verified\\&quot; purchasers. Now look at the positives and see for yourself that the majority are NOT \\&quot;Amazon Verified\\&quot; purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I ignored all the reviewers on here warning about the fake positive reviews and purchased this product anyway to save a few bucks. This is pretty much a 3 oz bottle of crap. I was suspicious when the packaging looked very generic and had slim to no info on it upon arrival. Also, you get way more than you expect because this stuff pretty much just contains a bunch of glycerine (a $30 rip-off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all this, I decided to give this a chance instead of returning it immediately. After a month, I&#x27;ve had NO improvement in my dark circles and NO improvement in fine lines. In fact, this makes my eyes itch and water, and has also caused the appearance of milia beneath my eyes. I&#x27;d get the same result from plain vaseline minus the burning and would save about $25. As a side note, I am not usually sensitive to skin care products, so not sure what that says about this. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, if you&#x27;re looking for a good eye cream, don&#x27;t be taken by all the bogus reviews and spend the extra money. And yes, a product listing with a bunch of fake reviews written by the company itself makes the product a SCAM and the company scammers! Amazon should really look into this, as I&#x27;m weary of trusting reviews on other products at this point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for over 1 month now... no positive changes whatsoever... it claimed to have \\&quot;Noticeable results in the first 30 minutes.\\&quot; FAKE!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I first read about this &amp;#34;Eye Cream&amp;#34; in a Woman&#x27;s Magazine maybe 3 years ago saying how great it is. It actually is a gel, but it is a great product! I use it every night on my old dark circles and the corners of my eyes...I will never use anything else! It works! That&#x27;s all I need :)</li>
    <li> Quickly reduces puffiness and makes the eye area look \\&quot;tighter\\&quot;. I look as if I am properly rested and relaxed. I assure you, I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> Cannot see any results from using this product</li>
    <li> I keep it in the fridge...it does cool but it seems to do little more than that.  I use it when I remember that I have it.</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old, and I have been using this cream for two months now.  I don&#x27;t see a lot of difference but probably its too early.  I will comeback later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that all the reviews are fake.  But some of them are definitely suspicious.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks now for dark circles under my eyes and it definitely hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me.  I don&#x27;t have many other issues outside of dark circles but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in fine wrinkles or bags under my eyes either.  On a slightly positive note, at least it didn&#x27;t make things worse.</li>
    <li> This product is FULL of parabens! Can&#x27;t understand why the manufacturer has chosen to use this ingredient in their otherwise well made product. Sadly, in the garbage it goes.....</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It is clear going on very smoothly. Some of the other eye products I have purchased leave a residue. I have found that is good for me to use a moist cheaper eye cream first. I let that eye cream dry and then I put the best eye cream on over that. The best eye cream goes on smoothly and keeps the skin tighter smoothing out the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to say it right up: I have not tried this item. However, I purchased this for my sister, and it was awful. I never write reviews, but this product was so poor that i felt like it was a must. My sister was so excited to get this product because of all the good reviews it had and how the results were \\&quot;extremely fast.\\&quot; And it had super fast results. Bad ones. After a few days of using it, her right eye looked like it had been punched. Under her eye looked like it had been bruised. Bad, bad, bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things that ring alarm bells:&lt;br /&gt;1) This is not an eye cream. It&#x27;s a gel. It seemed suitable for something you would put in your hair, not under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Savings of around 50 dollars? Awesome, but maybe a little too much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The size of the product was huge! It seemed way too much for just an eye cream. I have hair products smaller than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The name. \\&quot;Best Eye Cream\\&quot;? Sounds so...fake. No other word for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The reviews. Most people who reviewed seem like they are advertising the product. All the negative reviews receive low feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this product will work for some people, I do not know. My sister has hereditary under eye circles and this gel did not work for her.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as expected. Other OTC products are much better.</li>
    <li> Dont know about the others but was satifactory for me. i dont know why is this thing asking for more words -_-</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for 3 days, but my dark circles are looking worse than ever.  I&#x27;m really looking like a racoon.  I&#x27;ll keep trying, hopefully that will ease up and improve.  I&#x27;ve had dark eye circles all my life and have tried many products, all disappointing.  Early signs indicate this might be another.</li>
    <li> Still mad at myself for wasting my hard earn money on this eye cream. I used this cream for almost a year and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> My experience is the same as one of the other reviewers stating that it reduces some discoloration, but not all.  It functions more as a skin tightening product, helping to reduce the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 months and no signs whatsoever, keep your money. Try another product, trust me....</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for only a week and so far I like what the cream does. My eye area is not as dry and the wrinkles seem to be less visible. I love the way it feels, very soothing! I&#x27;m very pleased ....</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about a week. So far it is not a miracle in any since of the word. Goes on nice, but no different than many other products that I tried.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  As expected.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Well, its an eye GEL, not a cream... the first ingr.is water so for puffy eyes its not recommended. I have not had the product long enough to judge the rest of its acclaimed qualities. I do love the large pump container you get, a great deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is in this gel that make it work, but it works amazingly.  I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and just love it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there were parabens in this. Parabens have been linked to the tumors in women with breast cancer. Warning!</li>
    <li> been using this for two weeks and so far seems to have reduced some lines and even the dark circles. I would recommend...</li>
