<li> This product is tricky because if you use too much it make hair too hard</li>
<li> dry ends hair....</li>
<li> Like I said apply it to damp, not soaking wet nor bone dry hair.</li>
<li> This product left my daughters hair a mess.</li>
<li> I expected to feel / see a noticeable difference.</li>
<li> I was anxious to receive my order, since I already knew what it would do for my hair because of the fact that my hair dresser uses it on my hair on a regular basis.....</li>
<li> This does not make my hair smooth! :(</li>
<li> It controls you hair without weighing it down or making it greasy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I apply it everyday on dry hair just before straightening it.</li>
<li> Does not weigh hair down.</li>
<li> Not a good feeling or scent left in my hair....</li>
<li> I have VERY thick, coarse and frizzy hair.</li>
<li> Use your blow dryer &amp; a round brush.</li>
<li> and if you like heavily perfumed products you will like this product.</li>
<li> Just use a small amount of the smoothing lotion or your hair will feel greasy.</li>

    <li> works great on damp hair to control frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love this smoothing lotion. No matter what type of hair you have this is a great smoothing lotion. I use about a dime sized amount of the product, and apply it to damp hair. Like I said apply it to damp, not soaking wet nor bone dry hair. Like to use this product when I blow dry my hair straight. It&#x27;s also great to use if you use a flat iron. After applying the lotion to your hair make sure to come it through from roots to end. Use your blow dryer &amp; a round brush. Work in small sections, and wrap the hair around the hair as your applying heat.</li>

    <li> My hair is curly, thin and with fine highlights. I combine this product with Morrocanoil Treatment Light (just like they did at the hair salon) and I am very happy with the result.

    <li> I purchased the Moroccan Oil Smoothing Lotion from Amazon because I was buying it at a more affordable  price than my hair salon...I was anxious to receive my order, since I already knew what it would do for my hair because of the fact that my hair dresser uses it on my hair on a regular basis.....I assumed that the product would be brand new, however, after using it just once, I noticed an offensive odor while blow drying my hair. It&#x27;s as though the heat of the blow dryer is activating something in the lotion.....It also makes my hair feel as though every strand is coated with a film....Not a good feeling or scent left in my hair....I ordered this product on September 15 and started using it as soon as I received it, however, I just had to stop because of the unpleasant odor and texture of my hair.....My hairdresser told me that it&#x27;s probably a bad batch of the product or it could have been tampered with...Very disappointed because  now , it&#x27;s simply taking up space in my cabinet ...Sorry that I didn&#x27;t just purchase it through my hairdresser at the regular price!</li>

    <li> Bought this for a friend and she told me it doesn&#x27;t really do much for her hair. And that it actually makes her hair a bit puffier, but softer. I&#x27;m sure it would work fine on my hair though.I probably would love this for myself.</li>
