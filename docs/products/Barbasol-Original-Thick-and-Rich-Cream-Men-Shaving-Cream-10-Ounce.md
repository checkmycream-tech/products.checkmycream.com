      <li>Regardless, amazing amount of chemicals.</li>
      <li>The quality of this cream is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten any irritation or dryness from Barbasol, and always get a nice close shave.  </li>
      <li>And it smells really nice.</li>
      <li>The other brands are very good, too, but &#x27;Barbasol&#x27; is the very best canned shaving-foam product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Barbasol washes off easily and leaves a pleasant</li>
      <li>I have used many brands of shaving cream and shaving gel, Barbasol is the absolute best that I have used.</li>
      <li>The cream has a soft sent, making it perfect for males &amp; females.</li>
      <li>This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>Works good and cheap.  </li>
      <li>It comes out of the can easily when pushed, and has a handy cap to prevent unwanted dispersion.</li>
      <li>This product is much better than the cheaper ones that can be bought.</li>
      <li>Most days I use an electric razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shaving cream, what more do you need to know.  </li>
      <li>went and bought more from Walmart and threw out the cans I got here....</li>
      <li>you went to the \\&quot;specialty shops\\&quot; and bought powdered shaving soap as used by Japanese barber shops, Buddhist monasteries and assorted &#x27;skin-heads&#x27;, THEN you could get a great shave!</li>
      <li>Love waking up to the pterodactyl art.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I was pleased with the experience.</li>
      <li>I get an ok shave with it, but I get a closer shave when using a brush and shave soap (Williams, Col Conk etc).</li>
      <li>I love this to have in my possession.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better container.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m retired and the electric works OK for around the house.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rich!</li>
      <li>most importantly it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I needed a vessel to safely transport dinosaur embryos from a secure compound on an island in South America.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and rich.</li>
      <li>Maybe the creams weren&#x27;t as good with the old more primitive razors.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the fanciest and most amazing shaving cream, but it&#x27;s very very cheap (actually cheaper than in most brick and mortar stores) and it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Boy, these new five-bladed razors are really good with this old-fashioned stuff.</li>
      <li>The shaving was smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>Bought one on Amazon and it still is a fine shaving cream.</li>
      <li>If that isn&#x27;t enough for you recognize this can of shaving cream for the respect it deserves, it smells great too.</li>
      <li>I have shaved my head for the last eight years and it works great for that as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommend if you want smooth skin, and no irritation</li>
      <li>Smooth as silk.</li>
      <li>Not only is it great for that</li>
      <li>I returned home - smooth sailing.  </li>
      <li>Then, the TIME it took to get a good lather was a luxury suitable &#x27;for weekends only&#x27; (when most folks didn&#x27;t really NEED to shave!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brand is the classic that many of us have come to recognize and love.</li>
      <li>I want to make a blanket out of this&lt;br /&gt;shaving cream and sleep the sleep of the rich.</li>
      <li>I ordered the original and received the original.</li>
      <li>The best type of shaving cream there is, better then all those overly marketed garbage that are more expensive.</li>
      <li>an angels cloud and as rich as Bill Gates!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It rinses off clean or can even be rubbed off clean, unlike some of the newer gels and creams that seem to linger.  </li>
      <li>Well, I ran out of gel and when I was in a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market</li>
      <li>Shaving is quick, nick free and efficient.  </li>
      <li>A good basic product.</li>
      <li>It is more like the real barbershop cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, give it a try, buy some good shave cream, and support American jobs!</li>
      <li>Not bad can to have for rainy days for the price where I ran out of my organic shaving cream without chemicals or the pricey L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy with the right viscosity for a smooth, even application.</li>
      <li>use a 6-bladed dorco razor and generally use any kind of gel-based shaving &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Its the only shaving cream I can use that moisturizes and stays thick, great for close shaves and its perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I vividly remember him shaving every morning and wondering when I&#x27;d be able to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>This was about the same cost as the stores but got to love amazon!</li>
      <li>The price for a pair of cans is so worth it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really understand the popularity of gels, they cost more and do the same thing :)</li>
      <li>, while Barbasol may not be as good for those of us with &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin, the trip down memory lane is worth it.  </li>
      <li>Maybe Barbasol has worked hard to perfect their old fashioned product.</li>
      <li>Much better than those &amp;#34;foaming gels.&amp;#34; It definitely seems as though I get a closer shave with this stuff.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using this takes me back to the days when I frequented my favorite barber, John, in NYC.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 4 stars from me because while it smells good and lathers up very good it tends to dry somewhat, but no biggie because I use Barbasol&#x27;s Soothing Aloe now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used barbasol a lot throughout my life, and this really was garbage.  Foams up good, but doesn&#x27;t stick to my face.  went and bought more from Walmart and threw out the cans I got here....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Buy</li>
    <li> I needed a vessel to safely transport dinosaur embryos from a secure compound on an island in South America. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better container. It even dispenses shaving cream! I tested this out in my hand in a restaurant and put it on someones pie. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Not only is this the same old reliable Barbasol shaving cream that my father used, but it has some stellar advertising for Jurassic World on the can.. Love waking up to the pterodactyl art.</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with this product for 16 years but stopped sometime in 2013. The foam does a mediocre shaving job. In fact, I couldn&#x27;t shave every day and resorted to shaving 1-2 times a week because my face would become red and tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very heavy and thick Indian beard, and this foam could not penetrate my stubble - it seemed to float over my skin, hence, my shaves were not smooth at all. I felt I was pulling out stubble instead of cutting through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally in 2013, I gave up my 5-blade cartridge razor and chemical-laden canned cream, and switched to a straight razor, shaving soap (like Mitchell wool fat) and a badger brush - I&#x27;m never going back to this stuff.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re getting it for Jurassic park gimmick then don&#x27;t buy it. It looks different than it appears in the picture on Amazon.</li>
    <li> All I ever use, great product</li>
    <li> This is bargin brand shave cream.  It works well for the price, but don&#x27;t expect great things.  I get an ok shave with it, but I get a closer shave when using a brush and shave soap (Williams, Col Conk etc).</li>
    <li> This brand is the classic that many of us have come to recognize and love. It&#x27;s creamy with the right viscosity for a smooth, even application.

If that isn&#x27;t enough for you recognize this can of shaving cream for the respect it deserves, it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Gillette Gel Sensitive Skin Ingredients: Water; Palmitic Acid; Triethanolamine; Isopentane; Glyceryl Oleate; Stearic Acid; Fragrance; Isobutane; Sorbitol; Hydroxyethylcellulose; PEG-90M; Propylene Glycol; Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice; Silica; BHT; Blue 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbasol Cream Ingredients: Water , Stearic Acid , Triethanolamine , Isobutene , Propane or May Contain Butane , Sodium Lauryl Sulfate , Laureth 23 , Fragrance , Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) , Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) , Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract , Salix Alba (Willow Bark) Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is sold for $2.50 each in a four pack 8.4oz  in Costco, $3.00 for 7oz, and Barbasol for less than $1.50 in single 10oz tubes in CVS and Walgreens. If you compare the ingredients take out what is in both the left over difference will be;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GILLETTE: Palmitic Acid; Isopentane; Glyceryl Oleate; Sorbitol; Hydroxyethylcellulose; PEG-90M; Propylene Glycol; Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice; Silica; BHT; Blue 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BARBASOL: Propane or  May Contain Butane , Sodium Lauryl Sulfate , Laureth 23 , Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) , Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) , Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract , Salix Alba (Willow Bark) Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbasol sells cream, Gillet is not a cream, it&#x27;s a gel. There really is a difference applying cream than gel. Cream is ready to go, gel you need to rub. With cream, there is not much feel to it and feels that it does not do much at all. To get a cream in Gillette you need to purchase one which is for females and sales for less than gel. Regardless, amazing amount of chemicals. Not bad can to have for rainy days for the price where I ran out of my organic shaving cream without chemicals or the pricey L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to. it&#x27;s not a very complicated thing. My cheeks nose and scalp are still attached - VICTORY!</li>
    <li> Good smell and most importantly it gets the job done. Good amount and it has lasted me a couple months</li>
    <li> You likely did not notice but the call volume was cut from 11 oz to 10 oz, almost a 10% cut (that is a lot of cutting). Since I normally reorder without looking, I want to point out this was done. So please be aware and see if there are less costly alternative than one who just increased price a lot, basically</li>
    <li> Most days I use an electric razor. Sometimes&lt;br /&gt;I like to take my time and pamper myself.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a good experience.</li>
    <li> For the perfect shave I&#x27;d recommend this product. It works great and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> The lather of the shaving cream was thick and creamy, after the shave my legs and bikini area were left soft and smooth. The cream has a soft sent, making it perfect for males &amp; females. Bottle was easy to hold and shaving cream was simple to dispense. I will definitely purchase this shaving cream again.</li>
    <li> The quality of this cream is absolutely amazing. Very smooth and rich. There is also a huge amount in a single can as well so it&#x27;s been lasting me a while. I love it.</li>
    <li> Just got tired of paying for Gillette blades, even though they give a good shave.  So I went back to basics and ordered a nice Edwin Jagger double edge safety razor from Amazon and a box of Persona blades.  Now I&#x27;m experimenting with soaps/cremes.  I&#x27;d been using bar soap in the shower but that didn&#x27;t work well with the DE razor so I read about good ol&#x27; Barbasol.  It works better; not great but better.  I&#x27;ll probably wind up using a brush; maybe I can use one with the Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, keep in mind that you can buy one of these cans at Walmart for less than $1.50, so 4 cans for what the Amazon seller is asking.  Come on guys...</li>
    <li> One can has lasted me about 4 months thus far. Unless they stop selling it, I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Been a long time user and will continue to buy.  Allows for a close shave without gumming up the blades.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream works wonders! The thickness lets you get a good close shave, plus no razor bumps afterwards. The price beats the other brands, and so does the quality of this product. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never going to change brands unless they stop making this. It gets right to the point, no oily gel that has to be rubbed into an unknown quantity of lather. Nope, just plain old shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of barbasol, but who cares. It&#x27;s nothing more than the best shaving cream out there.</li>
    <li> The best type of shaving cream there is, better then all those overly marketed garbage that are more expensive.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I got tired of paying $3.00 each for a plastic razor that lasted a week, gave me endless nicks, and filled up our local landfil with it&#x27;s several million twin brothers.&lt;br /&gt;I dug out my Dad&#x27;s circa 1957 Gillette double edge razor, bought some good blades and went back to getting a real shave while spending about .30 per week for blades.  Of course, in the search for the ultimate shave cream to go along with my newly rediscovered way of shaving, I experimented with different creams and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I tried an expensive tube of italian shave cream...dried out quickly and required constant re-wetting.&lt;br /&gt;I tried an expensive block of shave soap and a  brush...way too messy and made shaving more of project than a simple shave.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few cans of Barbasol competitors...all too watery.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the new, low friction, shave gels....clogged the razor and took forever to rinse off my face.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I needed a small can of shave cream to fit in my travel shave kit, and found a travel size can of Barbasol that seemed just fine.&lt;br /&gt;While on my trip, I used the Barbasol and to my surprise, found that it worked perfectly.  The lather is wet, stays wet and allows the razor to glide over the whiskers with ease.  Shaving is quick, nick free and efficient.  Barbasol washes off easily and leaves a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;When I picked up a large can, I only paid $1.89 for a product that out performs any $6.00 cream that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good pairing with the Barbasol shave cream is their after shave lotion.  It&#x27;s about $1.50 at Dollar General and some other stores and leaves that old fashion &amp;#34;just left the barbershop&amp;#34; scent...which goes away shortly thereafter thus not overwhelming anyone in the elevator on the way to work.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both products.</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of shaving cream and shaving gel, Barbasol is the absolute best that I have used.</li>
    <li> smells great. jurassic park geek out everytime i use it</li>
    <li> It is what it is. Decent price depending where you at, unfortunately even with free 2 days shipping it is cheaper to just buy at store for me, even with tax. But is it a good product.</li>
    <li> What to say ? It&#x27;s not the fanciest and most amazing shaving cream, but it&#x27;s very very cheap (actually cheaper than in most brick and mortar stores) and it gets the job done. A good basic product.</li>
    <li> Where to begin...hey first off...it&#x27;s made in the USA!...and it really works...I mean really works...I&#x27;ve tried a number of soaps and creams, brush and brushless...this really is as good as the stuff you can pay $25 for in the small shops...they all try to say how good there are, and the great stuff they put in their soaps and creams...but really guys...it&#x27;s just shaving! it&#x27;s not rocket science...&lt;br /&gt;So, give it a try, buy some good shave cream, and support American jobs!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Much better than those &amp;#34;foaming gels.&amp;#34; It definitely seems as though I get a closer shave with this stuff. Also, it makes me crave whipped cream, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand since the early 90&#x27;s when I discovered it while in the Army. I have shaved my head for the last eight years and it works great for that as well. I bought three of these because my girlfriend used mine when she ran out of shaving cream and now she uses this on her legs so it is an all around multipurpose shaving cream....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shaving cream, what more do you need to know.  It works good I guess.  Good price and value.  I&#x27;ve bought this as an add on item, and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Same old Barbasol I&#x27;ve been using since I was 14 years old. So no problem with the product, it is just as good as ever. However, it was 12 degrees when it was delivered, so it was frozen solid. Unfortunately I did not have a hot date, so I was able to wait for it to thaw before tackling the face growth. Smooth as silk. Hope to have tons of use for it.</li>
    <li> The shaving cream is wonderful and great for an add on item.  This was about the same cost as the stores but got to love amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving gel for at least a couple decades. Well, I ran out of gel and when I was in a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market I went to the shaving supplies to get another can. About four brands were stocked on the shelf and next to them were two kinds of Barbasol Shaving Cream in old-fashioned ten-ounce aerosol cans. Barbasol? Man, I haven&#x27;t even seen that brand in ages. But there they were. It was like a time warp! Just out of curiosity, I decided to try the Soothing Aloe variety. It was cheaper than al the gels. So why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I shaved with it. Strange experience. I pushed the little indented button on the top and my hand was filled with a firmish ball of white creamy lather. Onto the face it went and I spread it all around to cover the areas with whiskers to shave. The shaving was smooth and easy. Boy, these new five-bladed razors are really good with this old-fashioned stuff. In little time I had a smooth, slick shave. I wondered why did I ever stop using these aerosol shaving creams? Why  did I shift to gels? Maybe the creams weren&#x27;t as good with the old more primitive razors. Maybe Barbasol has worked hard to perfect their old fashioned product. Anyway, I was pleased with the experience. The next time I was in the store, I bought the Barbasol Original Shaving Cream in the red and white striped can. Now that one really looks out of the past. The reason I bought it is that we have a very retro-looking sink and shaving area in the master bedroom and I thought it would look good there. It does. It fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff since I started shaving.  Simple, effective, economical, and just a plain ole&#x27; classic.  I&#x27;ve never gotten any irritation or dryness from Barbasol, and always get a nice close shave.  It rinses off clean or can even be rubbed off clean, unlike some of the newer gels and creams that seem to linger.  Neutral fragrance, and good lather texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> I ordered the shaving cream that was in an orange canister.  what was shipped was the shaving cream in a red canister - which is a different product.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sending it back because of the small $$ involved, it is not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Wow! After using another product for the past year, I remember why I started using Barbasol to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not shaved my face for the past 3 months, since m&#x27;lady liked the grizzy look. Low and behold, she ended up not actually liking the grizzly look. After much debate, I decided to quit looking like a barbarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an application of Barbasol, within 4-5 minutes ALL of the hair was soft and non irritated enough to start shaving. Normally I have to re-apply shaving cream, this late in the game. The texture and moisture of barbasol allows for extended shaving time, since a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you want smooth skin, and no irritation</li>
    <li> Barbasol is the shaving cream my dad used to use, (and I used to play with as a kid)  Its the only shaving cream I can use that moisturizes and stays thick, great for close shaves and its perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Same item you would get at your local drug store except at a much better price.  Other than that - not much more to add.</li>
    <li> Works good and cheap.  Don&#x27;t really understand the popularity of gels, they cost more and do the same thing :)</li>
    <li> Good Value. Works good too.</li>
    <li> My dad used this stuff.  Still does!  I vividly remember him shaving every morning and wondering when I&#x27;d be able to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can, and I hate it!  I hate shaving, but also this stuff is total garbage!  What were you thinking, dad?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;My dad shaves with an old-school single-blade gillette razor.  He has used Barbasol for as long as I can remember.  He loves it and will never change.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;I use a 6-bladed dorco razor and generally use any kind of gel-based shaving &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m currently using the Dove brand which is kinda nice.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;On a recent trip home, I didn&#x27;t bring my shaving gel.  It takes up too much room and I figured I&#x27;d borrow what I found at my parent&#x27;s home.  I used Barbasol.  IT CUT ME UP SO BAD I WAS SHOCKED!!!  This stuff offers NO protection and has NO moisturizing ability!!  You might as well use NOTHING when shaving instead of this stuff!!!  OH I WAS SO MAD!!!  I was bleeding like CRAZY and cut myself up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!!!  And - AND I thought &amp;#34;maybe I am an idiot shaving&amp;#34; so a few days later, I tried again!  But AGAIN it cut me up wicked bad!!!!&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home - smooth sailing.  My 6-bladed thingamajig worked just awesome with my Dove gel.  Even this morning I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all.  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re a 70 year old man who has been using this stuff his whole life, AVOID.</li>
    <li> This was a convenient purchase for me during military training restrictions.  The item arrived on time and there was no damage at all.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product if you are smuggling dinosaur embryos out of a secret island. Not only is it great for that but it even works. It actually has shaving cream in it. I tested it out myself. I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on pie though. Defiantly not meant to be eaten. But what was I going to do just wipe it on the table. Pfft that would just be silly. Anyways. totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> You might as well use generic Cool Whip. Actually, I think the generic Cool Whip would be a better choice because at least it would serve double duty. This stuff provides zero lubrication. Unless you have the skin of a crocodile and couldn&#x27;t nick yourself with a chainsaw then I would recommend you buy a quality shave soap or cream. I mean why not treat yourself to a quality shave? It&#x27;s not that expensive to buy a quality product.</li>
    <li> Work good. Same Barbasol as always.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t buy this item in Japan (and amazon.com can&#x27;t ship it to me! &amp;lt;GRR!&gt;) but I picked up a can of &#x27;Barbasol&#x27; regular in a pharmacy while on vacation in New York city (my home-town) several years ago. I was suspicious, as it was so cheap, while all the other brands were 2-3 times the price. I wish I&#x27;d bought a dozen cans! Great shave every time, guaranteed! Japanese shaving soaps (all types--tube, foam, solid) were practically useless (on a westerner&#x27;s beard) and imports were super-expensive, back in the mid-90&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you went to the \\&quot;specialty shops\\&quot; and bought powdered shaving soap as used by Japanese barber shops, Buddhist monasteries and assorted &#x27;skin-heads&#x27;, THEN you could get a great shave! That would set you back a small fortune for the soap (bulk-pack, of course!) and would require a decent shaving brush which also cost upwards of a few hours&#x27; worth of your pay. Then, the TIME it took to get a good lather was a luxury suitable &#x27;for weekends only&#x27; (when most folks didn&#x27;t really NEED to shave!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used plastic disposable razors, my only &#x27;shopping request&#x27; of my friends traveling back to the States was a can or two of &#x27;Barbasol&#x27; regular. They were a little surprised, as they didn&#x27;t use the product (and this stuff, allegedly, used to go &#x27;on sale&#x27; at supermarkets in Chicago and San Francisco for a very low price!) but it was what I needed and wanted. Two cans lasted me close to a year, unless I&#x27;d had a lot of house guests...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this foam, now, whenever available, even though I&#x27;ve switched to a \\&quot;wet electric\\&quot; shaver and all the &#x27;world-famous&#x27; imported brands have come down in price, by about half. The other brands are very good, too, but &#x27;Barbasol&#x27; is the very best canned shaving-foam product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My husband have used Barbasol all his life. It is increasingly difficult to find it in stores so when I can find it I stock up. This product is much better than the cheaper ones that can be bought. It is more like the real barbershop cream.</li>
    <li> Barbasol shaving cream does its intended job quite well. Its rich, thick foam helps moisturize and protect the face while shaving. And it smells really nice. But so do the other name brands. So, why buy Barbasol? Well, my experience is that it is generally a few pennies cheaper than the other brands. If you can save a few pennies each time you pick up a can of shaving cream, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving cream, better than other more expensive creams. It is also priced very well . . . . .</li>
    <li> I like this shaving cream. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . v</li>
    <li> It is really  Excellent and it is so smooth shaving that I complete my shaving within a few minutes. I love this to have in my possession.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> The shaving cream is wonderful. I ordered the original and received the original. In shopping for this product for my boyfriend I had mixed up the products, one had 3 cans for the same price as this ONE. My mistake of course and that doesn&#x27;t say anything about the product. I will never buy this product through here ever again though.</li>
    <li> they have been doing this for years . dependable product you can trust</li>
    <li> I sport a baldie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s low maintenance and it reduces my &amp;#34;get ready to go out&amp;#34; time.  Usually, I&#x27;d go for Edge gel shaving cream.  I like the sensitive skin stuff as it makes for a smoother, bumpless shave.  Barbasol does the trick so long as you let it sit a bit and allow your pores to open up some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbasol is ideal for straight-blade shaves.  I mainly use a four of five-blade razor, sometimes powered, sometimes not.  With the Gilette Pro Styler, I take a couple of passes to really get the smoothness I desire..  But, hey, stubble is in so who cares??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this takes me back to the days when I frequented my favorite barber, John, in NYC.  He was an old-school Italian gent with the accent and all.  A good storyteller too!  Anyway, you&#x27;ll know what I mean when you smell this stuff - it&#x27;s what the pro&#x27;s use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while Barbasol may not be as good for those of us with &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin, the trip down memory lane is worth it.  Plus you can fool people into thinking you always pay for your grooming.  All jokes aside, I notice little, if any, irritation or razor bumps so I may stick with Barbasol.  The price for a pair of cans is so worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  BUT DO NOT PURCHASE ONLINE.  I made a snap choice when buying razor blades to also grab this, and then saw it at a store for $2 bucks.  Whoops....</li>
    <li> Did not feel like going to the store.  Saved gas buyng online.  Shipped and recieved as planned.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s frigging shaving cream! Why are you reading a review about it?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a big can,it&#x27;s a great price, and it&#x27;s shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know what else to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh here try this;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the can bright white and fluffy like a cloud.&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream is the stuff of which dreams are made.&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would cover myself in this shaving cream and&lt;br /&gt;walk around in a creamy wonderland! I would probably be locked&lt;br /&gt;up but I would be creamy. I want to make a blanket out of this&lt;br /&gt;shaving cream and sleep the sleep of the rich. Rich! that&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this shaving cream is bright white, like a angels robes, it&#x27;s fluffy&lt;br /&gt;like an angels cloud and as rich as Bill Gates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya. If you want me I&#x27;ll be covered in shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Been using Barbasol Shaving Cream for years and plan to keep using it because it hold it&#x27;s texture and I never get face burn while shaving. Best Shaving Cream on the market.</li>
    <li> cheap cream works great.</li>
    <li> I used to use this years ago and just forgot about it. Bought one on Amazon and it still is a fine shaving cream. Delivery was great and cost less overall than a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> No Issues.  I&#x27;m giving this item 5 stars because it is a commodity type item that preformed exactly as it should.  No issues.</li>
    <li> For everyday use I use an electric shaver. I&#x27;m retired and the electric works OK for around the house.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m going out I use a straight razor and this thick and creamy shaving cream allows for a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I just live the way this shaving cream foams and lathers. What a great way to start the morning! I might just be coming back for more.</li>
