      <li>It has really aided in keeping my skin blemish free, it doesn&#x27;t sting at all and its non</li>
      <li>I am glad to have purchased this toner, so far its working.</li>
      <li>I love Derma E products which are natural and light and appear to work very well on my aging skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Today, I rarely wear make up</li>
      <li>It has a fresh lite scent.</li>
      <li>Results, I look like a 60 year old with healthy, glowing skin.  </li>
      <li>It really seems to clean my skin and prep my face for my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This toner leaves my face clean and ready for the Derma e night cream.</li>
      <li>On top of that it smell like flowers and I really results so far.</li>
      <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth without moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I find this toner to be very gentle and since it&#x27;s enriched with Vitamin A it helps with wrinkles and complexion correction.</li>
      <li>Anyways, at first I didn&#x27;t feel any difference but</li>
      <li>Interestingly enough, the backs of my hands look better too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different toners and the Vitamin A is by all means my favorite.</li>
      <li>This glycolic wash has my face glowing, clean, radiant, also soft.</li>
      <li>This dries my face out just enough and keep it nice and clear.</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and have not used any kind of soap on my face for a very long time; I&#x27;ve been making my own homemade concoction of aloe vera and tea tree oil along with some other natural home remedies.</li>
      <li>This toner smells really nice, however it does leave your skin a little sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this item for a couple weeks I really like it.</li>
      <li>When I was toning my face with drug store toners, or even department store toner like &#x27;clinique&#x27;, it really irritated my skin because all it did was burn me.</li>
      <li>Regardless of how carefully I have cleansed my face, I always get a bit more dirt or makeup off.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle with just a hint of papaya.  </li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to use this</li>
      <li>I really needed a toner and thought maybe this would do the trick.</li>
      <li>My skin is actually much clearer using this line.</li>
      <li>I like the product, but not how is was packaged not so much.  </li>
      <li>My face feels clean when I use this product but overall the issues I had</li>
      <li>The first order of the product I rate much higher than the last.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying these products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend all their products.</li>
      <li>and while I don&#x27;t credit this toner with keeping my skin clear (I&#x27;m also using Retin-A and taking spironolactone), it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>I use it about 3 to 4 times per week and it really helps keep my skin clear.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and fresh, not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>The toner is great because it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like other toners did in the past.</li>
      <li>I use this at night and use the Derma e Very Clear cleanser in the morning.  </li>
      <li>As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive to certain products and this one is gentle enough where I don&#x27;t have a reaction.  </li>
      <li>I like the derma e toner although I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I actually saw this product at Whole&#x27;s Food.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have adult acne</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t completely decided if I like it or not.</li>
      <li>I think it does a good job of removing soapy residue that can be left behind from soaps/cleaners while adding a layer of moisture.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other toner but it does remove any residue left from cleansing and leaves my skin fresh, toned and ready to receive my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I suffered from adult acne for several years and I had a hard time finding products that wouldn&#x27;t irritate and cause more</li>
      <li>I apply several drops on a Swisspers Cotton Round and smooth over my face, neck and décolleté.  </li>
      <li>This is the only toner that shows improvement in the skin ( soft &amp; even) yet doesn&#x27;t irratate!</li>
      <li>My face feels refreshed and soft, never tight or dry.  </li>
      <li>Another reason why I picked this product over the other ones is because it has aloe vera which is very soothing to the skin, and also because it has papaya extract.</li>
      <li>However, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any brightening and there is a slight sticky or tacky feel to my skin after I use it.  </li>

<li> A complete waste of money (though I did not find the fragrance overpowering as another reviewer mentioned).</li>
<li> Anyone with either dry or oily/acne prone skin should give this a try.  </li>
<li> Your fingers, stray loose hairs etc stick to the side of the bottle.  </li>
<li> I purchased 2 of this item and got 1 empty bottle.</li>
<li> It deep cleans your skin without a heavy residue I will repurchase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great service and product.</li>
    <li> This toner made my skin break out and leaves it feeling and looking oily. A complete waste of money (though I did not find the fragrance overpowering as another reviewer mentioned).</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of this item and got 1 empty bottle. and the box was opened. totally dissapointed</li>
    <li> I love this toner! I started using Derma E products about one year ago and absolutely love their products. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different toners and the Vitamin A is by all means my favorite. My skin feels very soft and smooth without moisturizer. It also seems to have helped even out oily/dry spots. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I can feel it working after using and it really does a great job removing the extra dirt off my face after cleansing. I always feel refreshed after I use this product</li>
    <li> I like the product, but not how is was packaged not so much.  The outside had a plastic film to keep it from leaking.  After removal it left the entire bottle STICKY. Your fingers, stray loose hairs etc stick to the side of the bottle.  Very annoying.</li>
    <li> I actually saw this product at Whole&#x27;s Food. I really needed a toner and thought maybe this would do the trick. Turns out to be a great buy. The toner is great because it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like other toners did in the past. My eyes doesn&#x27;t get watery at all when I apply it on my face. When I was toning my face with drug store toners, or even department store toner like &#x27;clinique&#x27;, it really irritated my skin because all it did was burn me.I find this toner to be very gentle and since it&#x27;s enriched with Vitamin A it helps with wrinkles and complexion correction. Another reason why I picked this product over the other ones is because it has aloe vera which is very soothing to the skin, and also because it has papaya extract. Papaya helps with brightening the skin and clarifies it quite well. This product has really good stuff that&#x27;s somewhat natural... When I go through the list of some other toners I don&#x27;t even know half of the chemicals they place in there. Anyways, at first I didn&#x27;t feel any difference but the more I used it the more I realize how much my skin was loving it. It really does brighten up my complexion and made my skin feels really healthy. I can&#x27;t say for sure that it helps with my oily skin but it really does feel really nice. On top of that it smell like flowers and I really results so far.</li>
    <li> I like the derma e toner although I have sensitive skin. So I use this at night and then use a thick moisturizer so it can rehydrate. When I use it after the derma e blemish control wash it&#x27;s too drying. But I like them both. Just make sure to keep your skin hydrated or it will over produce oil and in turn your skin will have break outs again.</li>
    <li> I like this toner a lot . I like that has gycolic acid at the same time that tone your skin and the smell is good .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Vitamin A Glycolic Cleanser and Vitamin A Moisturizing Gel.These products provide excellent exfoliation but don&#x27;t further aggravate my acne. My skin is actually much clearer using this line. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have adult acne so exfoliation is key, but scrubs can make my skin worse. I highly recommend trying these products. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The first order of the product I rate much higher than the last.  This version of the toner leaves my skin a bit sticky after use and I have to rinse after use.  It still does the job of removing the dirt and oil left behind after regular washing.</li>
    <li> I gave this toner a 4 star rating because it cleans well and does not cause any irritation to my skin.  However, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any brightening and there is a slight sticky or tacky feel to my skin after I use it.  Also, it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I had hoped for.  I will probably not order this again.</li>
    <li> I love all the derma e products. This one in particular is very nice. It has a fresh lite scent. It really seems to clean my skin and prep my face for my moisturizer. It is paraben free and cruelty free, and you can pronounce the ingredients!</li>
    <li> My face feels clean when I use this product but overall the issues I had I still have. Id use this product again but its hard to find a product that minimizes the wrinkles of time.</li>
    <li> I like this product good enough.  I think it does a good job of removing soapy residue that can be left behind from soaps/cleaners while adding a layer of moisture.  I do not feel as if it is drying me out.</li>
    <li> This product works well to remove traces of makeup that cleanser left behind.  It is not greasy or too drying but is just right leaving your skin feeling so clean.  Best toner I have found and all natural product makes it even better.</li>
    <li> This toner is amazing, it is a perfect pair of a cleanser, your skin feels great, clean after use it, and I love the smell too...</li>
    <li> I use this at night and use the Derma e Very Clear cleanser in the morning.  This glycolic wash has my face glowing, clean, radiant, also soft. I noticed it has helped heal some acne scaring,  they have been vanishing.  Love everything about it! I will be purchasing another bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the only toner that shows improvement in the skin ( soft &amp; even) yet doesn&#x27;t irratate! I only use it at night after I wash. It does leave your skin a bit dewy, but no worries if you just use it at night. I use this in conjunction with a moisturizer &amp; salicsylic acne treatment. Noticed very little breakouts after using this! Love!</li>
    <li> Works well with my skin. I have no adverse reactions. Works as intended and I love how clean my face feels after cleansing with a pad.</li>
    <li> I have been using Derma products for two years now, and hands down it has done magic on my skin. The toner, face wash leaves your face looking flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It minimizes my pores, reduces redness, and I haven&#x27;t found a wrinkle yet. I used to wear a lot of make up working for MAC cosmetics, and when I quit I still had it ingrained in my head \\&quot;do not leave the house with make  up on\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I rarely wear make up and I get so many compliments on how fresh faced I look from strangers. This item is amazing and it is such a easy system. I highly recommend all their products. I have them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to be in trend, where less make-up and having glowing skin.....this one is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no stinging despite the Glycolic which scares many people away....don&#x27;t be scared. This is seriously ambrosia from the gods.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love dermae products and this is another great one!  Anyone with either dry or oily/acne prone skin should give this a try.  It really works well to help exfoliate and remove the dead skin cells that can either flake on dry skin, or clog pores on oily/acne prone skin.  Gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting as many glycolic acid products can, but works well.</li>
    <li> This toner smells really nice, however it does leave your skin a little sticky. I haven&#x27;t completely decided if I like it or not.</li>
    <li> I am glad to have purchased this toner, so far its working. I keep forgetting to use it though! I would recommend this to my friends also.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I am on my second bottle and cannot imagine why I would ever quit using it.  The fragrance is light and fresh, not overwhelming.  I use this twice a day after cleansing.  I apply several drops on a Swisspers Cotton Round and smooth over my face, neck and décolleté.  Regardless of how carefully I have cleansed my face, I always get a bit more dirt or makeup off.  My face feels refreshed and soft, never tight or dry.  I also wipe the tops of my hands to use up the last bit goodness on the pad.  Results, I look like a 60 year old with healthy, glowing skin.  I can&#x27;t say that it has eliminated any wrinkles, but it has improved the appearance of the skin, pores seem smaller, and my complexion is brighter.  Interestingly enough, the backs of my hands look better too.  I believe my lighter age spots have faded somewhat; the dark ones seem unchanged.</li>
    <li> This toner leaves my face clean and ready for the Derma e night cream.</li>
    <li> Use it nightly then apply some Peptide formula.  It&#x27;s great &amp; smells great too!  Don&#x27;t use Peptide &amp; C together.  C cancels Peptide out.  Use C daytime.</li>
    <li> This is a product that i am used to and is pleased with this cleanser.i would continue to purchase this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this about 6 months and I don&#x27;t use it every day. I use it about 3 to 4 times per week and it really helps keep my skin clear.  I have had a lot less breakouts since using.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have oily/combination skin. Ever since I turned 30, my skin was prone to acne breakouts. Not anything serious, but a few hear and there sometimes those painful cystic pimples. This dries my face out just enough and keep it nice and clear. Follow up with moisturizer of course.</li>
    <li> I suffered from adult acne for several years and I had a hard time finding products that wouldn&#x27;t irritate and cause more issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months and I won&#x27;t use anything else. It has really aided in keeping my skin blemish free, it doesn&#x27;t sting at all and its non drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage anyone who suffers from acne or have sensitive skin to try this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. \\&quot;in my opinion\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time for starters. It smells wonderful, doesn&#x27;t sting and seems to help clear up my skin fast. I will be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> I love this toner. As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and it makes my skin feel very soft. I am prone to breaking out and while I don&#x27;t credit this toner with keeping my skin clear (I&#x27;m also using Retin-A and taking spironolactone), it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt. Mostly I adore the scent and consider it aromatherapeutic.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive to certain products and this one is gentle enough where I don&#x27;t have a reaction.  It removes any excess make-up not taken off by my face wash and creates that fresh clean feeling afterwards.  The scent is also great it&#x27;s gentle with just a hint of papaya.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this toner in along with the facial wash. I have seen a noticeable difference in the texture and redness in my skin. I have VERY sensitive skin and have not used any kind of soap on my face for a very long time; I&#x27;ve been making my own homemade concoction of aloe vera and tea tree oil along with some other natural home remedies. I was very hesitant to use this but it is great. I have been using it for about a month now and have had no issues with it drying out my skin or irritating it. For some reason the toner is very hard to find in-store so I will continue to order from Amazon. The shipping was good and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for a couple weeks I really like it. It deep cleans your skin without a heavy residue I will repurchase. I have seen a difference in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> It seems to do the trick. I wasn&#x27;t using a toner prior to Derma E so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other toner but it does remove any residue left from cleansing and leaves my skin fresh, toned and ready to receive my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love Derma E products which are natural and light and appear to work very well on my aging skin.</li>
