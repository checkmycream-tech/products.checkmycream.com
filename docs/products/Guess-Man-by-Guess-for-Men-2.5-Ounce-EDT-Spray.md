    <li> Every woman (seriously, Every woman) whose walked by and catches a whiff always:&lt;br /&gt;1. Stops&lt;br /&gt;2. Gives a compliment&lt;br /&gt;3. And asks &amp;#34;what kind of cologne are you wearing?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;4. I reply &amp;#34;Guess.&amp;#34; The smart ones catch on, and the ditzy ones well...  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my girlfriend loves the smell.  So 5 Stars, and no complaints from me.  Since it does work.</li>

    <li> A little expensive but i have not yet came across anyone that did not like the smell. Ladys love it</li>
    <li> Para mi una de las mejores fragancias de la guess y las uso a cada momento del dia. es extraordinaria</li>
    <li> Guess man has been around for some time but it never fails to turn heads.  I purchased this for my brother after speaking with several men who say that they continue to wear it because it&#x27;s oil-based strength definitely stays with them throughout the day and the compliments NEVER stop coming.  I like that it&#x27;s not overpowering and didn&#x27;t break the bank as so many designer fragrances do.</li>
    <li> My husband found this cologne at a department store, and we ordered it at a much lower cost from Amazon. He had caught a whiff of this scent a few years ago on a guy, loved it, but hadn&#x27;t asked what it was, so was delighted to find it again. It&#x27;s a casual cologne. For someone who usually prefers high-end scents, I actually love it as well, and find it inviting.... could have longer staying power, but at this price, re-applying it as it wears down isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> Great price, right size I gave it to my nephew as a gift, arrived on time. Will cost more at any other store.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Great price and great delivery.</li>
    <li> I have always love this perfume and I recently bought it for my best friend for his birthday. He was so excited!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne so when I found it on amazon for so cheap, I immediately bought it for my husband. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Excelente, fue entregado en el tiempo previsto y sin ningun inconvenientes, lo recomiendo, es responsable 100%. Satisfecho con el servicio prestado</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of this from Amazon and had one bottle from a Guess store.  The one from Guess is very strong and last very long -- one spray and the fragrance can be detected across the room.  But the ones from Amazon is very very mild.  I literally doused myself and still can hardly smell it.  I had to put my nose all the way against the spot where I sprayed to smell the fragrance.  So this product from Amazon is either a fake or it is extremely diluted.</li>
