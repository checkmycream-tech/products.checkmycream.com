      <li>Way better than Kleenex.</li>
      <li>If you use Charmin or Cottonelle, give these a try - you&#x27;ll like them better.</li>
      <li>What they will do is rise to the top of what is called the &amp;#34;mat&amp;#34; inside of your septic tank and will eventually clog your leach field.</li>
      <li>Best personal wipes my husband</li>
      <li>We really love this product.  </li>
      <li>THE FRAGRANCE IS EXCELLENT FRESH FRESH FRESH-</li>
      <li>It has a good combination of gentle, effective ingredients for keeping you clean and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>and I love having stock available.</li>
      <li>these are the next best thing to keep oneself clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>The reviews speak to the product accurately.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe there is no close substitute available.</li>
      <li>They have a really light scent, so you don&#x27;t smell as if you&#x27;ve just used wet-wipes.</li>
      <li>They are great for personal cleaning as they are meant to be in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>They are also useful and effective to deodorize the intended area on hot days.</li>
      <li>Who can ask for anything more? ;-)</li>
      <li>works great and doesn&#x27;t dry up like the others out there.</li>
      <li>They clean every bit as well with none of the irritation all the others cause.</li>
      <li>they are FAR better then Cottenele and many others.  </li>
      <li>Problem is: this most excellent product is becoming scarce and expensive.  </li>
      <li>Wet ones are great for me</li>
      <li>Good personal wipes.  </li>
      <li>Since I work full time, I can&#x27;t be running hither and yon to find this</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really soft, so they feel nice on your skin.</li>
      <li>Most brands and even those claiming to be gentle set my rear on fire.</li>
      <li>they are the best wipes  do not dry out  and are larger than others</li>
      <li>I bought these for the most obvious reason: to make sure I was thoroughly clean after using the bathroom and during my period.</li>
      <li>, THE WITCH HAZEL IS SUPER SOOTHING-</li>
      <li>A great alternative to the gentleness of hemorrhoidal wipes if you simply need a gentle wipe.</li>
      <li>Hey a good hygiene wipe to keep things clean down there is needed.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re comfortable and work very well.  </li>
      <li>I give 4 stars because I am not crazy about the material</li>
      <li>Being a 91 year old guy - I appreciate the performance of Fresh &#x27; Flush and have for many years.</li>
      <li>Everyone makes this kind of thing, and I used to think they were all the same, but that is not the case.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t dry out, are a decent size and a great price.</li>
      <li>We travel with packets of Fresh and Flush everywhere.</li>
      <li>Compare to Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipe]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE -</li>
      <li>Other brands fell apart, but Fresh n Flush were still strong........not good.</li>
      <li>The price is right</li>
      <li>So beware because once you start treating your butt right, you&#x27;ll be hooked</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of moisture, slipperiness, &amp; soothing.  </li>
      <li>Gentle and priced to keep you clean without cleaning you out.</li>
      <li>Dr. Oz says that we should clean better than we do or can with just toilet paper.  </li>
      <li>It is soft, extra moist and smells great; but beyond those pluses, it gently eases the itching and dryness.</li>
      <li>They are very soothing!</li>
      <li>however, the name &amp;#34;fresh n flush&amp;#34; obviously implies they&#x27;re ok to flush...</li>
      <li>These are the best flushable wipes I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m really disappointed they aren&#x27;t going to be making more of them.  </li>
      <li>The are gentle/soft, just enough moisture, a good size, and yet sturdy enough to do the job.</li>
      <li>pretty much any age.  </li>
      <li>More smooth, comfortable, and wet than any other brand</li>
      <li>We needed something to help out in certain situations.  </li>
      <li>Most are made with ingredients that dry out and inflame your skin (yes, even the ones that say &amp;#34;for gentle skin&amp;#34; and have aloe in them).</li>
      <li>However, the moisture that is used is very agreeable</li>
      <li>I have Crohn&#x27;s disease, and these really work well.</li>
      <li>I really like these</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the highest value you will find on Amazon, or anywhere really.  </li>
      <li>The self seal package really does work.</li>
      <li>Thanks...</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s great to find a product like this that flushes easily so far, has no alcohol, but yet still has witch hazel, which is extracted from the leaves and bark, is known for its astringent properties and often found in other products with alcohol, either as a by product of the distillation process or added as a preservative, it does not necessarily contain alcohol, it depends on the preperation.  </li>
      <li>I tried the single pack first and found these wipes to be quite fantastic, so I ordered the six-pack refills.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first starting using these because of bike tours that I go on. The group I ride with doesn&#x27;t stop in hotels......we do what my friend calls &amp;#34;stealth camping&amp;#34;. Basically we ride until we can&#x27;t and then we find an inconspicuous sleeping spot like a ravine on the side of a road. Sort of hobo style. Anyway, there aren&#x27;t restrooms in ravines and you need to keep your shorts clean and your butt happy. These flushable wet ones deliver everything you need. I now use them at work because I think the supplier of that sandpaper is a sadist. So beware because once you start treating your butt right, you&#x27;ll be hooked</li>
    <li> These wipes are soft and soothing, especially with aloe and witch hazel which you won&#x27;t find in other wipes.  I&#x27;ve used several other brands of wipes, and these are by far the softest and most soothing.  You&#x27;ll never want to use dry paper again, and after getting hooked on these wipes, I never want to use another brand again.  I also recommend the single-wipe travel packs for those just-in-case moments when you&#x27;re out and about.</li>
    <li> I tried a few brands before finding these online (can&#x27;t find them in stores) and these have been the most gentle. I wish they came in a pop-up style.</li>
    <li> These are the best wipes! My Dr. recommended them for the witch hazel. They are very soothing! They are flushable and do not dry out before all are used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Wet Ones\\&quot; for years.  They are wet, soft, and do what they are supposed to.. and they don&#x27;t clog the pipes.  Who can ask for anything more? ;-)</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no going back after using these sweet little babies. They&#x27;ve got it all folks. Gentle and priced to keep you clean without cleaning you out.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my house is using them and I would recommend for kids and adults as well... pretty much any age.  If there are issues of sensitive skin, this is very soothing and does not seem to agitate at all.  I have recommended to family members who have started using them as well and everyone seems to like them.  At fist they may seem a slight costly for the little packages but they do a great job and are worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like these, it&#x27;s great to find a product like this that flushes easily so far, has no alcohol, but yet still has witch hazel, which is extracted from the leaves and bark, is known for its astringent properties and often found in other products with alcohol, either as a by product of the distillation process or added as a preservative, it does not necessarily contain alcohol, it depends on the preperation.  It has a good combination of gentle, effective ingredients for keeping you clean and comfortable.  I even use them on my face in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of moisture, slipperiness, &amp; soothing.  So, so sad to hear they&#x27;re being discontinued. cccc  ccddd ddd</li>
    <li> Everything was as stated.  The reviews speak to the product accurately.  It&#x27;s the highest value you will find on Amazon, or anywhere really.  No alcohol is a plus.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about at all, they are a good size, clean up well, and are soothing on irritated skin.</li>
    <li> These wipes work better than any other butt wipes out there.  Others fall apart on you, leave lint, have perfumes, etc.  These do none of that and they also contain witch hazel which is good for your hemorrhoids.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are excellent for our toddler. Way better than Kleenex. I wish they were cheaper, but hey, toilet paper ain&#x27;t cheap either....</li>
    <li> Best personal wipes my husband and I have ever used. We won&#x27;t use anything else. Very smooth on your behind.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I can use.  All the others have something I must be allergic to, because they cause a very inconvenient itching.  I give 4 stars because I am not crazy about the material -- it is rather thin and not much cloth-like (as are the others).  However, the moisture that is used is very agreeable</li>
    <li> Being a 91 year old guy - I appreciate the performance of Fresh &#x27; Flush and have for many years. The addition of witch hazel to their formula makes the product soother than any other on the market that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Good to have on hand for the elderly and children.  It does not irritate the skin, and I plan on using it again.</li>
    <li> Hey a good hygiene wipe to keep things clean down there is needed. Most brands and even those claiming to be gentle set my rear on fire. These get the job done without any irritation. A great alternative to the gentleness of hemorrhoidal wipes if you simply need a gentle wipe. Impossible to find in stores but available online.</li>
    <li> If you were walking down the street and got poop on your arm, you wouldn&#x27;t wipe it off with a dry piece of paper and call it clean, would you?  (Then why do you do that with your a-hole?)</li>
    <li> We needed something to help out in certain situations.  This is now the de facto tool for final cleanup operations, with regular TP still performing most of the major work.  We&#x27;ve tried others like Cottonelle, which are softer, but the Wet Ones are just that - really moist.  They&#x27;re great for soothing and cleaning things up nicely.  The other brands are drier, which makes them not much better than what you have without wipes.  Say goodbye to &amp;#34;road rash&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I tried the single pack first and found these wipes to be quite fantastic, so I ordered the six-pack refills. They have a really light scent, so you don&#x27;t smell as if you&#x27;ve just used wet-wipes. They&#x27;re really soft, so they feel nice on your skin. They do a great job of cleaning without being rough or needing lots of dry, regular toilet paper. Plus, they&#x27;re flushable. It&#x27;s also easy to fold a few in a ziplock baggie for when I travel. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> I have Crohn&#x27;s disease, and these really work well. Their size is fine, and they aren&#x27;t perfumey like some of the other brands, which cause a rash and irritation...as several of the other reviewers have mentioned, these are hard to find in south Florida. I used to buy them at Publix, but for some reason they stopped carrying them...thank&#x27;s Amazon!</li>
    <li> These are the best flushable wipes I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m really disappointed they aren&#x27;t going to be making more of them.  They&#x27;re softer than all the others I&#x27;ve tried and they stay moist until you use the last one.  Get them while you can.</li>
    <li> Great product. Had to purchase refill since tubs were not available.</li>
    <li> This product will finish what your toilet paper left behind.  This is the only product in the market that does the job well without shredding.  It comes in a box or just a refill.  It is your choice.  The wipes has no alcohol so it does not burn your delicate areas.  We travel with packets of Fresh and Flush everywhere.</li>
    <li> I refuse to wipe my bum with anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these 100 times already.  They&#x27;re great.  They don&#x27;t burn and they stay moist to the bottom of the pack.  The refill package is convenient.  How many times do you need to order that annoying plastic container anyhow?</li>
    <li> best personal wipes on the market</li>
    <li> There is no way I could cope with running out of these so I always order in bulk to avoid that situation from ever occurring. In the absence of a bidet (oh, how I would love to have one) these are the next best thing to keep oneself clean and fresh. It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make me unbearably itchy - they are definitely hypoallergenic, and very soft and gentle on the undercarriage. They don&#x27;t dry out, are a decent size and a great price.</li>
    <li> These wipes are a life saver especially since I live in California, which is currently in a drought state of emergency. I normally use a lot of water afterward, but these wipes allow me to not have to wash my hands every single time....I just use them every other time.</li>
    <li> The stores no longer carry this brand in my area, but I keep ordering them. Everyone makes this kind of thing, and I used to think they were all the same, but that is not the case. Most are made with ingredients that dry out and inflame your skin (yes, even the ones that say &amp;#34;for gentle skin&amp;#34; and have aloe in them). These are made with witch-hazel, which is the ingredient used in hemorrhoid relief pads. They clean every bit as well with none of the irritation all the others cause. Why no other company has thought of this, I don&#x27;t know, but these are the only ones my family uses.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time, but appears that they are a discontinued item.</li>
    <li> If you like to &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; your lower area,(how else can I say it), this is the best buy.  Highly recommend.  The self seal package really does work.</li>
    <li> We really love this product.  We have this set up as one of our Subscribe and Save items so our refill order comes automatically.</li>
    <li> I love these, but unfortunately the manufacturer has discontinued them due to &#x27;consumer misuse&#x27;, as I called to inquire why.  They said these were clogging people&#x27;s toilets since they were flushing them.  I have used these for years, and I never flush them as they are obviously thick...however, the name &amp;#34;fresh n flush&amp;#34; obviously implies they&#x27;re ok to flush...so it seems like the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t want liability...a big disappointment for me as I love these wipes a lot...I wish they could just rename them and take out the &amp;#34;flush&amp;#34; part...I hope they will bring them back in the future...first they did away with the individually single wrapped ones, and now they&#x27;re making all of them obsolete :-(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product I hate to see go away</li>
    <li> Great, as advertised...</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  We love this brand and are happy with our purchase.  The price is right and I love having stock available. We purchased both the tubs and the refills.</li>
    <li> I hate how most wet wipes are way too small! These are a great size and get the job done! And they last a while, at least for me!</li>
    <li> Great product, I don&#x27;t know why it is no longer in stores.</li>
    <li> best of their kind on the market and I&#x27;ve  tried many.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It consigns toilet paper to the primitive category.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Problem is: this most excellent product is becoming scarce and expensive.  May: 1)  it remain on the market;  2)  Amazon continue offering  it.</li>
    <li> These are the best wipes, too bad they are not sold in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Best wipes out there and I have tried them all......but NOW I know why the price was so high compared to what they had sold for in the markets.........it is because they are not being sold anymore.........guess product name didn&#x27;t attract enough attention,,,,,but they are FAR better then Cottenele and many others.  Shame.</li>
    <li> These things came in a big pack that will likely last a long while.  They&#x27;re comfortable and work very well.  They also smell great.</li>
    <li> Item came in short time and as expected.  Glad to see people still ship to servicemen and women overseas. 20th Word.</li>
    <li> Cost a little more than ones at groceries, but worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I used these until Costco came out with their Kirkland brand which are better. Compared to dry paper either of these will leave you cleaner but I had my colon removed and frequently get sore there from all the trips to the bathroom that I am left with and this wipe has something in it that burns more than the Kirkland wipes. Also these are quite thin which led to using more and bleed through which is not sanitary. The Kirkland wipes are twice as thick, moist not soaking wet like these and ultimately superior. One does the job so I use less and with the Kirkland wipe being thicker there is no bleed through which clearly is not what you want with toilet paper wet or not... Oh...and the Kirkland wipes are cheaper too....YAY...</li>
    <li> These wipes are great for added personal hygiene but the recent price hike is insane. They used to be $20 for a pack of 6 (total 288 wipes) until just recently and now they&#x27;re to $60!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to try the Equate brand also sold here on Amazon - same amount, similar product, same type of resealable package - currently $18 at [[ASIN:B00EMWYWMO Equate Flushable Wipes 6-pack 288ct) Compare to Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipe]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - ALTHOUGH THEY SAY FLUSHABLE, DO NOT FLUSH IF YOU HAVE A SEPTIC TANK. They are chemically / biologically safe, BUT - they will NOT break down and dissolve over time. What they will do is rise to the top of what is called the &amp;#34;mat&amp;#34; inside of your septic tank and will eventually clog your leach field. (For those who don&#x27;t know - the leach field is the set of septic drain pipes that are underground connected at the top of a septic tank that allow the surface overflow of your septic tank to drain out into the ground, and if you clog your leach field septic drain pipes you&#x27;re in for very costly repairs and probably a disgusting backup experience in your home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flushing might not be an issue for dwellings with city sewer systems, but for homes on private land with your own septic tank flushing anything like these is a mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product though, for people who like to stay extra-clean.</li>
    <li> Wet ones are great for me and I have used them for years. I use them at home for cleaning my hands and removing spots on a shirt if I spill while eating. They are great for personal cleaning as they are meant to be in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I ADORE THIS PRODUCT- I THINK IT IS THE \\&quot;ONE THING I WOULD NEED ON A DESERT ISLAND\\&quot;- THEY ARE THE BEST WIPES FOR A 50 YR OLD PLUS FEMALE- I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR SO LONG I CAN NOT DATE THE ONSET- THEY ARE SUPERIOR TO TOILET PAPER ON SENSITIVE \\&quot; FEMALE ANATOMY\\&quot; -- GENTLE CLEANSING - BUT COMPLETE CLEANSING. THE FRAGRANCE IS EXCELLENT FRESH FRESH FRESH- I ALWAYS MAKE SURE I HAVE 6 PACKS ON HAND- KEEP IN PURSE FOR AFTER DINNER HAND WASHING- BUY THEM YOU WILL NEVER USE TOILET PAPER AGAIN, THE WITCH HAZEL IS SUPER SOOTHING- THEY ARE COOLING IN THE SUMMER MONTHS- WILL BE A STAPLE IN YOUR HYGIENE WORLD...</li>
    <li> We recently had the plumber out.  Found wipes clogging drain pipe.  So we did a test - soaked wipes in water overnight.  Other brands fell apart, but Fresh n Flush were still strong........not good.</li>
    <li> This is the best item of its type on the market. I have not been able to find it in stores for at least 2 years.</li>
    <li> No idea how I never bought these before. Excellent product for intended use. Six pack makes the price very good as well.</li>
    <li> I have used other wipes with the witch hazel in them and they definitely smelled like they had it in them, but this wipe is very different! It is soft, extra moist and smells great; but beyond those pluses, it gently eases the itching and dryness. This is now my go-to wipe.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best butt wipes anywhere.  More smooth, comfortable, and wet than any other brand and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands.  No problem with any allergic reaction either, which I&#x27;ve had happen before with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, they&#x27;re better than any other brand... if you can find them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the most obvious reason: to make sure I was thoroughly clean after using the bathroom and during my period. I have since discovered several other uses and benefits. I like that these are the smaller refill packs - I keep one pack in my purse in case I end up in a public restroom stall that does not have toilet paper. I&#x27;ve also found that using one of these in the morning and again at night prevents ingrown hairs and itchy bumps after getting a Brazilian/bikini wax, due to the witch hazel, which is far less irritating and drying to my skin than Tend Skin. They are also useful and effective to deodorize the intended area on hot days. One thing I do not recommend them for is makeup removal, particularly eye makeup removal, as the witch hazel will be too irritating to the eyes. For makeup removal, I recommend regular or sensitive skin baby wipes.</li>
    <li> Great flush-able bum wipes. I bought the plastic holder and a package of 6 refills. It is good for travel and at home. A good price for a good product; what more do you want?</li>
    <li> Good personal wipes.  These come in a box of 6 and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> they are the best wipes  do not dry out  and are larger than others</li>
    <li> These are softer and smooother than any other comparable products in this space.  If you use Charmin or Cottonelle, give these a try - you&#x27;ll like them better.</li>
    <li> Finally these refills are less expensive than the plastic cased ones.  Never did understand why the refills, which are a lower sheet count, would be more expensive?  Anyway, great product, great price!</li>
    <li> It is what we&#x27;ve been using and our local Publix isn&#x27;t carrying the product these days. Since I work full time, I can&#x27;t be running hither and yon to find this and you came to our rescue.  Thanks...</li>
    <li> I have tried many other brands but they just don&#x27;t compare to Wet Ones.  Unfortunately none of the stores in our area sell the Fresh &#x27;n Flush variety of Wet Ones so I have to order them online but I will not use any other brand!</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz says that we should clean better than we do or can with just toilet paper.  These are a good size (not too big but big enough to do the job) and flushable.  I am bothered by using extra products, though.  I suppose that we should have small washcloths that we can use and put in the dirty clothes after one use, like diapers.  Are we going to do that?  Probably not.</li>
    <li> Low in chemicals and perfumes. Witch hazel is a main ingredient. Good enough to special order -- Publix no longer carries this, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> My world was ruined when this product was discontinued. I can&#x27;t believe there is no close substitute available. Clearly there is a demand for it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I think it was discontinued.  Shipping timely as well.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these wipes for a long time and they are so much cheaper to buy online in larger quantities. The are gentle/soft, just enough moisture, a good size, and yet sturdy enough to do the job. We&#x27;ve never had an allergic issue or problem with flushing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> BEST WIPES EVER.....NO irritation like Cottonelle or other junk brands.....Unfortunatley becoming rare in stores and hence the price increase online!!!!!! THE BEST.......NO COMPARISON!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe these are antibacterial so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for then you may need to look elsewhere. Not overly fragrant and plenty of moisture to them. I keep a pack in my backpack at school since the lunch tables don&#x27;t get wiped down very often. I would buy again and seem like a great value pricewise.</li>
    <li> Very good product. can&#x27;t find it around my area. works great and doesn&#x27;t dry up like the others out there.</li>
