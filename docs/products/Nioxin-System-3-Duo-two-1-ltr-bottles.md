<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> It has helped in my hair&#x27;s growth</li>
    <li> Information was accurate and product arrive in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Purchased for Mother in law going through chemo... we really think it helped.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years and I like it a lot.  Does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a wonderful price. Not a phony product.  I was skeptical since the deal was too good to be true but I was won over.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the tingle that I normally get with Nioxin.  May not be the real product. Guess I&#x27;ll go back to paying the high price to make sure I&#x27;m getting the real thing.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser told me to start using this product because my hair was falling out from stress.  Well, I&#x27;ve gone through about 5 containers of this stuff, and I would say that I notice a difference.  It hasn&#x27;t caused my stress level to go down, but I guess I didn&#x27;t really expect that.  :o)  Basically the product created the optimal environment for the hair to grow in.  I find that I shed a heck of a lot less, and my hair looks a lot nicer.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it ^_^</li>
    <li> Great value.  Great product. Definitely will reorder.</li>
    <li> This has been the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> It was very good, I love it .</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and noticed my hair was thinning on top. I have thin, fine hair anyway so losing more was heartbreaking! Nioxin really thickens my hair and after about a month, I could really tell a difference! I also started taking biotin and folic acid, bought a flat iron that I can adjust to a much lower temperature, and began using a leave-in protein treatment. All of this, plus Nioxin, have really made a difference!</li>
    <li> received it quickly and a great price for the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking from. Arrived quickly and was pacaged well. Great seller great item at a great price. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It gets your hair clean the first shampoo no matter what products you use.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t over soften or leave conditioning treatments on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great for people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> Best product for fine color treated hair!!!  Washes &amp; conditions scalp wonderfully!!!  Nice cool natural eucalyptus tingle in the shower</li>
    <li> Good value good transaction.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price! Last time I bought my shampoo spent $30 and got  2/3 less product.  The Shampoo has saved my hair.  Have been using Nioxin for 2 1/2 yrs and my hair is thicker, fuller and does not seem to be falling out as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very happy with my purchase!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not as strong as the one I bought in the store. I feel like it was diluted but still alright</li>
    <li> Your scalp feels amazing using these products.  I won&#x27;t be using anything else for quite a while.  These bottles are truly huge and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using it  for a year.  Very happy with the results. My hair is growing back</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> As my hair and I have aged, I have found this product to be very helpful in maitaining my color and thickness of hair.</li>
    <li> I always love nioxin. Great product.</li>
    <li> The proof is absolutely visible - excellent results. Could not be more pleased. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo works for my wife so a lot of hair growth on it and less hair lose</li>
    <li> She loves this product and will only use Nioxin.  If she is happy, I am happy.  She deserves the very best.</li>
    <li> product was recommended for my personal situation and it was recommended that it works, but until some time goes by I will not be able to rate its efficiency.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I am  ordering this product again as my hairs have become healthly since i start using it. Once you start using this product you will realize the effect in few weeks.This cleanser and conditioner is little expensive than other products available in the market but I can tell you its worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and am always getting compliments on my hair.  This may not help to regrow your hair but is sure does help to keep what you have! Thanks Nioxin!</li>
    <li> I was experiencing hair loss due to my thyroid. My hairdresser recommended Nioxin. After using for about three weeks, I notice less loss and noticed new hair growth. Now after 5 months of use. my hair is back to being thick, full and my bathroom floor has less hair to pick up.Great product!!</li>
    <li> excellent deal, have been using it for a long tome. wonderful results. no split ends, hair is always soft.</li>
    <li> The only problem I had with this product is that the lid on the shampoo wasn&#x27;t tight and it spilled all over. I love this product and this was a excellent deal.</li>
    <li> glad I discovered Nioxin, now im able to take care of my sculpt and on top of that hair loss is very less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product 3 weeks from now; and really I have noticed that hair is not falling the way it used to do before.&lt;br /&gt;im happy with the results</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and this product truly has made my hair thicker after using it for 2 years.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love, so much better priced then beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> Very good for the colour treated hairs.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product in the past and I tried it out. Love it definitely works. I stopped using it due to lack of finding it in stores. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair thinning out a lot within the past weeks and looked up this product on Amazon. The price for the size of bottle is unbelievable. I received it way before expected delivery date and have been using it for about a week and already can feel a difference in the thickness. It also leaves my hair very soft and smooth, smells good and the best part is its a scalp treatment. I&#x27;ve had issues with itchy dry scalp with any shampoo that I&#x27;ve switched too. This product definitely does its job. Will continue to use this product!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for these two items togather. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Makes her hair feel soft! Hope her new boyfriend enjoys it! :-)</li>
    <li> excelent  product for that price.</li>
    <li> It was fast and wrapped up nice,very nice job!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product line. Love the tingle!!</li>
    <li> Great product and even better price here vs my salon.  I personally feel that it worked for me.  Definately slowed down my shedding after a recent surgery.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I feel it does a great job.  Amazon has the best price for combo set.</li>
    <li> This works!  And my hair looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> I like the results after using this product for several months. I shampoo daily and it is gentle enough on my hair to allow me to do that. I like the cooling sensation from the cleanser.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I have seen quite a difference and have gotten so many more compliments of my hair! It definitely takes time but it worth it! The photo I atrached is a 2.5 month difference! I love the product and recommend it!</li>
    <li> Been so pleased, with my thinning hair and bold spots after chemo, it produces good enough coverage.I know my original hair won&#x27;t return but it&#x27;s better now.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have been using them both for well over 2 years and my hair loss has stopped and my hair is thicker and has body.  I am also using a hair loss prevention product on my scalp but the addition of this shampoo and conditioner has made the results even better.  Some reviewers have complained about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; but I like the fragrance of both products.</li>
    <li> great buy! I have been using this for 4 months and do believe it is helping my thin hair can see some new groth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. I am an Asian you all know most Asians have thick dark hairs and I mean lots of hair. My hair was also thick and lots of it but started getting thinner on the scaple. So I started using this product when someone highly recommended to my wife by her close fried. So after few months I start noticing that my hair getting thinner and thinner as I kept using it and loosing it do much that finally I stop using it it completely. No more.</li>
    <li> What a great value and of course Nioxin is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> wonderful great size needed it my stylist uses it now i can get a prof wash at home for cheaper:)</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use on my hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and have good results.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This is my second order over  2months .&lt;br /&gt;im seeing stronger and new growth</li>
    <li> My husband was losing his hair in his crown - after starting this product several years ago, he doesn&#x27;t appear to have lost any more - in fact, it seems as though a lot of it has grown back - very good product</li>
    <li> bought it again and will buy it again in the future</li>
    <li> Fast and as promised two thumbs up</li>
    <li> Buy this for my mom with thinning hair.  She used to get it in the salon for much more cost. No complaints. Seems to be the legit product.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry &amp; lost. I have used this product for over 6 months and my hair is soft &amp; reduces losing.</li>
    <li> I have dry curly hair and this product keeps it from breaking off and getting split ends, keeps scalp clean as well.  Worth the $$$</li>
    <li> Best price I have been able to find.  Love this shampoo and conditioner.  I makes my scalp tingle.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product...Great deal.</li>
    <li> I want it to work!  But I don&#x27;t see any real results.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.</li>
    <li> Loved the product, it really feels like your hair is totally clean, bouncy and not flat at all. Great product?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nioxin products 10 years. The 1 liter duo at this price is an excellent deal; half off salon price. Salons I&#x27;ve frequented only stock the duo a couple times per year, once again Amazon to the rescue. My hairdresser recommended the Nioxin products when I was losing hair (20% loss) due to (then undiagnosed)thyroid problems. The shampoo/scalp therapy conditioner reduced the loss by 50% after 1 months use and increased the volume enough to make the loss unnoticeable.  Still use these products because they are good to my hair.I have shoulder length, thick, coarse hair, color every 8-10 weeks.  Hair feels and looks healthy, no residue. Safe for everyday, doesn&#x27;t strip color or moisture from hair and smells fresh not flowery. Added bonus, no Winter flaky scalp. I would recommend the shampoo/scalp therapy conditioner to anyone, losing hair or not.</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair.  It strengthens your hair and helps re-grow hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product with the Nixon 3 Treatment spray since March 2015 and I see no hair growth whatsover. My hair is still coming out by the brush-full. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. I may need to try Ovation Therapy now....</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this product.  I will continue buy, just don&#x27;t buy it from Beautogen.  This sell sold me an old product, it didn&#x27;t have the signature refreshing tingle the product is known for.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist always uses this when I get my hair done and I loved it. But it is too expensive at the salon. So I ordered it here. It is invigorating and makes your hair and scalp feel so so clean. I use it about 3 times a week. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and highly recommend it for naturally thin hair or hair loss of any kind.  Would not leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; Great Product!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to sooth my scalp from psoriasis. I can&#x27;t begin to explain how wonderful my head finally felt when I used this shampoo and conditioner. It stopped my flakiness and the sores went away.</li>
    <li> Wish I had of started using this product a long time ago, its a great product, my hair loves it.</li>
    <li> I recently had Bariatric Surgery which causes most patients to lose thier hair for 3 to 6 months because of the protein absorbtion issues. This product was recommended to me by my Dr. I immediately noticed a difference after one week of use and have continued to use it with noticeably less hair loss since. This was my second order and I am considering to continue using it even after the hair loss stops! I have always had very thin, fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner just seems to give it life and body.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t believe I found it at such a great price! It definately makes my hair feel fuller and softer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife. She is very happy with the way her scalp feels and the soft feel to her hair. We have used Amazon for our daughter&#x27;s books for college and we are very satisfied with the speed in which we get our order&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Fairly new user of this product. As a cleanser is certainly top notch, and the conditioner is not too heavy. After six weeks of use, I like the texture of my hair, but too soon to tell how it will effect hair growth. Great $ for this duo!!! I&#x27;m patient and will continue to use. Seasonal change will be a test for this product.</li>
    <li> This Duo is great!  I save a lot of money when I buy through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Help me to much. I was losing to much hair lately when I start to use Nioxin diiscover a. Wonderful item I los less hair my hair become more. Strong, shine and give more volume I really recomend it.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Within the first use I could see a change in my hair&#x27;s texture, shine, and elasticity. I love the minty smell and the feeling of tingling and coldness on the scalp is very refreshing and nice. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and it&#x27;s amazing for my hair. I was skeptical at first but it does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. My hair is thicker and even a bit longer. Also, where I have a scar on the corner of my head, there&#x27;s even hair starting to appear and grow there, which is a plus! Great product. Glad I purchased. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great product quick delivery</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!!</li>
    <li> I regret going for Quantity instead of Quality. Spend the exta money and buy it locally and make sure it is made in Canada NOT Mexico.</li>
    <li> I Was Hoping This Produxt Will Work For My Hair As Some Reviews I Read Had Help Others.Unfortunatly, It Didnt Help My Hair. I Was Shedding More Hair Then Before. Disappointed With This product.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  It is good shampoo and conditioner.  A little bit! goes a long way.  My 6 year old granddaughter loves the minty smell. My older sister liked it.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I ever had use........awesome results</li>
    <li> My hair is starting to look like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s! Its fuller and healthier! I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and the liters were at a great price. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> nioxin system 1 seems more effective for my hair.it did not have any effect on colored hair. noxin i  or nioxin 3. only difference is nioxin 1 gives a fuller look.</li>
