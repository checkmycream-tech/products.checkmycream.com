<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not really a slow speed. slowest speed goes too fast to use on my nails.</li>
    <li> I stops right in the middle of using. I don&#x27;t know if i just got a bad device or if it is the unit itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this item September 23rd and now it paste estimated arrival so aim not sure if tgis was a scam or if my product is on its way!</li>
    <li> The drill worked fine but the bits that came with it did not fit.  I had to buy new bits.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but the first time i used it the botton flew across the room and I was left trying to put it back together my self.  I guess you get what you pay for... :)</li>
    <li> It did not come with instructions had to watch you tube video on it on how to put pieces together</li>
    <li> I really like the drill because now i can put fake nails on and have them stay on for longer time than i used to</li>
    <li> Not good at all it gets hot its stops working within 3 to 4 mins after you have turn it on</li>
    <li> Great for home use but wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for commercial. It gets hot and stops working but all you have to do is turn it off for a few seconds and its good to go.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Not worth the money or the time. It really only has one speed despite how its advertised and comes with tools that are useless. The quality of the files is super poor and they wear down fast. Save your money.</li>
    <li> The bits don&#x27;t fit/stay on</li>
    <li> This nail file comes with the speed and power needed to file acrylic nails. The heads on this file is phenomenal. I adore this product!!</li>
    <li> I like the product but the pieces don&#x27;t fit in it and so you cant use it. So its worthless! I recommend you don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> its pretty fast and does do the work. i dont like that the speed changer is on the botttom instead of the side. i have to stop what i am doing and change the speed. as to instead just moving my finger to the side to move the speed.</li>
    <li> Function is ok for the price.</li>
    <li> I have ordered two of these . . . one to replace the electrical cord.  The electrical cord will short out after using for a short time.  Price is good and I love the product  . . . but if want work it&#x27;s not worth the price to use only for a short time.  Spend more money and get a better product.  I have two and neither one works due to a shortage in the electrical cord.  Comments are based on the product and not the seller.</li>
    <li> This machine is good for beginners like myself. It helps take off my gel polish and smoothed out acrylic. I had to watch a few YouTube videos on how it&#x27;s done because the box doesn&#x27;t include detailed instructions, nor does it include a diagram of the product, and what functions are where. All in all, a nice cheap suitable starter kit for the elementary learner. I received my package on time and contents weren&#x27;t compromised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this drill I have an at home salon and it works but i had to buy another one.  Had it for about 3 months I dint thunk it&#x27;s meant to be used everyday. But its good for someone who does self acrylics.</li>
    <li> IT IS SUCH A GREAT QUALITY PRODUCT AND I REALLY LOVE IT. I HAVE NOT STOP DOING MY NAILS SINCE I GOT IT. THANK U SO VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> It did everything that it was said it would do. I was very much pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Seller did replace my defective item.Re delivered item postage free. Product did work. And I did use it. The bit I used, fit and worked in drill. Once I give myself a fill-in,I will be able to rate the product fairly after full use. ****(My rating of 1 is the item I received from this seller was defective out of the box...The seller did contact me by email and stated they will replace the defective item. I am still waiting for the replacement. Once I receive the replacement, I will update my rating. As of now,my rating of this seller is a negative 0(-0)*******)There is nothing I like or dislike about the item, since it didn&#x27;t work out of the box. It would not be fair to rate this item negatively since I have not had the opportunity to use it. (As of now I RATE THIS SELLER&#x60;S -0.)***Seller did replace damage item and I would recommend the seller and product, at this time.2/12/14 updated</li>
    <li> I just received this item and was shocked about the charger.  It not a regular wall plug. Would not recommend this item</li>
    <li> love the color but when i got it the dial to turn it on was broken and did not get to use it:( so with that said .....i dont know how it works</li>
    <li> fast arrival, good product, great way to save money and do it yourself. Very reasonable price.Would highly recommend this product. Would have added a buffing wheel ,but you can get those else where and they fit the machine.</li>
    <li> The drill kept getting hot. As it took at least 10 minutes to file each nail down. I didn&#x27;t put a thick layer of arcyrlic on because that was my fear. So I had to manually file</li>
    <li> I just got my package in the mail today and it arrived 2 week early (so that&#x27;s a plus). I tried it out and everything works well. I read a lot of complaints about the tools not fitting, wrong charger etc. But before I bought this drill I made sure that I read up on it and learned how to use it first before buying it. I actually ordered a US adapter separately but when I opened the package it already came with a US adapter instead of the EU one shown in the picture. I like it (at this moment) but will re-post if anything fails.</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible. It won&#x27;t even stay on long enough to file one nail. It is very poorly made and must have a short in it.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  When I received the drill it did not work . The instructions were very poor. And I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money</li>
    <li> i use this to do my own arcrylic nails. it works great and the price is perfect. i love it</li>
    <li> U gotta read the instructions it&#x27;s a pretty good drill so far it looks cheap but as we all know it is cheap I like it after I figured how to get the bits to fit it&#x27;s a couple of confusing steps but it does work ppl</li>
    <li> i love it!!! cheap yet very reliable and its very easy to use.but it kept shutting off at first but after using it for a while it stopped shutting off and now works like a charm</li>
    <li> I use to do my own toe nails, but I stopped. I started back up again, and this machine is great! I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to do their own pedicures at home.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at first because I thought the drill bits didn&#x27;t fit, but they really do! It takes a little work though. Make sure the file is unplugged then take the black piece off the top and press the lock button down and unscrew the metal piece a little to loosen the slot to inset the bit and then your all set put it together and enjoy it really is a great product!</li>
    <li> For a small product, this thing works like the large, more expensive tools from the hardware store.  I Love it!</li>
    <li> These little drill are made for a person that is left handed. Once you run it to long it cuts off! Which is about one hand!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s horrible !! I want my money back. It turns on but the drill thing comes off when I&#x27;m doing nails. Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> It never worked properly. When I plugged it up for the first time it shorted out and I had it plugged in surge protector luckily cuz my laptop was plugged in too</li>
    <li> Worked great for the three times i used it!! Then stoped working!! Tip spins but wen you go to file your nail and put that little presher. It stops working!!! Great more money to spend!!! Not!!!</li>
    <li> Took a little longer than expected but I am very happy with the drill. I have another like it and I would order from them again</li>
    <li> Love this.Hope tp get two more for xmas.Give one to my daughter and mother in law.Hope they will love it</li>
    <li> I got this to smooth down the callous on my feet. The attachments come off so it is pointless. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it once before throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this electric nail art drill its great. So great I got one for my good friend and she really like it as well</li>
    <li> sent defaulty drill, the drill pieces would not fit in the end hole complete waist of my money. even if i got different size drill bits itwould not ft the hole was not made properly.</li>
    <li> This machine as soon i took it out of the package the spring fell apart. Its a hassle to put the security on place; since, it keeps poping out. Save your money its not worth it. Even though you are starting out as a nail tech, save your money. The file works</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d get the wrong plug with mine like alot of people say but my plug was correct I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put the bits in but they explained it too me and now my drill is up and working good! Worth the money :)</li>
    <li> i use this for my nails when i do them or someone else nails it works really well for my nails</li>
    <li> helps tremendously with cutting down time and wear on hands! I love my nail drill. I ordered it before reading the reviews and got very nervous after reading them. However I looked up a review on you tube and found the correct way to insert the tips and PERFECTO!</li>
    <li> the piece fall out of the drill they do not stay in tight so it make it hard to file my nails</li>
    <li> No instructions on which head does what function.  Round heads don&#x27;t fit on tools.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  Sorry I spent the money.</li>
    <li> Never coming......the first time am open the case ,and they suposted send to me a second one ,and never coming....</li>
    <li> The extentions is gets loose have to stop just to push it back in place....</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. It breaks and gets stuck way to fast! Bad quality! Don&#x27;t spend your money on this crap!</li>
    <li> if I can do any lowest star I would this product sucks it doesn&#x27;t even work when I first got it wow I still can&#x27;t get a hold of the seller to get my money back.</li>
    <li> This product is difficult to use.  The attachements are hard to put in and after you turn it on, they fly off.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use this thing since I bought it! It has no place to put the bits inside the tip of the nail machine! I don&#x27;t know if they want me to drill a hole in it to fit the bit or if the bits are just too big for the drill. Waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> I would not order it took 2 months to get here and the plug in for outlet is for Europe not the US now I have to find a adapter cant even use it yet after all this waiting</li>
    <li> It does not last at all... after 3 times use. it did not turn back on.</li>
    <li> Cant use this. the parts will not tighten. In the process of a return. May ask for an exchange. Very dissappointed</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t come with drill bits. I had to order them separately. Pretty lame but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheaply made, the on/off button is hard to turn and it&#x27;s hard to secure the interchangeable bits.  The nut to secure the bits wont tighten properly so sometimes the bit doesn&#x27;t turn.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> they said if you have nothing good to say don&#x27;t say anything at all this file was definitely not what I expected it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Very bad product I guess because what is cost... I doesn&#x27;t work and it got very hot...</li>
    <li> Came with no instructions and bits do not fit.  Absolutely useless.</li>
    <li> Misleading,&lt;br /&gt;I was give a 110 V plug instead of 220V. The picture shows a different plug to the one I received</li>
    <li> Before buying the drill i was skeptical because of the negative reviews. But I tried it and it works just fine. I have no trouble using the different tips and it&#x27;s just amazing. 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> this is the same thing as the Cyber Style 6 file. Thought it would be different.Disappointed.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the attachments couldn&#x27;t fit in but there is a way of adjusting it even though it did not come with any directions. I wrote the seller who then explained how to do it, which still was not very clear, but I managed. I thought, ok, I&#x27;m good to go now. Nope, it kept turning off while I was using it...it would be going strong and then just stop for no apparent reason. It is sold cheaply so I suppose you get what you pay for :/&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;My drill completely stopped working about a month ago (March or April 2014). I would recommend that you do not buy this product, even though it is cheap it is still a waste of your money.</li>
    <li> Even though it don&#x27;t come with instruction you can just go on YouTube to learn how to use it and it work fine.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO USE THIS ITEM PUT IT TOGETHER LOOKS GREAT SHOULD WORK JUST FINE. SENT ITEM FAST WILL SHOP WITH AGAIN</li>
    <li> This did not meet my expectations.  It broke my first day using it in class.  Another xlass mate had the same one and it broke as well, I would like to return it and get my money back.</li>
    <li> It gets hot to quick. The drill bits are not very sharp. U have to turn the power on high to get professional looking nails.</li>
    <li> It was okay, it did the job that I needed it to do, I would recommend it. The price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This works well. The included attachments cover all nail needs. I find it easy to use. Amazon Prime snipping and packaging was great.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> Items were as expected and at a great price. I love this drill. I was skeptical because of the price but am very please with my purchase. I am new to nail art and this gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It is good but some parts get loose when u put it on but it works well it was a good price too:)</li>
    <li> This is a awesome drill. It feels just like the nail shops. And can you believe this thing is fast to be so little.</li>
    <li> Machine is good for the price. Just did not come with clear instructions on how to attach the drill bit  but is a good tool to have.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to use it once. I plugged it in. Checked to see if it worked. Seemed to work just fine. A month later, went to use it and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. The motor in it is dying. It seemed really strong when I first got it. Now it seems to barely turn the rotary part. I&#x27;m very disappointed.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!  You&#x27;re better off spending the money on a real dremel and the accessories.</li>
    <li> I still have yet to get to use it. It came with a Euporean plug and I haven&#x27;t been any where to get an adaptor to be able to use it in America which is where I live.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product its amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple nail file at home.</li>
    <li> Product came damaged when tries to have another shipped they were ot of stock.. Really needed it</li>
    <li> My item was missing the drill bits as shown in the picture!!!! plz don&#x27;t buy this item!!</li>
    <li> I love this drill if you read the instructions it is pretty much fool proof to operate.</li>
    <li> This drill is a good item for a first time user, but this product is more of a starter and not for use in long run because its too basic. While drilling your nails, the front end of the driller will move forward and you have to keep pushing it back in place while the drill is on. Can be a safety issue. For its price, you get what you buy.</li>
    <li> I love it. I did wait a long time to get it. However, I didn&#x27;t have to pay S&amp;H fees.</li>
    <li> Horrible horrible horrible. I know you wanna save money on a cheaper drill.. but its NOT worth it because it does not work. Spend a little more on a quality drill. i received it and no matter what i did it wouldnt turn on. I fiddled with it as much as i could and dill what all the other people said to do via the reviews but nothing works at ALL. I sent it back the same day and got a refund. Dont purchase it!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have enough torque to really use for acrylic nails.  I guess that is to be expected for the price.  oh well.</li>
    <li> so far so gud ............... ............. .................... .................... ............ ........ ...... ..... .... ...  ....... ........ ....... .........  ... ..</li>
    <li> Its a great file but it heats up after a while and stops working so i have to wait till it coold down :(</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd machine. I am very pleased with this. It works well for my nails. I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product is just as it was advertised. And, works very good.</li>
    <li> The product is good. Takes long to arrive. The problem is the quality of the charger. It broke soon.</li>
    <li> This product took over 6 week to arrive and whenit did arrive it did not work. The device is cheaply made and the power does not turn on with the on/of switch.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very useful for beginners like me. I recommend to go to YouTube to learn how to use it. And for those people that says the drill bits don&#x27;t fit, that&#x27;s not true. They do fit it&#x27;s just that they don&#x27;t know how to use it. I recommend it to buy it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work when I got it delivered it sucks</li>
    <li> I now know why this product is no longer on the market.  It does not have enough power to work on toe nails.</li>
    <li> I took in the consideration of the reviews that were displayed on here but said what the heck, they can&#x27;t all be true so I went ahead and purchased it anyways thinking my experience would be different but it turned out to be the same the tools not fitting into the drill properly so what I ended up doing was taking my power drill and drilled a hole big enough to fit into the nail art drill then the tools fit perfectly fine. If your buying this to use as a hobby that&#x27;s fine but for a business I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars,  I would!  I just received this in the mail and it doesn&#x27;t even turn on! DO NOT WA SHE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Horrible product!!! It has a shortage in</li>
    <li> Its cute and small but it over heats and quits working too fast. I barley get to the 3rd nail and it quits on me.</li>
    <li> LOVE MY DRILL!!! I have gotten a chance to use on acrylic nails yet, but I have used to it for natural pedi and mani&#x27;s. I love it! It took me a few minutes to learn how to use it, but once it did I fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> Okay you guys that say it does not work and the bits don&#x27;t fit. They really do all you have to do is (make sure its completely unplugged) press the lock button which is close to the drilling area and unscrew the little black piece then the silver one and insert which ever bit you want, to loosen it. Then take it out and screw it all back together and then put the bit that you want to use, plug it in and you&#x27;re ready to work! I just figured that out and I&#x27;m supper excited to begin my new at home career. Lol</li>
    <li> It Stopped working less then a month of having it....TRASH</li>
    <li> Great product for the money! The bit doesn&#x27;t fit properly even after following step by step instructions multiple times, but it still works fine though.</li>
    <li> i got it very quickly, it is very powerful though and it hurts. it is way too fast, you cannot control the speed</li>
    <li> I wish I would pay attention and read the reviews before I bought that piece of crap. The botton on it broke down right away when I turned it on for the first time. And yes, the drills are too big for this machine, as many people complain. Lost $10 and time, got only dissapointment. I dont understand why Amazon is not doind anything about sellers like that???</li>
    <li> More than what I expect. Great quality.</li>
    <li> I was so let down by a lot of the positive reveiws when choosing this drill set. I took it out to use it and it turned off right away didn&#x27;t even file one nail. Then once it turned back on the lowest setting pulsed so that&#x27;s not going to work, to make matters worse the bit flew off. I would not reccomend this set at all.</li>
    <li> I love my drill! Everyone keeps saying the bits don&#x27;t fit... unscrew the silver piece on top of the drill while pushing the silver button (it should click), insert the bit ( don&#x27;t let go of the silver button) screw the top piece until you hear a click and you are all ready to go :) And it came a week early! :-)</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose but the part that holds the bits seem to come off when you change them. It needs to be made more secure.</li>
    <li> Like so many people are saying - DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME. The positive reviews were obviously written by the seller - look how similar they are. They weren&#x27;t event smart enough to change the wording. I wish I had read it before.</li>
    <li> It was great the first time I purchased this product over a year ago but I lost it due to Hurricane Sandy therefore I purchased it again and after a couple of weeks it broke. The metal key came out and would not go back in. It just malfunctioned. I returned it although I just wanted it to be replaced but they don&#x27;t replace the item they will only provide you with a refund. I still have not gotten my refund. But it is actually a great tool and I will purchase it again by the end of this month. One thing I remember is that the motor at times gets hot. It&#x27;a a useful tool for someone that does their own nails at home.</li>
    <li> i am a dog groomer and i love the color pink so i thought i would try this grinder for the dogs nails. when i got it, i plugged it in and tested it. turned it on its highest setting and just pressed it up to an object softly and it stopped spinning immediately. then when i took it off the object it started to skip and make noise like it was still trying to spin while still turned on high. had to turn it all the way off and back on again to reset it. only thing good about this grinder is the color. do not buy this item if you want to use it for anything but a display on your table. shouldve listened to my husband and bought the real dremel, which i use everyday and love it. i just wanted a pink one to match my scossors. BOOOOOOO!!!!</li>
    <li> So... i&#x27;m already to do my nails. I&#x27;m thinking my drill arrived just in time. I&#x27;ve already broke 3 nails ( acrylic was too thin) Anyways, I put in my drill bit and plug it up.. guess what? The crappy ass adapter doesn&#x27;t work. Sad part is it looks like the adapter from one of my old old Nokia cell phones  from back in the day that I no longer have. With all the complaints on Amazon about the adapter you would think before it was shipped the adapter would of gotten tested But, thats too much like right.  If I can get an adapter and this thing works then I will update my review but for now 1 star.</li>
    <li> The attachments did not fit and it is made of cheap plastic. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I only used it once and it never worked again...</li>
    <li> Had to watch a video to put the things in it but when I plug it in to the wall it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Heats up pretty quickly and the speed stops regulating itself after about 7 minutes and needs a break. Not a big deal, just a bit annoying. I am pleased with it for the price I got it for. I use it to do my own acrylic nails. It does come with a bunch of different tips, which is great. the only way it would be better is if it didn&#x27;t heat up and start being weird.</li>
    <li> I love this little machine, it is so handy and does a great job on your nails. The bits are perfect for the jobs you need to do. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice piece very powerful and impressed for its price a must have for the home nail groomer. Not for professionals.</li>
    <li> I want to start this review with the statement &amp;#34; you get what you pay for.&amp;#34; That being said, I love this product. I could not be happier. I&#x27;m glad i close not read the other review prior to placing my order because they are misleading given the price of the tool you are purchasing, as well as keeping in kind, if you are a person who has ANY clue what you are doing with tools, you are going to be fine with this product. What I read with other reviews about the bits not fitting I also experienced, but I&#x27;m going to take a moment to add some insight since the product does not come with any sort of user manual to explain what to do with this tool to make the bits fit the way they are built to, but before that, I love this product. I am in no way, shape or form a professional. I was looking for something to do my own acrylics at home to save some money and this was honestly a god send. The bits work great for what I need and my nails look great. Now! User guide for you bad review newb morons scaring everyone! Upon opening product you will see the tip of the gun is silver, below that a little is a silver button. Press that in and give the tip a twist until it comes off. You&#x27;re now left with a skinny silver tip that should remove easily, if not make it remove... This is what your bits don&#x27;t fit into, we&#x27;ll fix that. Take that out, and grab any bit you want. I chose the long pointy one (for under nail cleaning or detailing, this is unimportant, do what you want) shove it through the bottom so you open the tip up to fit the bit circumference. Return the skinny silver tip the way you found it and screw the other silver tip back on snugly (remember you need to press the silver button again to screw the tip back on.) Now, that should fix your bit fit problem. Also, I saw that someone couldn&#x27;t get the bits to go on from there... You need to do the button press, and slight tip unscrew with each bit switch. For example if you&#x27;re using the sander bit... press the button, give the tip maybe 3 or 4 good twists, keep the button pressed, insert the bit, twist tip back into place and release the button. Repeat for each desired bit. It&#x27;s a bit cumbersome, but, it can be done. As far as any other issues, I noticed slight overheating, but that&#x27;s with any non-commercial product on the market... Can&#x27;t really fault anyone for that, again especially for less than $20.00.</li>
    <li> Loved it, works very good and came safely with everything listed. Even came in ahead of time which was very convenient for me since it was a present for a friend of mine.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely fashion. Im so glad it. .I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it. And it works really well. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS DIDNT WORK! EXPECTED MORE AND GOT NOTHING. DO NOT BUY THIS BECAUSE U WOULD BE SORELY DISAPPOINTED! NOW I&#x27;M AFRAID TO EVEN BUY ANOTHER ONE.</li>
    <li> this is a perfect drill it dont burn your nails like the ones in a shop because u can control the settings perfect size too</li>
    <li> Works great when it&#x27;s actually running. After about 30 seconds the motor sounds like it&#x27;s dying and stops. Then randomly goes full speed. Still trying to figure it out.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it really but it has a nice speed to it but the bits wont stay in the drill as they should they are to easy to pull out once its locked...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t power on. $9 to the trash. People do not buy this product don&#x27;t throw your $ away. What an awfull experience.</li>
    <li> It helps to reduce nail thickness so they can be cut easily. I used it to also shape my nails and remove polish. What a time saver this is.</li>
    <li> Waited forever for this to arrive in the mail as soon as I got it figured out how to put the drill bits in and turned it on literally worked for 2 seconds then stopped waited a day tried again and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on so disappointed but glad I didn&#x27;t waste to much money on it with that said spend the extra $ and get a better one. I should have read the reviews first</li>
    <li> The product was amazing! It worked perfectly fine when I first received it. Unfortunately it stopped working about two weeks after I got it and I have no idea why :/</li>
    <li> Despite the review I went ahead and ordered anyways because it was a good deal and I didn&#x27;t want to go to the salon anymore to take care of my gel nails. This drill is absolutely amazing! The bit will fall out if I hold it upside down on full speed for a prolonged period but let&#x27;s be real... I never hold it like that. Having the drill had been a great help!</li>
    <li> I love this file! Works perfectly! The only downfall is if your using it for long periods of time it tends to get pretty hot.</li>
    <li> when I first opened the package, I thought it was just a regular rotery tool and started reading and it was exactly what I wanted. Can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> i started a nail business and i tried to turn it on and it broke whats the point of buying another cheap a** drill</li>
    <li> I got this for my Mother and the first time she used it the thing wouldn&#x27;t file anything and then it just stopped working. It won&#x27;t do anything now and apparently I cannot return it either. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this one.</li>
    <li> This  product was okay I used it for my nails better than filling my own nails with the filler thanks for sharing this product</li>
    <li> Drill spins backwards. No good to me. Wasted $. Maybe for lefty. Don&#x27;t like it. Pretty pink, but spins left. How do I do return?</li>
    <li> I give them no stars because the pieces don&#x27;t fit into the drill like someone said before it&#x27;s a waste of time .please people don&#x27;t buy this you will regret it. Buy something else worthwhile............. I had to give one star because I could not post unless I did so please disregard.......</li>
    <li> It arrived on time but it doesn&#x27;t seam to want to tighten up around the bits and they aren&#x27;t to good either . Other than that I like its light weight and small size</li>
    <li> salon quality on a consumer budget. great! save your nails; it was feet for me lightning  service. need it, buy it here!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. I wish it had directions on how to change the files, but after I figured it out it was great. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> The drill its self is weak,and wont hold the drill bits in place as you&#x27;re trying to work. Super disappointed.</li>
    <li> Do not even bother I wasted my money waited almost 3 weeks for it to arrive &amp; the pieces don&#x27;t fit &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work. I was so pissed. I guess I got what I paid for some deal!</li>
    <li> this will certainly get you thru those between nailshop appointments. it works well and is small enough to store away in your purse</li>
    <li> I chose these rating because it was getting started&lt;br /&gt;My likes were that it was pink&lt;br /&gt;My dislikes were that I couldn&#x27;t get it started&lt;br /&gt;I kind of would recommend this product because first of all it hard to understand the instructions</li>
    <li> It did not work at all.  I ended up just throwing it away.  It is really too bad too.  What a waste.</li>
    <li> This product will save you time and money because it cuts filing time in half. It is easy to operate and simple to use. Great for newbie people like myself who no longer want to waste money going to the nail salon and decided to DIY.</li>
    <li> This is crap only work for 2 weeks the speed variation stopped working the next day it wouldn&#x27;t come on at all</li>
    <li> do not use it often because it lacks a bit more power</li>
    <li> Did not work the first time i opened it and plugged it in and was unable to return. Looks cheap. dont waste your time</li>
    <li> NO ITEM, NO REFUND  .NAVIMAN IS A MESSY COMPANY AS FAR AS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION.... product NEVER WORKED! !DO NOT RECCOMEND</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK, THE ATTACHMENTS DO NOT FIT THE DRILL, AND EITHER THE CORD OR DRILL OR BOTH, THE CORD AND DRILL ARE DEFECTIVE. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY ANNOYING AND RIDICULOUS SITUATION AND IT IS A WASTE OF TIME.  THANK GOD I DIDN&#x27;T PAY FOR SEPARATE SHIPPING AS I RECEIVED FREE SHIPPING DUE TO THE ORDER I SUBMITTING OR I WOULD REALLY BE UPSET.  I HATE TO PURCHASE ANYTHING DEFECTIVE BUT AT LEAST THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.  BUT TO SELL A PRODUCT THAT HAS ATTACHMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE ACTUAL PRODUCT BUT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE PRODUCT TO WORK IS ASININE AT THE BARE MINIMUM. THE WORST PART HOWEVER, IS THE LIE STATING IT IS PROFESSIONAL, THE QUALITY IS CHEAP AND THE MATERIAL LOOKS LIKE A TOY FOR BARBIE DOLL TYPE OF PRODUCT.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AS YOU WILL SURELY HAVE TO RETURN THIS.</li>
    <li> Too dangerous for nails, used twice, brought blood both times.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it very well the motor kept getting stuck 1st time use so I used my old drill with the new power pack.</li>
    <li> My drill broke after the 3 time I used it and I can&#x27;t turn it down it just goes super fast waste of money</li>
    <li> first of all, the drill bits do fit. you just have to look up some youtube videos on it, since the packaging doesn&#x27;t come with instructions.  you can change the speed with a little spin adjuster, and the highest speed is actually pretty fast and powerful, considering its size (around 7 inches). it shipped fairly quickly (the first day it was estimated to deliver, it came). it&#x27;s not the best obviously, being around $10, but if you&#x27;re just using it at home for yourself, it gets the job done without wasting money on expensive professional drills that have extra features you don&#x27;t need :)</li>
    <li> Broke upon first use.. this is a piece of garbage plastic. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail art drill. It has adjustable speeds so I am in complete control of the intensity. I used it the first time with wonderful results. Thank you. Fast delivery, product as pictured.</li>
    <li> if u want to have a high torque, do not buy this. and this is not fast enough. I do not think it has 20000rpm as max speed</li>
    <li> The nail file came on time. But the bits are hard to change . And is a little on the bulky side .</li>
    <li> I orded this product. First off the company LIMITLESS ENERGY did not even have to brains to include the bits to my drill. I have not been able to find any bits in my area what so ever. I can&#x27;t even contact the company directly and here i am weeks later with a useless nail drill collecting dust. Needless to say this purchase was a waste of time, effort and money</li>
    <li> This little file machine is awesome and for the price even more so. I recommend to anyone looking to get their nails file quickly at home.</li>
    <li> Well I will be sending this back. Doesn&#x27;t even work when plugged in... and the on/off switch is terrible. Cheap cheap material. If I could give it 0 stars or minus I would.</li>
    <li> Gave it one star review cause can&#x27;t use it to try it out.  The plug is made for European use.&lt;br /&gt;How discourageing to receive a gift and not be able to plug it in. One would think it would come with&lt;br /&gt;a USA adapter.  It doesn&#x27;t notify you of this option at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li> Thanks for creating such a product. This machine is strong enough to do the job and small and light enough to take anywhere. I love it. I took it out of the envelope and dropped it but nothing was broken and the bits work just fine.</li>
    <li> i really like this product i have acrylic nails works perfect on them , i don&#x27;t have to go to the nail salon every week.&lt;br /&gt;i save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s several attachments I don&#x27;t really use them, i only use one of them and it work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;the only bad side is the round metal piece in front falls off every time you wanna change the pieces.</li>
    <li> i read the reviews for the product a little too late and i think some people just didnt read the instructions (either they didnt arrive with the product or they thought they didnt need them, idk) cause i mean, i liked it. it works. it kinda seems a bit fragile but i dont know if im just scared that what other reviewers said happened to them would happen to me but so far so good. the price was good for what i got.</li>
    <li> ive always  wanted a file like this so that i could do my own pedicure..this is nice thank you much</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price! The drill is a masterpiece! I ordered the drill covers separately for future use! I love it! My mom love to use it!</li>
    <li> It super sucks. Soon to find out in the directions that theres a piece not included. It doesn&#x27;t say that in the discritpion. It&#x27;s not powerful enough to sand down calluses. It&#x27;s cheap. No wonder its worth $10. I have no idea why Amazon is lying about it being worth over $100 or whoever is selling this product that&#x27;s its over $100 value. And then all of a sudden sell it for $10. Lol</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is so great the variable speed makes it amazing and mutch easier to use thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this tool for my friends thuck toenails. He loved it and said it was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend ths products to everyone!</li>
    <li> Yes ! 5 Stars !!&lt;br /&gt;This drill is amazing ! Adjustable speed dial great power ! So happy I took a chance on this little gem with bad reviews . MOST PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS A BAD REVIEW SAY THE BITS DONT FIT. . AT FIRST IT SEEMS THAT WAY . But I promis they do you just have to unscrew the top of the drill and put the bit you want in . Simply untwist black trim at the top then hold down the silver button while unscrewing the base of the drill bit.</li>
    <li> Great product it really works well happy customer from Texas&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money it really does a great job&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> first I couldn&#x27;t get the drill on. Then when I got it on and started using it, it stopped working literally in one minute...</li>
    <li> low quality and work only on 110 not 220, and not recharging good even on 110 Volt. i really hate it</li>
    <li> Hate it use it once clients complain it&#x27;s vibrating too hard</li>
    <li> Great product, its small &amp; lite weight. Easy to handle so it makes filing much easier. I recommend it if your looking for good quality &amp; low price.</li>
    <li> Ok so,I got this and it does not work. The tops do not fit into the Machine. save your money and do not buy it does not work and I really wish it would because it looked like a good material but it really is not</li>
</ol>
