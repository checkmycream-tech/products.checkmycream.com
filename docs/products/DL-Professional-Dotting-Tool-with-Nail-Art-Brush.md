      <li>I am beyond thrilled with this item,I&#x27;m am so happy to have gotten one of these,I&#x27;ve been wanting one so bad!,I haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
      <li>However the brush is good and I will continue to use both sides.</li>
      <li>The dotting tool works good.</li>
      <li>I do nails for a living so a good brush is a must have.</li>

      <li>The brush is great and very functional.</li>
      <li>It worked better when I trimmed the brushes</li>
      <li>The one tip is great for making dots and the brush side is good for doing french tips.  </li>
      <li>More bristles as well as thicker ones are needed to accomplish this</li>
      <li>It is perfect and since it serves multiple purposes it saves space!  </li>
      <li>I make my smiley french with the brush side, make nice dainty design with the dotting side.  </li>
      <li>so I would have been better off buying at the store.</li>
      <li>Love my dotting tool, and the brush is an added</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love this tool.</li>
      <li>Its perfect for French tips</li>
      <li>Love the tool.</li>
      <li>I use this to clean up the polish left around my nails and it is absolutely perfect!</li>
      <li>I use this to do french tip on myself by dipping it in alcohol and swiping the line clean and it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was on sale and &amp;#34;qualified for free shipping along with another order.&amp;#34;  Ended up paying more for shipping than the item.  </li>
      <li>Also it seems there should have been more bristles in them if that makes sense, like if you dip it in polish remover to clean up edges or something like that, the bristles separate out</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure that it would work great for nail design by hand as well, such as swirls or maybe polka dots?</li>
      <li>The tool is balanced well and easy to use.</li>
      <li>and the brush works fine</li>
      <li>so in love with this brush it fits my small hands perfectly 5 stars no doubt.  </li>
      <li>Works great for the French manicure.</li>
      <li>I recommend this brush for easy clean up messes.</li>
      <li>what can I say, It works good and is handy with the brush on the other end.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item for the brush side, to clean up around the cuticle.</li>
      <li>Excellent clean up around my cuticles and the brush doesn&#x27;t get hard after using acetone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got lots of dotters, but I didn&#x27;t have a good french tip/clean up brush.</li>
      <li>Now i can do it by myself and never pay for a salon again :) thanks</li>
      <li>Nicely balanced with nice tight bristles in the brush.</li>
      <li>I got it really quick</li>
      <li>My favorite dotting tool by far!!</li>
      <li>I bought another French tip brush that was cheaper and was better quality than this!</li>
      <li>worth the money.</li>
      <li>This tool makes my manicures a lot more professional looking</li>
      <li>And then it wasn&#x27;t worth it anyways.  </li>
      <li>This works okay for clean up but not well for  french tips.</li>
      <li>Even though the brush is just right for doing your nails,  some of the bristles in the brush kept coming out.  </li>
      <li>charged either right</li>
      <li>The brush is just the right combo of strength and softness.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s clean and ready to go in seconds.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something cheap that will get the job done this is fine but its not built for daily use.</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth the buy and great for any nail art fanatic.</li>
      <li>ITEM WAS SHIPPED ON TIME AND WAS EXACTLY WHAT</li>
      <li>Does exactly what i got it for.</li>
      <li>(haha oops!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite nail art brushes to use for French tips and designs with decals.</li>
      <li>I love this brush for clean up especially when doing the french mani clean up.</li>
      <li>Bristles are to soft to be used as a clean up brush.</li>
      <li>Worked great the 1st time I used it on my daughters nails to do a French manicure, but then right after went to do my other daughters nails and the brush kept shedding and would not make a decent line.</li>
      <li>But like I said earlier some of the brushes are great and exactly what you need, some are just garbage and not worth a dang.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the item because the size of the brush was too small but good seller because of the fast return ;)</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who makes a mess when painting there own nails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once, but it worked fine.</li>
      <li>The dots that were made with nail polish would not be uniform and often deformed, no matter how much polish was used.  </li>
      <li>... works really well.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Shipping was really fast</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t want to spend much and don&#x27;t care.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go again.</li>
      <li>Also, the shipping was extremely fast and I received it days before the estimated time.</li>
      <li>The dotting tool is kind of small bit worked pretty well for nail art anyway.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because it was on sale and &amp;#34;qualified for free shipping along with another order.&amp;#34;  Ended up paying more for shipping than the item.  And then it wasn&#x27;t worth it anyways.  Basically just a pen tip with a makeup brush on the other end.  Did not work at all for making dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the shipping.</li>
    <li> So happy I purchased. This does a great job cleaning up and the color is cute.</li>
    <li> So I finally had to chance to use it after owning it for a few weeks. The end of the brush had a few little strays that made my French Mani line weirs but a quicktrim of the loosies to even out the brush and I was very happy with the quality of the brush. Very good and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My favorite dotting tool by far!!</li>
    <li> Great for \\&quot;cleaning up\\&quot; around the cuticle after you paint! Haven&#x27;t used the the side opposite of the brush yet but I&#x27;m sure that it would work great for nail design by hand as well, such as swirls or maybe polka dots?</li>
    <li> Brush is to flimsy to use</li>
    <li> The brush is terrible. Very poorly made. After a couple weeks the bristles were falling off.&lt;br /&gt;Also thought the brush would be firm but it&#x27;s really soft. Could&#x27;ve just purchased a make up brush if I knew the brush was that soft.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Worked great the 1st time I used it on my daughters nails to do a French manicure, but then right after went to do my other daughters nails and the brush kept shedding and would not make a decent line. No happy with it at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like it because the dotting part is so small and the color is not how I pictured it to be. and the brush works fine I guess. I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
    <li> ITEM WAS SHIPPED ON TIME AND WAS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED THIS IS A NEAT LITTLE BRUSH THAT HAS MORE THAT ONE USE</li>
    <li> The brush wasn&#x27;t as thick as I expected, so it does not work well to help wipe extra nail polish off my nails when I want to do a french pedicure. Now I have to look for another brush.</li>
    <li> didnt work for doing my french manicure. tried to trip but didnt work</li>
    <li> This tool makes my manicures a lot more professional looking so It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> The brush is great and very functional. I had to cut a little off the tips to remove uneven hairs but after that it worked like a charm. I love that with the other  tip I can use to make flower decorations on my nails!</li>
    <li> It worked great until I clean it....I only use the dotter at the other end the brush itself no good any more. Went to my local nail supply store and bought another one.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m so in love with this brush it fits my small hands perfectly 5 stars no doubt.  I make my smiley french with the brush side, make nice dainty design with the dotting side.  Also use the dotting side for cleaning my side of the edges.  It&#x27;s holding up so nicely so far.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for clean up especially when doing the french mani clean up. The bristles are just stiff enough but still have good flexibility. I have not had a chanced to try the dotting tool yet but look forward to using it.  This is definitely worth the buy and great for any nail art fanatic.</li>
    <li> These are not what I thought I was going to get...the brush isn&#x27;t even full and look fragile in the package</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush are rather thin. It worked better when I trimmed the brushes but it was still rather difficult to trim my brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this dual purpose nail tool! It is perfect and since it serves multiple purposes it saves space!  The brush is just the right combo of strength and softness. I will get a lot of use out of this and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Came in the time it was suppose to. Does exactly what i got it for. I recommend this brush for easy clean up messes.</li>
    <li> Love my dotting tool, and the brush is an added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;Great 2-in-1&lt;br /&gt;Started using it the same night</li>
    <li> I used this brush once (with acetone for doing a french manicure), then went to clean it with water and ALL of the hair fell out. Obviously, no sense in attempting to put it back together so I threw it out. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Excellent clean up around my cuticles and the brush doesn&#x27;t get hard after using acetone. I already have dotting tools so the &amp;#34;dotter&amp;#34; on the other end is just an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I love this tool. Its perfect for French tips and I also use this to clean any mess ups</li>
    <li> I like the but I have to get used to using  them But I like them I two of them</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast I got it really quick, the brush quality is not that good but the dotting tool is great</li>
    <li> My wife loves this...</li>
    <li> This product is good but it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be it was a cheaper version of the one I wanted so I would have been better off buying at the store.</li>
    <li> what can I say, It works good and is handy with the brush on the other end.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. My daughter is happy with the product. Salon quality instrument. The tool is balanced well and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and shape for getting your nails just right.</li>
    <li> I bought this dotting tool to, well, dot little designs on my nails. I got lazy and decided to never do that (haha oops! Waste of money, you think?) But! I now use the dotting end of the brush to get nail polish out from the spots where the nail polish goes a little overboard. It works great! I just wipe it off with a little napkin or something and it&#x27;s clean and ready to go in seconds. I knew I didn&#x27;t completely waste my money! I also use the other side with the brush to remove larger areas of nail polish that get onto my skin. It&#x27;s great at picking up all the color, and like with the dotting side, I lightly brush it over a paper towel and it&#x27;s ready to go again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the item because the size of the brush was too small but good seller because of the fast return ;)</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for the brush side, to clean up around the cuticle. However, when I received it, the brush was not flat, it is very fluffy, almost like an eyeshadow brush, which is the opposite of what I wanted. I&#x27;m rather disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush!  I love it... works really well. I would order form them again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Bristles are to soft to be used as a clean up brush. If using for a nail art brush maybe, but would not reccomend.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love the tool.</li>
    <li> The brush is not sturdy enough to remove nail polish. More bristles as well as thicker ones are needed to accomplish this</li>
    <li> The brush end is not even.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me like I wanted it to. The dots that were made with nail polish would not be uniform and often deformed, no matter how much polish was used.  Overall I did not like it.  Maybe I did not know what I was doing, but I did try multiple times.</li>
    <li> I like the purple marble look on the brush handle. Very cute. The brush is softer than I had hoped for. I find that the harder thicker ones work better for making a french line but this brush is good for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got lots of dotters, but I didn&#x27;t have a good french tip/clean up brush. This works okay for clean up but not well for  french tips. The bristles are too soft and it leaves a fuzzy line instead of the crisp line that I desire.</li>
    <li> Exactly how it looks &amp; works great.</li>
    <li> The bristles could be stronger</li>
    <li> I have looked for something like this for years! This works perfectly for doing my own french tips (brush side) as well as creating nail art (dotting tool side)! I LOVE IT so much that I even ordered 2 more!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of the brush was terrible which made clean up on the nail very difficult.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean up the polish left around my nails and it is absolutely perfect! I love the little tool at the end as well.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes. I also love the combo for cleaning up! Sometimes I even use the doting tool. However, the brush is too soft and when I dip it in acetone the bristles spread and makes cleanup a little hard. I would recommend a brush with stiffer bristles and a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> the hair keep come lose and I try to glue it back and now it not even use because it is getting so thin  what a waist of money I should of bought here it work better I din&#x27;t have to pay S/H charged either right so there I said it.</li>
    <li> I love this tool. I always wanted a french nail manicure like in a salon this tool does the trick. Very easy to use and bring good and quality result. Now i can do it by myself and never pay for a salon again :) thanks</li>
    <li> I use this to do french tip on myself by dipping it in alcohol and swiping the line clean and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush for the price. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 months and it just fell apart. The first few times I used it it began to shed which I thought was normal. About two weeks all the bristles fell out of the ferrell. If you&#x27;re looking for something cheap that will get the job done this is fine but its not built for daily use.</li>
    <li> The dotting feature is nice but don&#x27;t expect the brush to be the thick one like salons have. The bristles are thin and flimsy and work poorly to take any polish off for clean edges</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I like to work on my nails and I would recommend this product if you do as well.</li>
    <li> So typically this is the brush I use for everything. I do nails for a living so a good brush is a must have. I ordered 3 of these. One was perfect, but I broke it. My fault. The other two are so so. The brush tip isn&#x27;t completely smooth so making a French tip w them is near impossible. Also it seems there should have been more bristles in them if that makes sense, like if you dip it in polish remover to clean up edges or something like that, the bristles separate out so its hard to work with. But like I said earlier some of the brushes are great and exactly what you need, some are just garbage and not worth a dang. I&#x27;ll try out a different brush before I order any or these again.</li>
    <li> The brush is a little cheap. I got it to do French manicures and the bristles seems to be fraying already.</li>
    <li> This brush feels cheap and small. I bought another French tip brush that was cheaper and was better quality than this! I don&#x27;t recommend this!</li>
    <li> I really wanted the brush to do a french on my nails, but the brush is made of straw like material. It does not stick together when i put it in actetone or alchol. I barly use it.</li>
    <li> The brush sheds like crazy, not usable. The dotting tool works good. This brush is alot smaller than I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> the brush is softer than I would have liked it.  I bought it specifically giving myself french manicures.  The brush is not stiff enough to remove the nail polish like I would like.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite nail art brushes to use for French tips and designs with decals. it&#x27;s an all in one brush</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price.  Works great for the French manicure.</li>
    <li> It looks like the picture, but it&#x27;s  a short handle.  Lengthwise, it&#x27;s not very long.  Even though the brush is just right for doing your nails,  some of the bristles in the brush kept coming out.  To me its not really worth what I paid.  It&#x27;s better to spend the money and get a real good brush that will last.  Especially, if you are the type of person who does your nails often.  Otherwise, its a fairly decent brush it you don&#x27;t want to spend much and don&#x27;t care.  It  was shipped to me well ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> metal part of the brush fell off BEFORE I even tried it to use it! terrible quality.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. I cut off a tiny bit at the end to make it denser.</li>
    <li> Nicely balanced with nice tight bristles in the brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect size tool for doing nail art.  The one tip is great for making dots and the brush side is good for doing french tips.  It has a nice arch and the bristles are fairly stiff so they keep the shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but it worked fine.</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mainly for the dotting tool. It was smaller than I had expected it to be and that&#x27;s why it lost a star. However the brush is good and I will continue to use both sides. Also, the shipping was extremely fast and I received it days before the estimated time.</li>
    <li> Crappy brush to do french manicure. Not happt.</li>
    <li> awesome products, thanks</li>
    <li> I got this thinking I would use it for cleanup of polish mistakes but it&#x27;s too fluffy for that. I do use it to apply my nail oil. The dotting tool is kind of small bit worked pretty well for nail art anyway.</li>
    <li> It is a present for my daughter and she is really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am beyond thrilled with this item,I&#x27;m am so happy to have gotten one of these,I&#x27;ve been wanting one so bad!,I haven&#x27;t used it yet but,I will be for Halloween. I would recommend this to anyone who makes a mess when painting there own nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it every time I do my nails.  It is a professional grade product.  I would order another if I needed it.  Thank you!</li>
