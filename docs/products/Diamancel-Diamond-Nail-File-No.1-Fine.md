### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very Good product!</li>
      <li>This nail file is wonderful!</li>
      <li>The results are the best and fastest I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>It is a superior product!</li>
      <li>Files my nails beautifully.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get all the great reviews</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
      <li>Both are good.  </li>
      <li>It is still good - bought these to give to my daughters.  </li>
      <li>- you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, worth every cent.</li>
      <li>Love these files!</li>
      <li>The diamond grit does not go all the way to the edges.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is a nice file.</li>
      <li>Packaging and looks are quite nice.</li>
      <li>I also got the #2 file which I use more often, but either works great and results in a bit more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look and feel to my nails.  </li>
      <li>I have the #2 which is probably for &#x27;normal&#x27; nails, but I find that the #1 works best for my nails at this point.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite nail file, and I like it even better than my OPI glass one!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the nail file because I have dry fairly flexible nails.  </li>
      <li>My favorite nail files</li>
      <li>Glad I jumped off my wallet and bought a quality file.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and do a super job finishing edges nicely.</li>
      <li>I ordered the No. 1, Fine, and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>The packaging lists Bliss Diamancel Diamond Nail File No1, Fine -- which seems like it should be the right file.</li>
      <li>I love it so much, I ordered another one for my daughter.</li>
      <li>No rips, no shreds, no hangnails, no blood, just nice even natural nails.  </li>
      <li>Filing is very smooth and quick, so no filing back and forth to get a smooth surface which saves my nails from heating up and losing more precious natural oils.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large and has some bend to it and easily files any size nails.</li>
      <li>Its worth the additional cost in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I get a clean, fast file with this.</li>
      <li>It seems like a lot to pay for a file but this file is well worth the money; cleans up chips and splits easily and professionally.</li>
      <li>I lost the first one I had bought and choose to repurchase on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have fragile fingernails and files that are most often used tare my nails.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy and usually use a clipper, but this is a great product to use while watching TV or anything to keep my hands busy.  </li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re not as strong as they once were, and every single other kind of file rips them to shreds.  </li>
      <li>Its durable, and fine enough not to do additional damage to my already brittle nails.</li>
      <li>Great file and is thin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to my mom and a good friend at least 3 years ago.</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  </li>
      <li>This file is fine enough to smooth the edges so that the nail doesn&#x27;t have any rough edges.  </li>
      <li>Bought same brand but different grade and size at Sephora and love it.</li>
      <li>I recommend this file highly.  </li>
      <li>Am growing out nails after wearing acrylic for nearly twenty-five years, and these files are gentle on my nails.</li>
      <li>so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but even the fine grit feels more like a rasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it looks new again.</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>Instead of being the same width the entire length, it has a narrow section to make more of a paddle.</li>
      <li>I buff after using it, which I anticipated having to do, but this file works much quicker and results in a considerably smoother surface than any other file meant for the same purpose.</li>
      <li>To clean, you just take a soft nail brush or something similar and go over the file to get the residue off of it - let it dry for a few minutes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only textured on one side but this file is clearly built to last.</li>
      <li>I had considered getting the coarser file because I have hard nails, but I absolutely do not need a more coarse file than the number 1.</li>
      <li>I love how its thin enough to get under my nails to shape and its a plus that all you have to do is rinse and repeat.. this file will last forever!</li>
      <li>The finish is just fantastic, it&#x27;s smoothes the nail so much you can brush your hand along very delicate clothes and not feel those little &amp;quot;pulls&amp;quot; that show that your nail is not quiet done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased the No. 1 and No. 2 file.  Both are good.  Am growing out nails after wearing acrylic for nearly twenty-five years, and these files are gentle on my nails.</li>
    <li> I bought one about 7 years ago.  It is still good - bought these to give to my daughters.  Very Good product!</li>
    <li> This file is unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before. I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to my mom and a good friend at least 3 years ago. They still rave about it! The finish is just fantastic, it&#x27;s smoothes the nail so much you can brush your hand along very delicate clothes and not feel those little &amp;quot;pulls&amp;quot; that show that your nail is not quiet done. I&#x27;ve also had had one for at least 5 years and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
    <li> My favorite nail files</li>
    <li> Overpriced, flimsy. Sorry I got it. Bought same brand but different grade and size at Sephora and love it.</li>
    <li> The only file I&#x27;ve found in all my years that doesn&#x27;t damage my nails.  Wow.  Too bad it took me so long to decide to invest in this nail file, my nails truly &#x27;like&#x27; it, they&#x27;re not as strong as they once were, and every single other kind of file rips them to shreds.  I finally decided to pay the $20 or so and buy this, and it&#x27;s made all the difference in the world in how my nails look.  No rips, no shreds, no hangnails, no blood, just nice even natural nails.  To clean, you just take a soft nail brush or something similar and go over the file to get the residue off of it - let it dry for a few minutes - you&#x27;re good to go.  I recommend this file highly.  I have the #2 which is probably for &#x27;normal&#x27; nails, but I find that the #1 works best for my nails at this point.  Excellent product, worth every cent.</li>
    <li> This is not a metal file.  This is sand paper glued to a plastic backing.  The sand paper does not reach the edge of the plastic backing.  For the price, I was expecting a quality product.  This is incredibly disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and usually use a clipper, but this is a great product to use while watching TV or anything to keep my hands busy.  I also got the #2 file which I use more often, but either works great and results in a bit more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look and feel to my nails.  Packaging and looks are quite nice.</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  It is almost useless as the rough part does not go clear to the edge and that is the part where it&#x27;s needed.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the nail file because I have dry fairly flexible nails.  Filing is very smooth and quick, so no filing back and forth to get a smooth surface which saves my nails from heating up and losing more precious natural oils.</li>

    <li> Great file and is thin.</li>
    <li> It seems like a lot to pay for a file but this file is well worth the money; cleans up chips and splits easily and professionally.</li>
    <li> I get a clean, fast file with this. It&#x27;s only textured on one side but this file is clearly built to last. One rinse and it looks new again. I buff after using it, which I anticipated having to do, but this file works much quicker and results in a considerably smoother surface than any other file meant for the same purpose. I cut my nails with seki nail clippers, use this, buff, and polish. The results are the best and fastest I&#x27;ve ever had. I had considered getting the coarser file because I have hard nails, but I absolutely do not need a more coarse file than the number 1.</li>
    <li> I have fragile fingernails and files that are most often used tare my nails.  This file is fine enough to smooth the edges so that the nail doesn&#x27;t have any rough edges.  It is a superior product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all the great reviews so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but even the fine grit feels more like a rasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if they sent me the wrong file. Mine doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. Instead of being the same width the entire length, it has a narrow section to make more of a paddle. Did they send me a callous file? The packaging lists Bliss Diamancel Diamond Nail File No1, Fine -- which seems like it should be the right file.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Files my nails beautifully. I love it so much, I ordered another one for my daughter. You simply wash after using. It will last a lifetime. Glad I jumped off my wallet and bought a quality file.</li>
    <li> I lost the first one I had bought and choose to repurchase on Amazon. I swear by this file. Its durable, and fine enough not to do additional damage to my already brittle nails. I love how its thin enough to get under my nails to shape and its a plus that all you have to do is rinse and repeat.. this file will last forever! Its worth the additional cost in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love these files! Easy to clean and do a super job finishing edges nicely.</li>
    <li> This nail file is wonderful! It&#x27;s large and has some bend to it and easily files any size nails. I ordered the No. 1, Fine, and it is perfect. It leaves my nails filed without any ragged edges at all. It&#x27;s my favorite nail file, and I like it even better than my OPI glass one!</li>
