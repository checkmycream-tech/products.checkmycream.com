      <li>LOVE it already!!</li>
      <li>Love best hand cream I use a night before bed.</li>
      <li>Does have good ingredients.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product - best hand cream ever.</li>
      <li>It is probably a good hand lotion</li>
      <li>it smells really good.</li>
      <li>I think the people that don&#x27;t mind the smell must not have a good sense of smell.  </li>
      <li>It smells so good that people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, good texture, good moisturizing, fair deal.</li>
      <li>Great deal, better than this $45.00 luxury brand cream I tried.</li>
      <li>Love the way this smells and feels!</li>
      <li>Love this hand cream!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>My hands still look and feel amazing.</li>
      <li>But as I said it makes my hands feel and look amazing</li>
      <li>This hand cream is nice and soothing, but I&#x27;ve not seen any of the results described.  </li>
      <li>let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
      <li>It is very strong.  </li>
      <li>I love this hand lotion and definately will be purchasing more of it!</li>
      <li>The product still doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it&#x27;s worth putting up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found, so far, for moisturizing my hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked around for products that I can feel good about using and I&#x27;ve been happy with derma-e so far.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to absorb, nice feel on the hands</li>
      <li>To be honest I find myself reapplying all the time mainly for the smell, I just love it, and it makes my hands look great.</li>
      <li>Product shipped right away and am happy with how easy it was.</li>
      <li>but I do love the ingredients</li>
      <li>I recommend this! :)</li>
      <li>so I tried their hand creme and was thoroughly pleased with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hands are moisturized and smooth now!  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve used Bath and Body lotions before, you&#x27;ll find that the scent on this is much more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is ok, not my favorite Derma-E product.</li>
      <li>And the big bonus for me was the wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>I want to add some more information since it&#x27;s been over a year of using this cream.</li>
      <li>I still love this product.  </li>
      <li>The scent is lovely---not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hands look and feel</li>
      <li>/&gt;Almost everything I&#x27;ve tried has worked better in the moisturizing department - Cetaphil, Eucerin, Netutrogena,</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells</li>
      <li>Now that I see that I will have better looking hands</li>
      <li>also need to say, the title I gave this more than a year ago says ant-aging cream.  </li>
      <li>I love how smoothe it is and how it smells.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and it seems to be helping the look and feel of my hands, will definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>Just got the product but already love it.</li>
      <li>and I love hand creams that smell good and sink right in, all while providing a protective barrier that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky to the touch.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love that it&#x27;s not geasy, soaks in nfast and the sweet pea scent is nice.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This has quickly become a favorite hand lotion.</li>
      <li>Not sticky and just a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not allergic or scent-sensitive, I love to wear rich powerful cologne.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is to be able to have hands that are almost free of the liver spots that we older adults deal with.</li>
      <li>Very powerful smell of Sweet tarts.</li>
      <li>Once it sinks in, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell, not overly sweet.</li>
      <li>I really love it so far!  </li>
      <li>No fragrance is best, but the way this one was described I thought it might be worth a little fragrance for younger looking, smooth hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I drive, my hands sit in direct sunlight, and I&#x27;d love something with an SPF option to keep my hands from the sun.</li>
      <li>but with this one not only is the smell is really nice</li>
      <li>This is a lovely rich moisturizer that takes a few years off my hands when I use it, not to mention it smells really nice, a very very soft clean fruit/floral.  </li>
      <li>It felt nice on my dry hands.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent to it that smells like sweet peas, but is barely noticeable to me unless I put my hands up to my nose to smell it.  </li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t wear cologne because I can&#x27;t smell it over this blast of sweet tarts, and I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want such a strong scent in a lotion.</li>
      <li>This lotion fits the bill on all accounts, and the only thing that would make it better is some SPF.  </li>
      <li>I can put this lotion on and within about 30 seconds, the lotion is completely absorbed, leaving my skin soft and sweet smelling without feeling like I&#x27;ll leave greasy fingerprints on everything I touch.  </li>
      <li>I have old looking hands and this product goes on smoothly plus it has no fragrance</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make it better for me is if it had an SPF built in.  </li>
      <li>I am very scent sensitive, so a big part of the enjoyment of using a good lotion is compromised for me with this one.</li>
      <li>feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Those antioxidants really work!  </li>
      <li>I would consider purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>As one who loves to work outside in the garden, this is the perfect treatment after a hard day of hand work.  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing, free of harsh chemicals (i am picky when it comes to this), leaves my hands very soft and not greasy</li>
      <li>I love derma e products in general because of their natural ingredients</li>
      <li>This one has a strong, overly sweet smell that sort of ruins it for me.</li>
      <li>But this cream melts right into the skin with no slick feeling after it&#x27;s worked in.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change yet, I use it every night.</li>
      <li>if it does the whole \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>so I cannot really emphasize in details if it is doing what it suppose to do</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much for the anti-aging effects, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement on that front.</li>
      <li>I read that the smell was too much to handle, well this is the part where we cannot go by all reviews.</li>
      <li>I havent really noticed a difference</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stay on through washing your hands</li>
      <li>and I really, really like it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say this is any better than any other body cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a fragrance that is strong enough for those in the general area to smell, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I already notice that my hands are looking smoother which I highly abuse them with gardening.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy scent, and I find it very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I can maintain a smooth, soft elasticity feeling on my hands for a very long time...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great hand cream and especially that I know it has all the good ingredients and not any bad ones in it makes a big difference.  I already notice that my hands are looking smoother which I highly abuse them with gardening.  Now that I see that I will have better looking hands i am protecting them by wearing cotton gloves while driving(sun from the window makes them age I heard!) and gloves while I am gardening and sun screen at all times. I am using the cream each time I wash my hands keeping them by the sink! I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very hard on my hands as I do lots of things in the outdoors. But this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found, so far, for moisturizing my hands. I notice a definite change overnight, and I can also use this throughout the day as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the DermaE products I&#x27;ve used in the past, so when I needed some new hand cream, I decided to give this a try and I really, really like it. It makes my hands feel so soft after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hand lotion junkie, and I love hand creams that smell good and sink right in, all while providing a protective barrier that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky to the touch.  I also like my hand lotions to have good ingredients in them, including no parabens or questionable items.  This lotion fits the bill on all accounts, and the only thing that would make it better is some SPF.  Since I&#x27;m on the computer a lot, I especially like that I can use it and almost immediately after type away, without worrying about it getting on my keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While others complained that the smell is a bit strong, I don&#x27;t find it to be so at all.  If you&#x27;ve used Bath and Body lotions before, you&#x27;ll find that the scent on this is much more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two tubes came in a different package that the photo currently being shown, but each tube was sealed with foil on the bottom and is fresh.</li>
    <li> It is probably a good hand lotion but I gave it away.  It felt nice on my dry hands.  However, I could not deal with the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, free of harsh chemicals (i am picky when it comes to this), leaves my hands very soft and not greasy AT ALL.  I recommend this! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally not very good at using hand cream (even though I need it) because I hate the greasy after feel that comes with it. But this cream melts right into the skin with no slick feeling after it&#x27;s worked in. And the big bonus for me was the wonderful scent. It smells so good that people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.To be honest I find myself reapplying all the time mainly for the smell, I just love it, and it makes my hands look great.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells and feels! It doesn&#x27;t really stay on through washing your hands and I do that frequently so I haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I do love the ingredients</li>
    <li> This is the very best hand lotion-cream I have ever used!  As one who loves to work outside in the garden, this is the perfect treatment after a hard day of hand work.  The scent is lovely---not overwhelming.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars but I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I love the way it makes my hands look and feel so I will put up with the stink. I think the people that don&#x27;t mind the smell must not have a good sense of smell.  It is very strong.  But as I said it makes my hands feel and look amazing so I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edited 11/2013) I want to add some more information since it&#x27;s been over a year of using this cream. I still love this product.  My hands still look and feel amazing. It does lighten the age spots and my hands do look younger.  The product still doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it&#x27;s worth putting up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also need to say, the title I gave this more than a year ago says ant-aging cream.  So ants, beware!! :D</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion and definately will be purchasing more of it!</li>
    <li> When a friend told me you can tell a woman&#x27;s age by the hands.  I looked at mine and put search in about a hand cream.  Ordered this one and my hands after two days looked 10 years younger and I am not hiding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money will order again.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands several times a day and I have tried dozens of different hand cremes and lotions, but none of them comes close to this one!  I love derma e products in general because of their natural ingredients so I tried their hand creme and was thoroughly pleased with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs immediately with no greasy feel and leaves my hands and cuticles  feeling soft and smooth.  I also apply it to my feet and elbows, wherever my skin feels dry and thirsty.  It&#x27;s made with green tea, olive oil, aloe, cucumber, vitamin E and MSM.  It has a light scent to it that smells like sweet peas, but is barely noticeable to me unless I put my hands up to my nose to smell it.  It&#x27;s not a heavy scent, and I find it very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for five years now and I have continued to notice a visible difference!  My age spots have continued to gradually fade and almost disappear! I am outdoors a lot in the California sunshine and this stuff is wonderful!  Those antioxidants really work!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I read that the smell was too much to handle, well this is the part where we cannot go by all reviews. I received it yesterday and the quality is creamy not thick like other creams, the smell is aaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmaaaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzziiiiinnnnng. I love the way it smells and they way it eliminates your rough hands immediately. I just got it yesterday (6/23/2015) so I cannot really emphasize in details if it is doing what it suppose to do but I can honestly say that it makes my hands feel softer, not dry or harsh and it stays like this for a very long time. I have tried other creams that makes your hands soft for a few minutes and then you get that tight harsh feeling on your skin once again which means you have to be constantly applying but with this one not only is the smell is really nice but I can maintain a smooth, soft elasticity feeling on my hands for a very long time...</li>
    <li> I seriously hate putting lotion on my hands... actually anywhere because inevitably I&#x27;m left useless with sticky or greasy hands.  This has changed everything for me.  I can put this lotion on and within about 30 seconds, the lotion is completely absorbed, leaving my skin soft and sweet smelling without feeling like I&#x27;ll leave greasy fingerprints on everything I touch.  I wish this came in a giant jug so I could slather it all over my body because it works well on my feet... arms... legs... let&#x27;s be honest... I just use it on everything.  My hands are moisturized and smooth now!  The only thing that would make it better for me is if it had an SPF built in.  When I drive, my hands sit in direct sunlight, and I&#x27;d love something with an SPF option to keep my hands from the sun.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product - best hand cream ever. Also paid the best price ever!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change yet, I use it every night.</li>
    <li> This has quickly become a favorite hand lotion. I can&#x27;t say much for the anti-aging effects, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement on that front. But it goes on nicely, is quickly absorbed, has minimal scent, and seems to keep my hands soft longer than my old standby Aveeno.</li>
    <li> Best hand creme ever!!</li>
    <li> Obviously I&#x27;m not the target group for this product because I find the scent heavy and intrusive: very strong, even if you use just a little. Very powerful smell of Sweet tarts. Other comments about slow to absorb are also accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Take all of that with a grain of salt-- I&#x27;m not allergic or scent-sensitive, I love to wear rich powerful cologne. But I can&#x27;t wear cologne because I can&#x27;t smell it over this blast of sweet tarts, and I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want such a strong scent in a lotion. So, what do I know.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to absorb, nice feel on the hands&lt;br /&gt;.  I use it all over the body as well as for the hands.</li>
    <li> I mentioned in another derma-e product review, I&#x27;ve bought several of their products and this and the vanilla bean cleanser are my favorites so far.  This is a lovely rich moisturizer that takes a few years off my hands when I use it, not to mention it smells really nice, a very very soft clean fruit/floral.  I&#x27;ve looked around for products that I can feel good about using and I&#x27;ve been happy with derma-e so far.</li>
    <li> it smells really good. it also smooths the hands a bit. not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, and all derma-e products, but I have to say the scent of this one is not appealing to me. Not the usual light fruity scent of derma-e products. This one has a strong, overly sweet smell that sort of ruins it for me. The smell does not last long, so this may not be a problem for anyone else. I am very scent sensitive, so a big part of the enjoyment of using a good lotion is compromised for me with this one. Otherwise, good texture, good moisturizing, fair deal. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again however.    I&#x27;ve used this lotion for several weeks now, and I have to say the scent has really grown on me. Once it sinks in, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell, not overly sweet. If I could, I&#x27;d change my 3-star rating to a 4 or 5. This cream is thick, but absorbent. I have come to like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is nice and soothing, but I&#x27;ve not seen any of the results described.  Am not sure if it&#x27;s any better than any other hand cream available at local stores.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this anti-aging hand cream, but it is no where near comparable to Aveeno&#x27;s hand cream period. My mom used it everynight and did not notice any antiaging results as claimed by this product.</li>
    <li> I havent really noticed a difference but i also could be because i have ezcema.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is lack of a sunscreen ingredient. Otherwise, I love that it&#x27;s not geasy, soaks in nfast and the sweet pea scent is nice. Quality ingredients. I wish they sold purse-sized tubes!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something with little or no scent, look elsewhere. As the description clearly states, this IS scented.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST HAND CREAM. I have had problems w/ my hands looking terrible the last couple yrs. Extreamly dry, cracked, awful texture &amp; rough. It has been quite embarrassing. I tried a lot of creams, olive oil, Etc. This cream works so well that it lasts all day. My hands are soft, smoothe &amp; younger looking. Great deal, better than this $45.00 luxury brand cream I tried.</li>
    <li> I have old looking hands and this product goes on smoothly plus it has no fragrance so I like that</li>
    <li> Bought this product to carry in my pocket book and it turned out to be very good.  I would consider purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m jumping ahead a little on the five stars because I just got it and dont know if it does the whole \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot;. However, it is the Best hand lotion i&#x27;ve ever used! My hands feel amazing!! LOVE it already!!</li>
    <li> the age defying hand crème that I ordered did not come with vitamin E. The one that I&#x27;m using has Vitamin E and ordered at different website</li>
    <li> I really love it so far!  My skin feels tighter and well moistened.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say this is any better than any other body cream. Does have good ingredients. Might buy it only for that reason.</li>
    <li> This lotion, at least for my body chemistry, does not work at all. It is one of the worst lotions I have ever used. In attempts to get results I have slathered huge amounts on, only to have my hands feel tight and dry 30 minutes later. When I wash my hands, a new slathering has to happen with repeats every 30-60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was willing to go through those short comings if my skin looked younger, which is the reason I purchased the product. Nope. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fragrance that is strong enough for those in the general area to smell, but not overpowering. No fragrance is best, but the way this one was described I thought it might be worth a little fragrance for younger looking, smooth hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost everything I&#x27;ve tried has worked better in the moisturizing department - Cetaphil, Eucerin, Netutrogena, any of those brands have no fragrance, leave the hands smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it is just my body chemistry and others get the results that I did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream!  It smells wonderful and it seems to be helping the look and feel of my hands, will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Costs less than the department stores including Walmart and Target. By the way I am not bashing Walmart! With today&#x27;s economy have to shop with some sense.</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement in the appearance of my hands. Not sticky and just a light fragrance. My husband even uses this.</li>
    <li> Received shipment as stated. On time and a great product. Product shipped right away and am happy with how easy it was.</li>
    <li> This is ok, not my favorite Derma-E product.</li>
    <li> Just got the product but already love it. I love how smoothe it is and how it smells.</li>
    <li> Until I purchased Anti-Aging Hand Creme, no other moisturizer could remove the dark spots on my hands, and arms, that I struggled with for years. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is to be able to have hands that are almost free of the liver spots that we older adults deal with. Being in the sun in Los Angeles and an active adult in the sun, the anti-aging hand creme, has helped me immensely with the unsightly blemishes that pop up at will. Thank you for this great product and I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL ADULTS who deal with liver spots and other unsightly markings.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t use this because I am allergic to Aloe</li>
    <li> Love best hand cream I use a night before bed.</li>
