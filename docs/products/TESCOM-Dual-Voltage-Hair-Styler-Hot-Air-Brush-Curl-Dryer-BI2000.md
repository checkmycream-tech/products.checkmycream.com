      <li>Plus this brush/dryer leaves my hair smooth, shiny and sleek.</li>
      <li>My friends loved it, so I went back for more.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>I use it while my hair is still slightly wet and my hair resembles the beautiful hair I always had.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look full and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I esp love the soft bristles.</li>
      <li>For a sleeker look use straightening iron (I rarely do).  </li>
      <li>Ever since having kids my hair has gone from being straight, silky and full.</li>
      <li>but the individual strands are very fine.</li>
      <li>Also, it dries my hair super fast.</li>
      <li>I purchased \\&quot;TESCOM Dual Voltage Hair Styler Hot Air Brush Curl Dryer BI2000 (Misc.)\\&quot; 28 years ago.</li>
      <li>It has an auto shut off, it shuts itself off if it gets too hot on higher setting.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m so glad i have it for my next travvel adventure.</li>
      <li>First saw/used this product at my sisters.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for (i really wanted a rolling styler)</li>
      <li>Great for my thick and curly hair!</li>
      <li>It can pop out if you tug your hair too much.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally straight, and I wear it in an A-line bob that falls below my chin</li>
      <li>out the deal and is selling it through Amazon US for much much profit.</li>
      <li>all I expected even though this one is not the latest model in Japan.</li>
      <li>It takes me 5-10 mins to get my hair fairly straight.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a gentle blower and styler.</li>
      <li>straight either,</li>
      <li>I have had a hard time finding anything that helped my hair look healthy and full again.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I think it is overpriced as it does not look or feel like a high quality product, but will see.</li>
      <li>, just I wish it was a little more watt</li>
      <li>wife picked up this hot air brush since her original one died after a few years.  </li>
      <li>but it only worked the first 4 times&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>I bought the exact same product in Japan for about $10 US.</li>
      <li>Once out, can be popped back in but it&#x27;s loose and can easily pop out again.</li>
      <li>Take a few minutes to cool off and ready to use it again.</li>
      <li>This did not have enough power or heat to dry my hair and most of the instructions are in chinese.  </li>
      <li>This one is a replacement for my old</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional woman</li>
      <li>Much faster than my regular hairdryer.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this one in addition to my older model because I did not want to risk being without</li>
      <li>the price is waaaay to high for this very low quality</li>
      <li>It is not heavy and quieter than some hair dryer sounds like \\&quot;vacuum cleaner\\&quot;?</li>
      <li>Now, if you have hair that is not easy to style then this might not be for you as the air can get really hot and burn your hair so you basically have to keep moving it thru your hair without stopping.</li>

<li> Its takes a  long time to get my hair dry and straight because its not powerful.</li>
<li> (in fact, my regular dryer actually makes my hair look dry and frizzy).</li>
<li> Short hair or long</li>
<li> dry or brow dry with a regular dryer</li>
<li> The only problem is you have to be careful with the plastic/rubber insert-brush.</li>
<li> plus I am not someone who likes to spend long time with my hair.</li>
<li> I have course thick \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair, and THIS bad-boy really does the job of drying and taming my hair, in preparation for styling afterwards.</li>
<li> it started making some weird noises and gets real hot</li>
<li> If you have really thin to partially thick hair or hair that doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, then I&#x27;m sure this product will work for you.</li>
<li> so I basically have to dry them while brushing it the way I want them to lay.</li>
<li> When I was in Japan I bought a few, and brought them back to the US.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think you can find it in any other store since it is a foreign item.</li>
<li> No possible way it cod replace a hair dryer and round brush for straightening my curly hair!</li>
<li> I got the other one just for my aunt.</li>
<li> and I use it few times a week to straighten, tame my frizzy, big, curly hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s made of hard, heavyweight molded plastic, and feels solid.</li>
<li> It is not powerful hair dryer</li>
<li> I got a TESCOM Curling Travel Hair Dryer BI21-K Black as a gift from Japan 10+ years ago</li>
<li> BUT it did the trick half way round the world</li>
<li> and  worked a little faster.</li>
<li> Easier way to straighten your hair is to split it and roll it around the dryer and hold for a few seconds.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this blow dryer cannot withstand it because the rubber on the brush becomes really soft &amp; falls out as I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
<li> Might have dried baby-fine toddler hair.</li>
<li> (have been using it for a few month).</li>
<li> I hardly use curling iron.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re like me, you will née to keep shopping around or at least until they make that stays secured to the dryer.</li>

    <li> Not as advertised! Cheap plastic construction. No possible way it cod replace a hair dryer and round brush for straightening my curly hair! Might have dried baby-fine toddler hair.</li>
    <li> Great for my thick and curly hair! I use it to blowout my hair before straightening it and it actually gets it straighter than I thought.</li>
    <li> I love this product... Short hair or long it&#x27;s amazing...I am happy I found it on amazon At such a great price.</li>
    <li> This did not have enough power or heat to dry my hair and most of the instructions are in chinese.  I do love the like the color.</li>
    <li> I got a TESCOM Curling Travel Hair Dryer BI21-K Black as a gift from Japan 10+ years ago and I use it few times a week to straighten, tame my frizzy, big, curly hair. I recently purchased this one in addition to my older model because I did not want to risk being without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional woman so I like my hair to be presentable at all times, however I hate to go to the salon and I am not good with blow-drying my hair straight either, plus I am not someone who likes to spend long time with my hair. After I wash my hair I air dry or brow dry with a regular dryer and then I basically comb my hair with this. Easier way to straighten your hair is to split it and roll it around the dryer and hold for a few seconds. Once you are done with each section comb the hair over. For a sleeker look use straightening iron (I rarely do).  It takes me 5-10 mins to get my hair fairly straight. I take my dryer with me wherever I go.</li>
    <li> perfect for overseas travel</li>
    <li> This dryer is REALLY great! I have course thick \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair, and THIS bad-boy really does the job of drying and taming my hair, in preparation for styling afterwards. When I was in Japan I bought a few, and brought them back to the US. My friends loved it, so I went back for more. The only problem is you have to be careful with the plastic/rubber insert-brush. It can pop out if you tug your hair too much. Once out, can be popped back in but it&#x27;s loose and can easily pop out again. The price advertised on Amazon is waaaay over. I bought the exact same product in Japan for about $10 US. Someone fig. out the deal and is selling it through Amazon US for much much profit.</li>
    <li> Its work good I Will say is 90% its meet my needs, just I wish it was a little more watt and  worked a little faster. Its takes a  long time to get my hair dry and straight because its not powerful. But in general its good  I am happy I got that</li>
    <li> I purchased \\&quot;TESCOM Dual Voltage Hair Styler Hot Air Brush Curl Dryer BI2000 (Misc.)\\&quot; 28 years ago. Literately, I have used it for the last 28 years, until I broke it by dropped on the floor. It is not powerful hair dryer but it&#x27;s a gentle blower and styler. It is not heavy and quieter than some hair dryer sounds like \\&quot;vacuum cleaner\\&quot;? It has a two settings and I always used lower setting and it never damage my hair. It has an auto shut off, it shuts itself off if it gets too hot on higher setting. Take a few minutes to cool off and ready to use it again. I hardly use curling iron. It&#x27;s great for medium-short hair!!</li>
    <li> I love these Japanese made blowdryers &amp; have been looking for one that best its me. I have really thick hair &amp; it produces a lot of heat. Unfortunately, this blow dryer cannot withstand it because the rubber on the brush becomes really soft &amp; falls out as I&#x27;m drying my hair. If you have really thin to partially thick hair or hair that doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, then I&#x27;m sure this product will work for you. If you&#x27;re like me, you will née to keep shopping around or at least until they make that stays secured to the dryer.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my wife and this is what she says about it. &amp;#34;I love this styling brush. Ever since having kids my hair has gone from being straight, silky and full. I have had a hard time finding anything that helped my hair look healthy and full again. This is great. I use it while my hair is still slightly wet and my hair resembles the beautiful hair I always had. I wish I had found this years ago.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I brought this cause i really liked the color but it only worked the first 4 times&lt;br /&gt;Then it broke it started making some weird noises and gets real hot i cant even hold it&lt;br /&gt;And the price is waaaay to high for this very low quality</li>
    <li> I love this product! Its great because it makes blow drying your hair so much easier. I esp love the soft bristles. Its great on my hair &amp;#60;3 buy it! I don&#x27;t think you can find it in any other store since it is a foreign item.</li>
    <li> Love having heat  dryer and brush together</li>
    <li> It is great hair styler</li>
    <li> Love what I brought!  So convenient and portable. Can&#x27;t live without it! I got the other one just for my aunt. She loves it！</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kind of hair dyer for years. This one is a replacement for my old one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all I expected even though this one is not the latest model in Japan. It works.</li>
    <li> wife picked up this hot air brush since her original one died after a few years.  dual voltage comes in handy when we travel abroad.  works well from what she states and would purchase again once this one dies.</li>
    <li> Love this brush/dryer! It makes my hair look full and shiny.  It&#x27;s made of hard, heavyweight molded plastic, and feels solid. Also, it dries my hair super fast. Much faster than my regular hairdryer. Plus this brush/dryer leaves my hair smooth, shiny and sleek. My regular hair dryer doesn&#x27;t do that (in fact, my regular dryer actually makes my hair look dry and frizzy). For reference, I have a lot of hair .... very thick ..... but the individual strands are very fine. My hair is naturally straight, and I wear it in an A-line bob that falls below my chin but above my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t figured out how to curl my hair with this yet. But that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ll practice a bit more and see if I can figure it out.  :)</li>
    <li> First saw/used this product at my sisters. Once I used it I loved it and decided to get one for myself. Amazon was out of stock for a while for this product but as soon as it came back I was able to purchase it. Love the fact that it is light, easy to use with one hand. My hair are easy to style so I basically have to dry them while brushing it the way I want them to lay. Now, if you have hair that is not easy to style then this might not be for you as the air can get really hot and burn your hair so you basically have to keep moving it thru your hair without stopping. Although I love it I think it is overpriced as it does not look or feel like a high quality product, but will see. so far so good. (have been using it for a few month).</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for (i really wanted a rolling styler) BUT it did the trick half way round the world and i&#x27;m so glad i have it for my next travvel adventure.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer nothing else needs to be said</li>
    <li> As my mother said, it is perfect.</li>
