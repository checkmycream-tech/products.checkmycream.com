      <li>Used to be able to get in dollar stores, but it seems they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  </li>
      <li>For my niece she will wash her hands as often as possible just for the delightful fragrance.</li>
      <li>It smells good, feels soft and also washes hands good, ...</li>
      <li>I am glad that Amazon carries this product.</li>

      <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s saying something...:)</li>
      <li>Clean soft hands and wonderful fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
      <li>Have used this product before and think that it is the best product out there particularly with the scent that it offers.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and it leaves your hands soft and smooth!!  </li>
      <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t remember if it did a good job of keeping hands from feeling dry after use, but I THINK it was good at keeping the hands soft and supple.</li>
      <li>But using this soap no matter how often I wash my hands stay smooth.</li>
      <li>This 21 oz size is so much more economical than the 15 oz refills offered elsewhere, or the 7.5 oz dispenser bottles.</li>
      <li>SO WHY NOT BUY IT FOR HER AND ENJOY FOR HER AND ME.</li>
      <li>AND HE SKIN IS SO SOFT AND SMELLS SO GOOD.</li>
      <li>ALWAYS LEAVES ME FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN.</li>
      <li>To my experience, I like this hand wash lotion over other more popular kinds.</li>
      <li>I love the cherry almond scent - this is the only hand soap that has it right.</li>
      <li>This has the old familiar cherry almond scent and is an economical size.  </li>
      <li>great product,have used it for years and now hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh, the consistency is gentle, Thank you for offering it online.</li>
      <li>Makes hands soft and the smell is so sweet and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>This is the greatest and I am so disappointed that it is no longer readily available.  </li>
      <li>I really like the smell of this soap and the reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I love the traditional Jergens Lotion scent of this Jergens Hand Wash liquid soap, and it leaves my hands soft.</li>
      <li>I had to give away new dish towels because my cracked fingertips stuck to the loops like Velcro.  </li>
      <li>Feels soft as silk!</li>
      <li>My hands are super sensitive to all of the anti-bacterial ingredients in other soaps.  </li>
      <li>Soft and comfy on hands.  </li>
      <li>the cherry almond fragrance, leaves hands soft</li>
      <li>This soap is great for anyone who Does Not want to get sick this season, but wants to have soft hands, as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bonus to have the original Jergens smell, one of the few fragrances I can tolerate.</li>
      <li>My hands are back to normal now.</li>
      <li>I have been using Jergens Cherry Almond Hand Wash for years, and have not been able to find the big refill bottle anywhere lately.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, &amp; this the only soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out.</li>

    <li> I LOVED the smell of this!!!!! I&#x27;d practically snort it every time I washed my hands!! Felt like weeping when it was gone! hehehe.

    <li> I love the smell of this product.  I have may happy childhood memories of my grandmother&#x27;s house and using her jergens hand lotion as a special treat.  I loved the smell then and still love it today!  Everytime I smell it, it reminds me of many happy days with her.  I would have given this product a 5 star rating except I received the product with part of the product all over the inside of the box.  The packing was insufficient to protect the product during shipping. One of the caps on one of the bottle shifted loose and the contents leaked out.  Perhaps the shipper can fix this problem in any future shipments..</li>
    <li> HAVE USED IT MANY TIMES, LOVE THE FRAGRANCE AND CONSISTANCY. ALWAYS LEAVES ME FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN. Feels soft as silk!</li>
    <li> I had gone to an upscale restaurant and my friend and I went to the ladies room.  My friend remarked that her grandmother always used the cherry almond hand wash and she loved the fragrance and how it made her hands feel.  I came home and went on the internet and ordered my friend 3 bottles for her birthday.  She was so  thankful thatI had found this winderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been stocking up on this handsoap for years. I cannot find it on the shelves in the stores nearby, and always turn to Amazon to order it. It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
