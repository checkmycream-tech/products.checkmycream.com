      <li>I love this face lotion.</li>
      <li>sample was a bit better</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>but i recommend you use a more richer cream at night, or pair it with a better hydrating serum.</li>
      <li>so it goes on top instead of under like you would with</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily nor does it irritate my face like most products do.</li>
      <li>Feels refreshing when you apply it.</li>

      <li>Skin feels great so far!</li>

      <li>I thought the product was pretty good, it smells very nice and the price is pretty reasonable.</li>
      <li>for the smell every one said it was strong but</li>
      <li>Also, the scent is way too strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Strong scent&lt;</li>
      <li>it is light and moisturizing without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I think this would be great for summer but for winter i think you would need to double it</li>
      <li>My favorite one in the collection with a fresh, unisex scent.  </li>
      <li>but it is like a light weight mouse like type of cream but starts to melt and apply smoothly onto the skin.</li>
      <li>In fact, I feel like it&#x27;s a damn shame to wash my face in the mornings just because my face feels so free and happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>It feels refreshed &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light nature.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I gave this an extra star purely because of the smell. I have heard that quite a few people don&#x27;t like it as it is a strong scent, but how I love that smell! Maybe it&#x27;s just me.... Now that that is out of the way, I don&#x27;t think this cream is anything really amazing but I do like it. I would definitely not use this cream during the winter because it is pretty light. This cream is nice for the warmer climates because it leaves the skin soft and matte. I guess I was hoping for this cream to help out with the texture of my skin a bit but it hasn&#x27;t so far. The texture of the cream is not very watery - in-between watery and creamy with a slightly silicon feel. I was surprised that the size is actually quite large and it comes with a little spatula. I will definitely use up this cream in the summer but I am not sure if I would repurchase it in the near future.</li>
    <li> Fast and problem free</li>
    <li> Pros: left my dry-combination skin moisturizer and super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: overwhelming scent and ingredients list! although I really do enjoy the smell, all the fragrances and chemicals going near my eyes is worrisome. Another thing is this container is quite heavy but the product lasted me less than two months.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as I expected, and came earlier than estimated. Thank you!</li>
    <li> really nice product, with a pleasant fragrance and cute packaging. the texture is a bit unique, so it takes a bit of getting used to. unfortunately, i have dry/sensitive skin, so this doesn&#x27;t work the best for me. it should give better results to someone with more oily skin.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday and therefore have only used it one day, but the scent is INCREDIBLE, and I loved the way it felt going on. Skin feels great so far!</li>
    <li> It softens and hydrates the skin but doesn&#x27;t relieve the deep wrinkle b/w my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a very moisturizing cream. It goes on a bit like a light gel, sinks in immediately, and leaves almost no moisture behind. This is the &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; cream but might only be good for someone with very oily skin. It had no moisturizing benefits for me.</li>
    <li> great product i should say! its very natural and has a pleasant smell!! it really does moisturize the skin and leave the skin soft. Recommend to combination oily type skin and oily skin ^^</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for oily skin. Gives just the right amount of moisture without being heavy. Those with dry skin may only find this product useful in the summer, due to it&#x27;s light nature. Has a light, fresh, slightly floral scent. The product comes in a substantial and attractive container, complete with a little spatula for dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from UniBella and shipping was fast (for coming from Korea) and product arrived in good condition. The outer box the product comes in was slightly smashed, but no big deal. The seller packaged the item in a generous amount of bubble wrap to prevent damage.</li>
    <li> Feels refreshing when you apply it. Leaves your face moisturized and smells nice. Defiantly worth the money but be aware you will have a few pimples when you first start.</li>
    <li> When it came, some of the product was around the the lid and outside of it. Either the lid was loose or it has been opened (it closed like a screw). No spatula.</li>
    <li> I recieve my package today and i was so excited for it. When i saw the package it was packaged in one of those tan envelopes that had bubble wrap. And once i opened it there was a cardboard box around the cream and bubble wrap wrapped over the cream box. (Everything was protected). My cream was in there and they even gave some samples which was nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the texture would be like watery gel sort of but it is like a light weight mouse like type of cream but starts to melt and apply smoothly onto the skin. It does absorb a bit quick so i would prefer to put a heavier cream on top if you really want a moisturized hydrated face. I think this would be great for summer but for winter i think you would need to double it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell every one said it was strong but thats if you really go deep into smelling it but the smell is light kind of smells like cucumbers with a tad bit hint of alcohol smell. It isnt disturbing but nor is the smell really great. It doesnt really bug me since im not sensitive towards it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way my skin is combination and i am not sensitive towards anything surprsingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ill have a better update once i try it out for a week. Overall great so far (:</li>
    <li> Fragrance is way too strong and not enough moisturizer. Went through the whole jar in 2 weeks being I hand to keep reapplying it. Will not buy again or recommend it</li>
    <li> this stuff is freaking awesome. I love the smell and it feels so nice on my skin its like a package of awesome.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and I had high hopes for this watery cream, but it did not deliver. It was good for summer, but does not provide much hydration for other seasons (my cheeks and around my lips tend to get dry). Also, the scent is way too strong.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this cream its awesome</li>
    <li> Very clean and fresh scent. it is light and moisturizing without feeling greasy. My skin loves it!</li>
    <li> Absorbs fast.  I could do without the smell, but so far the moisturizing qualities outweigh my aversion to the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ok. I&#x27;ve become obsessed with Korean skincare products. I am all in on the multi-step day &amp; night routine. I use this as part of my daytime routine. It&#x27;s a very very lightweight moisturizer that just feels delicious on. While I have an oily t-zone, the rest of my face has felt very dry thanks to this incredible New York winter we&#x27;ve had. This stuff hydrates well but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. When you layer in your skincare routine, it&#x27;s always a worry that things will start to feel thick, which is bad for daytime. This goes on nice &amp; light under your makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion. I recommend it to all my friends. My skin just absorbs it. And leave skin feeling great. I also noticed my wrinkles were disappearing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a day and night moisturizer when I&#x27;m not using a sleep cream pack.  I really like the fresh and slightly perfumed smell.  I only use a small amount since it kind of feels a little oily but I have dry skin, so this may be more ideal for cooler weather.  So far so good.  I found the price cheaper on Amazon than the Korean beauty website, Soko Glam.</li>
    <li> I have an issue with moisturizers clogging my pores. I eventually found out that I am sensitive to alcohol and fatty alcohols (think cetyl alcohol) that are often used in moisturizers. This is free of fatty alcohols but I worried about all the exotic sounding extracts and interestingly ingredients. That said, this is one of my favorite moisturizers. It has a distinct flowery scent, a tad bit thinner then a typical gel moisturizer with far more volume, and is deliciously cool when you put it on. I like to splash my face with water, pat dry, then apply this, then a sunscreen (physical sunscreen so it goes on top instead of under like you would with a chemical sunscreen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it being in a jar and therefore prone to bacteria. This has preservative in it so bacteria isn&#x27;t going to flourish in it. That said, I&#x27;d use a different product for antioxidant as they&#x27;d loose their potential being exposed in this container type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer lately, so I decided to try this since I&#x27;d heard good things about it. My face feels instantly hydrated as I&#x27;m applying it, and afterwards it leaves my face feeling super soft! It&#x27;s also very light and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all. The only drawback is what others have described as a\\&quot;light\\&quot; scent,  but for me it&#x27;s a little too strong and almost perfumey, though I stop smelling it after a while so it&#x27;s not much of a problem . Overall I love it and I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy some more!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, smells fresh and the texture is smooth and kind of feels like a liquid gel more than cream. Leaves skin feeling very cool and smooth; also absorbs rather quickly. The product comes with a little spatula, and a little definitely goes a long way. I only need a pea sized amount for my face, and I use it AM/PM,</li>
    <li> I love it! It doesn&#x27;t give my face a sticky feeling like other moisturizers have.</li>
    <li> Visiting Korea we liked this product and it&#x27;s great to see it is available on amazon since we have not found this product in Chicago stores.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Definitely the highest quality facial moisturizer I have ever used. You only need to use a little bit, and it absorbs very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or greasy either. I put in on at night and when I woke my face was very soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I want to love this, the cream is perfect! It smooths and moisturizes wonderfully and I don&#x27;t wake up oily anymore! It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it is so heavily perfumed that it burns my sinuses and makes my eyes water. This may be because I have a bit of a sensitive nose, but this stuff is so strong. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again, but my boyfriend likes the smell so I&#x27;ll use up the rest.</li>
    <li> I have oily to combo skin and this cream is so refreshing!! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily nor does it irritate my face like most products do.</li>
    <li> the cream is very moisturizing and will absorb fast, but i couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, although it has a fresh oceany scent, it&#x27;s too strong and last for hours making me feel giddy of constant fragrance inhales. I would give a 5 star if it was milder.</li>
    <li> I bought this after receiving a sample. I love it. Aqua is perfect for combination skin. It gives my skin just the right amount of moisture without breaking it out (like most others I&#x27;ve tried from other brands). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great for oily and dry combination skin.  It has fragrance added (very pleasant scent - almost like fresh apple), so that might be a concern for some.  Even though I&#x27;m not a fan of added fragrance, it didn&#x27;t cause any problem on my skin so I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the WORST luck with moisturizers.  Everything breaks me out or just doesn&#x27;t work.  My skin is pretty sensitive so I just gave up on them but I know that I need them - especially as I look at the downhill slope to 40.  A blogger recently reviewed some of her favorite products and I decided to give this a whirl as her skin sounds similar to mine.  While I realize it&#x27;s only a week into my adventures with this product thus far I am AMAZED and beyond impressed with this product!  I know that it&#x27;s probably a combination of all things I&#x27;m doing but this product seems to be the shining star of the group.  My breakouts have ceased, my skin is soft and the fine lines that were starting to appear are quickly dissipating.  Fingers crossed this remains to be the same but all other moisturizers by this point would have had my face freaking out so I&#x27;m giving this one a tentative 5 stars! YAY!</li>
    <li> I bought this while I was living in Korea. When I ran out...I had to get more! Thank God the internet has pretty much everything!^^</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this few a few weeks now and it does seem to be hydrating. My only real complaint is that my skin is very sensitive and as I&#x27;m applying the lotion it stings a little. The sensation dulls once everything is rubbed in, but it is not pleasant. I also find that I am left with a tacky/sticky feeling after applying it that&#x27;s a little unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrates dry skin well&lt;br /&gt;- Hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or left me with an oily face feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly sticky feeling after application&lt;br /&gt;- Strong scent&lt;br /&gt;- Stings upon application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using this I was using Olay Regenerist Night Repair cream and I liked that a lot better because it left my skin feeling soft and was a lot gentler. In the future I will be looking for a product that is geared towards more sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face cream! My sister brought it back from Korea, and I can&#x27;t stop using it! It&#x27;s very light but keeps my face moisturized and soft. Koreans have such amazing skin care products!</li>
    <li> This product has a fantastic scent and it felt wonderful on my skin for about a week. I had to stop using it there after because it caused my face to break out. Perhaps it&#x27;s my skin type (combination oily) but I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about purchasing this product because of the great reviews I had seen on it. So far I have used it a few times and it has made my face break out into red spots :/ It does feel really good on the skin though when put on. Maybe I bought the wrong kind for my skin type.</li>
    <li> fragrance Excellent....</li>
    <li> Love product. Make sure to reorder immediately if you like it. It can take a month to receive order from Korea!</li>
    <li> it has a slight tightening effect. Its good if you have oily skin and wear it under your makeup, but i recommend you use a more richer cream at night, or pair it with a better hydrating serum. btw this is a gel</li>
    <li> is a nice face cream doesnt feel greasy and leaves ur face hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Being a watery cream it&#x27;s supposed to help provide moisture to the skin over time. I use this at night and love it! Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy before I go to bed and feels very refreshing. Works very well for combination skin to help balance. I&#x27;m on my second jar. My only concern is with the fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it&#x27;s floral enough it might bother others, however I have very fair, sensitive skin and have never broken out to this.</li>
    <li> I have combination/oily skin and have had lifelong issues with acne (and no, this did not clear my current breakout). Any kind of moisturizer that I put on, day or night, left my skin oily within the next 30 minutes. Enter this gift from the skincare gods. I bought this on impulse while vacationing in Hawaii because I needed a lighter moisturizer in the humidity there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night and in the mornings, my skin feels like skin. My face didn&#x27;t freak out and secrete more oil. My skin feels perfectly moisturized. In fact, I feel like it&#x27;s a damn shame to wash my face in the mornings just because my face feels so free and happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my anecdotal experience, this would be great for anyone who struggles with skin that&#x27;s overzealous about oil production. I will admit, though, that the combination cream has a smoother/silkier finish upon application. This watery cream has a consistency of jelly that isn&#x27;t unpleasant but was a little funky at first. The combination cream feels more like a traditional cream. I think that either one would&#x27;ve worked out great but I&#x27;m too busy being in love with this cream to even care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay moisturized, my skincare-conscious friends.</li>
    <li> this has a nice texture, but i could not get over the heavy fragrance! it overwhelming and smells like men&#x27;s cologne. sorry, but just no</li>
    <li> My sister turned me on to this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s by far my favorite it&#x27;s very moisturizing, very smooth and smells great! It doesn&#x27;t leave your face sticky feeling. It feels refreshed &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> I love the little scoop that comes with the jar. I don&#x27;t even need a full scoop to cover my face. I have combo skin and an oily t-zone. I haven&#x27;t broken out much after using this. Love it!</li>
    <li> sample was a bit better</li>
    <li> Okay this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.. it beats out my Loreal revitalift in which that smells amazing... however this stuff smells more amazing... it&#x27;s a spa treatment in a jar. I love this product so much I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar. ♥</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered on time!</li>
    <li> I find this to be very fragranced.  Does OK job.</li>
    <li> I discovered this when I visited Seoul, South Korea and bought one. It has a subtle scent and non-greasy and works really good on my skin. Since this usually ships from Korea, I place my order before I use up my jar so I will never run out of it.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness... this cream is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Note: - There is alcohol on this.&lt;br /&gt;  -There is a scent (kinda rosey and mild, but smells great and I don&#x27;t mind.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination and sensitive skin, and based on past experience of using cheap products, I would usually avoid all products that have alcohol on it. But I&#x27;ve been SO satisfied with this product so far! Using the spatula that&#x27;s part of the package, I swipe some and put on little dab spots, then spread it all over my face. Very little of this product goes a long way! My skin feels so soft!!! :) Perfect for a day and night cream!</li>
    <li> UPDATE AT BOTTOM!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. Its super light and moisturizes perfectly. I have oily combination skin... I recommend this to anyone with a face. Its cooling because its a gel moisturizer. I can&#x27;t praise it enough, I had a sample told my sister how much I loved it, she bought it and now I am forced to steal some from her. (hopefully she won&#x27;t notice)&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE:***&lt;br /&gt;I may have to go on a search for a new moisturizer. I have used this for about 2-4 years now. I loved the gel consistency loves the smell how it made my skin feel. Unfortunately something they added to it makes it ball up when I apply makeup. I mean i can dust the peeling moisturizer off but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to. This has been the case with my last 2 bottles of it. What a bummer.  I hate when companies reformulate something great.</li>
    <li> I thought the product was pretty good, it smells very nice and the price is pretty reasonable. The product worked very nicely; made my face very smooth</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! Nature Republic hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. I just tried this because I have combination to oily skin. But sometimes in the winter my face gets  a bit dry. This is the perfect moisturizer for that! I use only a little bit in the morning before I put on my make up and night after I wash my face. IT ALSO SMELLS LIKE A BED OF FLOWERS!!!!!! :D&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if you have combination or oily skin, this does not make your face greasy, and its quality product for the price. :)</li>
    <li> It has a nice refreshing smell, and i love using this during the winter, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily yet it keeps your face moisturized. I have a large area on my cheeks that had a lot of blemishes and acne, however after using this along with Nature Republic&#x27;s Aloe gel, and Mizon&#x27;s snail recovery my blemishes are slowly going away and also the acne is under control. I even notice some scars fading out!</li>
    <li> My favorite one in the collection with a fresh, unisex scent.  I have been using this moisture cream for years and it never lets me down. I got 3 at a great deal!</li>
    <li> I first tried this out after I bought it from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;It was my first moisturizer and I really loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited for this one to go on sale for a while and finally bought 2 when they were 13-14 dollars each.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I didn&#x27;t like it as much as I first did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-smells nice&lt;br /&gt;-keeps my skin moisturized&lt;br /&gt;-close to the price I paid in Korea (10 dollars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s almost been a month and I&#x27;m close to finishing the jar&lt;br /&gt;-my skin gets oily again pretty quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what I learned from this is that I have oily skin and not combination. I will continue to buy this product, but in the one for oily skin rather than combination. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this, wait for it to drop to 13 dollars because it drops every month or so.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream. I love the texture of it and how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product! First fell in love with it in Hawaii when I purchased it from the Waikiki Nature Republic store. Glad I can buy it from someone legit and that actually ships from Korea. Shipping was faster than expected. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Feels good worth the price</li>
