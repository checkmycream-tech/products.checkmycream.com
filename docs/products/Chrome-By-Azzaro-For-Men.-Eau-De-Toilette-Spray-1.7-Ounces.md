      <li>/&gt;It is not very strong or overwhelming.</li>
      <li>bought it on Amazon for more than half the price....</li>
      <li>Goes on a little strong, but mellows out.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>it is a HUGE bottle that should last him a really long time.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of this cologne especially in the summertime.</li>
      <li>Apparently this is one of the top sellers in my local perfume stores, but for me it&#x27;s just an above average cologne.</li>

<li> Smelled this at a local clothing store &amp; it was too expensive....</li>
<li> Believe me with this selection you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> Love this scent for my husband.  Great price and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance. Goes on a little strong, but mellows out.&lt;br /&gt;Also has good lasting power.&lt;br /&gt;I just give one squirt. That&#x27;s plenty.&lt;br /&gt;The women haven&#x27;t exactly been falling over themselves to make any comments. LOL!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice cologne.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands Favorite cologne. It has a very manly citrus scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle usually lasts my husband over a year because unlike women, men only use a spray or two.&lt;br /&gt;If you were to buy this same bottle in a department store your looking at $40-$50 for this size. So it is a Huge bargain buying it on here.</li>
    <li> Chrome is my favorite fragrance for men. It has very refreshing and lingering citrus notes which I absolutely love on my man. Its great for both day time as well as night wear. Very attractive and not loud. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> Was not real! You can see the marks on the cap from the seller pulling off the cap and glueing it back on. Also the azzaro contact info on the box was scratched off.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t spend the money, buy it in a store safer and easier&lt;br /&gt;But it still smells good just watered down</li>
    <li> Arrived as described and smells great, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> I got this for a reason unrelated to wanting to smell good, but I have gotten so many good comments about it from the fairer sex that I wear it whenever I am able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a bit pricey, but Chrome is apparently worth the money.</li>

    <li> The fragrance is light and airy and reminds you of spring/ summer. Everyone who comes into contact with me loves how it smells and always asks what it is. Azzaro Chrome is one of my favorite fragrances of all time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne. It works excellent with my body chemistry. My wife love the way the scent smells as well.</li>
    <li> One of several that I use. Chrome has a light &amp; fresh scent to it.</li>
    <li> Smelled this at a local clothing store &amp; it was too expensive....bought it on Amazon for more than half the price....</li>
    <li> I like it because it is very nice, but not cloying or gross like axe and other brands. Good price, but small bottle.</li>

    <li> very good item and seller</li>
    <li> this was purchased as a gift for a friend. It was not expensive (cheaper than in the store) and it smells great. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Brother got this for one of his Christmas presents. it is a HUGE bottle that should last him a really long time. After he opened it he said &amp;#34;this must have been pricey&amp;#34; and I thought to myself, if you only knew the good deal you can get on Amazon. I actually ended up buying a smaller bottle for myself to keep in my truck. Good smelling stuff!</li>
    <li> My husband smells fabulous. Recommend that you buy it.  Will buy it again.  Good for the price. Go ahead buy these.</li>
    <li> Delivered as scheduled.  I love this cologne on men.</li>
    <li> I order this item for my dad a week and three days ahead of father&#x27;s day. He didn&#x27;t get it on time like I was told but all and all he loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my father and we were both pleased with the scent. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, not musky, but is still masculine. That being said-a little goes a long way. Don&#x27;t bathe in it guys, just a spritz or two and you&#x27;re golden. A great alternative to the traditional colognes. Branch out, try something new! Also of note-It arrived exactly on time.</li>
    <li> Gift for Christmas, he has not received yet. But was a recommendation my by son. Hopefully he will like it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my husband who loves it. Will reorder it in the future.</li>

    <li> Had lid tight and only used it a few times and when I went to use it it had all evaporated.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. That I had to buy my son his own because he finished half of my bottle. Been using chrome for about 10 or 12 years. It&#x27;s my favorite. It has a crisp musky smell that drives the ladies crazy. Believe me with this selection you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great, always getting compliments from it. Try it!</li>
    <li> I got this cologne for my husband on the recommendation of a friend.  It&#x27;s great, I love the way it smells, and he does too.</li>
