### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This conditioner moisturizes well and also leaves a wonderful smell to your hair.</li>
      <li>The best in the west</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve therefore found that if I use this on the ends of my hair, it&#x27;s a wonderful conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I asked him what he thought about this conditioner, and he said that it was probably the best he&#x27;d ever tried.  </li>
      <li>All the products in this line are excellent.  </li>
      <li>Best conditioner ever!</li>
      <li>Since I have this one though, I am quite happy to use it on my ends.</li>
      <li>The shampoo that goes along with this is also a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>So figure 4.5 stars, splitting the difference between my expectations on the frizzy, and her joy in the shine.</li>
      <li>I though that the end result would be great.</li>
      <li>and I got great results.</li>
      <li>This conditioner in combination with the shampoo works great for my hair.</li>
      <li>and it smells great and not over whelming...</li>
      <li>This conditioner works great for me though.</li>
      <li>In combination with the shampoo, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells good, worked well at detangling my hair and way the product is dispensed from the bottom is a great design.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does smell good and rinse well, but there are no benefits to using it.</li>
      <li>... good.</li>
      <li>So, conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m used to about 4 days of good hair and then 4 days of fighting with it until I wash it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, despite having a not to impressed outlook, this conditioner turned out to be a fantastic find</li>
      <li>In fact, I noticed a difference after just one use-and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been really good</li>
      <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good scent&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells so good.  </li>
      <li>love the smell, too!  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s great if you have fine hair that needs that lift.</li>
      <li>best thing is the summer has been very hot and humid and most conditioners leave my hair flyaway.</li>
      <li>Love the stuff, smells really good too</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and did seem to nourish my hair and make it shine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the scent is nice - it smells like shea butter of course -</li>
      <li>The fragrances of coconut and shea butter seem to stand out the most, but in a good way.  </li>
      <li>The color was enhanced nicely too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Her hair does look good, and it&#x27;s been easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>These ingredients promote a great clean feeling and a nice refreshing smell once the product is washed out of one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>It washes out well (better than the shampoo) and leaves my hair smelling nice (my wife loves it).</li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s a perfect conditioner, and we will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This conditioner is pleasant, in fact it is what I think clean should be.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice, and not too strong.</li>
      <li>Was very smooth looking, it made me check the bottle to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using bodywash.</li>
      <li>I need to use a whole lot of it to get any kind of good detangling and softening/conditioning.</li>
      <li>Shipping was okay.</li>
      <li>I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture.</li>
      <li>Love the smell also.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is okay.</li>
      <li>so glad I can get it on here - love the scent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought it, and I look forward to using it again and reordering once I&#x27;m out.</li>
      <li>combed nice and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>at all I love it</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wash it every day or it would be more on the fried side.</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon this brand by accident but am glad I did.</li>
      <li>more than met both of our expectations.  </li>
      <li>and this one is even better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The consistency of the conditioner is okay</li>
      <li>product however was much better.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I then started using this conditioner (not the shampoo) and am in love.</li>
      <li>first thing I noticed is the pleasant coconut scent which may be overpowering if you don&#x27;t care for a lot of scent, which I do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smell was great, which was a plus; but since this is a shampoo geared towards a \\&quot;clear\\&quot; scalp, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations with regard to the aesthetics of her hair after blow drying.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and beautiful</li>
      <li>Her hair was soft, shiny, looked beautiful.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky, the slip is great</li>
      <li>I love the way it made my hair feel soft and smooth, also the smell is great.</li>
      <li>I got this Clear Scalp with the matching shampoo, and am quite happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Great product shipped very quickly in individual bags, I was pleased with my orders, I also love the smell and quality</li>
      <li>My hair was still nice and fresh on that in between day.  </li>
      <li>and I could tell my hair was easy to manage afterwards.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair that doesn&#x27;t take well to conditioner, so I saved this [[ASIN:B007RTR9E2</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it made my hair look unwashed and greasy.</li>
      <li>So I ended up rewashing my hair that same day with Garnier Triple Nutrition which I LOVE LOVE LOVE and would recommend to anyone!</li>
      <li>has a light shea butter smell to it but not over powering.</li>
      <li>Even on the second day, my hair still looked great.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner just doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair, which is supposed to be one of the primary purposes of a conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair feels very moist rise and amazing.</li>
      <li>At night it smells good still and so soft to the touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It really does what it says it will do!!!</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance, while pleasant, is a bit strong and persistent to me.</li>
      <li>This conditioner balances out my strong shampoo nicely and it makes my hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited to have found this line.</li>
      <li>The lather is rich and plentiful.</li>
      <li>Familiar with this product.</li>
      <li>He also mentioned that many products he&#x27;d tried did not result in the manageability he had purchased the product for in the first place.  </li>
      <li>Rich texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first discovered this product in my favorite &amp;#34;big box store&amp;#34; but they stopped carrying it.  </li>
      <li>[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]  and had wonderful results.  </li>
      <li>My hair and head feel utterly clean after using it.</li>
      <li>My hair always feels squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
      <li>Especially important was the fact that it did not dry out his hair or scalp, but he mentioned that he also liked the way it made his hair feel, even when using it on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>awesome stuff but hard to find in the stores</li>
      <li>This product cleanses just as good as WEN and gives my hair back its strength.</li>
      <li>The product itself its a thick pearly liquid, which smells wonderfully nutty.</li>
      <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is good enough to recommend.</li>
      <li>Not the greatest on fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall for the price I am happy with this conditioner and will continue to use it in a rotation with other conditioners that work well for my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff but hard to find in the stores so glad I can get it on here - love the scent</li>
    <li> Good Conditioning results but not good enough for here in Afghanistan.  However, nothing seems to work here.  I think the product would work well in the U.S.</li>
    <li> I use this for the first time last night with the shampoo and I got great results. Again my hair is extra thick and very coarse. I love the way it made my hair feel soft and smooth, also the smell is great. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it because this was my first time using it but I don&#x27;t think I will have anything bad to say because anything that makes my hair feel and look like this is a keeper... Love the smell also. Again I think Clear Ultra Shea is for ethnic hair .</li>
    <li> this product does really make my hair feel very soft and smell sooo... good.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with hair issues for some time.  I first discovered this product in my favorite &amp;#34;big box store&amp;#34; but they stopped carrying it.  Of course I checked my favorite online store and without fail, Amazon had it!!!  This product makes my problem hair grow.  After using my hair is soft and hydrated. I pair with the shampoo.  I will never stop using this shampoo/conditioner.  I just hope Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt softer or manageable, and helps keep my dry, curly hair moisturized as well... So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> We have four types of hair in our home- baby fine and wavy, medium fine and straight, coarse oily and wavy, and dry brittle and wavy with color treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying the Clear Scalp Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, I expected greasy useless performance, but in once case I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the first three types of hair did not fare too well with the conditioner (too heavy and weighed down), the dry brittle wavy color treated hair does beautifully with this conditioner.  When using various shampoo with it, this conditioner left the hair beautifully shiny, soft, and very curly and wavy.  The color was enhanced nicely too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, despite having a not to impressed outlook, this conditioner turned out to be a fantastic find and I know at least one person in our household will be using it until it is gone and most likely repurchasing too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also like the way the container is made.  It stands up straight, does not leak, and dispenses the conditioner just right.  The scent is fresh and fruity/herbal very reminiscent of a high end brand which works well too.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that doesn&#x27;t take well to conditioner, so I saved this [[ASIN:B007RTR9E2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] for my teenage granddaughter to test drive during her August vacation with Grandma.  Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly, straightened, blow dried, often frizzy and a different color just about every week.  Straight off the plane her hair looked about like so much straw on her head, badly in need of some intensive repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference in her hair was striking, right from the very first use - soft, smooth, no frizz.  Even her drastically split ends were nowhere near as apparent.  Needless to say, she raved about this conditioner - so much so that I&#x27;m going to have to order a year&#x27;s supply to drag across the pond to the UK when I go to visit this fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try for your problem hair.</li>
    <li> I have problem hair. There&#x27;s all kinds of textures in it, from thin and silky to fried and crinkled. I can&#x27;t wash it every day or it would be more on the fried side. Also, as I&#x27;ve aged, my scalp has started to dry out. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have dandruff every day, but I *can* have some if I end up itchy right before I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did itch less with this conditioner. In fact, I&#x27;ve been trying all sorts of conditioners since I ran out of this, and I also went back to my old conditioner, but nothing has worked to both moisturize my hair and calm that \\&quot;need to wash my hair\\&quot; scalp itch. I thought it would end up drying my hair out further, but I used it about a month, and that didn&#x27;t happen. So, I&#x27;m sold on it, and if you have some scalp itch, I think it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
    <li> My main problem with this line of products is how thick both shampoos and conditioners are, to the extent that it&#x27;s hard to squeeze them out of the bottle. As for other qualities, it&#x27;s just ok for my hair. This conditioner just doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair, which is supposed to be one of the primary purposes of a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Helps my hair.  I have wave and tight curls along with burn damage. This conditioner in combination with the shampoo works great for my hair. Yes, I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this because it is not pricey, it makes my hair soft and it smells hmmmm..The best in the west</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and beautiful</li>
    <li> I have fine thin, dirty blond hair. Normal &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner combinations leave my hair greasy and gross but my hair will still feel dry and in despite need of help. After I found this shampoo/conditioner, I have never used anything else. Moisturizes without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy. My hair is soft to touch and feels healthy. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t give me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also has a light shea butter smell to it but not over powering. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I stopped using WEN and started using this product because when made my hair too soft and weak. This product cleanses just as good as WEN and gives my hair back its strength. I still use my WEN deep conditioner twice a week. I prefer the golden Shea type over the other purple-ish &#x27;Clear&#x27; conditioner but only available online, not in stores for some reason.</li>
    <li> The Clear Scalp Ultra Shea conditioner leaves my hair soft without feeling oily. My hair is pretty thin and I normally shave my head, but for the last few weeks, I had been letting it grow. In combination with the shampoo, this is a great product. It washes out well (better than the shampoo) and leaves my hair smelling nice (my wife loves it). I don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so I think this will last me quite a while, even with my wife using it. My wife also loves it, and she has very long hair, while not as thin as mine, it is by no means thick. This is good enough to recommend.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is okay. Was very smooth looking, it made me check the bottle to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using bodywash. It has a nice smell and did seem to nourish my hair and make it shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; brand conditioners. Like the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and the scent is not too bad, but I prefer the scents of the non-shea conditoners they have.  The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, to give my hair a chance to get used it it, and see how it works. My hair and head feel utterly clean after using it. I work in a restaurant, and some days come home sweating and gross, so I need something that&#x27;ll be like an industrial cleaner on my head. This stuff does that well. My hair always feels squeaky clean. However, I find that if I don&#x27;t follow up immediately with a deep conditioner, my hair tends to feel rather light and dry. That&#x27;s great if you have fine hair that needs that lift. When you have thick hair, it turns into a giant &#x27;fro, and is not cute. The smell is nice, and not too strong. The lather is rich and plentiful.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product to test it out because I read up on it and it sounded like a good new shampoo and conditioner and thinking the Clear Ultra Shea Shampoo and Conditioner would nourish my scalp, lock moisture in my hair, smooth, and seal as it says on the container it would do, turns out it does the complete opposite the shampoo stripped my hair. After shampooing my hair was hard, tangled, and dry feelong. Then I thought maybe the conditioner will help my hair so I put the conditioner in and it did NOTHING, my hair was so tangled, no kind of moisture what so ever to it, my hair was extremely dry and tangled and was very hard to detangle even after applying the conditioner. So I ended up rewashing my hair that same day with Garnier Triple Nutrition which I LOVE LOVE LOVE and would recommend to anyone! I will never ever ever buy this Clear Ultra Shea or recommend to anybody you would be better off buying some Suave shampoo and conditioner than this mess. I am very upset that I have two almost full bottles of this shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s going in the trash unless I find somebody that likes it that I know.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells good, worked well at detangling my hair and way the product is dispensed from the bottom is a great design. That said, my hair felt dried out and scalp irritated after using it and I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I got ULTRA SHEA SMOOTH &amp; NOURISH CONDITIONER mainly for my roommate, who complained to me recently that he has tried many, many conditioners and found that they either dry out his hair or dry out his scalp, or both.  He also mentioned that many products he&#x27;d tried did not result in the manageability he had purchased the product for in the first place.  So, when Amazon offered this product, I decided to try it for our bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for me, I do not have the type of hair that really needs a conditioner.  My hair is normally soft and manageable, no matter what the weather or how often I wash it, which is usually daily.  Still, I do like to use a conditioner every ten days or so, just to keep my hair feeling the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, ULTRA SHEA SMOOTH &amp; NOURISH CONDITIONER more than met both of our expectations.  My roommate is a professional actor, who needs to have a consistent appearance and wants to make sure he looks exactly the same day after day, especially when making a film or doing a long stretch in a theatre piece.  I asked him what he thought about this conditioner, and he said that it was probably the best he&#x27;d ever tried.  Especially important was the fact that it did not dry out his hair or scalp, but he mentioned that he also liked the way it made his hair feel, even when using it on a daily basis.  As for me, I have no complaint at all; the odor is agreeable and it leaves my hair feeling even more silky than usual.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s a perfect conditioner, and we will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This Clear Ultra Shea Conditioner does a good job at moisturizing hair and has a very pleasant scent, but using it more than two or three times a week leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling unpleasantly \\&quot;coated\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was used in conjunction with [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]], which does work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I have to put this conditioner on three times before my hair isn&#x27;t tangled.  I thought conditioner was supposed to un-tangle your hair but I found that the first couple times I put this on my hair it&#x27;s tangled when it hadn&#x27;t previously been that way.  After applying it three times the tangles are almost gone (I have short thick hair) and my hair feels soft and silky.  Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough at once, but I put on the same amount I normally use of a conditioner.  It seems a little watery to me but not so much that it drips off my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is the pleasant coconut scent which may be overpowering if you don&#x27;t care for a lot of scent, which I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Shampoo, but I much prefer the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner which works much better on my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner along with the matching shampoo[[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]for a 2-week period in order to give it time to \\&quot;work\\&quot;. It is a light conditioner (feels more like lotion), and leaves my hair feeling heavy and drab. I am giving it 3 stars because I think it has potential of working on a different kind of hair (I have very fine, straight hair), and it has a non-offensive scent.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> Love the stuff, smells really good too</li>
    <li> My hair is very prone to dryness. I use to layer 3 different leave in conditioning treatments to keep my hair from drying out between washes. And that only bought me a few days. If I wash my hair too often it starts to shred so I wash it every 7-10 days. So I&#x27;m used to about 4 days of good hair and then 4 days of fighting with it until I wash it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not a problem with this conditioner. It leaves my hair really soft (which also makes it easier to straighten) and my hair is shiny and healthy and bouncy until I wash it again. I&#x27;m really excited to have found this line. The shampoo that goes along with this is also a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I would say this is probably just for really dry hair, though the shampoo can be used on anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp. This conditioner works great for me though. (Dry hair/Dandruff prone.)</li>
    <li> I decided to get this product for my daughter who struggles with dandruff, since we had such success using the men&#x27;s version of this same product for my son.  Smell was great, which was a plus; but since this is a shampoo geared towards a \\&quot;clear\\&quot; scalp, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations with regard to the aesthetics of her hair after blow drying.  BOY was I wrong.  Her hair was soft, shiny, looked beautiful.  This is an added advantage to the obvious...which is resolving the dandruff problem, as the product appears to have also done.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with this shampoo line for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-DYB</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd conditioner from CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR that I have tried recently.  The first one didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, the second was an improvement and I continue to use it and this one is even better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this conditioner I have been using it every other day for close to two weeks.  If I use it daily it makes my hair to oily, but on the other schedule it leaves it soft and feeling moisturized.  It rinses well and also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, which is good for my naturally curly hair.  Additionally I have had less problem with frizziness which is great here in the Northwest. One last note is I do like the smell of it; although because it rinses well it doesn&#x27;t linger as much on my hair as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price I am happy with this conditioner and will continue to use it in a rotation with other conditioners that work well for my hair.</li>
    <li> I began using this product four weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I have thrown out or given away all the other products I used. My hair is stronger and is so soft. I color and relax my hair and since using the breakage is healing and my hair is increasingly sheeding less. I use the damage and color repair along with the ultra shea products and I am sold out for this product!!! Try it you won&#x27;t regret it. It really does what it says it will do!!!</li>
    <li> I mean I was really excited to use this. I don&#x27;t actually wash my hair myself-i&#x27;m no good at it. So I took both the [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] and the conditioner to my salon and I really felt the difference. I get deep condition and It was light and I could tell my hair was easy to manage afterwards. I&#x27;m really glad I bought it, and I look forward to using it again and reordering once I&#x27;m out. My favorite Shampoo and conditioner so far.</li>
    <li> I ADORE this conditioner for my wavy, coarse, color-treated hair. The smell is pleasant, has a thick viscosity, plus it has an anti-dandruff element. I consume about four bottles a month, as each time I use a large handful. I find this product even better than Shea Moisture conditioner, and I have been using Clear Shea Conditioner for about a year now.</li>
    <li> I had already tried two Clear Scalp &amp; Hair products and was less than impressed with the results.  In fact, I noticed a difference after just one use-and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product however was much better.  The conditioner helped restore the moisture that the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Moisture shampoo had striped away.  I also used the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp &amp; Hair Oil which added a lot of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone with long hair (long hair is old hair-the closer to the scalp the younger the hair), curly hair or thick &amp; coarse hair because the shea butter adds the moisture that your hair needs but it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or weighed down.  If you have thin or fine hair I would try a volumizing formula instead.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for two weeks now. I am very picky about conditioner. I have very long and fine hair that tends to be dry and flyaway at times. This conditioner moisturizes well and also leaves a wonderful smell to your hair. I have noticed it is east to comb my hair when I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is the summer has been very hot and humid and most conditioners leave my hair flyaway. The moisture this provides leaves my hair soft and not flyaway. At night it smells good still and so soft to the touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it with [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]. The shampoo does not clean my hair well but the conditioner does wonders. I might try another shampoo to go with the conditioner since it works so well.</li>
    <li> I wash my long hair every night, and have to use a conditioner, without fail!  I got this Clear Scalp with the matching shampoo, and am quite happy with it.  My hair ends up totally soft and totally tangle free.  That&#x27;s all I ask from a conditioner.  Oh, it also can&#x27;t have a heavy perfume smell, because that gives me headaches.  This one has a slight perfume scent, and it doesn&#x27;t linger, so that works.</li>
    <li> This has been used by my daughter for the last week. She has dry, curly hair, very thick, medium coarse and past shoulder length. She&#x27;s been using it with the matching shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected with it&#x27;s description that it would be really moisturizing for her hair type. It&#x27;s been conditioning it, but not quite as well as expected. Her hair does look good, and it&#x27;s been easy to comb through. It&#x27;s still prone to some frizzing even after a week of using it following the instructions every day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing a build up on her hair and I do like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it, she likes the scent, the shape of the bottle, and how shiny her hair looks. So figure 4.5 stars, splitting the difference between my expectations on the frizzy, and her joy in the shine.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my hair. I&#x27;m mixed with African American in Dominican so I have relaxed hair that gets pretty kinky in between. this stuff made my hair very soft very manageable and not greasy at all. I def think its geared  more towards African American hair because the stuff in it definitely is stuff hair like ours needs. My hair feels very moist rise and amazing. It also has helped my split ends tremendously. I would definitely recommend this product if you have hair type like mine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if a selfish in stores yet I&#x27;ve checked in a lot of places but I haven&#x27;t checked in Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;Also I should mention that usually shea butter ways down my hair a lot but this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to do that at all I love it</li>
    <li> Great product shipped very quickly in individual bags, I was pleased with my orders, I also love the smell and quality</li>
    <li> This conditioner is pleasant, in fact it is what I think clean should be.  I used this conditioner with its \\&quot;partner\\&quot; [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]  and had wonderful results.  The conditioner, as the shampoo, has a cordial blend of ingredients such as shea butter, sunflower, coconut and almond, to list a few.  These ingredients promote a great clean feeling and a nice refreshing smell once the product is washed out of one&#x27;s hair.  The fragrances of coconut and shea butter seem to stand out the most, but in a good way.  Overall, this is a wonderful product that left my hair (and my bathroom) feeling refreshed and clean.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I need to wash my hair daily because it tends to get oily, and when I used it daily it worked great.  I decided to give it a day in between washes to see how this product would hold up, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn&#x27;t need it daily after all!  My hair was still nice and fresh on that in between day.  I think I will continue using this conditioner on a regular basis now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, too!  It smells so good.  Not overpoweringly so, either.  The container is essentially upside down, with the lid on the bottom.  I really liked this because I feel I&#x27;m getting every last drop out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes well and my usually hard to comb wet hair combed nice and smoothly.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great product at a decent price.</li>
    <li> This review is for Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ Shampoo]] &amp; [[ASIN:B007RTR9E2 Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third of the clear scalp and hair beauty products that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if there&#x27;s any difference between them. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and suddenly think \\&quot;Wow! This product brings out all of the potential my hair has ever had!\\&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t bad. My biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me. It reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a perm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t so bad that I won&#x27;t eventually finish the bottle, but it&#x27;s not something I plan on purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed is that it smells quite a bit like suntan lotion.  Thankfully the smell went away as soon as I rinsed my hair.  This is a fairly thick conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair (which is shoulder-length and color-treated).  In all, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a difference between this conditioner and others that I&#x27;ve tried.  Considering that Clear is an inexpensive line, this one will do just as well for me.  I don&#x27;t really like that it opens on the bottom though.</li>
    <li> Made my hair way to oily.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good scent&lt;br /&gt;- Rich texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- After a month or two I&#x27;ve started noticing some odd smell in my bathroom, I think this conditioner does not age well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t say that my hair felt different comparing to other hair products, but then again that&#x27;s very rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Nice product as a refresher, but you&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
    <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy Ultra Shea conditioner provides a lot of moisture. I found it to be very heavy on my hair though. If I used it all the way up to my roots and scalp, it was too thick and wouldn&#x27;t rinse out. I have fine hair and it made my hair look unwashed and greasy. I had to wash with shampoo again to get it out. However, my ends are damaged looking and this conditioner improved their appearance. I&#x27;ve therefore found that if I use this on the ends of my hair, it&#x27;s a wonderful conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant. It smells like a salon conditioner and the scent of the shea butter is evident in the product. It goes on thick, like a cream. My favorite part about all the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy products I&#x27;ve tried though, has got to be the container. The conditioner comes out at the bottom when the opening it popped, like a toggle switch. It&#x27;s stored with the opening at the bottom, with a nice large and flat base, and gravity pulls the product to the opening. The amount wasted in minimized, giving me more bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I&#x27;d prefer a conditioner that was lighter so I could use it all over. Since I have this one though, I am quite happy to use it on my ends. It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> used the conditioner after using the Clear Scalp shampoo and I was pleased with the results.  Even on the second day, my hair still looked great.  But I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance, while pleasant, is a bit strong and persistent to me. If you like a lasting fragrance, then I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is good for processed or very dry curly hair.  If you are going to be in the sun, this is very nourishing.  Not the greatest on fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Familiar with this product. I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture. It leaves my hair soft and silky, the slip is great and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Little or no tangles and it smells great and not over whelming...</li>
    <li> All the products in this line are excellent.  I order all of the Ultra Shea line for my daughter, who has coarse, dry hair and I have purchased much more expensive products that did not come close to delivering the quality and result these products do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe this conditioner was not right for my type of hair (curly), but it was too heavy and my hair was just lifeless. The product itself its a thick pearly liquid, which smells wonderfully nutty. When I washed my hair it felt like it was extremely soft and I though that the end result would be great. I have curly hair which needs hydration so I thought this would work, but it made my curls just drag. I used the shampoo of the same kind with it for a month, then gave up, going back to my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different Clear shampoos and conditioners and so far, I have not liked any of them particularly well. This one is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the scent is nice - it smells like shea butter of course - it just doesn&#x27;t perform well for me. I need to use a whole lot of it to get any kind of good detangling and softening/conditioning. After I shampoo, I add conditioner, comb it through with a wide tooth comb and then put my hair up in a clip with the conditioner still in my hair, while I wash my body. So, conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so. With this conditioner, I felt like I had to use so many heaping piles of it to get just a tad bit of detangling action. Once I rinse it out, it almost feels like I never even used conditioner. Most of the time I use my other conditioner (Infusium23 or Redken Extreme) after rinsing this Clear one out. If not, I use a leave in because my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized or soft enough after using the Clear. My hair is not particularly rough or damaged, so I shouldn&#x27;t really need to use so much. I definitely don&#x27;t need to use as much when using my regular brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good and rinse well, but there are no benefits to using it. It also does not seem to coat or weigh my hair down, but again no other benefits. I need a conditioner to help me detangle and soften my hair - things a conditioner typically does - this one just doesn&#x27;t do any of that for me.</li>
    <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce. Shipping was okay. I would buy this again. I would recommend this product. I use it with the shampoo.  Price is similar t o what they have in stores.</li>
    <li> As African American (Jamaican) it just seems like there&#x27;s no product out there for my texture hair. Anyway after using Pantene for the past 5 years or so I saw the commercial on TV the other day for this product and decided to try it. It&#x27;s been really good so far- better than Pantene. My hair feels more clean and moisturized after using and have definitely seen less breakage. I bought the entire set.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this brand by accident but am glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now. I started off with the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy shampoo for dandruff, but it did not work for me. I then started using this conditioner (not the shampoo) and am in love. I have very long, medium-thick hair that is very oily and must be washed daily or my roots look wet (yeah, gross). I have always struggled to find a conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft, and not leave a residue behind. Well this is the first conditioner that has done that for me. I should explain that I have to use T-Gel shampoo because I have an extremely itchy scalp, and that is why I do not use the shampoo to go with this conditioner. This conditioner balances out my strong shampoo nicely and it makes my hair extremely soft and shiny. I will most likely never use a different product, as long as this one keeps working so well.</li>
