      <li>Great shampoo and will buy again.</li>
      <li>I have blond frizzy hair and this works great along with the conditioner and the hair oil.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Smells great and cleans hair nicely!</li>
      <li>But they smelled really good and the name of the products sounded moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>and I have noticed an amazing change in my hair.</li>
      <li>It is really nice for damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>So far, the best products I have found are: 1) shampoo:</li>
      <li>and I was so happy to see it on amazon at a much cheaper price!</li>

      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love diamond oil and this shampoo does not disappoint.</li>
      <li>Its like magic in a bottle.</li>
      <li>my hair is nicer and more manageable, but still....</li>
      <li>Well, it was ok, but NO miracle.</li>
      <li>I also use the 10 minute miracle mask with this product when I have been straightening/curling my hair more during some weeks on my hair.</li>
      <li>It has become softer and responds better to styles.</li>
      <li>10/1/16: Please note that the price of the product on this listing has more than DOUBLED since I purchased and wrote this review.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>My hair went from dry and damaged to moist and happy without being greecy!!</li>
      <li>I use it on my 4 year old and its been great for her hair as well.</li>
      <li>so nice to have found this wonderful shampoo that has brought my very damaged hair back to life with shine and manageability right away!</li>
      <li>First, I blended warm apricot and coconut oils, massaged them into my scalp, leaving them on overnight, one or two nights per week.</li>
      <li>I guess this was fine</li>
      <li>Diamond oil shampoo,and oil for hair is fantastic</li>
      <li>Fast results!!!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the Diamond</li>
      <li>Full disclosure: I purchased the Redken Diamond Shine shampoo and conditioner at a salon, not Amazon, and I should have listened to my hair dresser when she said she was &amp;#34;not impressed&amp;#34; with these products before I tried them.</li>
      <li>It is not bad</li>
      <li>was as promised and sent out quickly.</li>
      <li>Oil-- probably because my hair can get oily quickly, it wasn&#x27;t something that I needed.  </li>
      <li>Cleans very well,..gives that squeaky clean feel.</li>
      <li>I have to wash my hair every day because its very oily and with diamond oil its not oily that quickly...</li>
      <li>(so it&#x27;s the first thing to get absorbed instead of chlorine water) and I use a special cap that is nearly leak-proof called &amp;#34;My Cap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Diva</li>
      <li>I really love this shampoo but in my opinion overly &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll go back to using the color protect Redken which has a milder smell.</li>
      <li>My hair is So soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I get even MORE compliments on it than I did when I was years younger.  </li>
      <li>Nexxus Therape, 2) conditioner: either Redken Butter Silk (which used to be Butter Treat and was better back then but is still okay) or Nexxus Oil Conditioner (which can actually get a bit too oily for me), and 3)</li>
      <li>I purchased it and I am not sorry.</li>
      <li>That eliminated the scaly gunk, but everyday was still a battle with itching and dryness, not to mention my hair becoming unruly and simply uncooperative after decades of wearing it in the same cut and style best for my hair type.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very soft and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>Works great - leaves hair soft and not weighed down -- I don&#x27;t even need condition when I use this because it&#x27;s so mourturizing.</li>
      <li>:) Another tip that might be helpful: Before I go into chlorine, I coat my dry hair in coconut oil</li>
      <li>This shampoo works very nicely, especially on my color-treated, fine, thinning, wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all; it really dries out my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products and this is fantastic, especially with the Diamond Oil Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I woudlnt buy whole bottle.</li>
      <li>After shampooing with Diamond Oil, I put on Sebastian Potion #9 lightly, then blow dry and curl with hot curlers</li>
      <li>If you have other kinds of hair or circumstances, maybe it will perform better for you.</li>
      <li>some is not, my hair is also very dry and gets build up easily.</li>
      <li>It is great for coarse and or thick hair.</li>
      <li>At this Amazon price, assuming the product continues to be the genuine article, I&#x27;ll be a lifelong user.</li>
      <li>It was $12.95 at the time I purchased it only one year ago (but there is no inflation, right?).</li>
      <li>I learned of Diamond Oil in 2013 when a new hairdresser used it.</li>
      <li>Then, the new hairdresser used Diamond Oil on my hair, and that is ALL I&#x27;ve needed ever since.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>/&gt; The large bottle is a milky white liquid.</li>
      <li>(like I said, I&#x27;m old).</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and color it.</li>
      <li>Makes my course/thick hair fairly soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>And to my beloved, though angry, daughter-in-law, I have to say &amp;#34;Get over it.</li>
      <li>Actually, there are lots of protein sprays that seem to work fine, such as a brand called &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; and others, as long as your hair gets protein.</li>
      <li>The small bottle contents was a clear liquid with what looked like fine glitter in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, but not limp, and shiny, and my scalp is given needed extra oil that lasts for two days between shampoos.</li>
      <li>I tried also blue clear moisturize.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin, fragile hair and am a swimmer, so I need high moisture.</li>
      <li>These products go on sale several times a year in salons for half price, so shop smart!</li>
      <li>Having oily hair as a young woman, then normal since mid-forties, I believe that the use of minoxidil in my 50&#x27;s caused the extreme dryness of my hair and scalp, suddenly reaching a breaking point when one&#x27;s scalp dries out naturally later in life.  </li>
      <li>I have tried countless products over the past 30 years and am always looking for new products that will infuse moisture in case my current products get discontinued (after so much work finding them).</li>
      <li>At the time, I was experiencing dry, itchy, scaly scalp, something quite new for me since reaching the age of 60, in addition to the natural thinning of hair due to age.</li>
      <li>Other than having to deal with a bit of wiry, gray hair, nowadays, my scalp and hair are back to normal.</li>

    <li> I have a ton of thick, wiry hair, some is wavy some is not, my hair is also very dry and gets build up easily. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products and this is fantastic, especially with the Diamond Oil Conditioner. No build up and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> Smells great and cleans hair nicely! My hair is soft and shiny! I use it with the conditioner that also is great! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I buy it on Amazon because it is a little cheaper than anywhere else. I have starting using this since I dye my hair blonde on a regular basis. It keeps my hair from drying out and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! Fast results!!!</li>
    <li> The Redken Diamond line is phenominal.  My hair is So soft and smooth. I use the conditioner as well.  My hair has never felt healthier.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo. I purchased it and I am not sorry. I have blond frizzy hair and this works great along with the conditioner and the hair oil. I would recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> so nice to have found this wonderful shampoo that has brought my very damaged hair back to life with shine and manageability right away!</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all; it really dries out my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was in horrible shape because of washing it in well water.  I had been looking through all of Redken&#x27;s products because I mostly only use Redken&#x27;s.  I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the Diamond Oil-- probably because my hair can get oily quickly, it wasn&#x27;t something that I needed.  I finally went ahead and tried it and now I want the conditioner too.  It is really nice for damaged hair.  I don&#x27;t color my hair so I can&#x27;t comment on how colorfast it is.</li>
    <li> The girl who cuts my hair recommended this and I was so happy to see it on amazon at a much cheaper price! Works great - leaves hair soft and not weighed down -- I don&#x27;t even need condition when I use this because it&#x27;s so mourturizing. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great product for my long hair, and great value/size.  Wish it came with a pump, but that&#x27;s a minor thing.</li>
    <li> Makes my course/thick hair fairly soft and shiny. It is not bad but I personally prefer Redken Magnetics.</li>
    <li> was highly recommended but seems chemically compared to my usual shampoo</li>
    <li> Redken makes great hair products, but this is one of their best. Leaves my hair very soft and rinses clean. Best shampoo I have used in years.</li>
    <li> Seller mis-packaged shampoo. U.S.P.S. added $0.65 postage due.  Forcing us to go all the way to the postal annex to pay for and pick up the item.&lt;br /&gt;Item was as promised and sent out quickly.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I purchased the Redken Diamond Shine shampoo and conditioner at a salon, not Amazon, and I should have listened to my hair dresser when she said she was &amp;#34;not impressed&amp;#34; with these products before I tried them. But they smelled really good and the name of the products sounded moisturizing. I have fine, thin, fragile hair and am a swimmer, so I need high moisture. If you have other kinds of hair or circumstances, maybe it will perform better for you. Unfortunately, the products were damaging and not hydrating/moisturizing for my hair--the shampoo stripped moisture out of my hair and the conditioner had little effect to put it back in. It only took one shampoo to see and feel the effects. I have tried countless products over the past 30 years and am always looking for new products that will infuse moisture in case my current products get discontinued (after so much work finding them). So far, the best products I have found are: 1) shampoo: Nexxus Therape, 2) conditioner: either Redken Butter Silk (which used to be Butter Treat and was better back then but is still okay) or Nexxus Oil Conditioner (which can actually get a bit too oily for me), and 3) Redken Anti-Snap protein spray (a leave-in product). Actually, there are lots of protein sprays that seem to work fine, such as a brand called &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; and others, as long as your hair gets protein.

After the swim, I rinse my hair out with conditioner only (if I don&#x27;t have to go to work) or wash, condition, and protein spray if I do have to go to work. I hope this info is helpful because I had spent years struggling with balding and breaking hair before learning this routine through painful trial and error (as well as lots of lost money on hair care products). I finally have reliable hair growth and shine.  Thank you for sharing any additional info you might have about products and experiences as well. --Julietto work) or wash, condition, and protein spray if I do have to go to work.

    <li> I chose this rating because this shampoo is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair shiny and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser also recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> Different from smaller bottle. The small bottle contents was a clear liquid with what looked like fine glitter in it.&lt;br /&gt; The large bottle is a milky white liquid. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in quality yet.</li>
    <li> Verified with my angry hairdresser daughter-in-law that this is the REAL Redken product. She was angry, naturally, that I didn&#x27;t purchase it from her in her upscale salon for double the price. Oh well.  I learned of Diamond Oil in 2013 when a new hairdresser used it. At the time, I was experiencing dry, itchy, scaly scalp, something quite new for me since reaching the age of 60, in addition to the natural thinning of hair due to age. Having oily hair as a young woman, then normal since mid-forties, I believe that the use of minoxidil in my 50&#x27;s caused the extreme dryness of my hair and scalp, suddenly reaching a breaking point when one&#x27;s scalp dries out naturally later in life.  First, I blended warm apricot and coconut oils, massaged them into my scalp, leaving them on overnight, one or two nights per week. That eliminated the scaly gunk, but everyday was still a battle with itching and dryness, not to mention my hair becoming unruly and simply uncooperative after decades of wearing it in the same cut and style best for my hair type.  Then, the new hairdresser used Diamond Oil on my hair, and that is ALL I&#x27;ve needed ever since. I still use oils every now and then in the dead of winter when everything is dry, but this shampoo is really what changed everything. I have never needed a conditioner due to having oily hair, and with Diamond Oil, I still don&#x27;t. It leaves my hair soft, but not limp, and shiny, and my scalp is given needed extra oil that lasts for two days between shampoos. After shampooing with Diamond Oil, I put on Sebastian Potion #9 lightly, then blow dry and curl with hot curlers (like I said, I&#x27;m old). Other than having to deal with a bit of wiry, gray hair, nowadays, my scalp and hair are back to normal. I get even MORE compliments on it than I did when I was years younger.  At this Amazon price, assuming the product continues to be the genuine article, I&#x27;ll be a lifelong user. And to my beloved, though angry, daughter-in-law, I have to say &amp;#34;Get over it. I&#x27;m never paying those inflated prices for even Redken shampoo!&amp;#34;  Update 10/1/16: Please note that the price of the product on this listing has more than DOUBLED since I purchased and wrote this review. It was $12.95 at the time I purchased it only one year ago (but there is no inflation, right?). Please disregard my review regarding price since I simply would not purchase this again from Amazon at the current price. These products go on sale several times a year in salons for half price, so shop smart!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very nicely, especially on my color-treated, fine, thinning, wavy hair.  I would recommend this for anyone who colors their hair and suffers the effects that coloring can result in.</li>
    <li> I have been just using both the Conditioner and Shampoo and I have noticed an amazing change in my hair. It has become softer and responds better to styles. Some of my crazy frizz has gone away and it overall has a shine I haven&#x27;t seen in ages. I started to use on occasion the sample I have for the Shatterproof Diamond Oil and its been helping with my split ends. I plan to buy the bottle and give it a shot for the month. I also use the 10 minute miracle mask with this product when I have been straightening/curling my hair more during some weeks on my hair. Its been helping to making up for any damage that it costs.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every line from redken. I started with blonde glam but that dried my hair out.  My hair was brighter and nicer but it was too dry. Then I tried volume line. That didnt help at all. I tried also blue clear moisturize. I havent noticed any change either. Then I ordered sample of red line for color treated hair. Well, it was ok, but NO miracle. I woudlnt buy whole bottle. I ended up with blue line for damaged hair. I guess this was fine my hair is nicer and more manageable, but still.... I was looking for some miracle. FINALLY, I found it it DIAMOND LINE !!! this is the best. I have to wash my hair every day because its very oily and with diamond oil its not oily that quickly... LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Its like magic in a bottle. My hair went from dry and damaged to moist and happy without being greecy!! I use it on my 4 year old and its been great for her hair as well. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Unbelievable how shiny it leaves my hair even if I skipped a day shampooing.a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I came across this product by mistake and what a surprise.I have natural curly hair and color it.Diamond oil shampoo,and oil for hair is fantastic</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo for my color-treated hair.  It smells wonderful and it cleans my hair thoroughly.  It has a great lather and keeps my hair color in longer inbetween touch-ups.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great - I love diamond oil and this shampoo does not disappoint. It is great for coarse and or thick hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo but in my opinion overly &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll go back to using the color protect Redken which has a milder smell.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo!  Cleans very well,..gives that squeaky clean feel.</li>
