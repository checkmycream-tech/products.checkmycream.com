    <li> I&#x27;ve waited for so many years to find a brush for acrylic that wouldn&#x27;t gather product and get all clumpy. Found it! The bristles in this thing are excellent! It&#x27;s well-made and fits easily in the hand. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressure as the bristles are the proper stiffness. I absolutely adore this brush. If I ever have to replace it, I&#x27;ll get another one just like it. (20 years experience)</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent brush but there&#x27;s no metal cover like on the picture for it so I will give it 4 stars</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great price and beautiful brush. Definitely recommend this to any nail technician or at home user. Excited to put it to work!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this brush for her acrylic applications. She is self taught from videos online, we bought all the products from various websites and some practice fingers.

    <li> I ordered the brush to replace one that I had before for several years.  It is not exactly the same but it is a very nice brush.  It did not come the the silver cover as shown in the pic.  A picture was requested of what was received but I have don&#x27;t have a camera.  I still like the brush!</li>
