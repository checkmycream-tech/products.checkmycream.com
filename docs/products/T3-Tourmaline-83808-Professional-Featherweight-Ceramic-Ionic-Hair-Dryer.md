      <li>and I am very, very satisfied with the results!</li>
      <li>Works great and because my wife and daughter fight over it I bought another one.  </li>
      <li>now I think (going with an authorized dealer), but I was really happy with this dryer.</li>
      <li>fly away hairs as well.</li>
      <li>In the beginning you notice the shine which was great</li>
      <li>The product is great............</li>
      <li>My wife says it works great.</li>
      <li>anyway I&#x27;m happy to say I lucked out with a great mixture of both</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>It looks great.</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for, great blow dryer.</li>
      <li>She was so happy, I remember it.</li>
      <li>my hair is in great shape since switching to it.</li>
      <li>it was a really great hair dryer</li>
      <li>This dryer will do a great job on your hair.  </li>
      <li>Well, I have used it twice myself and, yes, it really is a great hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>its a great blow dryer</li>
      <li>It was great, but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working, as they do.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
      <li>From the reviews it would appear that the product used to be good and some  customers were happy with it like the stylist that recommended the dryer to me</li>
      <li>He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  </li>
      <li>In sum, the Babyliss ProTT is an excellent product,  a much better choice than the T3.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it!!!!</li>
      <li>It is a good hairdryer</li>
      <li>you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>After being swayed by the reveiws here and getting wise to the warranty situation, I made a point of purchasing this product in a nearby beauty supply store who is an authorized seller and thought I was getting a bargain at $125.</li>
      <li>She commented that she loved it.</li>
      <li>I bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment.  </li>
      <li>Loved the styling of it with the bling on the handle.  </li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>others I&#x27;m about to detail that it is a superior product to the T3.</li>
      <li>so it was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair, the glowing remarks about the T3 are written by people with wavy hair that tends to frizz.  </li>
      <li>I have loved this dryer and the technology it uses.  </li>
      <li>But she was very impressed and happy to finally have a great dryer for her hair.</li>
      <li>We would be more than happy, however, to make an exception and bend our rules a bit to accommodate the replacement of your product.</li>
      <li>I love this hairdryer, so lightweight and my hair is great.  </li>
      <li>But, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before.</li>
      <li>My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before.</li>
      <li>It takes up most of my time but not anymore!</li>
      <li>and I would end up with something between frizz and more frizz!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer!  </li>
      <li>I love both of them!</li>
      <li>Boy am I glad I did!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Someone recommended this one to me and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really liked the lightweight aspect but the heat control stopped working on all of them including the travel version.</li>
      <li>Souhe said it was something she really wanted and the price was wonderful.</li>
      <li>I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>Best investment you can make and really is lightweight.</li>
      <li>she loved color,and shape, but most reason is my birthday gift.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>I saw all of the magazine reviews (In Style&#x27;s Best Buy list, 2005, Allure, etc.), and being the product whore that I am, I was REALLY tempted when I saw that AMAZON.com had it for $159 (plus free shipping and no tax!)  </li>
      <li>This dryer is great for getting the job done quickly and to make your hair look better (without that frizzy, burned</li>
      <li>My whole curly-haired family has tryed the Tourmaline and loved it!</li>
      <li>When I first started using it, it worked great.  </li>
      <li>It is a  very good product so far, but it is not the T3 I ordered.</li>
      <li>Another great thing about this dryer is that if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day a quick shot in the morning will refresh it as if you have a fresh blow out!  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read closer, if the wattage was noted, and purchase a more high-powered dryer.  </li>
      <li>I am impressed that it does make such a difference.</li>
      <li>I used this hair dryer at my friends place and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to read the instructions...</li>
      <li>Perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo (I recommend Bumble and Bumble or Paul Mitchell) and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Original review: I have had so much trouble getting my hair to look nice, even with great products and great hair cuts.</li>
      <li>I am also impressed with the low noise feature.</li>
      <li>I have a Solano that I also love</li>
      <li>I know that is authentic</li>
      <li>but so are most $20 hairdryers.  </li>
      <li>However, I used it one more time and the breakers blew and the dryer stopped working all together.</li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny and healthy (no longer has the \\&quot;burned\\&quot;, over processed look).  </li>
      <li>Also I love my featherweight during the two weeks</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how light this thing is!</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>, one more thing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I agree with another user:   Seemed to work OK at first although I didn&#x27;t notice much improvment in speed of drying. It is lightweight and easy to handle -- but it is hotter than I&#x27;m used to. After 6 months, my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine. My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before. My hair stylist noticed it and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong. After about 9 months, I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again. Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me, and costly!     This comment above sums it up for me as well.  In the beginning you notice the shine which was great but after a few months I started to notice that my hair was losing it&#x27;s shine and bounce.  I now went back to my old blow dryer that I had in storage and my hair is bouncy again and the shine is coming back slowly but surely.  I believe this blow dryer doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types.  My hair is semi curly.      Darlene</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  But she was very impressed and happy to finally have a great dryer for her hair.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer works great and has really cut down on drying time.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  I have definitely notices less fly away hairs as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One caution - If you want to register this product for the warranty, you cannot.  Amazon.com apparently is not an authorized seller.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the T3 Tourmaline II dryer and had great expectations.  My hair came out exactly the same as with my cheapo hair dryer I bought for $19.99.  I would think after paying out $149 plus shipping for a blow dryer I would have noticed a difference.  Nothing different.  I expected my hair to come out with a salon look and I got the same flat hair no matter how much time I spent on styling my hair.  I have short, layered hair and thought this dryer would add some volume but nothing changed.  Luckily I have a 30 day return policy so I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund.  Save yourself the shipping cost and buy something else.</li>
    <li> This is the second T3 I have purchased, the second was for a gift.  It dries your hair fast.  Saves a lot of time.  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> Mine lasted 7 years.  I really liked it.  Loved the styling of it with the bling on the handle.  It was quick and did feel more gentle on my hair vs. a standard dryer (and that is why I bought it).  I did think it possibly made my hair a little bit less shiny and less buoyant compared to a traditional dryer, though I cannot say that for sure, as I no longer have one to compare.  The first thing to go was the cord (started splitting after only a year or two--patched with electrical tape).  Then the plug/fuse started literally coming apart at the seam around year 6.  It lasted 1 more year of sporadic use and finally ended in a sparky bang.  Literally.  I was sad to see it go.  The motor and body of the hairdryer are still in great shape, despite many trips and several moves.  I will upgrade to the T3 Luxe2i now I think (going with an authorized dealer), but I was really happy with this dryer.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have below shoulder length hair.  This dryer definitely makes a difference in drying time.  I even got one in the travel size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this particular dryer of Bespoke Labs and I am very, very satisfied with the results! I&#x27;ve decided to purchase it because cuts down drying time tremendously. I had another ionic dryer and its nothing compare to professional T3. My hair does feel dry at all, no breakage, no frizz. The engineering is fantastic! It does what it claims. I can stay this company creates TRUE CERAMIC, TRUE TOURMALINE composed items. I have relaxed hair and I hate drying it. It takes up most of my time but not anymore! I used the low setting with a nylon bristle brush and I could believe it, flat shiny moist hair. And when used the my flat irons, it straighten very fast--a breeze. Users stay they burn out quickly but it produces salon results each time over. You&#x27;ve already saved hundreds of dollars compared to the times used in total. I will be purchasing their flat irons/ curling irons. I am Bespoke brand loyal now! Then won me over!</li>
    <li> After much urging from my wife, she bit the bullet and spent the extra money on this dryer.  When it was working (little less than a year), she was happy.  When it stopped working, well, not so much.  And it&#x27;s not as though you can repair these things.  They have no user-serviceable parts, outside of the little grill that your wife&#x27;s hair accumulates in.  Don&#x27;t buy the hype, and don&#x27;t buy this dryer.  You can buy 8 or 9 hair dryers that will work just as well and cost less combined, and die off just as quickly, or maybe even not as quickly if you&#x27;re lucky.  Why spend the extra money on something that doesn&#x27;t offer anything extra?</li>
    <li> I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working.  This is my second T3 hairdryer.  My first one lasted two years.  It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer the only problem is, it is very dangerous after a couple of years it started to shoot flames, and now it just blows cold air.  My hair dresser also has one of these blowdryers and while she was blow drying a clients hair the blow dryer caught fire yes caught fire so this blow dryer seems to have a defect it can not be that two blow dryers caught fire.  Other than that its a great blow dryer</li>
    <li> Addendum: I am editing this review to say this hairdryer actually damaged my hair badly, causing split ends like I have never had before. So, if you have the type of hair that is prone to split ends, don&#x27;t get this hairdryer. It is too hot. I subsequently bought a babybliss and it works great too, costs less, and didn&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I have had so much trouble getting my hair to look nice, even with great products and great hair cuts. I never even thought that the dryer would make a difference. I don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t occur to me but when my last blowdryer died I asked around to see if anyone \\&quot;loved\\&quot; theirs, since I have never had one that I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone recommended this one to me and it&#x27;s amazing. I feel like I finally figured out the secret to great looking hair. I guess it depends on your hair type since some people had the opposite experience. I have a lot of  fine wavy hair that is layered and falls just below my shoulders. It used to take forever to dry it because there is so much of it. Now it takes about 10 minutes, max and comes out really soft, shiny and well styled. Every day now I look like I just walked out of the salon. People at work keep asking me if I got my hair cut because it looks so different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about this \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot; business. I got mine from Amazon and it had a serial number. I sent in the registration for the two year warranty it comes with and I have not heard yay or nay yet, but really, even if I have to buy another one I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I have found are that 1. the air coming out of it gets HOT and if you are sensitive, that might bother you and 2. the on/off switch is very easy to turn off while I am using the dryer which is annoying.</li>
    <li> This only lasted 6 months.  When I reported the problem to their customer care, this was there response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Feb 24, 2015, at 2:43 PM, Haircare &amp;#60;Haircare@t3micro.com&amp;#62; wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Morning Joseph,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terra Beauty/Amazon.com is not an authorized reseller of T3 products and would not be covered under the warranty.

    <li> I love this hairdryer, so lightweight and my hair is great.  It really does make a difference to have a great hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife who has just longer than shoulder length, thick hair. She really loves it!</li>
    <li> After doing some research I decided to purchase the T3 Tourmaline 83808 from Best Beauty Buy.  I was impressed with Best Beauty Buy&#x27;s excellent customer service and quick shipping!! So far the T3 has been worth the money as my hair dries faster and is smoother as well! Also, the \\&quot;drying sound\\&quot; is pleasant and not overly loud.</li>
    <li> The biggest waste of money I&#x27;ve ever spent. This drier has to be a fake t3 because I&#x27;ve used a t3 for many years and loved it. This drier however gets hot enough, but there&#x27;s absolutely no power behind it to blow dry the hair. Essentially it&#x27;s just barely blowing while heating up my hair. My hair takes forever to dry with this thing and after its finally dry it&#x27;s a frizzy mess. This company seems dishonest as well because in the box there was a large piece of paper stating that they&#x27;ll give a lifetime warranty if I give a good review! So they&#x27;re not standing by their product but instead they&#x27;re essentially trying to pay me to lie! I&#x27;m sorry, but I have to be honest and the drier is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I have the t3 featherweight after 3 years it lost power and I was told by my hairstylist to send it back to company.  I did but didnt think they would do anything because I didnt have receipt. Two weeks later I received a brand new dryer I am very impressed by how they stand behind their product.  Also I love my featherweight during the two weeks gone I used my daughters hairdryer, it took me twice as long to blow dry and it was all frizzy.  My T3 is fast and leaves my hair very smooth.  Worth the money if you have very curly thick unruly hair!</li>
    <li> The product is great............but the company wouldn&#x27;t let me register for the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized dealer.  Didn&#x27;t know that when I made the purchase.  Now I&#x27;m on my own, and screwed if the product breaks down!!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how fast this dryer drys my hair which is very thick.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking frizzy which my regular dryer did.  I only have one complaint and that&#x27;s with the on/off switch - it&#x27;s a toggle switch right in middle of handle so when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair straight w/a brush, which requires hand to adjust dryer, I keep hitting the switch off w/ my hand.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that the company would not honor the 4 year guarantee because I got this on Amazon.  They said it was not a qualified seller.  Amazon should also tell buyers that if you purchase this item on Amazon, the company will not honor the 4 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I had been lusting after a T3 forever because of all the rave reviews and finally got one for Christmas.  I&#x27;m really sad to say that I&#x27;m disappointed and am going back to my ionic hairdryer from Sharper Image. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the glowing remarks about the T3 are written by people with wavy hair that tends to frizz.  My hair is long, straight, and shiny, and I blow dry every day for volume.  After using it, my hair was shiny, but very limp.  I&#x27;ve given up after several tries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The T3 is light, quiet, and looks nice, but I agree with another reviewer regarding the design.  When I use it, I tend to knock the switch into the \\&quot;off\\&quot; position because it&#x27;s right where I grip the handle.  Also, the air flow feels very weak to me, which is not really what I need when I&#x27;m trying to volumize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is great product for some people, but if you have straight hair, you should save the $150 (or save someone else the money).</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for my wife birthday gift. she loved color,and shape, but most reason is my birthday gift. She was so happy, I remember it. &lt;br /&gt;You know, now after year, this is the most scared thing. When she uses it everyday, it comes out sparkles from inside. It is so dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;Such a exprensive item who can easily throw away. &lt;br /&gt;When I bought it, I read the description, it looked like amazon is authorized dealer or seller. I have no idea.....? fix it or throw away. &lt;br /&gt;Now she complain \\&quot;how you spened that much money for this?\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;I am not good husband now. &lt;br /&gt;Think about my situation amazon associates and future buyer. &lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> This dryer will do a great job on your hair.  It dries it quickly, while decreasing frizz and increasing shine.  However, I have now had two of these dryers and each one died after a little over a year due to poor design.  The way the cord enters into the dryer it is not stable and will constantly move around until the wires break and your dryer quits working.  Needless to say, I will not buy a third one... $400 down the drain in two years was quite enough!</li>
    <li> Love hairdryer. my hair is in great shape since switching to it. the only thing that i wish it had was a hot/warm setting in addition to the high/low</li>
    <li> A product that really lives up to all the hype for once?????? Could it be true??? YES!!!!  I was SO skeptical about this product, especially since it retails for $200!!! I saw all of the magazine reviews (In Style&#x27;s Best Buy list, 2005, Allure, etc.), and being the product whore that I am, I was REALLY tempted when I saw that AMAZON.com had it for $159 (plus free shipping and no tax!)  So, I gave it a try.  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to live up to all of the hype. Well, I have used it three times now and I am AMAZED!!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.) I really does dry your hair in half the time.  &lt;br /&gt;2.) My hair really did look and feel healthier!!  &lt;br /&gt;3.) I can&#x27;t believe how light this thing is! It feels like a toy!!!  &lt;br /&gt;4.) It&#x27;s SO QUIET, and  &lt;br /&gt;5.) It does all this without getting hot and making me hot!!! Sometimes after a shower and then blow-drying my hair, I swear I need another shower my bathroom gets so hot. Not with this baby!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!!! It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that I always blow-dry straight. I have paid $300 for hairdryers bought in beauty supply stores...they were so heavy and loud. I was very skeptical to spend more money on yet another dryer, I am so glad I finally did! &lt;br /&gt;This dryer is magic. My drying time went from 45min to 15-NO JOKE. My arm never hurts anymore and I am never getting too hot.  &lt;br /&gt;I have 0 frizz and it really does make hair shinny. It looks a lot better after 15min now than it ever did with my old 45min drying time. I get compliments on my hair all the time... &lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews, but I had to get the word out on this exceptional dryer. BUY IT!! :)</li>
    <li> I was going to order a T3 from Amazon but after reading the reviews that the manufacturer would not honor the warranty I ordered a Bio Ionic Whisper Light from Amazon for $173.  Works great and because my wife and daughter fight over it I bought another one.  It has a 5 year warranty that WILL be honored.  If T3 wants to loose out on Amazon sales by being jerks about the warranty, let them.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to handle and placement of controls for on/off, cooling, etc. are comfortable to use.  Hair does seem to feel smoother.  My hair is extremely thick and takes a very long time to dry.  It does seem to shorten drying time a bit.  Because the dryer is lightweight it is not as tiresome to hold it as an older dryer.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! This dryer puts out little air and is so lame compared to my old Chi! Also, please beware: This company does not recognize Amazon as a real company. They will not allow you to register the dryer even though it has all the registration information and numbers. The company is not user friendly ... and, unfortunately, neither is the appliance! Stay away from the T3!!!!</li>
    <li> I believed the wonderful hype about this dryer. Still, there was one nagging review that said the hair dryer was breaking her hair. I ignored it. I hope you won&#x27;t.    The dryer seemed to make my hair dull. I could live with that. But I started to watch my hair get \\&quot;frizzy.\\&quot; I have wavy hair, and I live in a dry climate; no reason for frizz. But it wasn&#x27;t actually frizzy - it was actually all the broken ends frying into frizzle. I finally had to admit that the dryer was the problem and I went back to my nearly broken old dryer from 1995.     It will take a long time before my hair is grown out and the damage gone. Lots of nourishing hair products and lots of time. And I wasted so much money on a dryer that really hurt my hair. Too late for me, but if you haven&#x27;t bought it yet, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Two settings: low hot or high hot. It&#x27;s really featherweight. Quick drying time but the motor doesn&#x27;t sound as good as my old Italian made dryer. I wish I had tested it out in person first before buying I would return it but I got it for a song and don&#x27;t want to pay the shipping cost and 15% restocking fee. It&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight, quiet &amp; dries hair quickly. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> Over the past 2 years, I have purchased 4 different T3 blowdryers. I only dry my hair every other day and was expecting a much longer lifespan for this time of money. It did dry my hair quickly and left if shiny, so I kept returning to buy new ones when the prior would break down. This is ridiculous though! I&#x27;m done with t3... Off to find a higher quality product that will last more than 6 months!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is light weight and easy to use. It really cuts down on the static and dryness. Overall, worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer but it dosen&#x27;t dry your hair any faster than any other dryer it&#x27;s just hype, so if you looking for a shorter drying time then look somewhere else, but this dryer does make your hair super soft, softer than any other dryer that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried several brands, over all I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> No other hair dryer could touch the amazing job that this one does in half the time with no frizz! Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 3 months ago for my wife and according to her it really is not any better than the ionic hairdryer that you can buy at the drug store.  Yes it is lighter and dries hair a bit faster but besides that it does not work any miracles.  If I could, I would return it...it does not warrant the $200.00 that I paid for it..perhaps that&#x27;s why the price was lowered??</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer at my friends place and fell in love.  I showed up at Sephora expecting to pay $50 and saw that it was well over $200.  I bit the bullet and purchased it anyway and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  My hair has never been softer or shinier.  In fact, it&#x27;s improved over just towel drying.  Yes, it dries faster and is lighter, but as a male this was a less critical issue.  I really love how it leaves my hair soft, easily manageable (no static), and healthy.  Last week I bought one for my mom and more people are getting them for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on a blow dryer and then have it not live up to its claims, but I have to say I am delighted!  My long, curly hair was dry in 7 minutes,  and was soft and not frizzy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace another professional dryer I had.  I was so surprised at how light and quiet it is!  When I first opened the box, I didnt think it was going to work as well as it claimed because it felt like a toy. But, I am very pleased with the results.  It dries my hair faster, my arm doesnt get tired because its SO light, I can still hear my house phone ring because its so quiet, and it stays cool to the touch so you wont burn yourself. It will even straighten dry hair (for those mornings when you need a touch-up.) My whole curly-haired family has tryed the Tourmaline and loved it!</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the warranty (see below for original review).  I contacted Amazon and they said they will honor the warranty even if the manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t.  Way to go Amazon!      This is from the email I received from Amazon:    \\&quot;Thank you for writing to Amazon.com with your concern.    I&#x27;m sorry for the inconvenience that you have experienced with this order.    Rest assured that we will honor the terms of the warranty for this product, even if the manufacturer does not.    Thanks for shopping at Amazon.com.\\&quot;    This is my orginal review:    I love the dryer, however there is a problem with the warranty.

    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like to invest in hair products/items that are this expensive, so I thought I would ask for it from my boyfriend on Valentine&#x27;s Day. He bought me both the Featherweight hair dryer and the wet and dry narrow flat iron from t3. I love both of them! The hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes (when it is wet from the shower)- I have asian hair so I can say that drying my hair isn&#x27;t always a positive experience. However, if you dry your hair with the hot option first (doing the layers), then on the low option for the roots of your hair, and finishing with a blast of cool air all over, you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable.  &lt;br /&gt;After using my t3 hair dryer, I don&#x27;t know how I could not have it. Now, I want to get the overnight dryer. However, here is a warning. DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES! If you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair, a hair dryer will not fix that. Perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo (I recommend Bumble and Bumble or Paul Mitchell) and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon. This dryer is great for getting the job done quickly and to make your hair look better (without that frizzy, burned look that other hair dryers give you).</li>
    <li> My experiences with this hairdryer and this company are X4.  I purchased two sets of two hair dryers for my daughters for Christmas.  Each set had a travel size and a full size hair dryer.  They were $200.+  for each set.  At the time I made this purchase, reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years.  Within 6 months, both travel size dryers were no longer working.  They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.  Comapny wouldn&#x27;t return a phone call or answer an email.  I tried many times for 3 months, finally giving up and calling the seller (QVC).  I really didn&#x27;t expect them to do anything after 15 months, ( and they didn&#x27;t), but I wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch.  They are still selling them, so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere.  DON&#x27;T BUY T3 brand products!!!</li>
    <li> This dryer has been the best thing for my fine, thin, wavy color treated hair.  Where my cheapo conair would fry the ends so much I was constantly having to get it cut, using the T3 since July has actually enabled me to grow my hair about 2 inches longer than it&#x27;s ever been able to grow.  Even my stylist has noticed a marked improvement in the condition of my hair.    Unfortunately, something happened to it while I was using it this moring, an internal piece broke off and is now rattling around inside, making the dryer unusable. I&#x27;m waiting to see if Discount Jungle or Amazon will honor the warranty, since the thing&#x27;s not even a year old, but if I have to replace it myself I guess I\\&quot;m just going to suck it up and go to Sephora to get the real thing.  What else can I do, this is the only dryer I&#x27;ve ever had that didn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
    <li> The dryer broke after 3 months and the company won&#x27;t honor the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized seller.  But the company told me that for a mere \\&quot;54.95\\&quot; they will bend the rules replace it for me.  Steer clear.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer because of a recommendations from a stylist. She commented that she loved it. Before purchasing it, I read the reviews. Some were happy ,some complained about the dryer lasting a few days. Well, that is what happened to me. Upon receiving the dryer I noticed that it did not had temperature control. So I decided to return it since I did not like the lack of that feature. The company was eager to collaborate and refund the money to me even without asking me to return it. I was surprised and said to myself, wow this company is really different  from others, in terms of customer service. However, I used it one more time and the breakers blew and the dryer stopped working all together. The dryer lasted exactly three days. From the moment I received it to the moment  it stopped working. I was happy that I initiated the return earlier without me than knowing this unfortunate circumstance  might happened. I believed this product does not have a good quality control from the manufacturer, since more of one review complained about the same. From the reviews it would appear that the product used to be good and some  customers were happy with it like the stylist that recommended the dryer to me but  now it looks that quality fell very very low.</li>
    <li> I bought this T3 blow dryer over a year ago and just this morning had a failure with it.  I have loved this dryer and the technology it uses.  I contacted Best Buy Beauty this morning and they are replacing my dryer.  Great customer service!  Thank you Jennifer Cavanagh</li>
    <li> I must say the price is quite reasonable for a hair dryer using crushed tourmalines to produce tourmaline ions. But I have rather fincky hair. They only like saphire ions. I much prefer the S3 Saphire II 83707 Pro hair dryer. My hair comes out shiny and lustrous. However, I find the T3 is OK for my cats after a bath.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of spending so much on a hair dryer.  After reading the great reviews, I figured I would give it a try and hope for the best. I was so eager to try it this morning that I didn&#x27;t even let my hair partially air dry like I normally do!!  I have never \\&quot;timed\\&quot; how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn&#x27;t hit well enough with the dryer.  My husband even commented that my hair looked pretty today (I didn&#x27;t tell him I bought a new dryer!!!!)</li>
    <li> Strangely, the company does not recognize the bar code.  Hence they refuse to warranty the product.  I think that we paid a high price for a knock-off.  I am not pleased with amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed my T3 dryer, and so far has lived up to being very quiet and fast drying. Was disappointed to find out that T3 would not accept the serial number for registration, as it was not legitimate. So I don&#x27;t know if my dryer is a fake or not.....</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item with great hopes.  It is a good hairdryer BUT...imagine my surprise when T3 Micro Inc. refused to honor the warranty because I purchased this item from amazon.com.  Their response to me and I quote...\\&quot;We cannont guarantee the authenticity of this item and our generous warranty would not be viable if if we couldn&#x27;t verify the shipping and handing of our products.  Damage can be incurred as these items pass through many hands.  To protect ourselves and our customers, we want a direct line from our factory to our distributor (amazon is not approved evidently).\\&quot;  Stephen Gwin, T3Micro Inc.  steve@t3tourmaline.com\\&quot;  This thing goes on to suggest that Amazon should guarantee their product!!  I think that paying $150 for a hairdryer and then being told that amazon.com is not an acceptable vendor of their product is absurd.    Why are their products being sold on a reputable website such as Amazon if they will not guarantee them.  This is completely unacceptable.  I am angry at this company and will NEVER PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN.  I also have been letting all my girlfriends and collegues know about this situation so they don&#x27;t make the same mistake.  LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> This lightweight dryer did dry my hair quickly.  I usually don&#x27;t heat process my hair because it is time consuming.  I had nice dry hair in under 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if my hair was any glossier, but it didn&#x27;t feel dried out.</li>
    <li> Was very skeptical about buying a hair dyer that is expensive but it does do the job more quickly than the lower priced hair dryers. It is also lightweight and does not dry your hair out.</li>
    <li> Nice light weight hair dryer...........but had to return it because there is only ONE heat setting&lt;br /&gt;and that one is hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my wife who told me that she read it was a really great hair dryer and she wanted one.  Well, I have used it twice myself and, yes, it really is a great hair dryer.  She uses it to straighten her curly hair and it does a terrific job, making it soft and frizz-free.  In that I have curly hair also, I decided to try it and  was surprised when it also straightened my hair.  We have purchased other expensive hair dryers and this one is far and away the best.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the product. However, having purchased it from Amazon.com, T3 will not allow me to register my product for future warranty because they claim Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer. For such an expensive every day product, a warranty would be nice to have in case anything were to go wrong. I received an email from T3 and a call back both confirming that they do not consider Amazon.com an authorized dealer. When I called Amazon, they had never heard of such a thing. Amazon.com offered to exchange my featherweight tourmaline dryer with another but that did not resolve my issue. I cannot get my T3 Tourmaline Featherweight 83808 hair dryer covered by T3&#x27;s warranty because it was purchased through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work OK at first although I didn&#x27;t notice much improvment in speed of drying. It is lightweight and easy to handle -- but it is hotter than I&#x27;m used to. After 6 months, my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine. My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before. My hair stylist noticed it and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong. After about 9 months, I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again. Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me, and costly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference between blowdryer and my $15 conair dryer. My hair did not dry any faster, and it is just as frizzy.</li>
    <li> Okay, long hair girls - DONT CUT YOUR HAIR!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was seriously considering it, I had enough of the 30 min. drying time and then I figured why not try this blow dryer.  WOW, first time I bought something that was true to its claim, took me 10 min. to dry my hair instead of the usual 30 min., not kidding.  Best investment you can make and really is lightweight.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I have any complaints about the way this product works. My expectations have been met. However, I was very disappointed that they would not honor the warranty because they said that Amazon is not an authorized seller. When I paid $160.00 for a hair dryer, I hoped I could get a warranty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be the first one to confess that whenever something new comes out in the beauty market, i am eager to try it.  But even I was skeptical about the claims this hair dryer made. Plus, the price kept me in a pre-contemplative state for a long time.  Finally after talking to someone who actually owned and used the dryer, i decided to spring for it.  I have really curly, frizzy hair and it&#x27;s about 13 inches long.  If there is a drop of moisture in the air, I have to consider it a bad hair day.  Forget about blowing my hair straight.  When I first used this hair dryer, it was in the middle of July, sticky, and rainy outside.  Within 15 minutes (usually takes me 35 mintues for a blow out), i had blown my hair STRAIGHT!!!! and, it&#x27;s shiny too. Each section took about 2 minutes to complete.  It looks great. I don&#x27;t care about the technology, all I know is it works.  If you have had a lifetime of frizzy, unruly, dry or dull hair. Try this dryer.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars b/c it is prohibitively expensive and amazon is not considered an authorized dealer so I was not able to get the warranty either.  I have a Solano that I also love but it is really heavy and it does take much longer to make my hair presentable.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is not worth the money!  I bought it less than a year ago and not only is the claim \\&quot;cut your blowdrying time in half\\&quot; a lie, (it takes me 1 hr and 15 minutes to blowdry my hair), lately it has been blowing out cold air all of a sudden in the middle of my blowdrying session.  Also, if you don&#x27;t purchase from an \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot; your warranty will not be honored.  The t3 bespoke labs people don&#x27;t even have an official website!  This is a farce! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> Was pricey, but so far, it is much better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. Drys faster, feels smoother. I am impressed that it does make such a difference. I believe 5 stars are very rare, so really a 4 star is a good one. Just need to see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have had two T3 Tourmaline hair dryers and both has seriously dangerous wiring issues and caused electrical sparks and fire down the cord. I&#x27;m sending T3&#x27;s blow dryer to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the safety, but since that process takes time, I wanted to alert others of the extreme hazard of the T3 hair dryer.   I purchased a T3 hair dryer on Amazon (a purchase that can be verified). After using it for less than 8 months, it fired 6-8 inch red sparks when turned on. The sparks from the electrical fire extended a couple feet down the cord. I was lucky that my arm was outstretched and am thankful for not being electrocuted.  An isolated incident unrelated to the T3 dryer itself, you might think. Well, I did, and based on the glowing reviews, I replaced that T3 hair dryer with another one. At about the ten month point (last week), I turned on the dryer and a loud screeching noise erupted from dryer, giving off a terrible electrical fire smell, and blowing the fuse. I&#x27;m grateful that the dryer&#x27;s dangerous malfunction tripped the switch before being electrocuted.   The T3 dryers aren&#x27;t the only items I use in that outlet, which works perfectly fine for anything else (e.g., waterpik, hair iron, etc.). Nor was I around water when both of these T3 dryers basically exploded into electrical flames. I&#x27;m not a cat with nine lives, so two T3 hair dryers that threaten to be fatal was enough.   I contacted T3 with the limited information on their site, alerting the company and asking for their mailing address to return their consumer hair dryer to inspect for safety. They are suspiciously secretive about giving customers their mailing address, even when alerted to a potentially fatal product. The T3 company just sends template emails, with no contact person, name, or address, and demands to know the model number, date of purchase, where, and a whole laundry list of busy work for the customer to gather. This is in response to a request to send them one of theirproducts that is so seriously defective that it could be fatal.   Now, I don&#x27;t run a consumer products company, but if I was told a customer was nearly electrocuted and sparks are firing from my product, I&#x27;m pretty certain I&#x27;d be responsive, regardless of whether the dangerous item was black or white or purchased on Amazon or Sephora. Very shady in my view, prompting me to wonder if there are others who&#x27;ve experienced T3&#x27;s defective product and give up trying to contact the company.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment.  When I first started using it, it worked great.  I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards.  I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight (along with a round brush) and it did the job amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks.  This wasn&#x27;t even overused or anything.  In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it, I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week.  After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year.  In fact, for about 4 months out of that first year, I didn&#x27;t even use it right after I had my son.  That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn&#x27;t working properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.  I&#x27;m just glad and lucky that the sparks didn&#x27;t land on my hair and cause a fire or anything.</li>
    <li> Have had this dryer for about a year. When I first received it I was concerned that it did not seem to blow as hard as the dryer I had been using but it actually seems to dry my hair faster.</li>
    <li> If you have straight, shiny hair then don&#x27;t bother reading this review and stick with a cheaper hair dryer.  I have wavy hair that frizzes at the MENTION of humidity.  I was visiting a friend in Orlando recently (I hate going to Florida because the humidity makes my hair ugly) and used her T3 dryer.  When she told me months ago that she spent $200 on one of these hairdryers I thought she was nuts but kept my thoughts to myself.      I used this dryer and yes, it dried my hair faster and yes, my hair was straighter and shinier.  I have purchased one and will ask for the travel size for a holiday gift.  Sigh, I guess my days of using hotel hair dryers are over.......</li>
    <li> After being swayed by the reveiws here and getting wise to the warranty situation, I made a point of purchasing this product in a nearby beauty supply store who is an authorized seller and thought I was getting a bargain at $125. I bought it in the hopes of taming the huge, round, coarse frizzball sitting on my head.     Let me note for the skeptical that the product was brand new, unopened in the box and in obvious mint condition. It is an authentic T3 hairdryer. Yes, it dried faster, but left a noticeably dull, dry finish and seemed to strip my hair of it lustre. Not only that but I couldn&#x27;t get the ends of my hair to lie straight after they had already shriveled up in the fast drying process, and the more I struggled with the ends the more flyaway my hair became. And it appears to be MORE voluminous than ever - bigger and puffier and with the same amount of frizz, only duller looking.     I immediately plugged it out and plugged in my old, falling apart Babyliss Carerra (non-ionic) dryer and afer a few minutes managed to get the ends straight and see some lustre return. I agree completely with the reviewer who made the comment about losing the healthy shine.     I only hope I can get my money back. I will certainly try.     UPDATE - Comparison of T3 Tourmaline to less expensive Babyliss ProTT     though I couldn&#x27;t get my money back, I exchanged the T3 for a Babyliss ProTT 3000 Tourmaline dryer (I&#x27;d have stayed away from Tourmaline ionic infrared labels but apparently it&#x27;s all the rage and very difficult to find a nice lowtech one that doesn&#x27;t incorporate this technology).    Like the T3, the Babyliss is also really lightweight, dries as fast or faster than the T3, and has the added benefit of more heat settings - including medium, low, and high, as well as a cool shot, whereas the T3 only offers a high heat and low heat. The Babyliss has 1900 watts and the T3 has 1800. There are various models of the Bablyiss tourmaline, but this model was at the lower end of theprice range at $89, and you can get it on Amazon for about $20 less.    It is for the above reasons and others I&#x27;m about to detail that it is a superior product to the T3. Not only does it cost much less but the Babyliss gave my hair a soft, lustrous, shiny smooth sheen and healthy texture, and did not leave it looking dried out and fried as the T3 did.    That said, I still experienced the same problem w/the Babyliss as with the T3-  it gives too much volume to my short, thick choppy layered hair and doesn&#x27;t allow me to straighten it at any heat setting. What I saved in drying time (easily fifteen minutes without sweating and straining my arm) I paid for dearly in styling time to try to get the full balloon-y volume to calm down and get the ends to lay flat.    In sum, I would strongly recommend saving your money on the T3 and buying the Babyliss if you want to see not merely identical but significantly improved functionality and performance over the more expensive T3 dryer. Yet I would still be less likely to recommend this or any other tourmaline-infused infrared dryer for people with very thick, voluminous hair that they want to take the poof out of and make straight, as that will likely not happen with this or similar units. As a final but very significant note on performance - the Babyliss toned down my frizz (and it&#x27;s a very rainy day today) by nearly 100 percent! Also I noticed very few dry flyaways as compared to the T3.    In sum, the Babyliss ProTT is an excellent product,  a much better choice than the T3. It is more economical, offers greater functionality and superior performance.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE !!!Be sure to purchase this dryer from the AUTHORIZED DEALER ONLY. This product might be a bit more expensive however it will save you hours of headaches and many dollars if you need to return the dryer within what you THINK is the warrentee period.  Only the authorized dealer will stand by the 48 month warrentee. The  dryer I purchased from Amazon broke before one year of use , it was NOT from an AUTHORIZED DEALER. I had a extremely hard time getting it replacemented. I was shuffeled back and forth between Amazon and the seller that provided Amazon the dryer; Glamor Beauty .  After many heated hours on the phone with both parties, Amazon did send me what I think is a new dryer.  It is not from an authorized dealer so I&#x27;m not sure how long this one will last.</li>
    <li> I does not have a difuser, but is a very lite and comfortable grip. Leaves your hair shinny. Like it.</li>
    <li> When I tried to register the item for warranty, I received a responce from manufacturer that they could not give me warranty because I purchased the item from uncertified seller (i.e. amazon.com).  Also, there was no tag with a serial number on the cord, as it was indicated in a note about warranty.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is the second hair dryer that I received from you and this one is not any better. I believe you are selling inferior or refurbished products. If that is the case, you have no right to sell a product that is coming off as brand new. Tourmaline refused to warranty this product because the tag that is attached to the cord indicating the bar code is missing. It was missing on the other hair dryer also. I now spent $129 on a dryer that hopefully won&#x27;t break and if it does, it needs to be thrown out. I purchased as a gift for my daughter the \\&quot;original\\&quot; and spent the $180 for it. I know that is authentic and it dries the hair without any frizz. I can&#x27;t say the same for this.  I find this a tremendous disappointment and will never purchase from amazon.com again. I am appalled that you are passing old equipment as new.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these hair dryers and I love what it does for my hair.  The difference between the T3 and my Remington is a salon quality blow out and my worst hair day.  Only problem, a year after I bought it, it quit working.  I may have gotten a knockoff.  Since I couldn&#x27;t register it, I&#x27;m screwed on the warranty and have to buy a new one.  I believe I probably got a defective one but for $50 more, buy one from Sephora where you can register it.  It&#x27;s worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great dryer! Drys hair quickly and leaves hair soft with out the frizzies! &lt;br /&gt;Great price shipped quickly with no shipping charges</li>
    <li> 2006:  Every year I buy a dryer. I spend at least 20 min. everyday drying my med. length frizzy brown hair.  One year ago I purchased this one for $200.(site unseen) based on the raves.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I usually look for a high wattage for extreme heat to tame my mane.  I turned this one on and it makes very little noise and seems to not put out alot of air.  To my pleasant surprise, it cut my drying time to 12 minutes and definitely reduced my frizzies!  I should note that I also use the T3 Ceramic Tourmaline Barrel Brushes also.  My hair looks shiny and healthy (no longer has the \\&quot;burned\\&quot;, over processed look).  It&#x27;s been 12 months and it&#x27;s still going strong - looks like I won&#x27;t need to buy another hair dryer for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing.  My college-age daughter \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; mine to try (she has straight black Asian hair), now she won&#x27;t go back to using her brand.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting her her-own T3 for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY COMMENTS FOUR YEARS LATER (2010): I ended up purchasing one of these for my daughter in 2008 (T3 model changed: white in color, Bespoke Labs).  It lasted one year then FIRE erupted from the grill end - lucky her hair didn&#x27;t catch fire.  My own original dryer (above) shorted-out after two years.  I replaced it with another T3 and had the shorted-one repaired to keep as a back-up.  Obviously, there are electrical problems with these dryers.  A \\&quot;professional\\&quot; quality dryer should last a long time when used once daily at home!  Despite the problems I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m hooked on this dryer.  It&#x27;s done the best job so far for my curly, frizzy hair - and I&#x27;ve been using hand-held dryers since the 1970&#x27;s.  I sincerely hope that Bespoke labs corrects the electrical problems in future models!!!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I would now give it 4-stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This dryer is very light, very quiet, and does not burn my hair or dry it out.  I can dry my semi-long hair in about 6 minutes, using the cool shot button, and it is very smooth and shiny.  I think it has helped calm the fly-away static electricity this winter, but not completely.  Until now, I&#x27;ve bought inexpensive dryers that last about 3 months. I&#x27;m hoping that this investment will last a bit longer!  My only complaint is that the manufacturer will not warranty the dryer because I bought it through Amazon, which is not a certified dealer.  So, any problems will be heading right for Amazon&#x27;s customer service department!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Quiet, dries fast, makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> The picture on the web page didn&#x27;t match the model number. I returned the item and they reimbursed me.</li>
    <li> I have owned this dryer for 2 years and it is the best dryer I have ever had. It dries your hair quickly and makes it straight and smooth, without any frizz.  The only problem is that this week it just stopped working with no warning, for no apparent reason.  I am now buying the new Featherweight SE, and hoping it will be as good.</li>
    <li> Few problems with this Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;First: I&#x27;ve had this dryer before. It was great, but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working, as they do.&lt;br /&gt;Second: The FIRST time I plugged this dryer in the low blast setting did not work (as in, no air came out). I contacted the seller and I&#x27;ve received no response. The dryer is not working, and I just want a different one.&lt;br /&gt;Third: This seller is a complete scam! They send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they&#x27;ll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review. Complete extortion. I can&#x27;t believe Amazon works with these guys. Mind you, since they are not an authorized retailer it is very likely the manufacturer&#x27;s warrantee is void. This creates a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: buy this from a different seller.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just be sure to read the instructions... the first time I used the blowdryer it set my smoke alarm off because of the manufacturing residue in the blowdryer.  No real need to worry because there was a warning in the manual.  It was just inconvenient... had to open all the windows and turn off the dryer to get the smoke detector to go off.  There is an odd smell the first time you use the dryer but again, this was all described in the owner&#x27;s manual.    Other than that, I&#x27;ve had compliments that my hair looks smoother.  I noticed less frizz and my hair feels softer. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but a good product if you&#x27;re looking to splurge a little.</li>
    <li> To clarify the warranty situation, I called discountjungle for information including how they managed to sell this product for 91 dollars- here it is    amazon covers this hairdryer for only 30 days under their warranty    discount jungle covers this product for a full year- if you have a problem within the year, discountjungle will call T3 and handle the warranty claim for you    The reason it is only 91 dollars is b/c of the warranty w/ discountjungle only being 1 year, instead of the full 4 year warranty through an \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I owned this dryer since 2008 just stopped buying the newest version now. But this so far has ben the best dryer my 19 year old and I both used it. it really truly cuts drying time in half we both have think long hair.</li>
    <li> She was so surprised and loved it. Souhe said it was something she really wanted and the price was wonderful. thank you</li>
    <li> My hair dresser first started me on a T3 about 4 years ago. I loved it. When it began to loose power, I found another T3 on Amazon and am still a T3 fan. I highly recommend this blow dryer - well worth the money.</li>
    <li> After one week this brand new hair dryer stopped working on low, which is the speed I always use.  How can I get it replaced without a hassel?  I really like this dryer when it is working properly.</li>
    <li> I have had three T3 hair dryers. I really liked the lightweight aspect but the heat control stopped working on all of them including the travel version. It is impossible to use any of them because the the high heat gets so hot now that it burns my hair. If I put it on a lower setting  the air is just less forceful. The worst part is that I contacted the company and they didn&#x27;t even respond. I will never buy anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is lightweight, powerful and quiet as promised, however it completely died after less than a month. It seems like other reviewers had similar experiences. Therefore I would not recommend the product.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this dryer for me. within a couple of uses it stopped blowing hot air. He reminds me all the time how much money he spent and how it can&#x27;t be used.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, great blow dryer. I can tell it&#x27;s not too harsh on my hair when I use it, but it works efficiently. It also came super fast!</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair dryer.  My hair used to take forever to dry and this does the job in half the time if not less.  My hair always feels nice and soft after I am finished drying it and is not frizzy.  A huge improvement over my $20 hairdryer from Target.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used and believe me I&#x27;ve been around. The T3 is ultra lightweight and super easy to maneuver because we all know some hairdryers are NOT. I am a mixed girl with a white mom whom has beautiful yet fine hair and a black dad with the classic black mans curl anyway I&#x27;m happy to say I lucked out with a great mixture of both and wile I love my curls I like to straighten them out too, and now with the T3 its not a painful process. The power switch is very sensitive so you can turn it on or off or change the setting easily while in use and I know it may not seem like much but the cord is long very long and to me that&#x27;s a plus. This T3 made my curls straight and so shinny in 20 minutes tops and I have hair to shoulder blades. Please don&#x27;t waist any more time or money on useless dryers and go get this hairdryer. I saw a couple of complaints about warranty so I bought mine at sephora witch if for some reason the warranty dose not apply the girl at sephora said if I keep my receipt I could exchange it at anytime if something went wrong.. &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line BUY IT!    &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift. I was very skeptical of the claims, and would never have paid this much for a hair dryer myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is really is a difference between this and your typical hair dryer (\\&quot;ionic\\&quot; or not). It leaves my hair considerably softer and somewhate shinier than my old dryer. I&#x27;ve noticed a slightly shorter drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big plus for me is that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other dryers. I live in a hot, humid city and drying my hair in the summer is a miserable, sweaty experience. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but whereas with my old dryer my hair went from WET to HOT to DRY, with this dryer it gots from WET to DAMP to DRY - a more natural progression to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would recommend the dryer. Reading the other reviews here, however, makes me question the company as a whole, and particularly their customer service. Their policy on the warranty seems very short-sighted. I&#x27;m sure that the four-year warranty is a factor for a lot of people when considering whether to spend ten times the price of a regular hair dryer. If they make a good product and it&#x27;s packaged well, they shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to stand behind it. Is the box REALLY less likely to be dropped when the truck driver unloads it at Sephora than at the Amazon warehouse or some other retailer? I don&#x27;t know where mine was purchased, but I would have been VERY upset if they had told me they wouldn&#x27;t honor the warranty.</li>
    <li> This thing is wonderful. My drying time went from 45 min. to 20 and with no static or frizz. It&#x27;s very quiet, I can actually hear my kids ask me questions and so light I don&#x27;t have to keep stopping to rest my arm from the weight. The anxiety I had about paying so much money went out the window the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> A colleague bought one of these and raved about it.  I borrowed it so my wife could try: yes, it is lightweight... but so are most $20 hairdryers.  Wife said it didn&#x27;t dry any faster, didn&#x27;t impress her as being anything special.  Someone is laughing hard all the way to the bank with this.</li>
    <li> I just got my T3 Featherweight and I love it.  This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet and dryed my hair, to the roots, in under 5 minutes.  I will recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Would recommend to buy this hair dryer, light weight too. Especially love the cold air button! Only wish the cord could be shortened for my use but it&#x27;s a profession hair dryer so the length is understood.</li>
    <li> The blowdryer is light weight and results in a decent style but I have had two dryers that broke down within a year after I purchased them.  I do not think this blow dryer is worth the price.</li>
    <li> This does help dry my thick hair so it was a good purchase. My hair is shiny and soft so I did not see an improvement.</li>
    <li> The dryer is light and easy to hold, but the speed and heat are not very adjustable (just 2 settings) and it takes a long time to dry my thick hair. &lt;br /&gt;For the price, I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> After having read the majority of the reviews here, I&#x27;m happy to report that this dryer is fast and very lightweight.  My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that&#x27;s taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don&#x27;t miss having all of the other speeds.  This was well worth the price and I wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer.  But the results are well worth it.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have ordered several of these dryers and have been happy with them all.  I run a salon and enjoy retailing these dryers to my clients</li>
    <li> I ordered the T3 tourmaline 83808. I received the featherweight special edition, the number on the box is 83808. I previously owned the T3 and I know how it looks, the one I got is different.  This hair dryer is lighter.It does a very good job. But I feel the noise is stronger than the air comming out. I don&#x27;t know if this makes sense. It is a  very good product so far, but it is not the T3 I ordered.</li>
    <li> I purchased 1 and it stopped working in only a few months with only a few uses per week. I contacted customer service and they wanted $100 plus $14.95 to replace it. They don&#x27;t stand by their products claiming that the serial numbers aren&#x27;t enough to authenicate their products. Blah blah blah. Not worth the price tag and doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> I gave this five stars on behalf of my step-dad. I originally bought this hair dryer for myself.  My step-dad borrowed it and never gave it back.</li>
    <li> This is not the real T3.  It is a knockoff.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  Go to Costco and get the real one for the same price.</li>
    <li> I first saw this hair dryer on a TV show talking about beauty products used by the stars.  Then I noticed my hairdresser had switched to this brand.  His observations were the same as mine.  If you take a lot of time drying hair and the weight of the dryer is an issue, this is a very good purchase.  But your hair will be no shinier or softer than with other dryers.</li>
    <li> The weight of this hairdryer is a delightful.   The drying time is quick and the cord length helps to keep me from strangling my clients. I am also impressed with the low noise feature. Even the concentrator slips on to a groove so it is held in place securely. In my book, this dryer has it all and answers all of my needs. Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> At first I broke into a sweat at the thought of paying so much for a hair dryer. Boy am I glad I did!  I have thick wavy hair and this thing works miracles for me.  In the past when trying to blow out my hair I would give up because my hands would be killing me from the weight and I would end up with something between frizz and more frizz!  Not only does this baby cut my drying time in half but it&#x27;s so light, featherweight just like the description.  Another great thing about this dryer is that if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day a quick shot in the morning will refresh it as if you have a fresh blow out!  Smooth, shiny hair is what you end up with, how can you lose? &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I thought this product would dry my hair faster than it does (my dry time went from like 35 to 25 minutes), but the product does a great job at preventing drying, breakage and frizziness.  Despite the dry time, I would probably buy another in the future if my current one lasts at least a year (it would make sense for my pocket and for my vanity).  On a different note, the diffuser (bought separately for $25) is awful; I wouldn&#x27;t ever consider buying another.</li>
    <li> Lightweight dryer, fast drying , but not too hot. Makes my hair softer, not frizzy.  Sometimes the dryer will make my hair have static.  Overall, I really like the dryer.</li>
    <li> am in the market for a fabulous dryer for my natural african-american hair. I have heard rave reviews about the T3, which my stylist uses. However, the concerns regarding whether the manufacturer will honor the warranty if you buy from Amazon turned me off. I noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty. So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer. I plan to buy the dryer, but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty.</li>
    <li> The cool air button doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Other buttons are all right but I am not satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> My wife says it works great. I had to order it online. The one she had for several years was not performing like it did when she first purchased it (over five years ago.). She would not buy a different type at a store. She would olny accept this one. I am glad I found it for her.</li>
    <li> A month or two after I received this item, the attachment nozzle started falling off as I was straightening my hair.  This began happening more and more frequently, and after about 4 months, the nozzle wouldn&#x27;t stay attached at all.  I contacted the company and they said they couldn&#x27;t help me, to contact the manufacturer, T3.  I did (and attached photos), and they informed me that Xpress store had sent me a very old outdated model from 2007 that was made in Korea, that they were not authorized dealers of this product, and that a piece of the dryer itself had fallen off and attached itself irreparably to the nozzle, which is why i was experiencing the problem I was having.  I contacted Xpress store with this new information, and they told me they would not replace it.  Really sucks after spending $140 on a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is only 1800 watts -  I am sorry I didn&#x27;t read closer, if the wattage was noted, and purchase a more high-powered dryer.  I didn&#x27;t return this one because I discarded everything before realizing it.&lt;br /&gt;Mary in VA</li>
    <li> I Love it!!!! I use it everyday. One of the best blow dryers I have purchased. My hairstyles uses it on her clients.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  I asked my hairdresser how he achieved such silkiness and shine in my hair, when I, using  the same products at home, couldn&#x27;t.  He told me the blow dryer is the key.  He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I&#x27;m done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.  It is definitely worth the extra care it requires; it dries my hair FAST and leaves it shiny, sealed and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I bought a cheaper model elsewhere but my dog chewed  the cord. Liked the other better.  Takes longer to dry hair</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer.  Light weight in handling.</li>
    <li> Best blowdryer ever.  This is my second T3 because the airline broke my first one pitching my luggage. Drys super fast and less damaging.</li>
</ol>
