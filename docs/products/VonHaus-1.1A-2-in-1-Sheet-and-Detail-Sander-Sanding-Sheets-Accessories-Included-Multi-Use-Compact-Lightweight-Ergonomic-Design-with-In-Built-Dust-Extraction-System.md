      <li>I have decided to keep the nail filer and give as a gift to someone,  but it just really would have been nice to not have to search for and purchase another that is safe for diabetics to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The nails were smooth, it also worked when there a nick in my nails.  </li>
      <li>Cheap dont bother.</li>

      <li>is excellent for small detail work and drilling.  </li>
      <li>I have changed my review to reflect 5 stars instead of the original 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>its worth it!</li>
      <li>Received it quick.  </li>
      <li>It is a very inexpensive version of the Dremel tool which is no longer available.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller right away</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay product , make sure when you change the batteries be careful  and make sure you see how to put the batteries back in, and everything else</li>
      <li>The first dremel wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
      <li>After first use I can&#x27;t change the tips, something is stripped.</li>
      <li>Seems to work well at the higher speed.  </li>
      <li>It came with batteries but they weren&#x27;t that great and didn&#x27;t last every long.</li>
      <li>Bit release button broke with first use.</li>
      <li>I need to use it a little longer in order to write a more accurate review .</li>
      <li>Bought to help trim my nails between salon visits, it works but changing batteries is a major pain because of how cheaply its made.</li>
      <li>far as the seller, shipping was super fast and the item was exactly as they described it.</li>
      <li>She looked it over and stated that it would be just fine for us to use on low speed.  </li>
      <li>The item does not come with much of instructions on how to use it.  </li>
      <li>the product works really well on my nails.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be ready to go into business for myself.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like this for my acrylic nails.  </li>
      <li>but they were already in, the whole battery area fell out.</li>
      <li>My nails are real</li>
      <li>It was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much but definitely got my moneys worth in the first use.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
      <li>After 3 uses the high setting stopped working and the 4th use it stopped working all together.</li>
      <li>Asked for a refund, but was sent a new battery part.  </li>
      <li>Tried new batteries to no avail and the battery pack broke.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much exactly what we expected for the price.</li>
      <li>seller: WOW!</li>
      <li>I also tried new batteries figured maybe the batteries were old because the package had dust on it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item for myself and my husband because the description clearly stated \\&quot;Diabetic foot and Nail Care Set\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>, it also came early so thumbs up for that .</li>
      <li>I go to the nail salon to get my finger nails done, but I don&#x27;t let people go near my feet.  </li>
      <li>Europeans are smart enough to tax chinese goods into extinction but we&#x27;re not.</li>
      <li>and they resent a new one almost from one day to the next.</li>
      <li>Even the box of accessory bits was not securely closed.</li>
      <li>I guess it pays to read carefully because this is more powerful and complicated than needed</li>
      <li>When I first received this product, it stopped working in just a few seconds.  </li>

<li> very strange drill, the description should have said it was made in</li>
<li> I received the product today and the first thing that I saw on the instructions that came with it was \\&quot;Don&#x27;t use drill if you are diabetic or have poor circulation\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Amazon would not give me anything back as I had it for a few months.  </li>

<li> Not worth the trouble of ordering it.</li>
<li> It is too weak and the sanding circles don&#x27;t stay on the attachment, they appear to be too big.</li>
<li> total piece of junk, the sanding wheels did not fit tool, lacked power and stopped, impossible to replace the batteries---do not buy a complete waste of money</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> I AM DISABLED</li>
<li> if not .. then my money is wasted.  </li>
<li> This is the only product that was completely useless.</li>
<li> I have thick toe nails and have used a dremel in the past.  </li>
<li> No instructions come with the package and if one has never used a drill before, it&#x27;s really hard to figure out all the pieces.</li>
<li> DUH</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> battery compartment fell apart and never worked again.  Junk!!!</li>
    <li> For my nails.&lt;br /&gt;For my dog&#x27;s nails.&lt;br /&gt;For sanding down some materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And seller: WOW! The first dremel wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I contacted the seller right away and they resent a new one almost from one day to the next. I have never had a better customer service experience.</li>
    <li> Fell apart in my hands and could not put it back together, I was so upset I did not even try to return and just threw the pieceof junk in the trash!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for myself and my husband because the description clearly stated \\&quot;Diabetic foot and Nail Care Set\\&quot;.  I received the product today and the first thing that I saw on the instructions that came with it was \\&quot;Don&#x27;t use drill if you are diabetic or have poor circulation\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted the seller to ask them to correct their product description.  I have decided to keep the nail filer and give as a gift to someone,  but it just really would have been nice to not have to search for and purchase another that is safe for diabetics to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt; Since I posted the review for this product, I have seen my doctor and brought the drill in as well. She looked it over and stated that it would be just fine for us to use on low speed.  I have changed my review to reflect 5 stars instead of the original 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the seller, shipping was super fast and the item was exactly as they described it.</li>
    <li> No instructions included for operation or use of various bits/attachments. Bit release button broke with first use. Disappointing. I returned the product.</li>
    <li> I love this drill it&#x27;s so easy to use and it comes with many useful bits, great nail drill for a cheap price &amp; many saved trips to the salon!!</li>
    <li> The instructions for the product were poorly described. A phone call to the  distributor  was of no help. The instructions need to be more specific and the illustrations used to describe the product were essentially useless. I returned the item.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to do my toe nails. I put the file on and tried to file my toe nail and every time I put it on the nail tool would stop. What a waste. Doesn&#x27;t have enough power. I also tried new batteries figured maybe the batteries were old because the package had dust on it. It didn&#x27;t work any better. Returning.</li>
    <li> No instructions come with the package and if one has never used a drill before, it&#x27;s really hard to figure out all the pieces.</li>
    <li> It is a very inexpensive version of the Dremel tool which is no longer available. It is a fairly low powered cordless rotary tool,&lt;br /&gt;but is excellent for small detail work and drilling.  Pretty much exactly what we expected for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this for my acrylic nails.  It is too weak and the sanding circles don&#x27;t stay on the attachment, they appear to be too big.</li>
    <li> This worked fine until the batteries died,  When I took the cap off all the insides just fell out!  Amazon would not give me anything back as I had it for a few months.  But it obviously wasn&#x27;t made to last!  With all the contacts, etc. in a pile there was no way I could fix it.</li>
    <li> I used it once, used it on my sisters nails (same as mine) and the batteries died. Ok fine. replaced them.. Didn&#x27;t use again till tonight. You would think that the batteries were never replaced. Then suddenly, it stops.  Replace batteries again, Nope. I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not impressed!! Very hard to change bits. The battery life is short. The drill is a little too big for the hand, especially for professional use as a manicurist.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my feet and I use it every two weeks. It is great. I go to the nail salon to get my finger nails done, but I don&#x27;t let people go near my feet.  This is perfect for my feet.</li>
    <li> My nails are real but I still want them to look I just came from the salon. Hence the reason for the drill. This item is awesome and works great, cuts ur time in more than half from hand filing. All I need now is an air brush gun and I&#x27;ll be ready to go into business for myself.</li>
    <li> My product was sent to me used! The packaging was open. In addition to the outside package being open the little box that the files came in was open and coated in dust!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to switch accessories.</li>
    <li> I thought the item needed batteries but they were already in, the whole battery area fell out. I tried to put it together and was successful but now the unit isn&#x27;t working and batteries are in the item correctly.</li>
    <li> I have thick toe nails and have used a dremel in the past.  When it wore out, I decided to try this nail drill because the AA batteries are cheaper to replace than the dremel battery.  Also the dremel accessories also fit this nail drill.  It works wonders.  I no longer have to go to the podiatrist to have my nails filed, I do it myself.</li>
    <li> Bought to help trim my nails between salon visits, it works but changing batteries is a major pain because of how cheaply its made. After first use I can&#x27;t change the tips, something is stripped.</li>
    <li> After 3 uses the high setting stopped working and the 4th use it stopped working all together. I had just gone beyond the 30 day return policy so I wasn&#x27;t able to return. I thought that maybe it was the batteries and when I tried to change them the battery holder fell to pieces. Beware of this product!</li>
    <li> Cheap dont bother. It stops everytime you barley touch your nail. NO POWER</li>
    <li> its better then i thought it was gonna bee, it also came early so thumbs up for that . the product works really well on my nails.</li>
    <li> I have bought many items from Amazon. This is the only product that was completely useless. Has no power at all. As soon as you touch the nail, it stopped working.</li>
    <li> It slows down and stops when using it.So dissapointed with performance.Would not recomend.Thats all I have to say!Thank you.:(.Thats it!</li>
    <li> Opened the box- the drill and everything in the box just fell out. it was not sealed within the plastic packaging. Even the box of accessory bits was not securely closed. I tried to turn on the drill.. nothing. Opened the battery box, batteries and metal clips fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like someone else had this and returned it. I am doing the same. Hope you aren&#x27;t the unlucky next recipient!</li>
    <li> The item does not come with much of instructions on how to use it.  The effect is not so great or is it maybe we don&#x27;t know how to use it?</li>
    <li> Not a lot of information with the product, but was able to go on-line to find what I needed to know to use it.  Seems to work well at the higher speed.  I&#x27;m only using it for a thick toenail, so I do not know how well it works for manicuring.</li>
    <li> Does what I wanted it for to be able to care for my fingernails &amp; toenails without paying for a manicure &amp; pedicure. Always in my bathroom when I need to use it.</li>
    <li> very strange drill, the description should have said it was made in China.&lt;br /&gt;It is poorly made with no instructions on how the attachments are to be used.&lt;br /&gt;It is almost impossible to change the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would not recommend it</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, it stopped working in just a few seconds.  Tried new batteries to no avail and the battery pack broke.  Asked for a refund, but was sent a new battery part.  Still not working....Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy!!!!</li>
    <li> I came broken and I sent it back. Not worth the trouble of ordering it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use it , but so far so good. I need to use it a little longer in order to write a more accurate review .</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product, but I do wish it didn&#x27;t look like I should store it in a toolbox.  It works great, though.  Safety suggestions might be a good idea, too.</li>
    <li> I am sure my wife will enjoy using this buffer . It appears to be well made and has several added tools included</li>
    <li> I bought this product to shorten my Solar Nails while my nails grow out, it worked great.  The nails were smooth, it also worked when there a nick in my nails.  The product arrived timely.</li>
    <li> I guess it pays to read carefully because this is more powerful and complicated than needed but my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay product , make sure when you change the batteries be careful  and make sure you see how to put the batteries back in, and everything else</li>
    <li> This is better than i was expecting! It has great power and cuts the time it takes me to do my nails by 3/4. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed when I received this item.  Received it quick.  Took a minute to figure out how to change out the bits but once I did, easy peasy.  I didn&#x27;t expect much but definitely got my moneys worth in the first use.</li>
    <li> I AM DISABLED AND THIS PRODUCT SOLVED MY GROOMING PROBLEMS,IT IS WELL MADE , MY AIDES LOVE IT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> I love this battery powered nail drill.  It has plenty of power and is very easy to use !  Definately recommend.</li>
    <li> Just like the other reviews I read, the attachments are too big and will not fit into the drill hole.  Since the return time was 2 days after it shipped, I can&#x27;t return it.  My son uses drills at work so I&#x27;ll see if he knows a trick to make them fit .. if not .. then my money is wasted.  I took a chance on getting one that worked, regardless of the reviews .. so lesson learned.  You should not make the same mistake!</li>
    <li> So quality control in this chinese factory is not so great. Europeans are smart enough to tax chinese goods into extinction but we&#x27;re not. DUH</li>
    <li> total piece of junk, the sanding wheels did not fit tool, lacked power and stopped, impossible to replace the batteries---do not buy a complete waste of money</li>
    <li> It was better than I expected. Just for $20. It came with batteries but they weren&#x27;t that great and didn&#x27;t last every long. You won&#x27;t regret buying, just make sure you buy your own separate batteries too.. its worth it!</li>
    <li> Loved it was cordless and because of the versatility of uses.  I use it almost every day. Great product for a good price.</li>
