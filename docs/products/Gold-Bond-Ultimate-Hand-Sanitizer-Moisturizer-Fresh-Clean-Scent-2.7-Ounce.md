      <li>It smells great and really does moisturize.</li>
      <li>Fresh clean scent that is not overpowering and a great moisturizer while killing germs.</li>
      <li>This does not wash off so easily, does not clog my pores, is not caked on.  </li>
      <li>I keep this in the car and it is an easy hand cleaner until you reach your destination and can use soap and water.</li>
      <li>It is, hands down, one of the best hand lotions out there.</li>
      <li>I keep one of these Gold Bond items at my desk, in my car (great for after pumping gas) and one in my handbag (for quick sanitizing) after pushing those elevator buttons, or entering those conference rooms where you have to open the door by touching door handles.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hands smooth.</li>
      <li>Why is it when you finally find a great product they stop carrying it in the stores?  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fantastic at moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Fantastic combination.</li>
      <li>Note that the label indicates &amp;#34;not effective for new germs,&amp;#34; whatever that means.</li>
      <li>Smells clean.</li>
      <li>sure this will really help her.</li>
      <li>A quality hand sanitizer tht does not contain alco hol and is kind to the hands for frequent use.</li>
      <li>I work in home health and find this far superior to other sanitizers- not drying and feels like a good handcream.</li>

      <li>As a lotion addict I am always carrying one in my purse and this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
      <li>It has a nice feeling, absorbs quickly and can last through a couple of hand washes.</li>
      <li>This is SO much better than most hand sanitizers--doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out!</li>
      <li>I also \\&quot;love\\&quot; the fresh scent fragrance.</li>
      <li>not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>It definitely comes in handy.</li>
      <li>I love this hand sanitizer so much that this one was purchased for my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;She uses hand sanitizers all the time and the top of her hands are really dry and rough,&lt;br</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the drug stores where I live and was so excited when I found it on amazon.</li>
      <li>This product is in my purse or in the car and used more than once on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>but I really like this product!</li>
      <li>It amazes me that this is really a hand sanitizer!  </li>
      <li>I carry it in my purse and after shaking hands with people in church or touching door knobs or anything in public places I use this to help with germs and/or illness.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel like it is actually helping with my dry skin, where most lotions just seem to feel a bit slippery.</li>
      <li>Most hand sanitizers dry out your skin even when they say they moisturize.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of moisturizer sanitizer because my hands are always so dry after using those alcohol-based sanitizers.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>It is light enough for a woman or man to use.</li>
      <li>I really like this product .  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Gold bond works very well</li>
      <li>Not only is this way more effective than alcohol-based stuff against common things, flu, stomach flu, colds, etc</li>
      <li>Antibacterial products are by nature very drying to the skin.</li>
      <li>I \\&quot;highly recommend\\&quot; this Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer / Moisturizer!</li>
      <li>does not burn, soaks in well and heals your hand fast.</li>
      <li>It works alright though keeps your hands moistened for a decent time.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn or anything and smells decent</li>
      <li>Online is too high, with shipping costs.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>A little greasy, but leaves your hands feeling better than the ETOH sanitizers.</li>
      <li>Super clean scent, a little slick at first but ultimately absorbs and leaves skin nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>You know how when you really like something so naturally your go to store stops carrying it?</li>
      <li>Within 5 minutes of applying this, my hands felt nearly normal.</li>
      <li>There is a scent, but it&#x27;s not strong and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, which most fragrances do.</li>
      <li>It barely smells like anything at all, you have to really get your face close to smell it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since it first came out though suddenly Target doesn&#x27;t have it anymore.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, we were disappointed when the other brand with this formulation was discontinued but this is much better.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hands supple and soft.</li>
      <li>A must if you have to wash your hands frequently.</li>
      <li>It also is not heavily perfumed which is a relief since I have sensitivities to perfume.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fresh clean scent that is not overpowering and a great moisturizer while killing germs.</li>
    <li> Other hand sanitizer dries out my hands. This helps keep them moisturized.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR IN MY PURSE. I WISH IT WAS IN STORES</li>
    <li> I really like this product .  It&#x27;s not greasy and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> good product for those who have to was their hands every minute of the day.  its small and you can carry it with you where ever you go.</li>
    <li> As a lotion addict I am always carrying one in my purse and this is my new favorite. I love the smell and feel like it is actually helping with my dry skin, where most lotions just seem to feel a bit slippery. The fact that it is also hand sanitizer is a major plus!</li>
    <li> A little greasy, but leaves your hands feeling better than the ETOH sanitizers.</li>
    <li> I looked ALL over and could NOT find this in the stores!!  It was perfect for my 6 year old who was unable to use regular anti-bacterial hand sanitizer on her hands because they would end up cracking and was painful for her :(  This was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and silky. Excellent product</li>
    <li> Love it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have hand eczema with cracks that make alcohol-based sanitizer very painful. This stuff is like putting lotion on, dozens of times each day in the hospital.</li>
    <li> Was purchasing this product in the stores. However, it suddenly disappeared off the shelves. Amazon is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; Internet store for everything hard-to-find. Antibacterial products are by nature very drying to the skin. However, Gold Bond found a solution! Am hoping it will return to stores soon.</li>
    <li> I had heard the citrus version of this smelled awful, and I&#x27;m really glad to say this absolutely doesn&#x27;t. It barely smells like anything at all, you have to really get your face close to smell it and it smells just kind of lotion-y. Alcohol based sanitizers are pretty much useless against viruses, so when I saw something that was both known to kill viruses (including the stomach flu, which alcohol does absolutely nothing to) AND moisturizing, I had to give it a try. It is, hands down, one of the best hand lotions out there. My hands were chapped and cracked and very few hand lotions were helping. Within 5 minutes of applying this, my hands felt nearly normal. After just a few applications, they were incredibly soft. I ALWAYS carry a tube of this around, it fits in my pocket and it&#x27;s great to pull out and use before eating or doing my makeup. This stuff is great! I can&#x27;t gush about it enough. Not only is this way more effective than alcohol-based stuff against common things, flu, stomach flu, colds, etc... but it&#x27;s fantastic at moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love it... cleans &amp; conditions my hands.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, smell is horrible. not as good as expected. the previous reviews misled me.will not use it</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is always a reliable product for combating dry skin.  I can&#x27;t say how well this product sanitized hands, but it definitely moisturizes them well.  This product holds up to repeated hand washing.  There is a fragrance but I can&#x27;t describe it and it&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
    <li> Gold bond works very well my hands are soft</li>
    <li> I love this hand sanitizer so much that this one was purchased for my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;She uses hand sanitizers all the time and the top of her hands are really dry and rough,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this will really help her.</li>
    <li> We find this to be a convenient and soothing product.</li>
    <li> I keep this in the car and it is an easy hand cleaner until you reach your destination and can use soap and water.</li>
    <li> I hate dry hands and germs. I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it since it first came out though suddenly Target doesn&#x27;t have it anymore. You know how when you really like something so naturally your go to store stops carrying it? Yeah, that. So of course it&#x27;s Amazon to the rescue. Just hoping it&#x27;s not being discontinued in general.</li>
    <li> The best as it does not dry your hands out like most gels. Impossible to find in stores in my area, so glad to see it on Amazon. I stocked up!</li>
    <li> It amazes me that this is really a hand sanitizer!  Your hands are so soft just from using this.  My husband refused to use the other types because his hands got so dry.  This is awesome and fits in my purse so is always with me.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of moisturizer sanitizer because my hands are always so dry after using those alcohol-based sanitizers. This moisturizer is a little on the greasy side and doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly. I unfortunately discovered this when I went to put on contacts several minutes after using it - yeowch!</li>
    <li> Extremely moisturizing. Couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hand sanitizer on the market.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands with a dry feeling as other alcohol-based sanitizers do.  It is difficult to find so I am pleased to find it at this site.</li>
    <li> I use hand sanitizer a lot and this keeps my hands from drying as the other do. It feels soft.</li>
    <li> I work in home health and find this far superior to other sanitizers- not drying and feels like a good handcream. I actually buy this for my patients.</li>
    <li> This is SO much better than most hand sanitizers--doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this just what he was looking for</li>
    <li> It does the job without drying out your hands out. It leaves your hands supple and soft. Love the product. I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere but Amazon. It kills germs &amp; lotion for your skin. Great combination in a hand cream. I also purchased the larger lotion for home. My work friends asked me to get them some. We were tired of hand sanitizers that dryed our skin.</li>
    <li> The only hand lotion i use. does not burn, soaks in well and heals your hand fast. Smells clean. Best hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I \\&quot;highly recommend\\&quot; this Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer / Moisturizer! What a great idea that someone came up with, to combine a hand sanitizer and a moisturizer all in one. You know how drying those hand sanitizers can be and with Gold Bond, they take care of that drying out, by adding a moisturizer! I also \\&quot;love\\&quot; the fresh scent fragrance. It is light enough for a woman or man to use. I keep one of these Gold Bond items at my desk, in my car (great for after pumping gas) and one in my handbag (for quick sanitizing) after pushing those elevator buttons, or entering those conference rooms where you have to open the door by touching door handles. This product would make a great \\&quot;teacher&#x27;s gift\\&quot;, an awesome stocking stuffer and if you just want to let a friend, or sibling know you care, grab a tube of this product for those you love or care about!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I get a rash from traditional hand sanitizers but not from this. Leaves my hands smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is in my purse or in the car and used more than once on a daily basis.  It truly is a moisturizer and definitely seems to be a sanitizer as I haven&#x27;t gotten sick all winter.</li>
    <li> Hand sanitizer that also moisturizes your hands. It&#x27;s a little greasy but I really like this product!</li>
    <li> Super clean scent, a little slick at first but ultimately absorbs and leaves skin nice and soft.  A must if you have to wash your hands frequently.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and antiseptic to 99.9%.  Nice scent.  Note that the label indicates &amp;#34;not effective for new germs,&amp;#34; whatever that means.</li>
    <li> This is the best of both worlds. It kills germs while nourishing my dry skin.  It also is not heavily perfumed which is a relief since I have sensitivities to perfume.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Purell  dries your hands out, and I love how this moisturizers them and still kills germs.</li>
    <li> This can be hard to find in stores. Perfect size to tuck in your purse. A must have!</li>
    <li> The local stores no longer carry this. I buy this product for my hand to not be so awfully dry. This does not wash off so easily, does not clog my pores, is not caked on.  I actually had to buy this online as the stores tried it for their shelves but no longer carry it.  It also has a hand sanitizer in the mix.  It dosen&#x27;t bother me. Some it does. Read the label about the sanitizer. If other products with those ingredients bother you then this one will too. Otherwise. This is GREAT!</li>
    <li> Love Gold Bond hand sanitizer. I keep mine in the car. Whenever I&#x27;m out shopping, I rub some on my hands as soon s I return to the car. The best feature is that unlike gel sanitizers that are drying, your hands are moisturized with Gold Bond. There is a scent, but it&#x27;s not strong and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, which most fragrances do. Fabulous product, but hard to find. Happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> I thought I had found my one and only new hand sanitizer. I teach and regularly sanitize my hands throughout the day, which was drying them out. I tried this product and loved it!!!  Now I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more. Why is it when you finally find a great product they stop carrying it in the stores?  Online is too high, with shipping costs. I hope Walmart restocks this item!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,  its not inthe stores,  I am so happy I could get it on Amazon....</li>
    <li> I carry this hand sanitizer always...it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like the clear sanitizers do.  This is like a hand cream and I love it, but can&#x27;t find it in stores. Have to order it on line.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend because she loves this stuff and can&#x27;t find anywhere.  I used hers once-very moisturizing for a hand sanitizer, but too pricy for me to use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> like gold bond products they work quite well.  I am a nurse and need something to moisturize without flowery frangrances to disturb patients.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The stores in my town don&#x27;t sell these anymore and I was so happy to see them on Amazon. It actually moisturizes while disinfecting instead of drying my skin out. I hope they never stop making this. It shipped promptly too.</li>
    <li> Love this product and can&#x27;t find it in stores around here.  I love that it is both a hand sanitizer and moisturizer combined.  Has a fresh, clean scent, not floral or overpowering.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, we were disappointed when the other brand with this formulation was discontinued but this is much better. No more dry hands from alcohol or bleach. It smells great and really does moisturize. It&#x27;s in my purse all the time also it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works nicely. Hands were so dry from traditional hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn or anything and smells decent but it&#x27;s a little thick and greasy. It works alright though keeps your hands moistened for a decent time.</li>
    <li> My hands are a wreck in the cold weather - this product really helps, especially at night when I apply the cream and put on a pair of&lt;br /&gt;cotton gloves overnight.  It has a nice feeling, absorbs quickly and can last through a couple of hand washes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  THIS WILL MOISTURIZE @ SAME TIME AS SANITIZING.  DOES NOT DRY MY HANDS.  ITS WONDERFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have dry hands and I go to the bathroom a lot when I am out.  using this Gold Bond product  has solved  my &amp;#34; hands&amp;#34; problem.  do not stop making this product!!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  we knew before we purchased.. Only drawback was shipping which doubled the price</li>
    <li> Lotion and a hand sanitizer too. Fantastic combination.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product because it&#x27;s a hand sanitizer BUT also moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t smell alcohol. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the drug stores where I live and was so excited when I found it on amazon. I carry it in my purse and after shaking hands with people in church or touching door knobs or anything in public places I use this to help with germs and/or illness.</li>
    <li> Most hand sanitizers dry out your skin even when they say they moisturize. Gold Bond actually does what it says.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find this product. A quality hand sanitizer tht does not contain alco hol and is kind to the hands for frequent use.</li>
    <li> The title speaks for itself. I really like this stuff. I bring it along with me to work. I&#x27;m constantly using company vehicles and my hands constantly get dirty. It definitely comes in handy. I actually use it like regular lotion too(two birds with one stone), It&#x27;s time to get the bigger bottle now! I&#x27;m a guy, so I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t smell girly or over powering.</li>
