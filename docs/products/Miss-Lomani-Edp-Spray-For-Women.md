<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this scent. Literally my little go to perfume for daily use.</li>
    <li> I ❤ this perfume. It has such a great smell. I love how it stays on my skin. If you want a nice fruity but soft perfume this is the one for you</li>
    <li> Cheap and smells good! On the fruity side</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long but it smells great. Sweet citrus scent with a light floral hint</li>
    <li> This fragrance is an absolute winner! I get so many compliments every time I wear it. It last all day! It&#x27;s a soft floral. It&#x27;s not too over the top. Perfect for spring &amp; summer.</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume on a whim.. wanted to try something different. had just finished a bottle of burberry brit and the one by dolce and gabbana. two different scents and Miss Lomani makes it 3. It is an oil based perfume so it lasts a lot longer but it isn&#x27;t an intrusive or overbearing smell. It sets with time and adjusts to skin chemistry. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments and I love it!</li>
    <li> First time I used this perfume was in 2007. I never found any other better than it, including Channel No.5. I just love the fruit, fresh and sweet feeling. It made me think of the summer at seaside. It is OK to wear it all year long, but the best season to wear is spring or summer. This is my favorite. Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love love love.....if you love sweet fruity smells this is so for you I have been using this for a few years get a lot of complements on the smell I use to buy this a t retail price of 40$ SO THIS PRICE IS GREAT  I don&#x27;t have to go weeks without now do to the cheap price thank!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I love it. My husband has bought me different parfums in the past but this one and Robert Cavalli are the only ones that I get compliments on. I just ran out and I plan on purchasing this plus I am going to get the set.</li>
    <li> This parfum is very soft smelling and feminine. It is more of a springtime parfum. The notes that stands out in this pafume are orange Blossom, Sandalwood, Jasmine and Carnation. If you are a spicy ,sweet, or powdery parfum wearer this might not be the purfum for you. If you like Jasmine with a hint of wood this is the purfume for you. The price is right so it&#x27;s worth giving it a try. I like this perfum but don&#x27;t love it, just a personal taste. I&#x27;m a sweet and powdery parfum lover.</li>
    <li> I bought one of this years ago as a gift. The person who used it got lots of compliments, so she asked for it again. Thank amazon for having it, and the price is even cheaper.</li>
    <li> buy it without knowing it is delicious, makes me feel sexy and my boyfriend charm, delivery was very fast, I would return to buy</li>
    <li> Miss Lomani By Lomani For Women Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Oz&lt;br /&gt;LOMANI&lt;br /&gt;like it</li>
    <li> I hate that this perfume is discontinued but Im glad I can get it here, it shipped within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I liked this perfume a lot. Especially for the price. Have soft , calm smell.</li>
    <li> I like perfume made in Paris and Miss Lomani meets my expectations plus it lasts all day. It has a light floral smell to it.</li>
    <li> I will be completely honest.  Before I purchased this $20 bottle of Miss Lomani, I spent $140.00 on a Coco Chanel bottle for my wife.  I LIKE THIS FRAGRANCE BETTER !! I told my wife that even though I don&#x27;t regret spending on the Coco bottle this is an example of NOT ALWAYS getting what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Its so light and fresh and different from all the other perfumes that i have used.... I love that I never have to worry about someone smelling just like me.</li>
    <li> Hands down, my favorite fragrance for my body chemistry!  Has all the right notes and my husband goes crazy every time I put it on!  What more could a woman ask for?!  Very light floral scent, with a sophistication about it.  Heart notes include jasmine, which is an all time favorite for my skin!  The price is ridiculously worth it and I am over the moon happy that I finally have a reliable place to buy my absolute MUST have fragrance!  Fast shipping and good packaging of product.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume, very light fragrance,  only one I can wear because of my allergies</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd bottle of this parfum.  the scent i like so much and it goes well with the every day activities.  price is excellent too.  the package has a cute bracelet that can be worn 24/7</li>
    <li> It so good but I can smell alcohol so I don&#x27;t use so much.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! but isn&#x27;t that strong so the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as a expensive perfume.</li>
    <li> I love the clean scent this fragrance gives off. Most fragrances are loud but this one is calm and still leaves it&#x27;s mark when u walk in the room.</li>
