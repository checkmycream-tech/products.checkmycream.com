      <li>So far this products is great!</li>

      <li>It feels great on the skin but have not see much change in the skin</li>
      <li>I love this serum.</li>
      <li>Might be able to help.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to &amp;</li>
      <li>I love the cooling sensation of this lotion, but it does nothing for removing cellulite or tightening skin.</li>
      <li>I suggest to use the product in summer time. :-)</li>
      <li>I love the sensation after you put it on.</li>
      <li>Within a couple of days I noticed better stomach definition.</li>
      <li>and it can be a bit overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Need to give it more time.</li>
      <li>Ok as soon as I opened this and smelled the peppermint scent I knew I was going to love it.</li>
      <li>I wish more came in the bottle.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>but it worked so good that the price was WORTH IT.</li>
      <li>I love that it is tingly as well.</li>
      <li>So excited to have found this product!</li>
      <li>I have used this on my thigh area and have had great results so far!</li>
      <li>I need to use it longer before I can review properly - very cooling sensation which is nice but the scent seems to be very strong and medicinal smelling.  </li>
      <li>We all have our preferences but if you are like me, then this will make you very happy with that icy cooling effect it gives.</li>
      <li>the smell is pleasant and it is very cooling to the skin, leaving it smooth and silky...</li>
      <li>Very quick and prompt delivery and</li>
      <li>and it does have a strong mint smell (doesn&#x27;t bother me,)</li>
      <li>I was thinking this cream would be really nice to use during the hot summers because with the menthol it has a cooling effect.</li>
      <li>but all it did was made my skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>Purchased as gift nevertheless my finicky recipient whom is all about organic this, organic that will enjoy</li>
      <li>When I put it on, it does not sit on top of the skin, but get absorbed.  </li>
      <li>It does smell nice, very pepperminty, and feels like a muscle ache rub when you put it on.  </li>
      <li>I have tried it again since then and it seems to help a bit with swelling, not quite sure about cellulite, might have to give it more of a change and use product more regularly for this result.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited with the results.</li>
      <li>Love this product so much!</li>
      <li>so I put it on my left arm to test it out, and when I woke up in the morning, held up my arms in front of the mirror, to my pleasant surprise</li>
      <li>This stuff is really cool.</li>
      <li>It makes my legs feel cool and tingly for about 20-30 mins after applying.</li>
      <li>I could start to see results, but stopped using it since I became pregnant.</li>
      <li>It feels super minty which I like</li>
      <li>I also love the way it feels and the clean, fresh + natural scent it has.</li>
      <li>Love the natural scent!</li>
      <li>I feel like I will be much more confident in shorts from now on, which is crucial in this hot summer heat right now.</li>
      <li>It is so smooth, and absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients and does its job though.</li>
      <li>cause I can definite see some kind of change.</li>
      <li>I think if it continues to tighten and reduce the look of cellulite on my legs and stomach than it will still be worth it</li>
      <li>Definitely worth giving it a shot.</li>
      <li>So far i love this cream.</li>
      <li>but it is so incredibly worth it.  </li>
      <li>product is very strong, I thought my abs is on fire when I used the first time, and now I am on my second bottle, the burning feeling excited me because I know it&#x27;s working.</li>
      <li>You can feel it right after you apply it on you skin.</li>
      <li>I hope i keep seeing positive results!</li>
      <li>Overall, I would recommend, but if you have a dislike for a very strong menthol smell, I would not purchase.</li>
      <li>While it does seem to be helping, and the scent is strong but you quickly get use to it, wherever you rub it has an icy burning feeling for about 20 or so minutes which isn&#x27;t exactly comfortable.</li>
      <li>This product is totally amazing and works great, my little love handles were secretly disappeared..., OMG I can not believe it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost like it flushes the fluid padding out from under my stomach skin. :)</li>
      <li>I love the peppermint in it, which is an essential oil often used to stimulate.  </li>
      <li>and this really works!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great deal!  Quality product!</li>
    <li> Purchased as gift nevertheless my finicky recipient whom is all about organic this, organic that will enjoy</li>
    <li> Smells great! Ging to take a few weeks to see it if works as well as they say, but moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> It feels great on the skin but have not see much change in the skin I guess I need to use longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these types of products before &amp; I would have to say the tingling sensation (I believe from the mint) is stronger than previous brands. I am very sensitive to cold, so I found using right out of the shower to be a bit too intense (like I need to use a hair dryer to try to combat the intense chill, lol). As long as I used it a bit later in the day, my body tolerates it fine. Definitely worth giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> Wow it is a very wonderful  and amazing  products I think everyone should  try it</li>
    <li> Sorry, i don&#x27;t how to use it. And i think it small a litter weird, and work not very obviously.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong, and it tingles after applying. I did it after I took a shower. I could start to see results, but stopped using it since I became pregnant. But after I have the baby, I will be using it again!</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel. I can see a slight difference,  It will take time. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work over night but I can see it will work over time. Excellent</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I have used this on my thigh area and have had great results so far! My skin seems smoother and not as &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34;. It does has a menthol smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it at. It makes my legs feel cool and tingly for about 20-30 mins after applying. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells medicinal but gives results. I put this on before going to bed and felt a difference in the morning,</li>
    <li> Great product!! I use this product after working out, so far so good see my other review.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much! It feels amazing on, with a nice cooling sensation!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different firming creams and I haven&#x27;t seen enough of a difference to be excited about, but this one seems to be working! It absorbs quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all! Just a warning: If you use it right after exfoliating or a hot shower it will burn a little, and you will be sensitive to temperatures for about 10 minutes. It comes from the menthol or essential oils I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it for about a week, but if I continue seeing results like this I will keep buying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way- I use this in conjunction with a cellulite massager- they work well together.</li>
    <li> Stuff is amazing for sore musscles after a work out. Only been using it for 2 days. Probably doesn&#x27;t help with the cellulite, but if has a peppermint smell and leaves your skin with a tingly ice cold feeling.</li>
    <li> While it does seem to be helping, and the scent is strong but you quickly get use to it, wherever you rub it has an icy burning feeling for about 20 or so minutes which isn&#x27;t exactly comfortable. Especially at bedtime. I think if it continues to tighten and reduce the look of cellulite on my legs and stomach than it will still be worth it I the end. 4 stars for the comfort issue. Love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients and does its job though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled to have found this!  I have used several different cellulite creams over the years, this is the only one that has really worked. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days and I can already see an obvious difference. I purchased it to help tighten my excess skin. I also love the way it feels and the clean, fresh + natural scent it has. This is definitely a great, life changing product to have! I feel like I will be much more confident in shorts from now on, which is crucial in this hot summer heat right now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really cool. I have started a diet and workout plan and apply Skinny Bod before working out. So far, I think that it has helped dehydrate the area around my hips, or my &amp;#34;love handles.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t say for certain because I am also working out and eating right but it has a cool minty smell that if for nothing else, makes me smell good at the gym! Honestly this stuff reminds me of a body wrap I tried and I think the lotion formula is pretty similar to the one that was on the body wrap. The wrap I bought was $20 for 45 minutes of use, making this Skinny Bod product a good value for the price. At first what seemed to be expensive, I have realized is not too bad since you get much more than 45 minutes out of this product. Now that I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a week, I find myself applying it after I shower as well. The minty smell and cooling feeling are very refreshing, but be forewarned that if you don&#x27;t like the smell of mint, you will not enjoy this! All in all, I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this and will most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on your skin, but I have not used long enough to see if it actually does what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> so far I like it it does smooth out skin.  It feels cold but its refreshing.  Something about this makes me put it on every day cause I can definite see some kind of change.</li>
    <li> So far i love this cream. The smell really isn&#x27;t bad, it is strong but its what you would expect from the ingredients and absorbs quickly. I love the sensation after you put it on. It actually feels like its doing something. I have only been using it for less than a week now and my skin does look firmer and feels great. I hope i keep seeing positive results!</li>
    <li> doesnt slim at all, but it feels good on sore muscles.</li>
    <li> I love this! I wish more came in the bottle. The cooling effect can be intense.</li>
    <li> I had many expensive med spa procedures done in the past, and none of them works 100%. I decided to try Cellulite Treatment after I&#x27;ve read all the wonderful reviews. They are telling the truth and it&#x27;s magical! This product is totally amazing and works great, my little love handles were secretly disappeared..., OMG I can not believe it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very strong, I thought my abs is on fire when I used the first time, and now I am on my second bottle, the burning feeling excited me because I know it&#x27;s working. Thank you Cellulite Treatment, you are a real miracle worker.</li>
    <li> Skinny Bod exceeded my expectations! No cellulite after 3 weeks ( I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have a major problem). It works well with a balanced and complete nutritional plan, a workout routine and lots of water. While using it, do not forget to use an exfoliator twice  a week.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is so smooth, and absorbs into the skin very well. I love that it is tingly as well. I don&#x27;t have terrible cellulite but I wanted to tighten my tummy after having two children. It came fast and loved the disclosure explaining the best way to use this product. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend because I have used it everyday and I do not see any difference.  I  was not pleased with that product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I need to use it longer before I can review properly - very cooling sensation which is nice but the scent seems to be very strong and medicinal smelling.  I think I need to give it more time - it might be great.</li>
    <li> The scent is very strong eucalyptus, but it feels therapeutic. As a PhD candidate I&#x27;m always scrutinizing purchases and products. This one gets a thumbs up. The feeling after putting it on my skin is a sharp cooling sensation: great for the middle of a hot day or after a noon swim.  Within a couple of days I noticed better stomach definition. I used it right before a triathlon race and my legs looked smoother in the pictures than I remember from other times.  Actually, I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for a week (forgot it when I left the country) and wished I had it with me.  Im&#x27; going to start using it again immediately before my next race.  It&#x27;s almost like it flushes the fluid padding out from under my stomach skin. :)</li>
    <li> I am almost 40 and always trying to find ways to fight cellulite and aging! Uv tried ALOT of products!! This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried by far!! Been using it almost one month and I have noticed the difference and this really works! I&#x27;m shocked in a great way!! Wished I could have parties and sell this myself! Love!!</li>
    <li> Scam! Scam! Scam! This lotion is basically a very tiny bottle of lotion laced with essential oils that warm your skin. It does nothing for cellulite or improving the appearance of your skin so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love the natural scent! I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to &amp;#34;see the difference&amp;#34; after just one use, so I was pleasantly surprised that I really could see the difference after using it overnight. I also wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any difference on the scale, but just in case I weighed myself before I went to sleep and then again when I woke up. I weighed 6 pounds less in the morning - have to think that it was influenced by this cream. I&#x27;m definitely buying another bottle when I run out. I was thinking this cream would be really nice to use during the hot summers because with the menthol it has a cooling effect. I do recommend taking it at least 2 hours before bedtime because that cooling effect might make it harder for you to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference. At the price I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, unfortunately my skin couldn&#x27;t take the affects of it. It burned real bad.</li>
    <li> Ive only used this once so far so ill update as I see progress. Its a strong scent and leaves wherever you put it extremely tingly like that of something containing menthol or peppermint oil. Very quick and prompt delivery and this company seems awesome so far. I look forward to using their product and seeing how well this cream works!</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME! It has a VERY strong smell, but it works! I feel like my cellulite has faded some. I also have been dry brushing and sugar scrubbing! I have been rubbing this on, wrapping my stomach and thighs in saran wrap, put on a tight shirt and leggings to keep it in place and then go work out! YOU WILL SWEAT SO MUCH IF YOU DO THAT! Like holy cow! I have to take off the wrap in the shower I sweat so much!</li>
    <li> I just got my product today.. I bought it because I just had a baby 5 months ago and I really want something to help with my bloating and fatigue with getting barely any sleep these days... and my stomach isn&#x27;t so pretty anymore so hopefully  it helps with that too. It feels super minty which I like and it does have a strong mint smell (doesn&#x27;t bother me,) but I feel like it&#x27;s working. I will update my review in a few weeks. I did take before pictures so I have a comparison&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I just uploaded the picture. The left is my stomach a few days after using the product twice a day ! I&#x27;m so excited with the results. I will update another picure with my results after 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve had such a hard time losing my &amp;#34;mommy pouch&amp;#34; so this is such a relief for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product *used* to be amazing. It is now a different solution and does not work whatsoever .  When I first started using this is was 2 years ago and was roughly $35 a bottle.. but it worked so good that the price was WORTH IT. now it&#x27;s $14 but it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s really unfortunate that vi-tae would even mess with this product when it used to be so amazing.</li>
    <li> Need to give it more time. It is not a miracle cream removing cellulite overnight.  It smells medicinal like noxema and peppermint.  It feels fine and seems to make skin feel a little better.  But cellulite is still there.  Perhaps in this case cellulite could be better described as plain old fat so this may have been a real challenge for any cream.</li>
    <li> this lotion is amazing... the smell is pleasant and it is very cooling to the skin, leaving it smooth and silky...</li>
    <li> Ok as soon as I opened this and smelled the peppermint scent I knew I was going to love it. The lotion also has a beige tone to it and I am one that loves when cellulite creams have that mentholated feeling to my skin. It just makes me feel like it is working and I personally prefer that. My sister in law however hates it. We all have our preferences but if you are like me, then this will make you very happy with that icy cooling effect it gives. It has only been a few days since I started using this so I will have to get back to you about the results, but my skin feel smoother.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this on my ankles when they have swelled up and are sore from a day of work. It helps the pain some how. It smells really nice too.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and has that burning/tingling feeling when applied.  So far this products is great!</li>
    <li> Very minty. So far, I like it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells. You can feel it as soon as it is applied. I put it on under my sweat belt before I work out.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed I expected this product to improve my cellulite but all it did was made my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> The smell definitely takes some getting used to.  It is a very strong menthol/peppermint smell that clears out your sinuses.  You can feel it start to tingle when you put it on and it can be a bit overwhelming.  The first time I tried it I took it off because the combination of the smell and the tingle/burn sensation was too much.  I have tried it again since then and it seems to help a bit with swelling, not quite sure about cellulite, might have to give it more of a change and use product more regularly for this result.  Overall, I would recommend, but if you have a dislike for a very strong menthol smell, I would not purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I was skeptical so I put it on my left arm to test it out, and when I woke up in the morning, held up my arms in front of the mirror, to my pleasant surprise my left arm was noticeably smaller.  I then had to put it on my right arm the next night to even myself out.  It does smell nice, very pepperminty, and feels like a muscle ache rub when you put it on.  I bought it to help tighten my skin from weight loss and it is doing that.  I definitely will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. I love the smell and the feel, but, unfortunately, I did not see any results at all.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend purchased this product and she loves it. It smells awesome and she loves the way it works. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I love the nice, cooling sensation that this gives off from the eucalyptus - I could wrap myself in that feeling all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an overweight woman who has plenty to lose - so for me it isn&#x27;t about getting that last dimple off my leg.  For me, this is about reducing the severity of my cellulite so that I can hit the beach with my kids and grandkids and not feel like everyone is looking at my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is well on its way to giving me that confidence!!  It has a fading/receding effect.  The cellulite isn&#x27;t just there one minute and not the next after using this, it is more gradual, so you&#x27;ll need a little patience....but it is so incredibly worth it.  My cellulite isn&#x27;t completely gone, but it has DEFINITELY faded, to the point where I don&#x27;t think all eyes will be on my thighs anymore.  And that feeling is absolutely priceless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. - To the creator of the product -  you should totally make this in a  larger bottle, I&#x27;d definitely get it!</li>
    <li> I used this in combination with the Vitae Firm Baby Firm lotion every night for about a month.  After the first week I started seeing results.  While the results have not been drastic, I have noticed a reduction in cellulite.  Like any woman over 30, genetically predisposed to cellulite only major surgery will rid me of it completely, but this has helped enough that short skirts are no longer embarrassing.  Please keep in mind that this is a long term product.  I stopped using it for several days and could see a difference.  Maybe in six months I will be able to go from using it every night to every few days, but for now it is fine.  Another downside is the scent.  While it is not a bad smell you will smell basically like an herbal cold lozenge.  Another thing to watch out for is that they are serious about only getting the product on the upper/inner thigh and buttock areas of your body.  I accidently got some on my lower back and had to immediately wash it off.  While not serious it was not comfortable.  Even given these drawbacks I will continue to use this product as it does work and given their competitors is rather reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I can feel the heat after a few minutes. Might be able to help.</li>
    <li> You can feel it right after you apply it on you skin. It makes the body feel very cold for around 20 minutes. I guess this is how it help to burn the calories? I suggest to use the product in summer time. :-)</li>
    <li> I love the cooling sensation of this lotion, but it does nothing for removing cellulite or tightening skin. Its also over priced for the amount you get. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Get something with caffeine and retinol in it.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice cellulite lotion!  I dry skin brush already, so I have just added this to the mix for myself.  When I put it on, it does not sit on top of the skin, but get absorbed.  I love the peppermint in it, which is an essential oil often used to stimulate.  I don&#x27;t understand how it all works, but I know it does!  I see a difference in just a few weeks - and I love the feeling of the stimulation.  It is something I will definitely continue doing!</li>
    <li> After two weeks, i notice my legs look soother!</li>
    <li> Feels very cooling and wonderful on my skin, seems to tighten everything. I have issues with water retention in my legs and this seems to assist with that as well!</li>
    <li> So excited to have found this product! When applying it makes the area chilly. I put it on the back of my thighs and it made them very cold. I&#x27;m not sure what it does but seems to be doing something. I&#x27;ll try anything for those problem areas.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It goes on so nice and not greasy at all. I&#x27;m seeing some looks in my cellulite and it&#x27;s improving. This is great!!!! I&#x27;m one happy person. This isn&#x27;t just for us females either, lol. Definitely would recommend!</li>
