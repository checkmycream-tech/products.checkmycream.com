<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am really pleased with this mirror. It extends smoothly and holds without bending.</li>
    <li> We love this. Bought this mirror for my husband.  His eyesight is poor and i wanted a nice magnifying mirror. This one is perfect. It is well made and should last for years. Would recommend to everybody.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Just what the barber ordered..</li>
    <li> Solid construction.  Better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Love how easy it was to install. Use it all the time, from putting on makeup to using 7x side to pluck my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Price is great.</li>
    <li> Got this idea from a cousin and it&#x27;s terrific to have -- almost like having an old-fashioned vanity when it&#x27;s near my medicine cabinet, which happens to be mirrored on the inside as well.  Love the look in my simple-and-slightly-vintagey cottage bathroom, as well as the functionality.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror. Easy to install, perfect magnification and the item was shipped in perfect condition. Nothing broke of cracked. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Elegant looking mirror! Mounted near the window to do makeup under natural sunlight. Easy to pull out for use and push in to hide behind the curtain. A great idea, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality and well made mirror!  It is very solid and looks as though it is an expensive piece.  I recommend purchasing this item!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite purchases.it is made so well,and looks so attractive in my bathroom. I mounted it across my medicine cabinet mirror,and I can style the back of my hair with ease</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror I have ever bought. We have a small bathroom and were able to mount it on the wall directly accross from the vanity mirror. With te flexibility of positions, I can do my hair hands free and never have to worry about dropping another hand mirror again.</li>
    <li> The mirror works well, holds it&#x27;s position and is of great use.</li>
    <li> way to heavy for installation without accessing a stud</li>
    <li> Very easy to install.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Was precisely what I was looking for.  Mounted easily.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this mirror.  I love that it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. That it&#x27;s more substantial than any I&#x27;ve seen before, excellent workmanship in the making, easy for me to install, and a sweet n low price tag..I hate that I can now see every flaw I possess!  Seriously though this mirror is a thing of beauty and now I can see well enough, without leaning over the sink, that I can work on my own in comfort.</li>
    <li> The mirror is a good size, it feels very durable, the magnification is good, maybe too good because I can see all the flaws in my reflection!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one installed and I love it. I&#x27;ve installed them in all of our homes and even friends homes. Good stuff</li>
    <li> This mirror is the perfect addition to my new bathroom. It&#x27;s very flexible to move and position just right for applying make up and getting up close when needed. I love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for the IKEA FR&amp;Auml;CK mirror, better quality too. The top and bottom screw hole placement are identical to the Ikea model, but the screws are slightly longer.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works great!</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality mirror at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase, it was really easy to install and seems very sturdy. I like all the directions it&#x27;s able to pull out and swivel. I wish they had a lighted version like this because then it would have been perfect.</li>
    <li> My product arrived in great condition and in just a few short days from when I ordered it. I&#x27;m loving it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Mirror could have been larger in size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this expandable mirror for my newly remodeled bathroom and I&#x27;m very pleased with both the look and functionality.  It installed easily, although my husband added an additional washer for support, since the cabinet wall wasn&#x27;t too thick.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Doing my hair is a breeze now!!! These should come standard in every home. The quality is amazing.  The mirror is very sturdy with weight...meaning to say it&#x27;s not flimsy...do not hesitate to buy!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 of these and they both came busted. no thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mirror, but it is larger than I thought which required me to return it.  Remember to check the location where the mirror is to go before ordering.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror. It has great X7 magnification, a good reach and is of good quality. My only down on it is that when its pulled out to use, it sways back to the wall. I have to make sure its in just the right spot to use so it doesnt sway. Add a lock of some sort to hold it there.</li>
    <li> Much sturdier than the Ikea version, totally worth the money. Mirror stays where you put it. My face in the 7x zoom side is something I never, ever want to see, but the normal side is perfect.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror - heavy and good quality. Looks great in our bath, and so easy to see for makeup, contacts, etc. Mounting hardware is nice and substantial, but easy to install.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted. Really like the extension arm. Pull it, use it, then push it out of the way.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty product, mounted easily, and feels very secure and sturdy. I love it and shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> Great product, better than I expected. Sturdy and has the expensive feel to it.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror...easy to hang...very sturdy...I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Received fast!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! I finally got it mounted in my bathroom. It&#x27;s beautiful, sturdy and fits right in with my 50s decor.</li>
    <li> I love love love this mirror!!!! Easy to install and just the perfect size for my wall.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to replace an IKEA swivel mirror that I absolutely loved. Very pleased and surprised with how sturdy and well built this mirror is. The screw that connects the mirror to the extension is very solid and tight ( the one on the IKEA model loosened easily and made the mirror wobbly) and the magnification is greater.  The mirror itself is a little larger but physically the entire unit takes about the same amount of space as the old one. Because of a beefier construction it&#x27;s easier to move out of the way and have it stay ( the old one tended to creep back!). Extremely happy with quality and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This mirror was purchased to replace one we had in our bathroom. The old model had rusted over the years. We wanted something exactly like what we had without the rust of course! This is even better than our original. It is heavy duty, looks great and can be mounted two ways. This is everything we wanted!</li>
    <li> Mirror was exactly what I expected and easy to install.  I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a non-lighted mirror, since my bathroom gets a lot of natural light. This one is just the right size and magnification. Infinitely adjustable. And it was very easy to hang!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. It&#x27;s huge! The magnification is almost scary. I can see things I never knew were there. :)</li>
    <li> My wife liked this mirror so much that we ordered a second for our vacation getaway.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the product and would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> High quality product. Well built, smooth mechanical operation. I wish they had a model with smaller mirror for tight spaces.</li>
    <li> Great product, meets all our needs, easy to install and looks great on the wall, would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at the quality and size of this magnifying mirror since the price was so reasonable. It exceeded my expectations. Installation was easy and it extends and retracts with ease.[[ASIN:B00LKSXA6W DecoBros 8-Inch Two-Sided Extension Wall Mount Mirror with 7x Magnification, 13.5-Inch Extension, Chrome]]</li>
    <li> The quality is good.  Hanging up was easy and fast. I&#x27;m happy with it for the most part. Not 5 stars because the arm is loose so it swings and won&#x27;t stay in one spot.</li>
    <li> Very useful, good-looking mirror.</li>
    <li> solid product, easy to mount, drilled into the stud, works great, the wife uses it everyday</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror to use when shaving.  My wife also uses it for putting on makeup.  It was very easy to mount especially because I had a stud in the wall where I wanted to install this.  To top it off this mirror looks great too.</li>
    <li> Great value for the $</li>
    <li> solid product that does its job well</li>
    <li> This thing is HEAVY, and there&#x27;s no way I can install it by myself, it&#x27;s got a recessed hanger (fits into the back of what shows up front) you have to install first and then hang the actual aperture attached to the mirror over that???? Don&#x27;t like the design.</li>
    <li> Seems well made and heavy. It was a little larger than I had envisioned but that&#x27;s me and not the product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I imagined.  It arrived in perfect condition.  I installed it in about 15 minutes with E-ZAncor Drywall &amp; Stud hardware.  The studs were not where I wanted to hang it and the E-ZAncors work great and are so easy to use with drywall or studs.  Believe us when we say the mirror and mount is heavy.  A secret:  In the directions it says if you need metal wall anchors, they are not included. Plastic wall anchors are included.  Mirror is &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; with no distortion.  The price is great for this mirror.  It looks kind of retro.  Love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had the opportunity to communicate with DecoBros&#x27; customer service and they are exactly that, Customer Service.  They handled my questions immediately.</li>
    <li> Good value and very easy to install.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to install.  Exactly what we were looking for to install in our bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, well packaged.  The only negative is that it did not come with the screws, etc., to hang it.  I had to make a trip to the hardware store.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item so I could trim the hair on the back of my neck without help. It was easy to install it is very sturdy and well manufactured I&#x27;m sure it will last for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Bought a house where the mirrors where on the sides of the sink instead of the front. This was the perfect solution for my morning shave.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to our bathroom for shaving!</li>
    <li> Now that I bought this Deco mirror I don&#x27;t mind putting on makeup. And, the public thanks Deco also!  I love how it extends and of course, the magnifying is fantastic and easy installation. You will not regret buying this one.</li>
    <li> Everything was great. I do wish the screws were labelled, as I am home improvement impaired</li>
    <li> Very nice!! It&#x27;s beautiful! I would definitely recommend it. I would definitely buy it again. Shipped quickly and was packed well. Very good price! I love it!</li>
    <li> NO FLIPPING INSTRUCTIONS!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Looks great &amp; love the extension and tilt features!</li>
    <li> ...and I like the deco look.</li>
    <li> Well built and easily installed.  High quality mirror.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, works great</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror.  Mounted easy and looks very nice!</li>
    <li> quality and easy install</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, JUST WHAT I NEEDED</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Better than I thought it&#x27;d be for the price.</li>
    <li> I love it, easy installation, great product.</li>
    <li> Great value, well made and easy to move.  I will get lots of use out of this.</li>
    <li> Received today. Have not mounted yet, but quality is terrific for the price. Very sturdy and magnification is perfect. Would recommend. Fits flatly against wall next to my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Love it, Looks great- easy to install</li>
    <li> This replaced another mirror I had which was not as good.</li>
    <li> Great product, gret quality and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> extremely nice, sturdy and good magnification...glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Very pretty, fun for wife&#x27;s daily ritual! Easy install!</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror!  It&#x27;s just as described, looks very attractive and it is very well made!  I was not expecting much for $20 but this product exceeded my expectations by far!  The mirror quality is also very good, and there is no distortion in either the plain or magnified side. The installation is very easy too.  I will be buying another one for another bathroom!</li>
    <li> As other purchasers have noted, this is a high-quality product and a good value. The 7x magnification comes in handy.</li>
    <li> Primo quality. Good product!</li>
    <li> Too much magnification.  Distorts reflection way too much to be useful.  Well made otherwise.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, was packaged very well. I  was very happy with the quality of this mirror. Was much more than I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> I had always wanted an articulating mirror for seeing the back of my head while combing my hair and this one does the job well. And the magnifying side shows details you might miss otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  Mounting was easy &amp; great price too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend.  she loves it and I like the fact it lays flat on the wall without getting in my way.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2, one for me, one fore my husband.  Was concerned about shipping - if the mirrors would arrive in one piece - They were PERFECT!! He installed them easily enough without any issues. Now I can see what I&#x27;m doing without glasses! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> In one word &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Got one for the wife and it is amazing, daughter in law loved it so much we got her one for Mothers Day. Quality product, solid, heavy, well made.</li>
    <li> THE MIRROR WAS A GIFT.  IT ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION, AND MY FRIEND IS HAPPY WITH IT.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED EXTENSION MIRRORS FOR 30 YEARS, AND ALWAYS ENJOY SHARING WITH MY FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually gotten the mirror hung up yet so it&#x27;s hard to give it a rating. It was bigger than I had anticipated but that&#x27;s not a problem. It looks VERY impressive and I&#x27;m sure that I will like it. The maginification is perfect.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted. Best price.</li>
    <li> Just installed a similar Jerdon for a friend and this Deco for my wife. The Deco Brothers model is slightly nicer and seems to be made a wee bit better. Both come with long enough screws to hold the mirror firmly if they&#x27;re set into a wall stud. The plastic wall anchors for mounting on sheet rock provided by both companies are totally useless. I installed mine with toggle bolts This means that secure installation will likely require a trip to the hardware store.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very easy to install and easy to use. I did use toggle bolts rather that the plastic anchors that were included. Maybe that was overkill, but it is very sturdy. The scissor extension mechanism was stiff the first few times I used it, but it easy to move now(about a week later). I love that I can flip from a regular mirror to magnified side.  I was slightly concerned that 7x magnification wouldn&#x27;t be enough as I was used to 10x, but I can see easily without glasses to put on eye makeup. Sadly, it does show every line, every enlarged poor or blackhead. Maybe it should include a warning that overuse could lead to fantasies of Botox and or professional facials.</li>
    <li> Excellent item to have in a small area...woud recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This mirror was exactly what my wife wanted in our bathroom.  During a recent trip to the Dominican Republic our room was equipped with a similar style mirror, so of course the adding of a mirror to our new home landed upon my &amp;#34;Honey-Do List&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;After some searching around the local Home Stores I gave up.  Then thought, I wonder if I can find one online?&lt;br /&gt;The mirror was easier to install then I though it would be, the packaging was beyond what I would have assumed, excellent.  It folds nicly out of the way when Not in use, and pulls easily to extend beyond the sink when needed. My wife is about a foot shorter than myself, however the tilting allows us both to use the mirror quite easily.  Makes putting my contacts in much simpler, and her make-up application time has decreased by about 50%.  (Not that she really needs it)</li>
    <li> the telescoping arm does not stay put as much as I would have hoped but it very helpful nontheless</li>
    <li> Well-made. Easy to install. Looks very high end. No complaints :)</li>
    <li> A well constructed item. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to install.  Better than my previous mirror.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> the best mirror I have every came across and my wife loves it!... Thank You</li>
    <li> It fit the spot. It&#x27;s what I needed. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality....price quite reasonable.  Was completely satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> Great mirror! Love it! Easy installation too. Love the clarity of the magnifying side and the wide array of adjustments you can make. This exactly what I wanted. Good product at a good price. On time delivery also.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the money. I have seen many other similar ones at extremely higher costs. This does the job and is attractive and well made.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement to a similar mirror I had purchased which fell apart. This mirror is significantly better made and was 30% less expensive than the first one I had. Don&#x27;t let the low price scare you off.</li>
    <li> Quality product, worked out great for our application</li>
    <li> I had searched for quite awhile for this mirror, and it was just what I was looking for.  Easy to install, easy to use and folds compactly to the wall.  Arrived on time and in excellent packaging.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, well-packed, easy to install, a bit heavy but seems to be of high quality.</li>
    <li> Have been searching for an extension mirror for my husband.  Just what we wanted.  Excellent!  Amazon has everything!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC, just as other reviewers had said. Heavy-duty and well-made, goes perfectly with the rest of my master bath remodel!</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived on time in perfect condition. Although I am actually sending this back for a smaller version (my fault for not measuring properly), the mirror looked awesome, solid construction and I wish that it fit in the spot I planned for it.</li>
    <li> Better than anticipated; easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to install. I use it with our regular bathroom mirror so that I can see to style the back of my hair.</li>
    <li> Had it a week.  So far so good.  This is a heavy and I suspect durable product.  My first impression is great.  So long as over time it does not rust or corrode and cleans up well, which it appears it will, I&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
    <li> The mirror was easy to install, works as anticipated and is quite easy to reposition.</li>
    <li> Seems like a very good product but I returned it because it was so heavy.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror too big for our bathroom</li>
    <li> Good mirror for the price</li>
    <li> The quality of this item was way beyond my expectations. It is the best thing I have ever bought online and it will be used a lot. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Too much magnification for me.  Expandable section a bit stiff.  Got a simpler 5x design instead.</li>
    <li> This is a good, high quality mirror as others have stated. You will want to mount this on a stud if you have drywall because it is seriously heavy.  And be sure the mounting plate is exactly vertical. If you just eyeball it like I did, and it is a bit off, the mirror will be off balance and not hold its position.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty; easy to install and looks great!</li>
    <li> Love it! Such a big help! And was so easy to put up!</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror! Easy install... 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Love love love it! Worth much more than the price.&lt;br /&gt;Shopped around and found one at BBB for double the price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I also love Amazon prime for fast delivery! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Like a previous reviewer, I previously owned the Ikea version of this mirror, and I liked it a lot.  That&#x27;s why I decided to buy this style mirror to add to my newly remodeled bathroom.  I have to say, it&#x27;s an incredible value.  It&#x27;s a large mirror and very substantial.  The mounting system makes this so easy to put up.  The bracket attaches to the wall with three screws, and then the mirror itself attaches to the bracket without the need of tools.  It looks very expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror, high quality glass, heavy weight so good metal. Amplification of 7X is actually just perfect for seeing pores and hairs etc.. :-)</li>
    <li> Well built and mounted easily. Would certainly buy other items from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often bother to write a review, but felt I needed to in this case. I was very surprised at the size and quality of this mirror. Made in China - I figured I was going to get a small flimsy item. But no! I still can&#x27;t get over the size of this thing, and the quality is superb. Heavy weight &amp; very well made. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this - you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> a little larger than i expected, but good quality</li>
    <li> Amazing! The quality was unexpectedly amazing. Look and feel of a $100. mirror. Bought a few more for friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Easy to hang and folds in and out with no problem. Loving it.</li>
    <li> Nicely built, hasn&#x27;t fallen apart and was easy to install. It&#x27;s a bathroom mirror, what more can you say?</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this mirror as our similar IKEA FR&amp;Auml;CK mirror came unscrewed and shattered. While more expensive, this mirror is far superior. It appears to be of a higher quality as expected and is much thicker and sturdier than it&#x27;s Ikea counterpart. The magnification appears to be stronger as well. The top and bottom screw hole placement is identical to the Ikea model, but the base was wider, so I wasn&#x27;t able to take advantage of reusing the holes as I had hoped, but that was because I placed the old one next to the edge of the cabinet (My fault). Items of note not included in the description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three mounting points for extra security&lt;br /&gt;Comes with mounting hardware (3 short wood screws and 3 drywall anchor/screws)</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I needed. Only had it for a week but i like it a lot. Hope it is a durable product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted. Heavily made, packaged well. Good value.</li>
    <li> Really really nice mirror! Wasn&#x27;t sure what it would be like since the price is so good and I have to say it is heavy duty and not cheap at all. The mirror is big and I am so happy I went w this one.</li>
    <li> Great shaving accessory !</li>
    <li> Great, well&#x3D;made mirror.  Heavy chrome, looks and feels like quality</li>
    <li> Nice quality, heavy duty, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This item will not disappoint.  The quality is quite good.  We installed the three point (screw) mounting plate on a stud with the supplied mounting screws, and it is VERY solidly mounted.  It is mounted so that it is opposite a wall mirror, and can be infinitely adjustable for great back of head or side angles with its four-way angle adjustment, and in addition also has a magnified side (7x magnification).  Truly a woman&#x27;s dream accessory for doing hair and makeup.</li>
    <li> Got mirror for shaving. We have in our bathroom one of those corner angled mirrors. Great for small bathroom. Not so good for shaving. Hard to see the left side of the face, I use a straight razor, or a double edged safety razor. It is much easier to shave when I can look straight into the mirror rather than having to lean over or sit on the sick to look in to the corner mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror was easy to install and works great. Comes with 3 drywall screws, you only need 2 but nice to have an extra one. You unscrew bracket from mirror  figure out where you want the mirror to be installed. Drill holes in the wall Put bracket up then screw in the screws to attach the bracket.&lt;br /&gt;The screw the mirror mount onto the bracket. Super easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I wish it did was move up and down as well as toward and away from you. With various heights of family members it would be nice to be able to adjust the height. Other than that its a great mirror for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/24/2017: Still works great after almost 2 years. Upgrading to 5 stars. Have had no problems with it at all. Still use it when shaving  and love it.</li>
    <li> What a great value - fast delivery, easy to install and a very good product</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! It is great quality</li>
    <li> Solid quality and well made.  The accordion type extension is sturdy. The joints are not too loose or too tight.  The 8&amp;#34; mirror is just the right size too.  Put these qualities together and combine it with a reasonable price, you can&#x27;t afford not to consider buying this over the other wall mount mirrors.</li>
    <li> Much heavier and nicer quality than I expected!  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made and sturdy. The magnifying mirror is great, very clear.</li>
    <li> wife thinks its great</li>
