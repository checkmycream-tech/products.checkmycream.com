      <li>Was excited to try this.  </li>
      <li>I have tried applying lidocaine gel an hour before treatment and it does help, but I prefer to treat a clean face without any gels or creams on it.  </li>
      <li>It was not painful to me at all.</li>

      <li>It is worthy.</li>

      <li>To my surprise the first time I used I already saw a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Have fun and remember what my grandmother used to say &amp;</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m satisfied...</li>
      <li>The prospect of having healthy clear skin works as a painkiller for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping:  It came fairly quickly (hey, I&#x27;m in Iraq-can&#x27;t expect much!)</li>
      <li>my skin is in pretty good shape with minimal wrinles.  </li>
      <li>it is SO easy to make before/after shots look like a complete trasformation!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I decided to go with the \\&quot;every day for the first 4 - 7 days, then once every 3-4 weeks\\&quot; approach.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t too much work to it at all-even a caveman could do it!  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t too much work to it at all-even a caveman could do it!  </li>
      <li>this is not the most romantic way to get rid of wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>The prodect does exactly what it implies, but make no mistake..</li>
      <li>I used some of my leftover lidocaine (numbing) cream prior to using the micro needle (okay,</li>
      <li>I used it the first day before I went to bed</li>
      <li>Best kept secret ladies and gentleman!</li>
      <li>Use lidocane burn cream first, then roll your face and put on your retin a and moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Bought this to help with fine lines and skin tone in general.  </li>
      <li>Let me first tell you that I am VERY pain tolerant.</li>
      <li>As for wrinkles, not so much yet.</li>
      <li>It really works,and it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
      <li>I have to admit, I was very nervous when I recieved this item.</li>
      <li>You really see results.  </li>
      <li>and you really start to see real changes.  </li>
      <li>No matter what I use, how much I use, nothing has ever worked for me.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;deep 11\\&quot; lines between my brow are significantly shorter in length and they are farther apart than before I began treatment.  </li>
      <li>It is packaged decently in a sturdy plastic case.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this particular microneedle for anyone.</li>
      <li>I have high hopes and do think it will help in time.</li>
      <li>If you are going to use this-I highly recommend that you do your research before using.  </li>
      <li>you are going to use this-I highly recommend that you do your research before using.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels thicker and more firm.  </li>
      <li>They are all pretty much the same.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure skin type/thickness is a factor and some should use it less frequently.  </li>
      <li>and they are pretty deep ones.</li>
      <li>Total garbage, which is exactly where it ended up.</li>
      <li>I will try, go through ANYTHING to have clear skin.</li>
      <li>I am thinking if i keep using this until my skin is completely clear, it should resolve my acne problem.  </li>
      <li>Wow, I had this procedure done at a doctor, which cost me $200.  </li>
      <li>I see no difference there, but I know it is early</li>
      <li>As far as pain goes, I&#x27;m not gonna lie:  </li>
      <li>Have had no issues thus far.    </li>
      <li>ive been using it for weeks with no effect, but im positive its because the needles are too short and are not penetrating deeply enough.</li>
      <li>but really it doesn&#x27;t, at least not to me; some areas feel a little more sensitive than others but not any big deal.  </li>
      <li>Oh well, at least it was cheap.  </li>
      <li>for a moisturizer, I suggest just using a product you already have at home...or a product that worked for you after the first few uses but just stopped having its spark, because skin has the ability to get use to a product, and since youre essentially poking tiny holes into your skin, the amount you will absorb after your microneedle treatment will be about 60% more than usual.</li>
      <li>So please be clear, the actual treatment works, this product</li>
      <li>the only thing I have noticed is that when I use it, sometimes I will get a clear water drop on my face.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get rid of the red marks all over my face from old acne...</li>
      <li>The formerly large purple stretch marks on my hips are now a lot smaller, and definitely have a whole lot less color to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are tiny little blood spots on my inner thighs, although these are not painful at all.  </li>
      <li>There are tiny little blood spots on my inner thighs, although these are not painful at all.  </li>
      <li>it barely penetrates the skin and its not enough to cause the skin to react in any way.</li>

    <li> Wow, I had this procedure done at a doctor, which cost me $200.  I got the same results doing it myself for a fraction of the cost!! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a dangerous knock off!!! It did not come with instructions so I contacted the company and they told me it is not their product but an imposter made in China.  This size needle should only be used by a doctor and if not used correctly with antiseptic steps and prescribed after care it is very dangerous.  I can&#x27;t believe Amazon is allowing this product on their site!!!</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about this product for awhile now, and finally decided to give it a shot after visiting a few micro-needle websites to gather information.  Of course, I was a bit skeptical-becuase it is SO easy to make before/after shots look like a complete trasformation!&lt;br /&gt;Well, put it this way-try it and see for yourself!  I have bought the micro-dermabrasion kits, had facials-you name it!  I am currently in Iraq right now, and the wind and dust and everything else here makes your skin just awful, even if your skin is normally flawles. I was just about at my wits end when I decided to give this little tool a shot.  OMG.  Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply rub it over your skin (with minimal pressure) and it does the work for you.  You can literally hear your skin \\&quot;popping\\&quot; as it is creating \\&quot;holes\\&quot; to stimulate collagen growth.  I have stretch marks on my hips, thighs, and breasts and decided to see if this would work.  It does!  The formerly large purple stretch marks on my hips are now a lot smaller, and definitely have a whole lot less color to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you are looking into getting a micro-needle, don&#x27;t hesitate.  It is SO worth the time and small cost that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping:  It came fairly quickly (hey, I&#x27;m in Iraq-can&#x27;t expect much!) and in a box. Inside the box was an airtight case containing the product.  Over the needles were small styrofoam and tape to ensure sterility.  I felt so confident that this product had shipped here without issue that I immediately used it without question.  Sure, it probably wasn&#x27;t the safest thing...but I didn&#x27;t feel as if this was a bad decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain:  I also epilate (love it!) so I have plenty of lidocaine related products purchased before I realized that epilating really isn&#x27;t that bad at all.  Lol.  I used some of my leftover lidocaine (numbing) cream prior to using the micro needle (okay, I admit it-I&#x27;m really afraid of pain!)  and I noticed that it really wasn&#x27;t that bad at all.  Someone else described it as \\&quot;annoying.\\&quot;  I find it easy to bear, and of course keep in mind that some parts of your body are more sensitive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: I have a bowl that I put isopropyl alcohol in after use of the micro-needle.  Have had no issues thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After effect:  There are tiny little blood spots on my inner thighs, although these are not painful at all.  On my face, it feels a tiny bit burned, but I am also in the middle of July in Iraq....so that does sort of hold a huge weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to use this-I highly recommend that you do your research before using.  There isn&#x27;t too much work to it at all-even a caveman could do it!  Just remember ladies, pain is beauty!  lol-seriously though-it isn&#x27;t that bad at all.  For the results I have gotten, I would have gone through a lot worse than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hannahomeone else described it as \\&quot;annoying.\\&quot;  I find it easy to bear, and of course keep in mind that some parts of your body are more sensitive than others.

    <li> Was excited to try this.  This thing HURTS like a motherf....er!  Bought it to use on my upper arm...Whoever who told you that its painless is lying to you.  It feels almost like getting a tattoo!  Not to mention the extreme itching you experience the next day after using!  Aparently excessive itching IS normal!  Complete waste in my opinion.  And I think it made my skin darker!  Oh well, at least it was cheap.  I didn&#x27;t feel bad throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> if you have average to thick skin or tough skin and are interested in one of these, get one longer than the 1mm. it barely penetrates the skin and its not enough to cause the skin to react in any way. ive been using it for weeks with no effect, but im positive its because the needles are too short and are not penetrating deeply enough. also, the product comes with extremely basic directions on the box. it could use more thorough instructions.</li>
    <li> I use this micro needle together with hyaluronic acid (also bought through Amazon) twice a week for almost a month and can say that I have visual results as pore reduction and face complexion improving. This is painful, really painful, and it is really better to use in some humid environment because otherwise a skin becomes dry and rough, which might disappear after 5-7 time. The prospect of having healthy clear skin works as a painkiller for me. So I plan to buy 1,5mm needle soon. Great idea, great product, great result.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with horrible adult acne.  I have tried everything and nothing works.  I tried this as my final hope and attempt.  Within one day of using i noticed my acne decreased by 50%.  By day 4 it was decreased down by 80%.  I skipped a couple of days and they started coming back. I am thinking if i keep using this until my skin is completely clear, it should resolve my acne problem.  I also noticed that my skin is brighter healthier and tighter looking.  Others have noticed it as well.  I have creases on my forehead that this product claims to fix.  It has not really changed the appearance of the creases.  I am soo happy that my skin and my pores look great.  I am giving this only three becuase it already broke after 6 uses.  The roller sticks.  So if you can imagine a roller with pins sticking as you are rolling it across your face, it is painful.  It does not work as well since its not working properly. So please be clear, the actual treatment works, this product not so good cuz it broke. I am going to look at purchasing one that is more better made.  I think I need to spend the money and get the gold plated one.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was very nervous when I recieved this item. I was expecting it to hurt alot. I took a deep breath and dove in..lol. It was not painful to me at all. the only thing that happened was when I used it on my forehead, it made me sneeze! (I know..weird!) I have only been using it for about a week, Every other day. I have noticed that my skin tone had evened out and looks refreshed, almost glows. It looks very healthy. As for wrinkles, not so much yet. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles except between the brows. I see no difference there, but I know it is early and they are pretty deep ones. I have high hopes and do think it will help in time. Maybe I should have gotten 3mm since this one doesn&#x27;t hurt. I have not drawn blood at all..the only thing I have noticed is that when I use it, sometimes I will get a clear water drop on my face. Maybe it dug deep and cleaned some pores. Not sure what that is all about. I use neutrogena wrinkle cream afterwards. I will try to update as time goes on....</li>
    <li> You really see results.  Use lidocane burn cream first, then roll your face and put on your retin a and moisturizer.  You will see improvement the next day.  Do it once a week and you really start to see real changes.  For scarring, wrinkles, and skin tone.  It is painful tho!!!</li>
    <li> The microneedle came looking just as I thought it would. It is packaged decently in a sturdy plastic case. It is easy to use and seems durable. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice results.</li>
    <li> I bought it to help with acne scars and sun damage. I was reading the .03m is small so i got the 1m. the needles are to long for the face, i needed the smaller ones. Not sure why I gave it a 3 star, but maybe cause i can&#x27;t think of any other way to use it. So do some research and find out what type you are going to need. I wish it could have posts about what size needles do what. So to the back of the drawer it goes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like finding the Needle in a hay stack (literally!!). Seriously you can forget all about laser, peels, Microdermabrasion ...this beats it all. Best part it&#x27;s in the convenience of your own home. I heard about this a while ago and decided to give it a try. To my surprise the first time I used I already saw a huge difference. I&#x27;ve tried it all (have acne scars, big pores, you name it) and this seriously stood up to the test. I now ordered the Micro Needle Roller 3.00mm Titanium to go to work on my chest and thighs. I wouldn&#x27;t go crazy picking the most expensive one. They are all pretty much the same. It&#x27;s in the needle size, so pick one 0.25mm - 3.0mm, depending on how severe your skin type is. The titanium seems to penetrate deeper and last longer (for the larger areas I figure). Anyway hope this help. Best kept secret ladies and gentleman! I don&#x27;t intend to tell any of my girlfriends ..just let them wonder why I am so beautifully glowing ;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how I had came across the microneedle to begin with.  I was actually blown away that I hadnt discovered it sooner.  I can&#x27;t get rid of the red marks all over my face from old acne...its so horrible.  No matter what I use, how much I use, nothing has ever worked for me. Sure i&#x27;ve conquered breakouts for the most part.  I&#x27;m 22 now so they only show up under extreme stress or around that time of the month.  I will try, go through ANYTHING to have clear skin. My life long dream has been to walk out of the house with NO MAKEUP.  So I did my research and decided to get one of the cheaper models of the microneedle *just in case it was a fluke* and I received it about 5 days later in the mail.  Let me first tell you that I am VERY pain tolerant. I have 13 tattoos, I&#x27;ve had my septum pierced twice and my lip pierced twice as well..I do DIY brazilian&#x27;s monthly...so just to give you an idea of how tough a cookie I am...this microneedle brings tears to my eyes.  It is the most annoying and irritating pain i&#x27;ve ever felt.  but I would do it three times a day everyday for the REST OF MY LIFE if I had to.  because this THING WORKS.  I have never woke up and looked in the mirror to be pleased at the reflection.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 12 days.  I used it the first day before I went to bed and I waited one day and did it again...then I waited 2 days and did it again...so in total ive only used it 3 times.  but the spots are fading and I can&#x27;t begin to imagine what it will look like in 2 months.  I use my toner combined with a drop of argan oil for moisture after each use. for a moisturizer, I suggest just using a product you already have at home...or a product that worked for you after the first few uses but just stopped having its spark, because skin has the ability to get use to a product, and since youre essentially poking tiny holes into your skin, the amount you will absorb after your microneedle treatment will be about 60% more than usual. hands down. the best thing I have ever discovered.  I actually just went into the bathroom and looked at my face again.  AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve never felt better and its on been 12 days.  Please do yourself a favor and get this.  I would put my life on it that this WILL WORK for you.</li>
    <li> Works great! If you are buying for face use 0.5 it&#x27;s not as painful to use.[[ASIN:B002JW64IY Derma Microneedle Skin Roller - Derma Microneedle Skin Roller - DERMA1.0DERMA1.0]]</li>
    <li> I have had this for just over a week and am very impressed with the results.  I know there is some controversy over frequency of use.  I decided to go with the \\&quot;every day for the first 4 - 7 days, then once every 3-4 weeks\\&quot; approach.  Using it for days in a row has been fine for me.  I&#x27;m sure skin type/thickness is a factor and some should use it less frequently.  The \\&quot;deep 11\\&quot; lines between my brow are significantly shorter in length and they are farther apart than before I began treatment.  The trenches across my forehead have diminished.  I have a tiny mark beneath my eye that has noticeably moved its way upward as has also become lighter.  My skin feels thicker and more firm.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results as time goes on.  I did have some tiny dots of blood on the forehead area, but it was very, very minor.  As far as pain goes, I&#x27;m not gonna lie:  It hurts.  I have tried applying lidocaine gel an hour before treatment and it does help, but I prefer to treat a clean face without any gels or creams on it.  It seems to be less painful with each use.   I will never be without this roller.  I&#x27;m very satisfied after just one week.</li>
    <li> Used only 2X b/c of the pain. Guess I&#x27;ve got to set my mind to using it 2 c the outcome.</li>
    <li> Works great if you love to roll needles over your skin.  Micro needles should be renamed torture device.  Forget water boarding.. Arm the military with this sucker!  Buy some numbing gel or invest in a big bottle of booze. lol The prodect does exactly what it implies, but make no mistake.. this is not the most romantic way to get rid of wrinkles.  It hurts!  Have fun and remember what my grandmother used to say &amp;#34;You have to suffer to be beautiful&amp;#34;! lol Suck it up, buttercup or move on to Botox!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used 3 times &amp; am already seeing great results!!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will look after repeated rolling!</li>
    <li> Bought this to help with fine lines and skin tone in general.  Have to say that at 58 y.o. my skin is in pretty good shape with minimal wrinles.  Was a little worried that this was going to hurt but really it doesn&#x27;t, at least not to me; some areas feel a little more sensitive than others but not any big deal.  I use this twice a week, in the evening after washing my face, and apply a serum and moisturizer on afterwards.  I feel that my skin looks more vibrant since using and maybe it&#x27;s too soon to tell but hoping it will even out some areas where there are crumply looking patches below outer lip area on each side.  So far I&#x27;m satisfied... have only been using for about 3 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I tried it for three weeks now. I like the results. I am going to buy another one . I think I am going to try 2.0 now. It really works,and it doesn&#x27;t cost much. Especially when you have to replace it after 4-5 weeks. It is worthy.</li>
    <li> I have uploaded a picture in the Customer Image section of this product. I have used a similar product that is used in Chinese medicine and I have included both products in the photo. In China, it is called Plum-blossom needles/ Dermal needles/ seven star needles (you could use these keywords to search for more information online). In Chinese medicine, the Plum-blossom needles could be used for improving the skin texture. It could also be used to cure myopia, baldness and joint problems. Most of the times, doctors specialized in Plum-blossom needles perform the procedure. Sometimes patients could also do the procedure at home by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used for improving skin texture, the theory is that the needles by going over the skin will accelerate blood circulation. Some reviewer mentioned that they put serums after the procedure, this is not recommended in Chinese medicine because the serums could cause skin infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dos:&lt;br /&gt;-use rubbing alcohol to disinfect the needles, your skin before and AFTER the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;-after the treatment, do not go outside and do not let wind blow over the treated area; do NOT apply any creams/ toner until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;-In China, the procedure is recommended to practice DAILY for the best result. Some reviews mentioned that they do this procedure monthly, I doubt it will have any effect when the interval between procecures are that long.</li>
    <li> This product did not come with care instructions or anything so I had to search it on the internet. I took care of it just as I read, and the needles rusted. VERY dangerous. I do not recommend this particular microneedle for anyone. Total garbage, which is exactly where it ended up.</li>
    <li> Love them, great gifts, looking forward to seeing great results any age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good value, for the cost, affordable for all.</li>
    <li> My roller has two pins that are longer than the rest and it drives me crazy.  If it was made better I think I would use it more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review something that does not ship when it&#x27;s supposed to.  But, here goes.  I saw zero change in my skin from the time before they billed me, to the time after they billed me for a product that wasn&#x27;t included in the shipment.  No, perhaps I have an extra frown line now.</li>
    <li> I should have been prepared for the pain, but nothing can prepare you for that. I clinched my teeth for using it on my face expecting at least some dramatic results. But I can&#x27;t say that I detected any, few days later. The best result I think was between my eye brows, where I have somewhat prominent wrinkle. Apart from that, not really. The pain is just not worth it, to my opinion. And I couldn&#x27;t find any care instructions. Are you supposed to wash it or soak in alcohol? Are you supposed to use any numbing ointments?</li>
    <li> Everyone should have a roller... they are a miracle stick!!!! They help with reducing acne scars and with the use of TCA peel they will eventually dissappear...</li>
