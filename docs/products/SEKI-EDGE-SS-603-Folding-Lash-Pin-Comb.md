<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lash comb, best one I&#x27;ve ever owned! I love the fact that it folds into itself, so no more broken tines! Careful, though, this is not just one of those plastic combs you can just hurry and comb through with, it&#x27;s got some seriously great pins that really separate all of your lashes! (I&#x27;ve learned my lesson a couple of times after poking myself in the eye NOT to hurry with these)! The great part is, you don&#x27;t have to hurry. One or two times through, and you&#x27;re done!</li>
    <li> I bought to separate my lashes after applying mascara, but found that it just pulled the mascara off with it. I guess it does an okay job though.</li>
    <li> Really separates lashes. Bit it is so sharp, that I have to be careful. (Have stabbed self in eye several times now--and don&#x27;t know if neat lashes are worth the risk. (But my lashes are thick, so I needed this--plastic won&#x27;t work &amp; the teeth always break, right?)  ;*)&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s foreign; feels glamorous when getting ready in a.m.</li>
    <li> Very handy, small teeth and folding design make this a sure winner.  It declumps amd separates eyelashes quickly for a flawless finish.  Cleaning is a snap with makeup remover pads or washing in the sink under warm water.  Folding design keeps the teeth safe from being bent or broken in storage.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!!   Bought one for myself and then another for my daughter.  She had a cheaper version with plastic teeth.  Night and day difference in performance.  Wish I had had one of these years ago!  Love the fact that it has a built in protective cover to protect the teeth.</li>
    <li> Perfect for separating lashes &amp; removing globs after applying mascara. So much better to have the metal pins instead of the cheaper plastic ones on the reverse side of a brush. Of course, anytime one is working around the eyes, care must be taken.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a mascara addict for most of my adult life and have tried every brand, finally settling on Lancome.  However, I&#x27;ve tried some drugstore brands that seemed to do everything Lancome did except that they clumped.  I&#x27;m ashamed to say that I never realized a product like this existed except in the totally useless plastic comb variety.  This little comb is great ... you can use any kind of mascara and totally remove dreaded clumps!  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am so in love w/ this lash pin comb. I did not know there&#x27;s such a thing like this. Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. I use tubing mascara which is tricky as far as clumping goes. Usually I can get away with a thin coat and zero clumps; but if my lashes clump, I have to separate them immediately before tubing sets. I suppose this comb would perform even better with a regular kind of mascara.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the good reviews. I wanted something compact that I could stick in my purse. It is very small and works very well. Since it&#x27;s metal it will go through even stubborn clumps and provides a very natural fluttery look without taking off 90% of your mascara the way that some do. I recently lost mine and I liked it enough that I reordered this same one again. Seems to be pretty well built, it was lasting great with no signs of wear until I lost it!</li>
    <li> I really really like it!! My lashes look more natural now that you can really separate them after putting on mascara. No clumps.  The fine tooth metal Comb easily comes through lashes. Be careful once the mascara dries though, it will possibly pull out lashes as there is no give to the metal comb. You do have to use it right after putting mascara on so it is still wet.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this folds into a smaller compact size.  The quality is excellent. It&#x27;s made of a sturdy plastic, and the pins are some type of metal (not to thick and not too thin).  I thought I could comb thru my lashes just once to get them to unclump, but it does take several strokes to get them to separate.  However, this is no fault of the comb. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.  It beats using a hat pin!</li>
    <li> The design of it seems flawed and cheap. The hinge seems to wobble and could break if not careful. not much lasting power.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I ordered from the company.  It was easy and I received fast and efficient service.  I would recommend them to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The comb assures it stays closed with magnets and so far, it&#x27;s proven to work better than my old Tweezman eyelash comb. The teeth aren&#x27;t sharp either, so it won&#x27;t poke your skin out. The separation between the teeth and the material that it&#x27;s made of separates all my lashes perfectly</li>
    <li> Works great to separate lashes. You just have to clean after each use. I leaned that you can clean it with coconut oil if desired.</li>
    <li> Kinda flimsy, but does the trick.  Just please take caution when using this tool. If you aren&#x27;t fully present while using it  u can accidentally poke at your eye. Happened to me and ouch! Had to run for some eye drops to take the red out.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Easy to clean and use. The folding feature protects the teeth from damage.  Great feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 6 months ago and I&#x27;ve used it every day since.  Before I got this I was always looking for a good mascara that wouldn&#x27;t clump, but now it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind I use because I just use this to seperate.  It&#x27;s best not to comb through once the mascara is dry because it can pull lashes out, but if you&#x27;re in a pinch and have to then dipping the comb in makeup remover first and then combing through can help.</li>
    <li> I have used this lash comb numerous times and it works great.  I like the fact that it folds up when not in use and I can throw it in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT....COMPACT AND READY FOR USE AND STORAGE. I JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER I HAVE IT GOOD, GOOD, GOOD THANKS...</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does the job, it is sturdy, and I especially like the way it folds. That protects the comb, and my fingers when I dig in my bag - lol , and keeps it clean !</li>
    <li> my wife said it does the job.</li>
    <li> Went through a phase where I was all about&amp;#34; the mascara.&amp;#34; This comb is the bomb. IF you wear mascara, you must use this comb.</li>
    <li> I love how it folds over so the comb-teeth are protected if I throw it in my purse. Works great. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it almost every day for 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person who tends to overload my mascara, this thing is a lifesaver. It cuts through even the gunkiest spider lashes and helps me look presentable after I&#x27;ve gone too far with my mascara-- which is just about every time. Even when I&#x27;ve not gone overboard with the mascara, I still run this tool through my lashes to straighten them up and remove any clumps. The tines of this comb are spaced perfectly to separate my lashes without pulling them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential negative about this comb is that it&#x27;s very sharp. I see this as an advantage, because the needle-sharp tines will cut through clumps with little effort. But, if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand, be careful with this comb or invest in a plastic one.</li>
    <li> It cost a little bit more but it is worth it- it doesn&#x27;t break, it&#x27;s sturdy, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> This thing is a life-saver. The brushes with the plastic combs on the end are a pain, usually cost more than they are worth, and their teeth are thicker than I would like; this product is great! The metal pins are thinner, so it works better, and they&#x27;re also easy to clean. It seems expensive but I am definitely willing to say it was worth the money. It folds so you can throw it in your purse and the teeth will be protected. Mine came apart at the hinge once when I dropped it and I almost had a heart attack, but you can pop the halves right back together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful, because poking yourself does hurt more with this...</li>
    <li> Awesome tool to separate eyelashes. My favorite mascara is very thick and more then one coat there&#x27;s always a risk of clumping. I am able to put two coats of mascara on and use this tool to separate the lashes while they are still wet. The comb is well made and has survived heavy usage from my daughter and myself.</li>
    <li> always had problems with my mascara clumping no matter what kind i bought. This changed that. I never go without it now. I did accidentally hurt my finger with it...pins are VERY sharp!</li>
    <li> This eyelash comb isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the one I lost.  It doesn&#x27;t grab the lashes and doesn&#x27;t separate them very well.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this product is excellent because of its thicker teeth (removes excess mascara better) and its ease to clean. I too have found it easier to clean than my Tweezerman and I bought this because the teeth on the Tweezerman were falling out.</li>
    <li> I have long lashes and frequently have issues with clumps of mascara forming when applying mascara. Based on the advice of a professional makeup artist on YouTube, I use the comb by starting at the base of the lashes, then pulling straight up. Go slowly so as not to stab yourself with the sharp teeth of the comb. This comb gets rid of the clumps without removing my mascara...just be sure to use it when your lashes are still damp. Wipe off any mascara within the comb asap with a wet rag. If you wait until you&#x27;re done, it&#x27;s difficult to remove from the comb.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash comb around. I lost my first one so I am going to order a few more just in case i loose them again. I have used other lash combs in the past but this one separates the lashes much better than any others i have purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked long and hard for a great lash comb and this is by far the best I have used!  It&#x27;s easy to store since it folds into itself so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it scratching anything else in my make up bag. The easy to clean, I just wash with soap and warm water. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and will last longer than my previous one.Separates eyelashes fairly well.  However the needles are either a bit too thick or they are placed a bit too close together as it does not separate quite as well as the clear one with very fine pointed needles. Still an ok product.</li>
    <li> This little lash comb is marvelous! So easy to use, not as sharp as a safety pin, and so much easier to use! I would recommend this to everyone. I like that it folds up it stores right next to my 3D mascara in the case! I&#x27;m so glad I found this, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality lash comb. I take it with me everywhere every day, and it stays durable. The comb teeth do not easily come out either when being cleaned, unlike some other metal-toothed lash combs I have owned. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Best Lash Comb I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Ever get tired of the mascara clumps that are inevitable, even with a fresh mascara? This little comb does such a great job separating lashes with just-applied wet mascara, or with dried mascara. I like that it folds in half to protect the comb tines and it is washable. Nice product</li>
    <li> This is the best lash comb I have ever used.  I lost my Tweezerman metal comb and was unable to repurchase it.  I found this on Amazon Prime(my go-to place for buying on line). This Seki Edge is far superior and am ordering another for my daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t even know the point of those cheap plastic eyelash combs. they just &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; my lashes and really don&#x27;t &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; through them. really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect at first, but was really impressed by the seki edge lash pin comb. wow. am i really combing my lashes? and yes, the thought of poking my eye out does freak me out but hasn&#x27;t happened.... yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, i make sure to remove any mascara or anything stuck to the pins after every use.</li>
    <li> It takes some time to get used to the sharpness of these pins so go very slowly.  It does what it says and makes the little plastic ones seem pretty worthless.  I like the folding feature.  I used to think these items were over hyped but they are good tools if you are careful and do not abuse them.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic little eyelash comb.  I have had several of the plastic ones in the past, and they were OK, but it never took long for the pins to start breaking in my makeup bag.  Not this one!  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and it still looks as good as new.  The pins are very sturdy, and the folding mechanism keeps them protected when not in use.  I also like that it is so easy to clean.  With the metal pins, you can see quite clearly when it needs to be cleaned, and a little eye makeup remover on a cotton ball does the trick quite quickly and effectively.</li>
    <li> Nothing can replace this tiny wonder!</li>
    <li> This is the best brow and lash comb ever really works well easy to clean. Love it</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, excellent product. thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this but be careful when using anything near your eyes.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash comb ever! I&#x27;m a HUGE fan :-)</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these combs.  They are the best for separating your eyelashes after applying mascara. This is my fourth one.  I have extras just in case!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this to scrape mascara off a mascara wand and then apply mascara to my lashes...works well for that and great when combing thru to unclump mascara. Really quite useful.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t compare with tweezerman eyelash comb</li>
    <li> I always have a difficult time when I travel with lash combs because the cap gets lost and then the comb breaks.  I also hate the plastic ones because they don&#x27;t really work.  This one is nice and sharp and gets the clumps out of my lashes perfectly!  I highly recommend it and it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Work much better than the plastic tooth comb.</li>
    <li> This lash comb is truly awesome! It will make an unusable clumpy or wet mascara look perfect. I know it seems like an extra step but it truly makes a big difference and only takes a few seconds to separate your lashes when I otherwise just wouldn&#x27;t wear mascara at all because I can&#x27;t stand it when they clump together. Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap plastic ones, this one is made well and seems like it will last a long time (I have an eyelash curler from this brand that is still alive after 10 years!)</li>
    <li> I love this lash comb! It works great. I have absolutely no complaints. It seems sturdy like it will last. I previously ordered a Tweezerman lash comb and I received it broken (cracked with the pins coming out). It didn&#x27;t seem durable for this reason. At the time I was torn between this one and the Tweezerman. If you are deciding, choose this one!</li>
    <li> This is the best lash comb I have found.  It separates so nicely and I like the way it folds up small.  I also really like he metal teeth so much better than the plastic teeth that most lash combs have.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It separates my lashes without poking my eyes.  Have to keep it clean, but that&#x27;s easy enough with an old toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is great. I had another one from another brand, but in cleaning it, the little pins or tines or bristles or whatever you want to call them, came off.  So I bought this as a replacement, and it is much better. I also like that this one folds down, so it can go in your makeup bag and takes up virtually no space and won&#x27;t get bent or anything.  And for anyone reading this who just never used an eyelash comb at all - GET IT - if you use a good mascara and then comb through, you will look like you&#x27;re wearing false lashes! i love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this thing.  My lashes are never clumpy, so I am not afraid to use mascara now (I am into the natural look).  I have not jabbed myself in the eye with it.  It&#x27;s smaller than appears in the pics, but that ends up being a good thing.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and I haven&#x27;t broken it.</li>
    <li> The folding design means the comb doesn&#x27;t catch on my makeup brushes, nor do the tines break off.  (I&#x27;m looking at you, plastic CVS comb.)  The comb separates the lashes nicely, and it&#x27;s certainly much safer than using a safety pin.  UPDATE Jan 4th 2016:  Still going strong.  I&#x27;ve since purchased one for my mother another one for me.</li>
    <li> So incredibly good at de-clumping and separating eyelashes. Easy to clean (I just take a makeup removing wipe and poke the pins through it, wiggling back and forth to remove the mascara, then pull off he wipe), an excellent price, it hasn&#x27;t broken after extensive use like other products I have tried, and it folds to prevent catching/shanking! While not a huge risk, be aware that the pins are pretty sharp so if you poke yourself, in the eye or otherwise, it is gonna be unpleasant! An excellent buy, I might get these for some of my girlfriends and female relatives come holiday time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it really helps with the mascara clumps, I would recommend to everyone.  I use this everyday!</li>
    <li> I have been buying Tweezerman metal eyelash combs for years and was very happy with how they performed on my lashes. But they kept breaking every couple months! The plastic handle near the comb would crack and the comb would come loose. I didn&#x27;t even know that there was another brand of metal eyelash comb available. This one is far superior. It combs smoothly, it is sturdy, and it is easier to clean! Mascara glides right off of the tines when you wipe with alcohol or tissue. So far, I can&#x27;t imagine a better eyelash comb.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t separate all the eyelash hairs after applying mascara.&lt;br /&gt;But it is of good quality and I think that it is compact.</li>
    <li> Love this comb!!! Makes a huge difference, just be careful not to poke your eyeball!!  Most defiantly a must have!</li>
    <li> Nice, small but sturdy lash comb. Separates lashes very well and folds up to a small size to keep in your purse. The teeth are metal so it won&#x27;t break. I use it every day...</li>
    <li> I had a similar product from a beauty store.  This works better.  I use it every day to separate my lashes before and after applying mascara.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best metal pin lash comb I&#x27;ve owned so far. Pins do not come loose and are not sharp.</li>
    <li> I like that the small magnet keeps the comb closed when not in use.  Comb hasn&#x27;t fallen out, like another brand did.</li>
    <li> Best beauty tool for eyelashes. I had a metal comb awhile back &amp; it broke. So I&#x27;ve been using plastic ones since I couldn&#x27;t find any metal kinds. I hate the brushes with the plastic bristles. So I took a chance with this &amp; love it. Works great &amp; I like that it folds to fit in my makeup bag better. It also arrived sooner than the estimation date :)</li>
    <li> I had an eyelash comb that I bought over a decade ago that I loved. Well, I thought I loved it until I got this one. My old one did fold and had the metal tines, but they were extremely sharp, like needles! And they were constantly falling out when I tried to clean it. Such a pain. I never replaced it because I couldn&#x27;t find another metal comb in the stores and the plastic ones are pointless. So I continued to put up with it because I liked the look when I was able to comb through my lashes, a much softer and fuller look. This comb is so much better! I just received it today, and after one use I love it! The tines are metal, but not needle sharp, and they do not fall out! It combs through lashes beautifully. I am so glad I stumbled upon this brand.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I am including these next few words becasue Amazon requires it. That needs to be changed.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find this lash comb. The pins on it are so much thinner than an ordinary plastic brow/eyelash comb that usually comes with makeup brush sets. These pins actually get in between lashes and separate them, before and after mascara application. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I saw a youtube video about using an eyelash comb to apply mascara.  You place a little of the mascara on the comb and then comb it onto your eyelashes.  It&#x27;s amazing when used this way, no clumping at all.  Just get as near to the base of your lashes as you can, then comb on the mascara with a little bit of a zig zag motion.  To check out the video go to youtube and search on &amp;#34;gossmakeupartist mascara&amp;#34; and look for the title &amp;#34;The New Way to Apply Mascara&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am quite certain that this comb will last forever.  It is solid and durable.  This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This little comb separates and un-clumps lashes after applying mascara. It works well and is easy to clean. I like that it folds down when not in use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and it combs right through clumps and separates lashes well.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the tweezerman version for the past 10 years.  The problem with the tweezerman version is that the teeth fall out all the time.  I&#x27;ve virtually impossible to clean.  Also, the teeth on the tweezerman were super sharp.  The seki&#x27;s teeth are solidly in place and not that pointed.  However, they are small enough to effectively separate lashes.  I also really like how there is a magnetic closure so that it stays closed when in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Love it. This little thing separated my eyelashes after mascara like a pro.</li>
    <li> The best lash comb I have  purchased.  I really like the folding design.  It prevents a lot of pricking accidents.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think my beauty regime would be the same without this lash comb. I had originally purchased one (not this brand) years ago, and when it finally broke I could not find another one quite like it. This one, however, blows my original one out of the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you might say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just a lash comb...&amp;#34; But for those of us who like to layer our mascara, it is a lifesaver for lifting and separating the lashes, as well as removing any and all clumps. I always panic a little bit when I can&#x27;t find it in my purse because I love it so much. It has helped make my morning beauty routine so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had another eyelash comb for years and have lived in fear of losing it.  finally discovered this brand on Amazon and it&#x27;s even better than my original:  teeth very close together so it combs my lashes clean of all excess mascara, leaving them long and totally clump free.  Am ordering more so I can have one on hand as an extra and in my travel bag.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Work better than any other lash comb I have tried.</li>
    <li> what every girl needs for her lashes! does exactly what you need it to, just always have it tilted upward when you go in towards your eye, they are after all strong metal pins. I havent had any of the other problems ive read about with the pins falling out, I clean mine all the time and so far so good:)</li>
    <li> The mascara combs/eyebrow brush combos I&#x27;ve purchased in the past always clumped up, then broke after washing/using... This one seems to be made of steel &amp; separates perfectly!</li>
    <li> I had a Tweezerman eyelash comb.  The teeth started falling out but I&#x27;d had it for quite a while so thought I would just order another one.  When I went on-line I came across the Seki Edge &amp; the reviews were quite positive so I thought I would give it a try.  It is much better constructed than the Tweezerman.  Glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> This works very well to take the clumps out of mascara.  I actually find combing my eyelashes tribe addicting with this little tool.  I highly recommend over the cheap plastic lash combs that can&#x27;t even come close to separating lashes!</li>
    <li> I use this to apply mascara and it works well and is easy to use. the folding aspect is an added bonus</li>
    <li> the metal bristles are sharp! but it is hard to separate your lashes with them without hurting yourself so be careful. Overall I am pleased with this item and is made up of quality materials</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty awesome. The tines aren&#x27;t sharp and don&#x27;t poke and are properly spaced to perform as intended. Also love that it folds to not only protect the tines, but for compact storage. Now I don&#x27;t worry about clumps if I have to apply mascara away from home.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool, way better than the plastic combs.  Really got into my lashes and separated them nicely.  Love the way it folds up so you can carry it around in your purse without the sharp edges sticking out!</li>
    <li> Quite simply the best lash comb that I have ever owned.  Works great!  No more clumpy mess for my long eyelashes :)</li>
    <li> This is the first lash pin comb I&#x27;ve had, and it does its job well.  Helps prevent clumping and all the other mascara messes one can make in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for......no more old mascara wands to separate lashes.  This tool is slick and effective and easy to keep clean.</li>
