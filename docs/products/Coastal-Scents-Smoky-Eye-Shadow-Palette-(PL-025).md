      <li>:-)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this palette</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen many YouTube make-up gurus use this palette</li>
      <li>Packaging is okay .</li>
      <li>I have the Coastal Scents 88 palette, which is OK, but hasn&#x27;t gotten any love since the day after it arrived.  </li>
      <li>I love this palette, many looks can be created.</li>
      <li>i really really love it.</li>
      <li>There are some matte finishes as well as some more sparkly ones.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>The product sticks more to the brush than the eye (I was using synthetic fibers).</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I love doing the smokey eye</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay though, because with the amount I paid</li>
      <li>I love the pigments in this pallet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute.</li>
      <li>I do not regret this purchase and I will be purchasing more Coastal Scents products.</li>
      <li>If you went to MAC or even bought drug store shadows, you&#x27;d be spending so much more money.  </li>
      <li>this is more than what I asked for.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I love this palette, all the colors are gorgeous and very pigmented.,</li>
      <li>I love their \\&quot;Hot Pots\\&quot;, their prices are super and the products are well made and when you purchase from them they wrap everything very nicely and include a sample of eyeshadow for you.  </li>
      <li>There are bright matte colors, and a few really beautiful shimmery colors.  </li>
      <li>I have the 88 warm palette and was pretty happy with it, although many of the colors are almost the same, but the quality is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>That was great and just like I expected and more</li>
      <li>just the size and my hands don&#x27;t fit together</li>
      <li>I was looking for a cheap palette with a variety which is what you get with this.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve used it plenty, colors blend really well, and its set up so nicely.</li>
      <li>and it goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t fit on my makeup stuff.</li>
      <li>These colors are fabulous....</li>
      <li>This palette is perfect for someone who wants to spice up their eye makeup a bit for a low price.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I feel like it was a good investment, instead of spending more $$$ on MAC palettes or individuals.</li>
      <li>Mostly because it&#x27;s my first time applying makeups.</li>
      <li>Once I received this palette I was excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>Plus, I&#x27;m not really into the bright colors that most of the 88 palette comprises of</li>
      <li>I actually love the variety, The colors are true when you first put them on but</li>
      <li>/&gt;You just need enough color because it&#x27;s that bright.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d heard good things about Coastal Scents eye shadows from friends and from the make-up tutorials I like to watch occasionally.  </li>
      <li>I am very please with this product and will be buying more of the companies products.</li>
      <li>its a good product for those starting off.</li>
      <li>however this is it true to size</li>
      <li>I mean it works GREAT! !</li>
      <li>If you travel it&#x27;s a great kit to take along due to the variety of colors.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Colors are a little too harsh, but good quality</li>
    <li> I am a Professional Makeup Artist and want to say that this palette is close similar to the best brands like  MAC, Urban Decay, Makeup Forever... very affordabl, well pigmented, very nice colors! Just love this and all the other Coastal Scents products I have.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected but the colours are nice. Some are a little chalky but most of them are quite blendable</li>
    <li> I love this palette, all the colors are gorgeous and very pigmented.,</li>
    <li> the quality is really good, some of the colors are breathtaking! its amazing. i really really love it. i&#x27;ve used it plenty, colors blend really well, and its set up so nicely. great for starters and experienced women using makeup</li>
    <li> Like many, I spent some time debating whether to get this palette or not. I&#x27;ve seen many YouTube make-up gurus use this palette so I thought it would be the best one I can afford. Plus, I&#x27;m not really into the bright colors that most of the 88 palette comprises of so I thought this would be a better alternative.  Once I received this palette I was excited to try it out. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but the pods looked a little bigger in the picture than in person. It&#x27;s okay though, because with the amount I paid I felt I had no room for complaints. I decided to try out Promise Phan&#x27;s Vibrant Purple make-up look. I was merely disappointed as the colors are very pigmented, the color did not come out the same on my eyes. Maybe it was the brushes I used? Anyway, I was bummed I couldn&#x27;t achieve the same look. Hopefully this is something that can be corrected by using different brushes.  Overall, I feel like it was a good investment, instead of spending more $$$ on MAC palettes or individuals. I will keep trying to make this one work since I love all the colors! I love doing the smokey eye so of course this would be a really good palette, given the name. However it does work well with other looks than the smokey eye.</li>
    <li> Not looking to spend a lot,  I was hunting for some spring colors to liven up the &#x27;ole collection.  I have the Coastal Scents 88 palette, which is OK, but hasn&#x27;t gotten any love since the day after it arrived.  But it is workable and offers up bright colors and endless combinations.  That being said, I ordered this Smokey Palette expecting the same, (i.e. a good option for everyday wear if I didn&#x27;t want to use up my good stuff too quickly.) this stuff is awesome! There are bright matte colors, and a few really beautiful shimmery colors.  Even a black matte that I have been using as a soft eyeliner. (As well as a deep dark chocolate matte.)  I use with UD&#x27;s Primer Potion, and it has lasted well into the evening.  It blends great and isn&#x27;t too chalky which is why my 88 palette is at the bottom of my bag o&#x27; tricks.  So, if you&#x27;re looking for a little spruce up for your everyday-makeup bag, this is it! Very compact and simple, no weird little foam applicators to toss away, (or if you&#x27;re like me and ended up cleaning the in-between of the computer keyboards a few times, THEN threw them away . . .) and the pans are a little bigger than the dime-sized 88&#x27;s.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Hello I want to buy another one Costal Scent Smokey Palette but I want to receive the right one please, I receive a Blush Palette !! :(</li>
    <li> I recieved my Smokey pallet in the mail today and was not at all disappointed! I have to say I no longer buy from Mac since I&#x27;ve been purchasing Coastal scents products. I mean it works GREAT! ! The colors are vibrant, colorful,and CHEAP! Why buy one mac eye shadow for $16.00 when you can get a while colorful pallet for the same price. I love coastal scents and will continue to buy all they have to offer. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to try out some new, more colorful looks, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on individual shadows that I may or may not like or even wear very often.  This palette is perfect for someone who wants to spice up their eye makeup a bit for a low price.  It&#x27;s perfect for experimenting.  I have the 88 warm palette and was pretty happy with it, although many of the colors are almost the same, but the quality is pretty good.  This palette&#x27;s quality, however, is much, much better--more pigmented, longer staying power, less fallout--and is so beautifully vibrant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a nice mix between matte and shimmery shadows, too.  Do use these shadows with a high quality eye primer, though, to enhance the colors and make your eye look stay all day.  My favorite shades are the matte purple, the shimmery hot pink, the bright matte blue, and all of the black shades.  As you can tell, there aren&#x27;t too many neutral shadows to blend with, but likely you&#x27;ll already have those in your collection.  For twenty dollars, you can&#x27;t beat this palette.  If you went to MAC or even bought drug store shadows, you&#x27;d be spending so much more money.  I love the compact, thin palette too--perfect for travel and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space on my vanity.  A great staple to have in your collection!</li>
    <li> The eye shadow is awesome there great for large wedding party&#x27;s are for any occasion love the texture and the way the colors pop on the eyes!!! Two thumbs up!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love Colors very good pigmentation</li>
    <li> This is like kids play makeup... Color vibrancy is not great, you have to wet it AND layer it on to get any color payoff. Wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> At first as I read all the reviews about packaging and cracked shadows I was very hesitant on buying items. But I still took the chance and the shadows were all in one piece. because  of the great reviews about the pigmentation I bought smokey eyes, winter berry, neutral, and shadow blush palette. I&#x27;m still waiting on the shadow blush kit which arrives today. I hurried n opened up shadows and tested them they went on great w a good primer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard good things about Coastal Scents eye shadows from friends and from the make-up tutorials I like to watch occasionally.  I have to be choosy, however, because I have sensitive eyes, so I have to be careful what I use.  Anyway, I was considering the 88 Color Palette, but hesitated because it seemed like there were only a few different colors in that palette.  Even allowing for some of the subtleties of each shade getting \\&quot;lost in translation\\&quot; when the pictures of the palette are placed on the internet, it still looked like you would get 5 slightly different(if at all) shades of the same color.  But, I found this Smokey Palette, and while only having 36 colors, they were in bigger proportion than in the 88 color palette, and were all very noticeably different from each other.  When it arrived in the mail, I was thrilled.  The color simply glides on, all of the shades are highly pigmented so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product, and they were very easy on my sensitive eyes.  I haven&#x27;t bought any eyeshadow at all since I received this palette. This has everything I need-lots of subtle, lots of dramatic, lots of matte, lots of shimmer.  Seriously, this is a fantastic deal and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had never tried Coastal Scents before this palette and I must say I am in love! Bright beautiful colors with an array of shade that blend and go on smoothly and look great! No creasing, no wearing off or fading. I am very please with this product and will be buying more of the companies products. Would highly recommend and would compare this product to high end brands like Sephora and Ulta shadow palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for free from amazon due to credits I had built up in my account.</li>
    <li> I will admit the palette is cute! I watched many youtube videos on the palette, and sure enough, the were right. It&#x27;s cute. It does the trick. BUT..it does not scream WOW! For the price, definately worth it. Of course, other brands like MAC &amp; Urband Decay are way way way better. But...what can you do......You definately need eye primer of some sort before even attempting to put this make up on fyi.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful but I definitely do not recommend this product. When I received this palette I noticed right away that most of the shadows are very chalky. About 3 months after I purchased them I noticed that all the shadows were chalky and very hard to keep on let alone blend them even with eyeshaow primer. Another thing I realized was that I over payed for this palette. It&#x27;s cheaper if you go directly threw the coastal scents website.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I read the reviews from other customers about this shadows but now that I have them I have to say they are amazing, their colors have brought a different shade to my makeup, they last a lot and have so many amazing colors to choose from, I really recommend this palette and I&#x27;m looking forward to buying another one.</li>
    <li> I love this palette great pigmentation and a variety of colors. Most of the colors are matte and few shimmers.</li>
    <li> I loved it! Mostly because it&#x27;s my first time applying makeups. Great product!</li>
    <li> such amazing colors i love that i can take it with me any where i love it so much its the best</li>
    <li> Beautiful selection of colors, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;A bit curious after using the purple shade my eyelids stayed pink for about a couple of hours and I used cold cream to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;So not sure if it&#x27;s the eyeshadow or a reaction but other than that no problems with the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this as a perfeet gift for a girl who loves makeup and eyeshadows or if you&#x27;re wanting to experiment with makeup tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best to use a primer before so these colors can really pop.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the richness of the eyeshadow. I brought this pallette with all these differant colors and use them all. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Many and nice color but it&#x27;s. Difficult to apply . Good product but I will not buy it again .</li>
    <li> Not the coastal scents quality I&#x27;m used to. Very chalky, terrible color pay off and a lot smaller than expected. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Ever since I began wearing makeup I&#x27;ve always only used MAC. After recently beginning to watch tutorials and reviews about makeup on Youtube I decided to try out Coastal Scents eye shadows. So far so good! They stay on all day with a primer/base and I like all the different colors! I will definitely be buying more Coastal Scents makeup.</li>
    <li> My husband  saw this in my wish list bought this for me and I love it the colors are beautiful :) perfect for summer</li>
    <li> The packaging was fast, and when I received it no shadows were broken so thats a plus. The eyeshadows are a dime size, I was expecting maybe a quarter size of the shadows but yea, and there are 36 colors some matt and shimmer.</li>
    <li> If you are a club girl or just want to go for a wild makeup this is IT.&lt;br /&gt;the colors are so vivid and wild that it definable makes an statement of fun. :-)&lt;br /&gt;You just need enough color because it&#x27;s that bright.</li>
    <li> This is a super palette from Coastal Scents.  You get 36 colors that are actually six sets of six go- together palettes, all in one package.  I always use a primer, so color stays on all day without creasing or needing a touch up.  I get compliments on how nice my eyeshadow looks and how it stays nice looking all day.  I like the set, though I do have a bit of trouble just opening the lid.  Not due to any product problems, just the size and my hands don&#x27;t fit together well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a regular user of lots of Coastal Scents products, I even buy their \\&quot;make your own\\&quot; mica&#x27;s and press my own.  I love their \\&quot;Hot Pots\\&quot;, their prices are super and the products are well made and when you purchase from them they wrap everything very nicely and include a sample of eyeshadow for you.  Their brushes are really nice and inexpensive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you receive this one you may be surprised by the size.  It is smaller than it appears in the pictures.  The shadows are actually about the size of a nickel, and the whole palette measures about 6x6 inches.  The colors are really lovely, and you get a nice mix of mattes, shimmers and metallics.  I am really very happy I bought it. If you travel it&#x27;s a great kit to take along due to the variety of colors. It&#x27;s an all-in-one that will go with whatever color your outfit is for the day.  You get:&lt;br /&gt;1:  neutrals, with an added orangey pop color&lt;br /&gt;2:  greens&lt;br /&gt;3:  purples&lt;br /&gt;4:  grays/black/white&lt;br /&gt;5:  blues&lt;br /&gt;6:  pinks&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the small amount Coastal Scents charges for it!</li>
    <li> the pigmentation of the colors is not good, and  the colors is not as the picture</li>
    <li> I love this palette it&#x27;s great!!! (: I love how there is a little of everything to me it&#x27;s worth the money (:</li>
    <li> The colors are small but nice.. i like the color with little of use leaves your eyes nice. I will recomend this pallet.</li>
    <li> it works great. i use the shadows with a primer. and colors last. even times i fell asleep studying and woke up and make up still looked great!! highly reccomend</li>
    <li> I personally felt that unless you love wearing pink/purple eyeshadows, this may not be your favorite. I bought the palette because I felt with all of the different colors there could be many different combos. Maybe I&#x27;m using the wrong brushes, but I find the colors difficult to blend, and i don&#x27;t feel that the matte colors apply as richly as the shimmer. If you&#x27;re going to wear turquoise, you want it to really pop and last all day! Unfortunately,  it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> I really liked the colors however a few of the shades were broken on arrival-that is why for the lower rating...</li>
    <li> I really love this palette! The fact that they positioned the colors in a way that you can easily know which colors go together is a plus! This idea would be good for a beginner and it will help you apply your colors so that they compliment each other. I do not regret this purchase and I will be purchasing more Coastal Scents products. I have already joined the website, but to get them here on amazon is a good deal because I can pay using my amazon credit card! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! I wanted one with a large range of colors that was very pigmented - and this is it! The eyeshadows go one really smoothly and the colors stay vibrant all day. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to add a pop of color with their shadow.</li>
    <li> I love the pigments in this pallet. however this is it true to size it is about the size of a CD case or DVD case but the pigments are the highly pigmented is a beautiful pilot I love working with the colors now if you are an artist that jizz that&#x27;s just interested in quality then go ahead and purchase one but if you are an artist as interested in quality and quantity I suggest you purchase 2 because it is very small it is not the size it it is in the picture but it is a good product I love it and I can&#x27;t complain about it only the size thank you</li>
    <li> That was great and just like I expected and more</li>
    <li> Great for beginners and to also use when you don&#x27;t want to use your extravagant product. Its a great product and I promise it won&#x27;t go to waste. Shadow primer is obviously required for the colors to pop. Overall don&#x27;t think twice to get this product.</li>
    <li> Every single color is super pigmented. I love this palette, many looks can be created.</li>
    <li> They are super pigmented eye shadows and they are packaged really well so they don&#x27;t break in shipping since they are delicate. i&#x27;m very satisfied with how well they blend. You get that professional feel without spending all of your money.</li>
    <li> Some colors are not as pigmented as I would like but they are in the minority. Nice and compact, makes pairing colors easy as pie.</li>
    <li> Some colors are really pigmented some are not . They are really good at blending and staying on all night . Packaging is okay . Good for the price</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this palette, but was sadly disappointed. I was looking for a cheap palette with a variety which is what you get with this. There are some matte finishes as well as some more sparkly ones. They were difficult to apply to the eye without getting too aggressive. I was using my nice brushes while trying to apply these as well so it was not the brush. The product sticks more to the brush than the eye (I was using synthetic fibers). They are also hard to blend once you finally do get them on your eye. If you are looking for some fun Halloween eye makeup that&#x27;s what this could be. As for an everyday eyewear.... Not for me.</li>
    <li> These colors are fabulous....this is more than what I asked for.  Deep rich colors and it goes on smooth. Long lasting wear.</li>
    <li> I really like it. I don&#x27;t use all the colours.. but it&#x27;s good for coloured makeup.. I would not recommend for basic make up. It doesn&#x27;t have too much variation. Its a little bit big for me. I doesn&#x27;t fit on my makeup stuff. So i don&#x27;t like to take with me to a travel. But I still like it! The colours are really pretty!</li>
    <li> I actually love the variety, The colors are true when you first put them on but after about 5hrs they begin to fade (even with primer and shadow base)</li>
    <li> Great product! Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing high paise about this product...so I thought I&#x27;ll try it.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give in and buy it.  Its and okay product, but I was hoping it would last longer then it has been...its a good product for those starting off.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, some more pigmented than others but still really good quality.</li>
    <li> I love this little palette and I had heard about it from a Beauty Guru on YouTube. Great palette with fun colors!</li>
