      <li>It is great for people with persistent body odor like people with organic and medical conditions.  </li>
      <li>Makes my sensitive skin feel so good.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s best to keep it pretty dry after using.</li>
      <li>and you feel clean</li>
      <li>However, I still continue to use the soap and although it has caused mild irritation I have already seen minimum, measurable, visible improvement in the rashes.</li>
      <li>I have so many skin issues including very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I find that this product was well worth</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t use soaps with strong fragrances that could irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have a whole slew of skin conditions, including eczema, acne, keratosis, and more, and this soap seems to clear it all up.</li>
      <li>It was very fast and the product by itself worked for me.</li>
      <li>I need to order more next month.</li>
      <li>I have used it every day and would not be able to bring back into balance my health without this welcomed relief.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for acne, eczema, dark spots, and any other skin condition.</li>
      <li>I am still using the 1st of the 3 bars, so it will last as long as you don&#x27;t let it sit in water &amp;#60;as with most bar soaps&amp;#62;!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
      <li>When I first used the soap my legs itched to high heaven.</li>
      <li>and it really helps my skin and face.</li>
      <li>The whole family - from youngest to oldest - could use it.</li>
      <li>It really curbs itching whether I have a rash or not at the time.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I had a very severe rash in my face.</li>
      <li>I simply cannot live (comfortably) without this soap.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic for people who have been immuno compromised and have had to be on long bouts of antibiotics.</li>
      <li>When it first goes on there is tingling/stinging feeling, then complete relief.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m less itchy and more moisturized.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap to everyone.</li>
      <li>I was excited to have found this soap only to find out after researching the ingredients that \\&quot;lemongrass\\&quot; should \\&quot;NOT\\&quot; be used on sensitive skin as it would cause irritation.</li>
      <li>, I use it a lot of times and always let it dry, after bath skin feels very soft and a sweet lemon smell, my daughters use It for acne .</li>
      <li>you have  to be carefull with the soap not to let it in watter, is very soft</li>
      <li>I have used this soap for several years, so glad I found some on Amazon, as my local store had been out of it for several months</li>
      <li>You really need to follow the instructions and keep it dry between uses or it will go too fast</li>
      <li>it fixed my rash</li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m on my last bar and won&#x27;t be buying this product again because I feel that it is very over priced.</li>
      <li>so they will be ready next summer so that I can wear shorts).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not normally a fan of lemongrass scent very much</li>
      <li>and I practically have to hide this from my family because it is kind of expensive for me anyway, and they all like it and want to use it though they don&#x27;t particularly need it.</li>
      <li>so the skin is open and very sensitive.</li>
      <li>The rashes on my legs have really compromised the integrity of the skin on my legs due to my stratching them</li>

<li> The rashes on my legs have really compromised the integrity of the skin on my legs due to my stratching them</li>
<li> It&#x27;s amazing and although it&#x27;s very expensive I truly recommend it.</li>
<li> BUT for the humongous price, these bars just do not last very long</li>
<li> The soap is very small, melts incredibly fast so keep it out of the water.</li>
<li> I only got four uses out of one bar of this soap, however the product was less and less iritating to my skin (the irritation was only on the skin rashes from candida and not on my entire body)</li>
<li> I have had issues with Candida for the past twenty years and am always looking for something to keep my skin clear.</li>
<li> Keep it dry after using soap and in a closed up container.</li>
<li> It has eliminated dry and itchy skin due to psoriasis and eczema.  </li>
<li> In a few words I will tell you that For 10 years I scrached my back all the time, I saw this soap on Amazon , went for it, couldnt belive it,</li>
<li> Maybe for other people, but to me it&#x27;s just soap.</li>
<li> (In other words my legs are \\&quot;ruined\\&quot; for the time being</li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> After spending a small fortune on one product behind another and with \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; providing anything but short term relieve, I was desperately trying to find a product that would alleviate the intense itchness and dryness and promote healing.</li>
<li> itchy  desapears (sorry my  english)</li>
<li> I usually get it from this soap</li>
<li> is too small.</li>
<li> For the price of the soap it should be at least 7 ounces.</li>
<li> One bar lasts approximately 2 weeks</li>
<li> Expensive and not efficient.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying it, it is quite expensive for a soap and for me didn&#x27;t do what it is marketed to do.</li>
<li> I ordered this soap for support of vicious, itchy, dry candida skin rashes all over my legs.</li>
<li> Too bad it is soooo expensive.</li>
<li> and I am desperately trying just about anything</li>
<li> and I have not seen that they do anything for my skin unfortunately :(</li>
<li> , I feel you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We are washing our itchy dog with this soap.  Too soon to tell if it is helping with his candida rashes.</li>
    <li> Having suffered bouts of Candida albicans and the horrid itching involved with the overgrowth, this soap provides a calming relief. When it first goes on there is tingling/stinging feeling, then complete relief. I have used it every day and would not be able to bring back into balance my health without this welcomed relief.</li>
    <li> Makes my sensitive skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. It smells delicious, but I can&#x27;t say that it really does anything special. Maybe for other people, but to me it&#x27;s just soap. I bought it because I was having an eczema attack and I thought it might have been candida on the skin. Just an eczema reaction to dairy. Anyway, I&#x27;m on my last bar and won&#x27;t be buying this product again because I feel that it is very over priced.</li>
    <li> I simply cannot live (comfortably) without this soap. I have a whole slew of skin conditions, including eczema, acne, keratosis, and more, and this soap seems to clear it all up. I&#x27;m so glad I found this. I only wish I had found it earlier.</li>
    <li> Great Soap for acne and skin disorders</li>
    <li> I have so many skin issues including very sensitive skin.  I have candida issues and so I came across this and decided to give it a try.  The scent it just lovely!  I love it&#x27;s lovely scent and I&#x27;m not normally a fan of lemongrass scent very much but this is very nice!  It really curbs itching whether I have a rash or not at the time.  There&#x27;s a nice lather and I practically have to hide this from my family because it is kind of expensive for me anyway, and they all like it and want to use it though they don&#x27;t particularly need it. lol  Having said that, this time around I&#x27;m going to buy a soap storage container and take it in and out of the shower with me.  You really need to follow the instructions and keep it dry between uses or it will go too fast and you don&#x27;t want that.  I find that this product was well worth me making a second order so please do give it a try if you&#x27;ve got candida related skin issues, I feel you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> In a few words I will tell you that For 10 years I scrached my back all the time, I saw this soap on Amazon , went for it, couldnt belive it, itchy  desapears (sorry my  english) you have  to be carefull with the soap not to let it in watter, is very soft, I use it a lot of times and always let it dry, after bath skin feels very soft and a sweet lemon smell, my daughters use It for acne .</li>
    <li> This soap was very effective in helping relieve the symptoms I was experiencing. I would definitley buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It is perfect for acne, eczema, dark spots, and any other skin condition. It&#x27;s even safe to use on your hair, and I love the smell of it. I have very sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t use soaps with strong fragrances that could irritate my skin. The whole family - from youngest to oldest - could use it. You&#x27;re definitely getting what you pay for .. I know at the herb shop I usually get it from this soap is $15.00 for ONE bar. So, three bars for this price is a DEAL!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap for support of vicious, itchy, dry candida skin rashes all over my legs. When I first used the soap my legs itched to high heaven. The rashes on my legs have really compromised the integrity of the skin on my legs due to my stratching them so the skin is open and very sensitive. (In other words my legs are \\&quot;ruined\\&quot; for the time being and I am desperately trying just about anything so they will be ready next summer so that I can wear shorts). After spending a small fortune on one product behind another and with \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; providing anything but short term relieve, I was desperately trying to find a product that would alleviate the intense itchness and dryness and promote healing. I was excited to have found this soap only to find out after researching the ingredients that \\&quot;lemongrass\\&quot; should \\&quot;NOT\\&quot; be used on sensitive skin as it would cause irritation. Lemongrass is an ingredient in this soap and the makers of this soap should advised potential customers about this caution and they do not. However, I still continue to use the soap and although it has caused mild irritation I have already seen minimum, measurable, visible improvement in the rashes. The soap is very small, melts incredibly fast so keep it out of the water. You may get four uses for a bath or shower out of one bar. For the price of the soap it should be at least 7 ounces. I gave it four stars because the seller does not tell the consumer about lemongrass and the size of the bar of soap is too small. To be fair, if you do not have any \\&quot;open\\&quot; skin, perhaps the soap will not irritate your skin.  AMENDMENT.  In order to be fair to the seller and maker of this product I have decided to amend this review. I only got four uses out of one bar of this soap, however the product was less and less iritating to my skin (the irritation was only on the skin rashes from candida and not on my entire body), anyway, I have noticed that the soap has improved the condition of the rashes. I am now on my second bar. I believe that I would be getting better results if I had not stratched the skin and severly comprised the integrity of the skin on my legs to the point that I have opened the skin. Therefore I am changing the stars to five.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It has eliminated dry and itchy skin due to psoriasis and eczema.  I highly recommend this soap to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for people who have been immuno compromised and have had to be on long bouts of antibiotics.</li>
    <li> I had a very severe rash in my face.I am saying rash for lack of a better word. Got this soap from my health food store. Has cleared my face that is why I am trying to purchase it online. $17.00 a bar in the store. Keep it dry after using soap and in a closed up container. One bar for use on my face only has lasted about 3 months.</li>
    <li> my daughter says this is a &#x27;must have&#x27; for her daily facial cleansing...she has Rosacea  and this cleanser is a God-send. : ) she says it is the best cleanser she has ever used...and her face rarely flares anymore...and her skin looks healthy after 3 months of using this</li>
    <li> if u have any kind of skin rash, this soap will fix it. it fixed my rash and i could not be happier</li>
    <li> Best Soap Ever, WOW! This soap, cleared every bump or rash I had on my skin, in one month. My skin is silky smooth now. This truly is an amazing product, that does what it claims. And it smells delicious and makes your skin smell wonderful, and that benefit lasts 24 hours. Can you tell, Im a fan!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for several years, so glad I found some on Amazon, as my local store had been out of it for several months and I have been needing it &amp;#60;local store called yesterday, they finally have some in the store 6 months later&amp;#62;. I use it everyday. It&#x27;s the last thing I do before I step out of the shower and it really helps my skin and face. I am still using the 1st of the 3 bars, so it will last as long as you don&#x27;t let it sit in water &amp;#60;as with most bar soaps&amp;#62;!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great for yeast problems on skin and you feel clean</li>
    <li> My skin is very happy. I&#x27;m less itchy and more moisturized. I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> It was very fast and the product by itself worked for me. It&#x27;s amazing and although it&#x27;s very expensive I truly recommend it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with Candida for the past twenty years and am always looking for something to keep my skin clear. Candida Freedom smells great and has a wonderful, soft lather. I am able to use it on my body and on occasion on my face and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it drying out my skin. One bar lasts approximately 2 weeks so it&#x27;s best to keep it pretty dry after using. Otherwise I will keep using it - this soap is great.</li>
    <li> Smells great! BUT for the humongous price, these bars just do not last very long and I have not seen that they do anything for my skin unfortunately :(</li>
    <li> It lathers great, smells great and works very well.</li>
    <li> Expensive and not efficient. Didn&#x27;t help with my recurrent yeast symptoms.</li>
    <li> Very Good.  I need to order more next month.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchace this product again.  I do love the Candida Freedom capsules, and will purchase them for yearly detoxes.  However this soap, did not work at all for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying it, it is quite expensive for a soap and for me didn&#x27;t do what it is marketed to do.</li>
    <li> No change in my  skin.</li>
    <li> Great soap for every bathing need.  It is great for people with persistent body odor like people with organic and medical conditions.  Too bad it is soooo expensive.</li>
