    <li> Small, but pretty good overall.</li>
    <li> If your looking for something that&#x27;s not going to last very long, this is it. It DOES work, but after a while (like a month, everyday) it just doesn&#x27;t stock to your thighs anymore.</li>
    <li> they wrinkle to much...</li>

    <li> A waste of money, luckily it is cheap lol</li>
    <li> These did not stick. They did not stay on nor did they help me sweat</li>
    <li> Product has no English instruction on how to use it. .Product  was plastic with powdery stuff on it and I Could not figure out even how to use it .. Therefore ,I just threw it in trash .  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY the picture shows something that is NOTHING COMPARED to what it really is; a piece of plastic  PIECE Of CRAP</li>

    <li> Terrible product. Does not work.</li>
    <li> Your bands are too small for bigger women I have not seen no improvement yet but I am still using your product hoping it will help. Do you have larger bands of wraps. I have big leg</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. It&#x27;s just a heavy duty saran wrap. What I was buying the grocery store is doing a better job</li>

    <li> NOOO, DON&#x27;T DO IT... :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> It leaves red marks and itchesvery much after wearing them. Too narrow to cover the tigh area. I may cover the calve area. I would like to return this item and get my money back.</li>
    <li> A joke! I guess you live and you learn. I went against the advice of the other negative reviews, and found out they were right. It doesn&#x27;t stick and it curls up. The only good use for it is in the trash and I put it there where it belongs.</li>
    <li> I wish I would of returned this product instead of throwing it away. This was by far my worst purchase of 2014. Extremely poor quality.</li>

THE JOKE IS ON THE CONSUMER!! i WOULD EXPECT AMAZON 2 have had some kind of quality assurance. THANK GOD I GUESS THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE U GET WHAT U PAY 4 LOL111</li>
    <li> Purchased this to slim my legs...looks like its working</li>
    <li> I expected something different.  The plastic slides off. It will not stay in place. I thought it would have Velcro.</li>
    <li> I COULD SERIOUSLY USE SARAN WRAP ON MY THIGH AREA. THEN I WILL PUT THE SLIMMING THIGH SHAPER ON TOP. MORE THAN LIKELY GETTING THE SAME RESULTS. IM NOT GOING TO SAY THAT I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT, BECAUSE TO EACH HIS OWN. I THINK FOR SMALLER THIGHS MAYBE, I HAVE BIG JUICY THIGHS, LOL. I WOULD NEED TWO SETS OF THESE TO COVER MY THIGHS. I WONT BE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
    <li> This not worth to buy, does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Not even on English so cute what to do</li>
    <li> This is one of the most horrible products I&#x27;ve ever had.  Save your $2.00 its not worth it.</li>
    <li> no intructions in how to use the product.</li>
    <li> These are hard to keep on, but hey, nothing&#x27;s perfect. I would use them while doing thigh and glute workouts. After use take them off and let them dry for re-use</li>
    <li> This is a piece of heavy plastic wrap.  Do not order.</li>
    <li> It awful, a waste of money ! I wish I never bought it!</li>
    <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It&#x27;s a total scam.</li>
    <li> This Is a great item! Really works..just use with heating cream♡</li>
    <li> Worst than plastic wrap</li>
    <li> I dont like it!! I waste my money for this!!</li>
    <li> They are just a long piece of plastic! There is no way to keep it on your leg! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> The length is fine, but the width is not for the thigh. it&#x27;s just not big enough. This product fits the arm better.</li>
    <li> So hard to stay in place!! Be better off with Saran Wrap. This must be for skinny ppl who can wrap it easily!! But why would they need it?!!! Waste of money</li>
    <li> Sometimes has trouble sticking in place!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all. My thighs are huge! I gained so much weight with my recent pregnancy and my thighs are my problem area. These things don&#x27;t even wrap over my thigh fully.</li>
    <li> it a piece of plastic that all</li>
    <li> Not good it&#x27;s all, not work good.  Ship long time</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these. They feel like floaties ​</li>
    <li> The actual scam, does not work, only gives heat and no reduction at all. Already knew too cheap going out bad. I do not buy again.</li>
    <li> i like it. i sweat a lot when i exercise. i will order some more</li>
    <li> I had a very bad experience this time with this purchase I ordered them so long ago and I just received them and when Ouse them they didn&#x27;t do any good because they just kept rolling up like rubber bands</li>
    <li> product is not worth the waste of money, doesn&#x27;t stick</li>
    <li> These were a waste of my money. This not only was a long wait but it also has no way to attached and hold into place it just slides off</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money!!!!!</li>
    <li> This about THE STUPIDEST thing I have ever wasted 3 dollars on. It does nothing for anyone. You might as well just spend the 3 dollars on cling wrap and use that. The Chinese are literally laughing in our face. &amp;#34;STUPID AMERICAN BUY PINK PLASTIC FOR 3 DOLLA&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in brand new condition however the writing on the outside of the package cannot be read because It is written in japanese</li>
    <li> Waste of money doesn&#x27;t work. Couldn&#x27;t even get it to stick on my leg. Made cheaply and is in Chinese.</li>
    <li> You will sweat when you put it on. What they should have said was that one size fits most.</li>
    <li> could use house hold ides instead</li>
    <li> be smart use saran wrap instead</li>
    <li> Been happy so far with all of my products so far</li>
    <li> Delivery very slow, and no instructions in English.</li>
    <li> Hard to keep straight but worth it.</li>
    <li> If you buy this, you will use it how you want to. Its good for something. It is the equivalent to using saran wrap, but waaay better. So I put it under my slimming belts for even more sweating.</li>
    <li> Does not stay in place well</li>
    <li> Not made for anybody that is bigger then a size 2-3</li>
    <li> Love these when I work out.&lt;br /&gt;I add some of my cellulite cream and put this slimming wrap over it&lt;br /&gt;I really sweat !&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place....Doesn&#x27;t do anything !</li>
    <li> The wraps did not stay on once I began to work out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these wraps. It was a waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes you sweat more during your workout. It is comparable to saran wrap but does a better job at staying in place. Used it with albolene to increase the sweating during the workout.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took forever.</li>
    <li> Love how much it makes the area where i put it sweat. Great item.</li>
    <li> I an a size 8 and the shaper was too small.</li>
