<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great. battery life is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to replace an older trimmer from Brookstone. This model outperforms that $ 38 trimmer hands down!</li>
    <li> Love this item! It works very well, seems sturdy, and is multi-purpose. It comes with a cover/case and is small enough to fit in a makeup bag for travel.</li>
    <li> This was a gift that was requested and the person who received it is extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Very good.  I don&#x27;t think you can buy anything that matches this one.</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought it as a gift for the hubby, and he loves it. Works just as described. really great.</li>
    <li> Safe, fast, easy to clean, it does the job and comes&lt;br /&gt;with a nice case. Good deal.</li>
    <li> I like it. Works ok and no problems.</li>
    <li> Finally, one that works great and doesn&#x27;t pull.  It&#x27;s great and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is probably the third battery-operated nose trimer I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I said to myself &amp;#34;this isn&#x27;t cutting it&amp;#34;.  No pun intended, but my old nose hair trimmer wasn&#x27;t sufficiently cutting the hairs, and I had to move it around a lot, and still wasn&#x27;t satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered the Panasonic ER430K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one use, the only thing I can say is &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.  This is the closest nose hair trim I&#x27;ve ever had.  I cannnot believe the difference it makes.  Tremendous.  Fantastic.  Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this review, then you&#x27;re obviously looking for a good trimmer.  This is it.  A +++++++++++++</li>
    <li> Works well with no problems!</li>
    <li> I really liked it before it died after 8 months. Used only 4-5 times. Warranty is covered, but it seems not worth it.</li>
    <li> Trims nose hair great.</li>
    <li> This is a really good trimmer working perfectly. The only con it has is that it has a serious vibration so while trimming the nose it makes you sneeze a lot. Otherwise does its jobs flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Works very well. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is this is the first thing I have purchased in a very long time that didn&#x27;t at least come with a cheap battery.</li>
    <li> I had one before and I got the same good performance.</li>
    <li> It does a great job.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few similar devices in the past and this one beats all of them. I am writing this review after more than a year of intense use. The device is still in perfect condition and works as new. It has a nice design and made from quality materials. It is easy to disassemble for cleaning and assemble after. Simple to reach the battery. The vacuum feature is very handy and really works.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s the job done.  If you&#x27;re not used to using this, it will take some time adjusting to the sensitivity of the product.</li>
    <li> This model replaces a Panasonic trimmer I bought in the late 70&#x27;s (which just stopped working) for $9.95 It works just the same as the old model, except that it&#x27;s a little slower because the new one has a guard with smaller openings, presumably to reduce pulling or inadvertent cuts. One would expect some improvement in 35 years, but not in this case. Still the old was was pretty good. I hope this one lasts as well.</li>
    <li> no burning,pinching,or scratching</li>
    <li> This product gets the job done quickly with no ouchies.  It feels substantial, noise is reserved - have been using this for a couple years now and I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace my old one. the action is so smooth and the vacuum feature is terrific. virtually no &amp;#34;leftovers.&amp;#34; Even gets at the very pesky ear hair. Biology is so weird.</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive product that does the job. Don&#x27;t waste high dollars on similar products when this one is top notch.</li>
    <li> Best working trimmer yet.  Powerful and slick on nose, ears, eyebrows.  Very easy to keep clean and works in water, great for shower.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer as long as you do not open the lead to clean it up. Once you remove the head for cleaning up the hairs and put it back where it was it becomes noisy. I had the same problem with \\&quot;Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer\\&quot; as well. So I give up.</li>
    <li> I love it. Trim my nose &amp; ear hair really easy.</li>
    <li> It was great while it lasted. But it only lasted about 3 weeks and then it wouldn&#x27;t come back on....</li>
    <li> This trimmer, while looking sophisticated in photos, is not really very useful.  If you just want to trim your nose and in-the-ear hair, then buy it with confidence - it does a great job in trimming those hair.  But I was disappointed when I finally got it and used it.  It does not cut at all other hair - all those hair all over your ears, all those almost invisible hair on your upper cheeks, etc.  I had a trimmer for about 14 years until its motor burned out - it cut all those other hair and I also used it to cut hair in my arm pits and even my pubes.  Plus another good thing about that old trimmer was that as it worked all hair fell off instead of depositing inside it.  But this trimmer collects all hair inside its cutting cap that I have to remove and clean after every use.  I cannot use it on arm pits and pubes also because those big hair would collect inside it and might damage it.    I would say do not buy it - you probably need a multi-purpose trimmer like the one I had for 14 years.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer so far...all pros and no cons!</li>
    <li> This one really works, very fast it doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt like others, had another one that was slow, didn&#x27;t work well, it was a painful experiance, and the battery was dead all the time.</li>
    <li> I like this type of nose hair trimmer.  I have used two other brands that were of the vibrator type and they were almost useless.  I had owned a Panasonic years ago but lost it in my travels.  This model has a rotary motor that is far more effective than the vibrator type.  The case is also handy for traveling.</li>
    <li> Interesting design and intention but it is the weakest and dullest of the trimmers I have used.  It is truly useless.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried several trimmers that said they would do the job, but this is the first trimmer that does the job efficiently and effortlessly. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is...OK.  It would work better if it were more powerful.  Plus, it really doesn&#x27;t trim the hair close enough.  I don&#x27;t want to have to wait until the hairs are 1/2 or even 1/4 inch long before the trimmer decides to cut them.  Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Researched products and finally made the choice-  It works as advertized and am happy so far.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is something I&#x27;ve been looking for but was trepidatious to purchase for fear of the nose hair pulling that has happened in the past. Well, I&#x27;m happy to say, none of that is the case with this trimmer. No pulling, tearing or catching at all. It zips along at a rapid pace and cuts the hairs cleanly - for the most part. It cleaned out my nose and ear hairs very effectively with the exception that, sometimes, because of the way the end is designed, you have to go over the same hair a dozen times before they get clipped. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great. I highly recommend it. In fact, it tickles my nose which makes me laugh. Now that&#x27;s a nice benefit to having to trim unsightly hairs.</li>
    <li> This was a very good buy for me. It works really well. The thing   on the bottom is sorta hard to take off but it does come off. That  is where you have to put the battery. 4/5 Starrs from me.</li>
    <li> The item is a good size for a man&#x27;s hand, and yet not too heavy or bulky. It does an excellent job of doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This is my first nose hair trimmer and I am really impressed with both comfort and results.  I feel like a cave man for not having owned a device like this before.  The unit cuts well and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair; it cuts hair down to a stubble length as you work it around the nostril.  Speaking of nostrils, mine feel glorious right now; I can&#x27;t remember the last time my air flow felt so unimpeded.  It easily cuts hair in many areas that are difficult and time consuming to reach with scissors.  The vacuum sucks up most of the trimmings and the blade housing can be easily taken apart and cleaned.  It runs on one AA battery (not included).  What&#x27;s not to like?     With such solid performance, I can&#x27;t understand any of the negative reviews... particularly considering how inexpensive this trimmer is.  It does a great job for less than a Jackson (shipped).</li>
    <li> Hard to find man-scaping tools that are high quality and do what they say they will.  The Panasonic ER430K keeps us from embarassing moments and is portable enough to throw in a medicine bag on a business trip.</li>
    <li> This thing is AMAZING!!! I had a overgrown dense forest growing in my nose. Now I can BREATHE!!!    What&#x27;s cool is that it can do eyebrows too. I have never trimmed my eyebrows in my life. Wow! I don&#x27;t look like a Neanderthal anymore. The unibrow look is SO DATED anyways (by a few millenniums)    An added bonus is that I can snort thicker and longer lines of coke now. What a RUSH!!!    Thanks Panasonic!!!        (I&#x27;m kidding about the coke)</li>
    <li> Fantastic, the best I&#x27;ve had after trying three different ones. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Very nice battery lasted a long time</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer yet!!!</li>
    <li> To be short in words this item does what it should do, I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and I can&#x27;t complain about it totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> For the last three years I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]. I liked its versatility (the eyebrow comb in particular) and how it could reach in further than the rotary-style trimmer.  However, it started to jam on a regular basis and eventually broke, so I bought the Panasonic ER430K as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, that mirror cap.  It seems Panasonic read the complaints of other reviewers that there were no instructions to remove the protective film.  On mine, there was a big \\&quot;Peel off\\&quot; printed on this film.  That said, the reflective cap didn&#x27;t seem to be useful - I tried various angles and it didn&#x27;t add any value for me.  But that wasn&#x27;t why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself works well, though as I note above it doesn&#x27;t reach in quite as far as my old Norelco. I like that it is washable, though I&#x27;d think that using it in the shower would be self-defeating as the hairs would not stick out well, but perhaps I should try it some day.  It is easy to disassemble and wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is a nice touch - I have a Philips beard trimmer with a vacuum - and I could see the hair clippings on the filter screen.  I never had an issue with nose hair clippings irritating my nose, but evidently some do and the ER430K seems to remove a good amount of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s instructions suggest that you can use this trimmer on eyebrows, mustaches, etc.  I suppose you can, yes, but with no ability to control cut length I&#x27;m not sure why you would.  That said, it works well at trimming stray hairs wherever they may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice touch is the zippered carrying bag.  It&#x27;s also nice to know that the removable parts can be ordered separately should they break, wear out or get lost.</li>
    <li> I just totally changed my review of this. Initially it seemed to cut well, and I posted a response based on that. Well, there was a slight change in my viewpoint and now I have sent it to the landfill. The first problem was that although it did initially cut well, I have no idea how but it also cut something in my nose. Thinking I had hit it at the perfect angle at the perfect time, I blew it off as nothing to worry about. Then it happened again and again. At that point I was very conscious of how I used it. That was the first downfall. The next was what someone else had stated--- Panasonic is all about the vacuum portion of it--- with that, it doesn&#x27;t do much for me and the other part of that is the cutters just simply didn&#x27;t last. I have been using it over 18-months and I noticed that it makes a lot of noise and just doesn&#x27;t cut correctly. With that, since my previous two were Wahl and they performed OK, I was on the lookout for something else that may work better. I even entertained the thought if a manual version, but I couldn&#x27;t honestly seeing it work they way I wanted it to, plus it would take two hands at once--- maybe I&#x27;ll try it someday, but not now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I went and tried was an Andis 13430. It looks like in more than one way like a Wahl--- maybe it is, maybe not. Either way, for under $10 I have used it a couple of times and it works much better than the Panasonic. No propensity to nick or cut. Also the resonant frequency that it naturally vibrates at makes my nose tickle less... maybe it is the Panasonic vacuum thing, but either way I sent the Panasonic packing and moved on. I do not expect these things to work perfect, but they should work to some extent. I would have thought more from Panasonic, but for this it is worth looking at something else.</li>
    <li> This works extremely well. I bought it to replace a different model that did a poor job of actually trimming. This one does the trick.</li>
    <li> Great unit, easy to use and clean. The unit is very efficient, don&#x27;t have to change the battery as often.&lt;br /&gt;It is highly durable. It works all the time.</li>
    <li> I am a fairly critical person and truly have nothing negative to say about this device.  It does what it is supposed to do without pain or mess and the zip case is a real plus. I don&#x27;t think you could do better for the price.</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto , funciona de maravilla, solo tomar en cuenta no dejar la bateria puesta ya que en lugares humedos y calientes se sulfata, hay que poner la bateria solo cuando se lo va a usar. Fuera de eso, es un excelente producto.</li>
    <li> Briefly, it does a nice job of trimming one&#x27;s ear or nose hair with sufficient closeness. No irritation, no pulling. Good value for the money, and I would buy it again. I only gave it 4 of 5 stars because, well - it&#x27;s a nose trimmer, not a cutting edge technological breakthrough.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the painful process of using tweezers to pluck unwanted nose and ear hairs.  This product has changed my life(as far as grooming goes)! Its easy to use and works as adverstied.  The vacum is a nice touch as well.  The ONLY drawback is the vacum is loud, but don&#x27;t let that prevent you from buying it.  Be sure to have a AA battery on hand as its not chargable or one you can plug into the wall.</li>
    <li> I had looked for an item like this for a long time -- Amazon had exactly what I wanted for a good price! It does a wonderful job of keeping my nose and ears hair-free!  Also, cleaning is a breeze!</li>
    <li> My ears are now well cleaned.  There&#x27;s a slight blowing for dust, etc. to get the junk out.  The battery seems to last long, too.  I&#x27;m overall happy.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works extremely well and leaves no uneven hairs and you don&#x27;t have the pain of having to clean up little hair bits because of the vacuum feature. My only regret is that I did not purchase this sooner.</li>
    <li> Does not get the job done in the nose or ears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because the reviews were so high, but this thing sucks. The round design keeps me from getting a close cut. I would seriously spend 5 mins in each nostril moving the damn thing around everywhere hearing an ocassional *tick* *tick* as it would get a hair or two. It got a majority of the hair, but left way more than it should. If you value a close trim, then do NOT get thks product. It is way overpriced for the job it does. When I would look in my nose after using this, there would always be a bunch of fairly long hairs in the corners and elsewhere. The cone design is horrible. The hairs have a hard time getting past it. Just look at it. It has a few slits around the side. My nosehairs are all supposed to slip past that? It reminds me of a medieval castle tower with arrow slits (which were actually designed to keep things OUT. Lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my frustration I looked at other designs. I thought i would give the slim clipper style a try. The store I was at had the Remington MPT3500 for like $10 (and cheaper here) [[ASIN:B002D1MZ34 Remington Mpt3500 Dual Blade Facial Trimmer]] and it ROCKS! Took me like a minute total and it trims VERY close. Buy that instead. There are less reviews and less stars for some reason, but it is way better. I&#x27;ve used both.</li>
    <li> Had used the smaller version of this trimmer for years and loved it, but then I dropped it onto the cutter head and dented it.  It wouldn&#x27;t rotate any more so I had to buy a new one.  I thought I would splurge and get the \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; model.    That was a mistake.      First, this vacuum model is huge.  Not that it&#x27;s a foot long or anything, but compared to the non-vacuum model it is ginormous.  It doesn&#x27;t fit the hand well and will take up additional room in my shaving kit when traveling.  Oh, and the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; on the top cap is a complete joke.      Speaking of jokes, the vacuum feature... it&#x27;s completely worthless.  I do feel air pulling through my nose and (annoyingly) venting onto my hand/face, but my nostrils are just as full of trimmed bits of hair when I&#x27;m done as with the non-vacuum model.  In the older model, I would take off the cap and there would be a good bit of hair in with the blade.  On this \\&quot;premium\\&quot; vacuum model, I have yet to find any hair in the unit.  There is a filter inside the cap, so either the trimmed bits are all staying in my nose, or else the particles are too tiny and are passing right through the mesh filter.  I&#x27;d rather have them in the cap, thank you.      Also, on the older, smaller model, a battery would last for months, sometimes 4-6 months when used 2-3 times per week.  This vacuum model is eating batteries in 4-6 weeks.    So, do yourself a favor and save a few bucks and get the simpler model [...] - you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I had an older Panasonic and it was painfull to use.  This new one works perfecty.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull at all.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure what others were refering to being loud.  I didn&#x27;t find it loud at all.  As for the vaccum technology, well, it doesn&#x27;t work so great, but it does just a little. Regardless, I really like this unit.</li>
    <li> After doing extensive research, I decided to purchase this. Some important things to note:  -It uses normal batteries. There&#x27;s no recharger.  -Build quality feels very cheap. It&#x27;s entirely made out of plastic, with some small metal components. Don&#x27;t drop it on the ground!  -It&#x27;s about the length of a toothbrush. Fits very easily into a suitcase, although if your nose hair is growing so fast you need to pack this thing for multiple uses, something&#x27;s wrong with you.  Now onto my personal experience. I&#x27;ve owned this thing for quite a while, but have only used it three times. I&#x27;m afraid to use it again, because the first time I stuck it in, it immediately induced an awful itchy feeling, causing me to want to blow my nose violently. My nose immediately started to secrete mucus from the irritation, and I noticed the mucus was bloody. I followed the directions exactly as said, and to this day don&#x27;t know how it happened. This cut persisted for about a week, and my nose was sore to the touch for the duration. My subsequent uses have all induced an itch, though I didn&#x27;t bleed from use those times.  Beware!</li>
    <li> It just wasn&#x27;t very effective. I will be looking for other options.  Clogged up real fast  and a little tug and pull action.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, exactly what expecte.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think I could ever write a raving review about a nose hair trimmer, but this little item does the job and does it well. Upon receipt, I was impressed by the solid feel...nothing cheap or plastic feeling about it. After 1 week of use, I&#x27;d say it was a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> works as expected - unfortunately even with the vacuum hairs still jam up the device.  Must keep clean</li>
    <li> My husband likes it. Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The panasonic nose trimmer did a great job as they indicated.  I hate getting old and having hair grow where you don&#x27;t want it but this product did do a good job and was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I just bought this facial hair trimmer by Panasonic for my husband via Amazon. I placed the order and it took about 5-6 days to reach us.  I did a little research before buying a new unit. I have bought a good 2-3 of those trimmers they advertise on t.v. on infomercials, but they always seemed to die out early and we couldn&#x27;t get a good battery replacement for them. We now have 2-3 dead trimmers sitting in his cupboard. So...I looked at the feedback of other Amazon reviewers and this unit seemed to get solid feedback.  This unit is small and compact. It takes up little space in the cupboard and will be easy to take on trips and outings as well. It only needs 1 AA battery to run. A quick push to a button up turns it on, remove your thumb and it goes off. The little cutter on the tip is well protected and just causes a gentle tickling sensation when used on the edge of the ear or nose canal. We have not tried it on the eyebrows or sideburns yet, but expect no issues there. There is a built in vaccum that sucks in the debris so, it doesn&#x27;t go all all over the place. The unit is quiet when it use.  It comes in an attractive black/silver finish. A simple black nylon case comes with this unit for final storage.  For the price, I think this is a great piece. As long as it works over the long haul, I think we got a nice trimmer that will stand the test of time.  Buy it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Works great and fast compaired to my other nose hair trimmers. Hey, I need it, so why not have a good trimmer. Very much recommended to men with legs hanging out of their noses.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked great at first. I used it several times with no issues. I like everything about is and it seems to have very good power. It claims that you can get those hard to reach places without cutting yourself... That was not the case for me, I cut the crap out of my nose and it hurt like hell. It could be the way the inside of my nose is formed I am not sure. Just take this review for what it is worth and be careful.</li>
    <li> tle less, than i expected. The main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t cut good on the side areas of a nose. But, more or less, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Pretty thorough trimmer.  Although most will believe that you will not have to do the \\&quot;wipe the trimmings from the nose\\&quot; due to the vacuum, there will still be a little bit of that.  Not too bad compared to then normal ones leaving a small forrest in your nose and making you sneeze.  Definitely a step up from my Wahl....I would definitely recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> Great product and prompt service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for more than a year and it&#x27;s worked perfectly so far. It trims the hairs very, very short, so I don&#x27;t have to trim my nose hairs so often. Also, it vacuums the hairs off the nose, which doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze as other trimers. The battery life is very good and it only uses one AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative point (not so negative, anyway) is that the trimmer is a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> Purchased this model after a cheaper (yet highly rated) died on me in less than 4 months. This model is a MUST have...plus it won&#x27;t cost you a arm and a leg. Even my father, who usually complains about everyone and everything...loved it. He was highly impressed with this model...so being a good son that I am. I went ahead and purchased one for him (well it was used/open box, but he doesn&#x27;t have to know that).</li>
    <li> I have been using this once a week for a couple months now. It is pain free, mess free and easy to use. It works great. It was inexpensive. I would def recommend this for nose and ears!</li>
    <li> It takes a little more time than I thought to trim the hair of my nose but it is still very usefull and specially painless...</li>
    <li> Works mostly well, although hard to get into tiny crevices of the nose with. Overall, does a good job!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for me and one for my spouse. I paid more than the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of us think this trimmer does a poor job compared to our old, less expensive Panasonic trimmers.  It takes too long to do even a small clean up job because it does not seem to cut well nor fast enough. I suppose the vacuum is nice, but we never had an issue without one so I am junking these and replacing them with the simpler model like we had before.</li>
    <li> great product to buy amazon.com is the best will never shop nowhere else unless it is amazon.com</li>
    <li> Pretty much the same as all the others. Works very well and is easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer, I ever owned.  Can clean under the tap water with no problem.  Best.  Best</li>
    <li> Cuts closer than the Panasonic ER411 which lasted about a year before it fell into the sink and broke the catch that holds the cover the cutter blades.  Seems to be much better quality.</li>
    <li> After 9 months of use, the trimmer began pulling hair rather than cutting.  Keeping a fresh battery in the trimmer helped, but the blades have definitely dulled.  Panasonic offers a replacement \\&quot;blade block\\&quot; assembly (WER416K1058) for $11.35 (plus $5.95 for shipping).  Not really a great value given the price of a new unit and that I can get it shipped free with my Amazon Prime membership.    Pros:  - good sized  - easy to use  - trims nose well when new  - ok choice among limited alternatives    Cons:  - weak job of trimming ear hair - leaves visible stubble  - limited life span  - might best be considered a \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; device    Summary: Not sure I would by again.  My scissors still work fine.</li>
    <li> We tried to use this product on a dementia patient...if he weren&#x27;t so combative it could work well. We used it once and cleared out  some heavy growth. Good product. Thanks and the price was right.   d</li>
    <li> I like this one, it&#x27;s very easy to use and really comfortable. And it&#x27;s really worth the function with this price :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always favored Panasonic trimmers and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s got a slightly bulkier base than the previous models I&#x27;ve had (they are durable enough; I&#x27;ve just dropped/damaged them) but it&#x27;s much more efficient and a battery lasts a LOT longer. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the $21 or so it costs in order to step up from the $15 models that require more frequent battery changes. I also have never had a closer trim than I get with my Panasonic trimmers. It does just what I want, so 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Easy,efficient, and less than a minute.  So much less nose hair left in nostril. I fully recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product looks good and the vacuum is a nice feature. I don&#x27;t like the blade setup and I wish it would cut easier and closer.  This product functions okay but not as well as I was looking for.  I don&#x27;t know if there are better blade designs out there but it would be worth looking into before buying.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this trimmer in high hopes I wouldn&#x27;t have to bother with nose trimmings making me sneeze and such. So I got the box and unpacked the thing which wasn&#x27;t hard to do, stuck a battery in the bottom and tried it out. It worked well enough I suppose, it cut the hairs but only vacuumed up some of the hair while leaving others behind. I&#x27; say it vacuumed up about 50%, so obviously I sneezed a few times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other things, the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; on the cap is dull and not really good for anything. The case is made of decent quality cloth with a slight velvety feel to it but sufficient. Also, to clean the thing is not the easiest thing in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good trimmer, but not perfect. 4 stars because it accomplishes it&#x27;s main function... Cutting the hair.</li>
    <li> It worked ok.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of nose hair and this the first one I ever purchased so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I accidently got the trimmer part stuck in the removable top and had a heck of a time getting it unstuck.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift-shipped very quickly. I am told it works great-best he&#x27;s ever owned. Note: The mirror had a label that said \\&quot;peel off\\&quot;.  I peeled that off and the mirror was still cloudy. There is a second film that I needed to scratch in order to remove it.</li>
    <li> People sometimes look at getting older in a completely negative light. I&#x27;m happy to say that there are many aspects of being in my mid-40s that are just fine. I am in great physical condition. I am old enough to say something in a meeting and have other people take me seriously, and yet young enough that the 20-somethings with whom I work can still consider me cool (or at least that&#x27;s what I tell myself). But one thing they don&#x27;t necessarily tell you about in the book of aging: hair tends to start sprouting from places you&#x27;d really never had to maintain in your younger years. Perhaps it is making up for the retreat from my skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I never previously had a need for such a device as a nose hair trimmer. Well, that&#x27;s not true; I&#x27;ve needed one for at least four years. But perhaps being in a state of denial, I never purchased a dedicated tool for said need. Instead, I grimaced at the hair that extended from my nostrils, and hacked away at them with a small pair of scissors. As I would attempt this, I would get a macabre daydream of slipping and falling, jamming said scissors into my brain, and dying in an ignobious manner. Plus, it never really worked very well... and was especially unnerving when I&#x27;d try the same thing with the hair that began emerging from my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Panasonic ER430K. Since this was my first purchase of a grooming device such as this, I looked at reviews and compared feature sets and all that stuff that a good consumer is supposed to do. What I found was that a) people liked the 430K and b) there wasn&#x27;t that huge of a price difference between this top-of-the-line Panasonic model and their lesser offerings. Plus, I was already buying holiday gifts for other people at the time, so I might as well bite the bullet and get this device at a good price and with the free shipping that came along with my sizable Amazon order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was about as simple as possible to set up. Unscrew the battery compartment, pop in a AA battery, and there you are. The next part -- using the device -- seemed self-explanatory. You turn on the switch, and stick it into your nose. Since it has a built-in vacuum, you aren&#x27;t facing the somewhat disgusting task of cleaning your discarded nose hair clippings from your nose and the front of your shirt after using it. I will say, for those of you with little experience in these matters: shoving a buzzing razor into your nose is an odd experience at best, and you should be prepared for it to tickle in a way that you probably haven&#x27;t felt before. The same goes for the first time you use it in your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That having been said, it seems to be tremendously effective. I am happy to say that in looking in the mirror after my first use, both my nose and ears were quickly devoid of unwanted hair. And that&#x27;s why we get devices like this one, isn&#x27;t it? Look, I&#x27;m fine being in my mid-40s. I&#x27;m fine with my greying beard, and the bit of wobble around my waistline. But the nose and ear hair had to go. The Panasonic ER430K did everything I wanted it to, was easy to use, and didn&#x27;t cost a lot. What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic trimmers, and this one is the best. The motor is stronger than the others, and the vacuum feature helps. But one drop onto a hard floor and the unit is dead. I&#x27;ve dropped 3 or 4 Panasonic trimmers over the years and each one died on impact.</li>
    <li> I use it in my office when the girls are not looking, excellent little unit it is better than a larger unit I use at home.    topdog</li>
    <li> works but not super great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried trimmers in the past and they never worked for me, so I just used a pair of cuticle scissors instead.  I lost those scissors so I went on Amazon and found this.  I got it yesterday and stuck it up my nose and voila.  It got everything from the deep hairs inside to the bushy stuff under the tip of the nose.  Easy.  No discomfort.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many of these - they always suck or break or both.  This one actually works and works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k.  Not great.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome! I have thick curly nose and ear hair. This puppy trimmed it with no problem. I really like the fact that it vacuums the hair as it cuts it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in a few months on its longevity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for a few months now, and it meets all of my manscaping needs. It was one of only a few of its kind that included the vacuum technology. I chose a trimmer with a vacuum, because my former trimmer would leave small shavings in my nostrils, and it would itch, get inhaled when I would breathe, and sometimes cause me to cough - rather girlish when I did, so I couldn&#x27;t have it emasculating me. I give it 5 stars, because it has made my former trimmer into a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has pesky nose hairs that need to stay above the nostril line and may have had an experience like mine with another trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this trimmer. It has a special guard on it so it is impossible to pinch while trimming. The vacuum action is totally cool! It is so nice not having a million little hairs left in my ears and nose after trimming! It has a very high quality feel in your hand but that&#x27;s no surprise since it&#x27;s a Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I own this model. Follows after four different models / brands over several years.  Cutting function - is the finest I have experienced.  This unit actually rather than plucking. Well made.  Long battery life.  Easily cleaned.  Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few trimmers and this is the best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s easy to hold and does a great job and it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;bite you\\&quot; like some trimmers will. I think the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature is more of a gimmick than anything, but the trimmer does a great job at trimming and that&#x27;s what is most important to me.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer twice and I am surprised how good it trims the ear hair.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  And the carring pouch makes it an ideal addition to my travel bag.  Use it often on business trips.  Nobody likes to see nose hairs hanging out and this item takes care of the problem, more especially when meeting with customers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of nose trimmers and always ended up throwing them away. There were always problems with them: ineffective, painful, fragile, not durable, etc.    I decided to try this trimmer out after reading all the feedback. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and I am extremely impressed. This is the first trimmer that really does the job and does it well. Overall, I have to say, this trimmer lived up to the reviews.    The vacuuming feature works great so that I don&#x27;t have any cleanup at all after using it. And the price was just a few dollars more than the non-vacuuming model.    It&#x27;s well-made and I feel confident it will last.    I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> No issues works well.</li>
    <li> Works and does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> finally, a product that trims ear and nose hair between haircuts and does it quickly and painlessly.</li>
    <li> Well this is my first \\&quot;nose hair\\&quot; trimmer ever. I&#x27;m glad that i purchased it. Though i hate that i actually need it. This particular model works ok. I dont know if other models have more than two cutting blades but this one could use four or five. It seems as though this would help out. With out the extra blades, and the fact that the two rotating blades that it does have sit pretty far down into the device - it seems as though this unit requires a lot of manual manipulation once inside your nose \\&quot;in and out then turn the unit, in and out then turn again\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t know if this is normal because this is my first unit. The vacuum feature is definitely a plus. Beware when you are rinsing out the head of nose hair clippings. The tiny actuator parts that are non steel have a tendency to want to float right out of the head and right down your sink drain! Other than that it will do the job with a little of your effort.</li>
    <li> My husband said that this is the best one that we have tried.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for a man.  Seems to work well and cuts fast without pulling any hair in the process.  So, if your man friend or lady friend ;) has a few more hair than usual, this works really well.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer twice so far and it has worked as advertised. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it, both for the ears and nose.</li>
    <li> I  love this nose trimmer it works really well. If anything happens to this one I will buy another one right away</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a very good job.It also very easy to clean after use.I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Just love them. Close cut that lasts for several days. No more nose tickle! I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Not the best and not the worst I&#x27;ve used.  I actually like a larger more substantial trimmer.  My last was much more powerful.  Used c cell batteries.  I do enjoy the vacuum, but feel this also draws too much power away from the cutting blade.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s - Vacuum, light weight, portable, wet/dry use, and effective&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s - underpowered, takes several passes to complete job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it a 3.5, but amazon doesn&#x27;t have half star ratings.  The price is average, but I still recommend this overall.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of other trimmers to compare to, but I can compare this one to a \\&quot;cheapy one\\&quot;.  This one is much better.  I don&#x27;t expect to need another one for a long long time.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. Removes ear and nose hair quickly and the vacuum collects the hair.</li>
    <li> My husband said it is loud when cleaning the ear hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a previous nose clipper.  That one was better, but this one does the job albeit not as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I would buy this again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I dropped my old ER411 a few days ago and it never recovered from that injury, so I decided to give the ER430K a shot.  However, I am unable to recommend this model -- it simply didn&#x27;t work as well as my old workhorse.    My main gripe is that the ER430K took repeated poking and prodding to get any hair to come in contact with the blade, and was unable to reach shorter hairs at all.  At first, I thought I had failed to remove a packing piece, especially since the ER430K&#x27;s blade-tip is a rounded plastic nub with blades on either side.  But according to the manual, the unit was ready for use with the exception of a battery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not totally happy. it takes a long time to trim hair and doesn&#x27;t cut very well.  It is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I have a little ear hair which is why I bought this and I used to have a norelco brand that had a rechargeable battery inside, it worked great until the battery refused to hold a charge. I looked for a good replacement and came across this Panasonic unit and it really does a decent job. I do find I have a slightly harder time using it around the ear but it does cut the little hairs without any pulling or pain. I&#x27;m very happy that this uses a AA battery and is easily replaceable. I am curious how long I&#x27;ll actually beable to use it before I have to replace the battery. So far I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks and it&#x27;s still running as strong as it was when I first put the battery in so all looks good.</li>
    <li> Works good even when wet!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty simple device that works as advertised.  What more could one want?  Takes care of those annoying ear and nose hairs and best of all, doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut your skin. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Quiet and efficient I am very happy with this purchase.trims with no discomfort and the vacuum also seems to work well</li>
    <li> This trimmer is ok, but nothing to write home about.  I found that I had to be careful or pulled hair and nicked  my skin.</li>
    <li> Better price then other areas,  Good product!!</li>
    <li> I may have had bad luck. It worked well until it broke after a few days.</li>
    <li> Owned a previous Panasonic trimmer -- ER415 -- and loved it. When the blades and motor started to wear I decided to replace it with the upgraded ER430. The ergonomics and intent of the design are well thought out but the blade -- which has been redesigned -- falls way short of the guide and prevents close trimming. If I can&#x27;t find the older blade design -- which fits the ER430 -- I&#x27;ll have to return it.</li>
    <li> Have had many trimmers in the past that get clogged, or dont trim hair close enough. This one is powerful, fast, and trims nice and close!</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have owned one nose hair trimmer after another and they were all lousy. That is, until I bought a Panasonic ER430K. This is, without a doubt, the best all-around design ever. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming action is sure and certain. It really gets after those pesky nasal and ear hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature is brilliant. It sucks the cuttings up so they don&#x27;t end up falling deeper into the nose and ear cavities and is easy to clean out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting/vacuum-collector head snaps off with a slight twist and has a very positive click stop engagement that assures secure attachment to the body with nice tactile feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zippered storage case protects the unit during storage in your bathroom cabinet drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of all parts (including the case) is outstanding---top quality throughout.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide what to get my dad for Father&#x27;s Day (the man who has practically everything). I have this trimmer and I knew he didn&#x27;t so I got him one and he loves it. Easy to use and very effective. It gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I lost my great Sharper Image nosetrimmer which had cost me $35 or so a couple of years ago. I bought this one to replace it and compared to the Shaper Image one, it is OK.  It makes a racket during its use - so using it to remove ear hairs is a challenge.</li>
    <li> Over all great nose hair trimmer.  I&#x27;ve never used one or owned one before and normally I used scissors.  But this is awesome.  I have no shame in saying I use a nose hair trimmer, this thing is so great.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends, and I recommend it to you too.</li>
    <li> I wish I had gotten this trimmer years ago.  It works great trimming my nose hair.  My other &#x27;cheapo&#x27; one can&#x27;t compare to this one.  I spent quite a bit of time looking at trimmers here on Amazon, and I&#x27;m glad I picked this one. I like it a lot and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> After long term use (6 months) blades become very dull and will feel like hair is being jerked out. Not cut.</li>
    <li> I had been using for years a less expensive Panasonic nose trimmer that just finally died. After reading customer reviews I decided to purchase the Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer. It works great an much better than the previous one that I had been using. It gets all the nose hairs with little effort and cuts them down close. It is quieter than what I had been using, so I am able to use it on my ear hairs also. It disassembles easily and easy to keep clean. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great cutter for all of your ear and nose hairs.  It vacuums all loose hairs efficiently.  It is quieter then any other trimmer I have used in the past.  Great product from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product. Would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My husband is satisfied with this product. It does seem to work well. He says he will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It does the job and better than the last trimmer I had. Easy to clean out. Doesn&#x27;t yank or pull at hairs.</li>
    <li> Had the previous model for about 1+years and then kablooey!&lt;br /&gt;No warning, weird noises, or shaking. Just up and quit on me like a slinky slut.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it and the gosh-darned thing left me. I changed battery and nada. I suppose something internal?&lt;br /&gt;I was mad as hell and I wanted it to work. I&#x27;ve been un-groomed for several months now and WoW I saw this model. I&#x27;m smitten again. I&#x27;ll see how this relationship works out. I have High hopes...</li>
    <li> Ok men, we who have aged a little understand...  Your hair is going to migrate off your head and down your back.. and on the way it camps out in your ears and your nose!!!  There is no easy way to take care of this..  I tried tweezers... that&#x27;ll bring a tear to your eye in a hurry.  I never wanted to buy a little gadget like this, but life has forced me to it.  Now that I have it, I wonder why I didn&#x27;t buy it 5 years ago!  The first time I used it the little vacuum in it tickled the crap out of my nose, but it did it&#x27;s job nicely.  (It has a vacuum to suck out the cut hairs so they are not left in your nose to irritate you.  I never thought of that, but I&#x27;m glad whoever designed it did and it worked nicely.)  Fantastic for short trimming jobs. (Like fixing a uni-brow if you have one.)  If you buy this, I hope you end up as happy with it as I am... and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a month and it works great, way better than any nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve owned before. I love this thing.</li>
    <li> I had a previous trimmer from Brookstone which was about $15.00 more and it didn&#x27;t seem to perform nearly as well as this one.  Don&#x27;t think twice..just buy it!</li>
    <li> nice product .small and easily portable. love the vacuum feature. definitely gets the job done and i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL AS USUAL ABOUT TRYING THESE GADGETS, BUT WAS QUITE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.  THE TRIMMER DID JUST WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD DO; NEATLY AND PAINLESSLY!  YOU CAN TRUST THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY APPREHENSION.</li>
    <li> Looks like a nice trimmer; purchased as gift.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> By far the best product of this kind that I have tried -- and I have tried MANY.  Much better than the old Panasonic models.  This one works extremely well and doesn&#x27;t hurt you in the process.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Over the last few years, I have bought many nose hair trimmers from Amazon. Specifically, I have bought the [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear n Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]] twice and [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110/60 NoseTrimmer 3300 (Packaging May Vary)]] twice. The only reason I have bought them so many times is because they keep failing on me and breaking--either they won&#x27;t cut even after cleaning or they won&#x27;t power on at all even with a new battery (a lot of people have problems with the ERGN30K specifically, just look at the more critical reviews on that product page that explains why it breaks down). It was getting quite annoying buying new ones every year--so I also tried the heavily lauded [[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]] because it didn&#x27;t rely on a battery and people say it would last a lifetime--but it HURT LIKE HELL when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I cannot say anything about its durability yet (just got it last week--will update when/if it fails), I can already say this is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever bought thus far--which is KIND OF SAD CONSIDERING EARLIEST REVIEWS OF THIS PRODUCT DATE BACK TO 2006! (aside: think of all the inventions/discoveries we made since 2006--and after 9 years no one made a better product to cut nose hair?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum system TRULY works and makes a WORLD of difference--goodbye sneezing while cutting and blowing your nose 50 times to try to get all the little hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also just feels a lot more hefty and durable than the Panasonic ER-GN30-K. However, only time will tell if it will outlast the other nose hair trimmer bestsellers on Amazon. I promise to update when it fails--but if you want to make sure mine is still alive and kicking whenever you are buying, just comment on this review and I will update you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for now, the extra 5 dollars over the other bestselling models is sooooo worth it.t.</li>
    <li> Good one, even the out looking looks cheap.</li>
    <li> (Before I begin, I will say that I bought this solely for the intention of trimming the hair in my nostrils.)    I was a bit skeptical at first because I never really used one of these things before, but after seeing the high ratings and feedback I decided I would go for the Panasonic ER430K.    I am writing this review just 1 minute after using this thing and let me tell you, it not only got all the hair out of my nose (it is like a forest in there) but it sucked the hair out as it was trimming it, just like a vacuum; exactly like it advertised!     I did not experience any kind of discomfort such as pulling or anything. I did however enjoy the sound of my nose hair getting trimmed off and sucked away as I moved this little trimmer around in my nostril.     Cleaning was a breeze, because all the hair is vacuumed up there is no mess and the hair sits nicely inside the filter which can be easily removed and cleaned by running some water through it, same goes for the blades too.    I am very happy with this purchase and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> Seeking to avoid the \\&quot;Lon Cheney as the Wolfman!\\&quot; look from vintage movie posters, I bought one of these a couple months back.     So far, I&#x27;m pleased. It trims nose hairs and upper mustache hairs well (though I&#x27;ll be honest, it tickles the bejesus out of my nose!), ear hairs, and I&#x27;ve even used it on a few errant eyebrow hairs that were getting out of hand. It comes apart easily for cleaning, and being able to put it under the faucet is a really nice feature.     The only caveat that keeps it at 4 stars is that it sometimes takes 3-4 passes to get all the hairs you&#x27;re afer. Some of this is due to learning how to hold it, and some is due to the cylindrical guard on the blade, which makes it a little tricky to get the hairs and the blades in contact. Still, it&#x27;s better than cutting your nose open with an exposed blade, so I&#x27;m not complaining.     Good trimmer, great cleanup.</li>
    <li> Trims well. And although at first I thought that such a seemingly slight vacuum-action would be ineffective, I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. It seems to have vacuumed just fine. Definitely could use a little more length to the blade housing unit - I think a gooseneck there would have helped a lot with getting to those hard-to-reach spots. A good value at $19.88.</li>
    <li> much better than the one I used last year.&lt;br /&gt;it works properly. No pain, not cuts, and clean</li>
    <li> I used couple nose trimmers in the past and they always get jammed or pull the hair. I used this product only few times and I liked it better than the old ones. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer is slightly bulkier than other models but there are many redeeming qualities that make it work.  First, it comes with a good zipper case handy for travel.  It also has a built in light so that it can be directed better than other models.  As far as the blades and its efficiency go, so far so good.  I can use it to trim nasal hair, the hair that grows in and around the ear, and even trim hair on the neck in selected places.  Does just what it is supposed to do, and very well.  Would buy again if I needed another.</li>
    <li> Really great compared to previous model. Use with a rechargeable battery for more consistent power (conventional batteries die a slow death with low power).</li>
    <li> the suction feature keeps it very clean, great look, highly recommended  UPDATE: after 14 months even with a new battery things aren&#x27;t as good with this once sturdy nose trimmer. It pulls hairs, doesn&#x27;t do the job. Great for 12 months though. All I&#x27;m saying is it didn&#x27;t last long that&#x27;s for sure</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product it said that promised and is useful to travel with it, I recomended it for males</li>
    <li> This is my second nose hair trimmers that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past 5 years or so. The first one that I had was really good and I wish I could buy it again, unfortunately I can&#x27;t remember where I got it or what the brand was. So I purchased this nose hair trimmer from Panasonic because my first pair was slowly falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself seems sturdy enough and looks good, but it never seemed really cut my nose hairs at all. I would put it in my nose and I pull it out and it felt like nothing was actually being cut, just a bunch of whirling. I don&#x27;t have a lot of nose hair at all and so the fact that this product was so ineffective leads me to believe that more thought went into the design of the device but not enough went into usability testing of whether or not it actually accomplished the goal cutting nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After feeling somewhat frustrated by what I felt was the razor&#x27;s poor performance, I pulled out the razor in the trimmer and compared it to that of my previous nose hair trimmers. I&#x27;m certainly not an expert, but the razor from this nose hair trimmer device didn&#x27;t seem like it was engineered right. So I swapped out the razor from my previous device and put it in the new device. I have been using this device for the past year or so and it works much better, but it is still not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this product didn&#x27;t work well for me. Perhaps others out there will have a different experience, but I&#x27;m still looking for something that is more effective.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better from Panasonic. I used it 3X and hate it. It does not do a good job, I rather do it the old way and use a razor or electric shaver.</li>
    <li> only the second one I have owned, but by far the best. Cleans itself, quiet running, absolutely no pain, no hair pulling. Sharp blades, but it is new. Do not know yet about battery life.</li>
    <li> Note:  Doesnt work on pubes.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ER430K offers a closer trim than the two other nose trimmers I have tried, but one day I dropped it on the bathroom floor and it popped apart.  When I reassembled it according to the instruction manual, the blades scraped against the tip housing and it hasn&#x27;t worked since.  I&#x27;m going to order another and be more careful with it, because I believe it&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an old unit that I had lost.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s supposed to be and more.</li>
    <li> I use those trimmer very often, this Panasonic ER430K does a very good !!!. It&#x27;s also very elegant, and brings a small bag to store it.</li>
    <li> Received item quickly and in excellent condition.  Great Sale.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I just love this hair clipper. Better than any I have used from various other manufacturers. Built in mirror on the cap is slick. I thought it would never really help but it is cool. I also love the carrying case. The machine is easy to clean. Though I have started to go frequently to Bazillion place as the waxed out nose hair dont grow back for 4 to 6 weeks. I use this hair clipper in between for those wild hair. :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Simple and easy and does its job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my significant other and even tried it myself for my brows. Works great. Very lightweight, multi-functional and the price is right. If you buy it, you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> my husband used them once and it caused him a nose bleed....but he may just need to try again and he is use to his dull trimmer.</li>
    <li> powerful and doesn&#x27;t pull my nose hair</li>
    <li> This is the first facial hair trimmer I&#x27;ve owned that actually does what it is supposed to do: trim hair, consistantly. The Panasonic ER430K is light, easy to use, and litterally gets every hair in its path. Nose, ears, even for trimming up where your main razor missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> As good as described in the ad. Recommend</li>
    <li> Probably the best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a nose hair trimmer. It does the job... batteries have lasted quite awhile. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> ive had a few nose ear trimmers and this one cuts by far the best! my only complaint is it tickles my nose because of the vacume part pulling air thru my nose hairs. doesn&#x27;t tickle me in the ear, i must not be as sensitive there</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer rocks, heavy duty.  I have another brand, and it just didn&#x27;t cut it, no pun.</li>
    <li> Little less, than i expected. The main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t cut good on the side areas of a nose. But, more or less, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Product worked as specified for the first four months.  Then top piece under the blade broke or sounds broken.  Reliability is in questions, would have hoped to get a year or two out of it.</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of doing to get results, not sure why, maybe the blades. Had one before that worked great until it was dropped.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, this trimmer actually works quite well.  You can tell it&#x27;s constructed much better than the dozen I&#x27;ve probably tossed over the years.  It actually works much better than any other which is pretty amazing since all of these things are almost identical in design.  In fact, when you open this one up to clean it, you can see why.  This unit uses an entirely unique blade shape and configuration so it has a much better chance of trapping and slicing the hairs usually missed by the previous units I&#x27;ve used.       I almost never review products but I really appreciate it when someone takes the time to provide a recommendation that provides relevant information on why someone should or should not look at a product for themselves.    I&#x27;ve truly found this one a league above all previous models by several different manufacturers and would highly recommend that anyone give this one a try.   Oh, I almost forgot, this little trimmer seems to also have a far more powerful motor than any previous one I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m sure everyone knows how these things all seems to peter out and barely run within a year.  Granted, I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple months but based on the apparent strength of the motor, I would find it amazing if this one gives out as others always seem to after some time.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to hold. Seems to work fine. Noticeably noisier (and to me annoyingly so) than the 10 year old Braun that it replaced.</li>
    <li> This is the first one I have owned and it works great.  It is much better than using scissors for trimming.  It is quick, quiet and painless.  The vacuum feature is nice, no hair to clean up. Panasonic quality is nice.</li>
    <li> Great Product work perfectly</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve found after years of looking and buying.  The vacuum ability is a subtle but useful addition.</li>
    <li> What can one say about the Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Ear Hair Trimmer except two words... It Works!    Not only does it shave away unsightly nose and ear hair, but the built in vacuum means you won&#x27;t accidentally breathe in any nose hair strands that will get caught in the back of your throat (similar to what happened to Larry David in that episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.)    Appropriate as a gift for married guys, single guys, tough guys, average guys, or even metrosexuals. A perfect birthday present or stocking stuffer at Christmas (or Hanukkah).  Excellent for the man who is nasty and as scandalous as a mug (with regards to the crops and bushes growing out of his nose and ears)!</li>
    <li> Product beautiful and elegant appearance Recommend to which this product</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product, works great!</li>
    <li> This is stainless steel with vacuum tech nose hair trimmer, moreover, it is hypo-allergenic.By the way you can rinse it under water and also great for those hard-to-reach ass hair.</li>
    <li> Finally I found the best one of these. I like the fact that the hair is &amp;#34;vacuumed up&amp;#34; so not falling anywhere or sticking inside the blades. Does a faster and very good job.</li>
    <li> It tickles a bit, but it works painlessly and efficiently on nose hair. Great product. And it&#x27;s nice to have the case to keep it stashed away in a cabinet.</li>
    <li> I am using this item consistently for over a year. Very happy. Works great</li>
    <li> Just got this last week and have been nose hair free since. Gave the nose a thorough hair cut and it worked great, alot better then a couple I have bought in Walmart or CVS. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to trim the fro from your nose.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ER430K was highly rated, so I assumed that it was considerably better at trimming nose hair (my primary need). I was wrong. I have a non-name brand trimmer which was identical-looking at the business end, just a slim body to house a AA battery and no vacuum. The rotary trimmer inside did just as good a job as the Panasonic and only cost about $9. What I would have wanted to know before buying this item would have been information that would have described WHY this product was so much better and how that had been determined. I expected a more sophisticated, well-engineered trimmer, but sadly, didn&#x27;t get it. I&#x27;d STILL like to know how reviewers of this product gave it such a high rating over other trimmers.</li>
    <li> I had one, used it 1 or 2 times per month...in about 10 months the little blade inside was jamming and would hardly turn at all...It was not damaged....trying the Phillips this time.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected.  It appears to be trimming the hair, but not convinced the vacuuming works all that well.  Does not grab hairs or get hot during usage like my old one.</li>
    <li> nice looking product, well priced.  it worked well, but felt just as cheap as any other plastic, battery-operated nose/ear hair trimmer out there.  two months later, out of the blue, just stopped working.  never was dropped or mishandled, it wasn&#x27;t even used all that often... just died.  i have tried numerous products that all feel the same, they all seem to be cheaply made.  going to give the philips norelco product a try now, but this will be the last time i purchase a battery operated one, if it dies, i am moving to a hand operated one, or just go back to using a razor... can&#x27;t be spending 15 bucks every few months for crappy products anymore.</li>
    <li> I just turned 30 and my nose hair has started to get out of control. I guess I just assumed that it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me but, alas, it did. When I first noticed the occasional hair poking it&#x27;s ugly head out of my nostril I decided to purchase a beard trimmer with a nose hair attachment. It was okay for those baby hairs but at some point in the aging process they got out of hand and I needed a solution. I debated spending $20 such a specialized product but it was absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product runs on a single AA battery, I&#x27;m using an Energizer Lithium battery for extended life. The unit is also larger than I expected, the size is required to support the vacuum motor and fan, but it&#x27;s not too big, it fits comfortably in my hand. A cap is supplied to cover the end that spends the most time crammed into your nose. On said clip there is a small mirror in case you need to trim up when no mirror is available, an added bonus. The small black inconspicuous bag is also a nice touch. Now that I spent the money I sort of wished I would have spent a little more for a unit with a built-in light.</li>
    <li> It cut my husband while being used for trimming his nose hair. Now its sitting on a shelf collecting dust. Sadly the reviews I read stated that its design wouldn&#x27;t allow for cutting yourself while using.</li>
    <li> Bought this exact model several years ago.  Worked perfectly all of the time.  Had to buy this replacement because I left the old one in a drawer in a rental cabin, frustrating for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been able to use this on eyebrows which saves money for waxing.  Blades are sharp and never had to replace battery in the old one.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box I thought I was shipped a 65 Buick Skylark. Which is like really big for a nose hair trimmer so I returned it. The problem was it had this 60s car fin shape. So it really did look like an old Buick. I didn&#x27;t want to dedicate so much medicine cabinet or suitcase space to a trimmer so back it goes. I would recommend buyers look into a combo beard trimmer with a nose ear hair trimmer function. From the other reviews I assume it would function well but it was almost insanely large. I can&#x27;t believe I have expended this much energy on buying a nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, but did not live up to the positive reviews I read prior to purchasing.  I do like the way it traps hair after cutting, but it does no better than any other model I&#x27;ve tried at trimming hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard getting too excited about such a product, given the inextricable link between it and advancing age.  Nonetheless, this is not the device&#x27;s fault -- it works just as advertised.  It seems well made and is easy to operate.  No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> As I have aged, I seem to have joined the males in growing nose hairs, which were very embarrassing for me.  I tried trimming them with round-point scissors but it was a bit dangerous.  So I purchased this Panasonic facial hair trimmer and voila!....my nose hairs disappeared.  It is well made in that the cutting blades are perfectly shielded so that I do not injure myself.  I only wish I had purchased it several years ago.</li>
    <li> I have tried every nose trimmer from wahl to Panasonic over the years and I have never thought that any of them worked. They pulled your hair or just did not cut it. I read the mixed reviews on this Panasonic trimmer and I still bought it. After using it just one time I was amazed. IT WORKS! I would have paid twice the price. Just get it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I have had it for awhile and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent nose hair trimmer for some time. This is it. Its very powerful.</li>
    <li> I love everything from Panasonic -  from TVs and recorders, to pencil sharpeners and hair trimmers. This model is worse than the oldest cheap first model (that was working perfectly and reliably during 5 years, till my dog chew it:). This one is more expensive but not as safe as the oldest model because it can bite/slice a small piece of your sensitive nasal mucosa all of a sudden. It is like having shaving biopsy, but not at doctor&#x27;s office :) So, be extremely careful when using it.  Othervise, it is still working; unbreakable (like all that comes from Panasonic :)</li>
    <li> Worked fine for 5 months, then nothing.  Batteries are fine.  Since it is still under warranty, I will contact panasonic for replacement.    UPDATE Jan 3, 2015:  I did get a replacement, which has worked fine to date.  You need to be very, very careful when you disassemble for cleaning.  If not fully aligned during reassembly, it will be noisy or be jammed and not work at all.</li>
    <li> The best little trimmer i&#x27;ve used.  Super sharp and gets into those hard to reach areas.  It doesn&#x27;t pull, just a clean cut.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this model to replace an older Panasonic model that I loved for years. This new model ER430K is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement. It&#x27;s nice and quiet, and I&#x27;m sure the vacuum works great, but I wouldn&#x27;t know since the blades would not cut the hairs I was trying to trim. We&#x27;re talking about hairs easily 1/4\\&quot; in length. A trimmer should be able to shave those down, don&#x27;t you think? If the hair was longer than that I could have used scissors. Don&#x27;t bother even trying this product, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The product worked as promised. Will buy it again as a gift for someone. Note: This product doesn&#x27;t shave the hair but just trims it down to a very acceptable level. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use. Drains a full charged battery in less than ten minutes. Better start using rechargeable batteries if you mind the expense!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and I don&#x27;t believe I have seen so much nostril in my life, since, of course, his usage of the new nose hair trimmer!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The blades spin at top speed without fail. Something cheaper knockoffs don&#x27;t do. It doesn&#x27;t bog down while trimming. It doesn&#x27;t gouge the skin or pull/rip the hair out. The vacuum feature works better than I expected. Great product. Make sure you buy it from Amazon and not a partner. My first purchase was from a partner who shipped the wrong product. (One of the cheaper models) Amazon however was great about the return and made the process as painless as possible.</li>
    <li> Does the job for sure Love that it vaccms all the  air!</li>
    <li> This product does an outstanding job and does a better job then other brands I have owned. This trimmer&#x27;s quality appears to well above other brands I have used. The best feature of this product, that I have experienced, is that it does not pull nose hair!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. As mentioned in the previous review, it trimms the hair to acceptable level.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He&#x27;s never had one before but thought he might like it.  He was unsure about how they work exactly but found it easy to use and effective.  I like it because there&#x27;s no mess after using it.</li>
    <li> First nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased that worked.  Great product and well worth the money.  Quit buying those cheap trimmer and invest in this product that works and will last.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband - works great - no pain and it will keep life&#x27;s \\&quot;getting older\\&quot; annoyance in check!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I had a Panasonic for many years before purchasing this one and it worked very well. This one does not. It cuts nose/ear hairs poorly and takes much longer to cut them than the previous model. I don&#x27;t know where to steer you for a better trimmer. I&#x27;m going to give the Angel Sales Neat Nose Hair Trimmer a try (with only 1 review at the time of purchase). Good luck.</li>
    <li> I had bought a Panasonic trimmer several years ago, and it had done a great job. I stupidly had replaced it with a brand other than Panasonic. that one had not done a good job and died far too early. I have since replaced that non-Panasonic trimmer with this one. This works great! It does a thorough job very quickly.</li>
    <li> best trimmer I have ever used.  I haven&#x27;t seen this at walmart or target.  PLUS, this is cheaper then the ones at walmart and kmart and comes with a vacuum feature and carrying case [at least when I bought it].  Great find on amazon</li>
    <li> Seemed to do the job pretty good, but the motor slowed down as I was using it. I could have replaced it, but it was kind of bulky holding it. Sent it back for a refund, and will look for something else.</li>
    <li> work good but they do not last long. not sure if is a battery connectivity issue or low quality motor.</li>
    <li> It is OK considering the price. But not that effective, it is just OK. Whenever I use it, I just want to sneeze. I dont know why.</li>
    <li> Cleans up the nose hairs, hasn&#x27;t snagged any of them while clipping.  Aces in my book.</li>
    <li> Effective with suction to keep hair that were cut together for easy removal</li>
    <li> Hey!, It works, what else can I say?  Very comfortable to use, and I like the battery instead of the re-chargeable method.</li>
    <li> This was an upgrade for my husband for Father&#x60;s day.His other personal groomer was older and smaller.  He was pleased with the ease of use.His dog had chewed his other to pieces, so this was a great gift.</li>
    <li> Un producto que no puede faltar para los hombres, excelente funcionamiento, no me gusto el sistema de aspiraci&amp;oacute;n, la verdad, no percibo que aspire los vellos que corta, no me parece efectivo, pero la maquina corta muy bien el vello, hace poco ruido y es muy f&amp;aacute;cil de manejar.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Like it very much and once again recommend it it highly.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It trims very fast and works perfectly!  Keeps me very happy that I purchased it!  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Keep looking for another product. This product broke after the first use. This is a total waste.</li>
    <li> works great - good buy.</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but it does the job. I sometimes have trouble getting a hair or two from my nose though. Not too bad.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is lightweight and strong as a bull!  I was tempted to buy one of the more expensive heavy weight trimmers, but I decided to try the Panasonic ER430K.  I am happy I did, this one is winner no matter how tough your nose hairs are.</li>
    <li> Purchased this from The Art of Shaving 6 months ago. I ended up giving it away and purchased the Panasonic GNK30 which I am much happier with... I am not a person who posts many reviews, but in this case I wish I would have known a few things and/or purchased a different trimmer from the get go. For the record I am not an extremely hairy person but I do groom frequently. That being said my personal opinion: The vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t add much function but would irritate my nostrils and cause me to sneeze which I disliked (never had this problem without the vacuum feature on past trimmers). This unit burns through batteries fairly quickly which can be annoying as when they start to die it doesn&#x27;t cut as well and causes the dreaded tearing out of hair. For whatever reason it didn&#x27;t seem to cut as well as my 10 year old Remington nose trimmer either right out of the box and cut quality seems to directly relate to battery strength ie cuts very well after a fresh battery, but the last few weeks of battery life before they die out is painful. It is not a terrible trimmer and may work well for others as it has great reviews, but my personal experience was not quite as great as others have had. Best of luck!</li>
    <li> My husband owns this and i can say, yes this works and it&#x27;s a great price. Not exciting to review for me. As long as it works and my husband is happy with this, I am too and as long as i can&#x27;t see any hairs and don&#x27;t have to clean it up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend- while he is predominantly hairless, his nose seems to get all the hair the rest of his body is missing.  While it does cut like it is supposed to, I give it 4 stars because he feels like it pulls a lot and is extremely tickly. He uses it because he has to but sometimes he just uses scissors instead so as to avoid the tickles.</li>
    <li> I got this half as a gag gift for my dad, but it works very well. Even though it isnt too expensive, i suppose its a pretty high end nose hair trimmer because its the most expensive one i can find. my dad has been using it since february, and he likes it a lot. its also nice that it comes with a carrying case and cap.</li>
    <li> Why is it when you you are young you wish for hair, when you start to age you wish for less of it? I have had a few different types of nose/ear trimmers and this one ranks as the best I have owned. Does it&#x27;s job quietly, safely and without pulling like some other cheap ones do. Cleaning is a snap and even comes with a nice little black pouch which can store the unit.     Highly recommended</li>
    <li> As others have said the old Panasonic trimmers worked great. This doesn&#x27;t. In fact it doesn&#x27;t cut nose or ear hair at all. Ponderous. You can hear the motor spinning but, as others have alluded to, the design has changed (?for legal reasons?) and nothing is cut. Another reason for tort reform as if any more were needed in our litiginous society. When the previous one cut/pulled the hair and pinched a bit you knew it was working. What kind of people sue Panasonic for that? How much can you really hurt yourself with a trimmer? I would like to give no stars.</li>
    <li> This product surprised me with how well it works. Glad I got one.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a good nose trimmer for his birthday and this was the perfect gift! He really likes it. The only negative aspect about it is that it tickles inside his nose to the point where tears run down his face :-)  Otherwise it does its job, and it does it best!</li>
    <li> This is the 3 rd Panasonic I have tried !!!  The 1 st one I purchased many yrs ago was the best. It was perfect until I dropped it and it was damaged. The 2nd more upscale one was a dud. This 3 rd fancy one with vacuum and carry bag was more expensive and was just NOT effective. It does NOT cut as advertised and is a POOR choice. Please Panasonic, you can do better.</li>
    <li> I bought a Panasonic nose and ear hair trimmer some 6 years ago and was quite happy with it until it gave up its ghost.  Upon ordering this new Panasonic ER430K ear and nose hair trimmer and using it for the first time, I have to agree with some of the other informed users: it&#x27;s not doing its job!  You really have to read the fine print on Panasonic&#x27;s product description to learn that Panasonic changed the blade angle from 90 degrees to 60 degrees, presumably out of legal concerns because some idiots could sue Panasonic if they hurt themselves using the trimmer.  The prior Panasonic devices, featuring a 90 degree blade/cutting angle were perfect for a close shave.  This new, legally improved 60 degree arrangement does not cut/shave close enough and leaves 2 to 3 millimeter stubbles of hair in your nose and ears.  No good.  If I want to get rid of nose or ear hair, I want it gone, PERIOD, and not have stubbles remaining.  If you&#x27;re as perfectionist as I am, you will NOT want this \\&quot;improved\\&quot; Panasonic trimmer -- and, unfortunately, the way I understant it, this new blade/cutting angle applies to all Panasonic nose and ear hair trimmers.  Amazon is amazing:) in its return policy -- and that&#x27;s the way it should be.  I got the full refund and am experimenting with other nose and ear hair trimmers.  Actually, I just got a cheapo $9 Conair trimmer at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, and it seems to be doing its job quite nicely.  However, I will reserve my final verdict until another trim.</li>
    <li> Basically does a good job on the hairs that are straight but sometimes hard to get curled hair against the skin in the nose.  Tickles a whole lot and you have to get used to that but you do.  Easy to clean out.  If you need nose hair trimming this would work for you.</li>
    <li> does not cut hair as closely as their other model er 431</li>
    <li> Still running after 5 years !</li>
    <li> Bought this for one purpose...get rid of nose hairs.  The product seems to have a hard time doing this, and I hardly believe I have some sort of super nose hairs that has jinxed the product.  Build quality is very solid, and really really feels expensive, but no matter how long the trimmer is being used, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I am blessed with hairy nostrils. It&#x27;s a sign of wisdom, and virility. Okay, so it helps when I think about it that way. Anyhow, I&#x27;ve tried a number of trimmer models and brands, but find that the Panasonics have the sharpest and most comfortable blades. If the blades aren&#x27;t sharp, the hairs are pulled out before they&#x27;re cut, and that kinda hurts! The Panasonic trimmers I&#x27;ve tried are also very well made, are nice and small, and very easy to hold / move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my last trimmer became a little dull, I decided to replace it with a new Panasonic, and found the Panasonic ER430K on Amazon. It cost a little more than I had paid for this sort of item before, but based on my experiences with other Panasonic trimmers, I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My immediate impression when I opened the box was that this was another excellent, well-made trimmer. It&#x27;s a little bit bulkier than I had expected, but that&#x27;s not surprising since it has the vacuum feature, and it wasn&#x27;t hard to get used to. It comes with a nice case, and cap, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it, and I would recommend Panasonic ER430K to anyone considering a trimmer purchase.</li>
    <li> Kind of weird discussing nose hair trimmers but this is the best unit I have had.  Yes it tickles but no sneezing.  It is powerful and fast.  I like using the battery, no recharging concerns and easy to grab and take with when I travel (which I do often)</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after my old cheapie Wahl unit died.  I am not overly impressed.  The unit does at best an adequate job of trimming.  It really falls down on closeness of the trim and ease of getting at all the offending nose hairs.  My old Wahl unit excelled on all counts except occasionally pulling a hair.  Unfortunately the Wahl unit isn&#x27;t made anymore.  The vacuum feature of this unit is a nice idea but I didn&#x27;t perceive any particular benefit.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose and ear hair trimmer I have run across so far. I highly recommend this product! I have recently received this product but I have nothing but praise for this product!</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic. Although its enclosure is made of plastic it is a heavy duty plastic. It is very efficient and cuts nose hair without pulling (even just a little push hurts)....</li>
    <li> This is the second product of its type which I have purchased, and it is excellent. I recommend this tp anyone who wants an easy-to-manipulate and operate item. It is also compact enough to be thrown into a suitcase for travel.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, i had a Panasonic prior to this model and was quite satisfied so stayed with the brand. This one seems more durable, easy to use and very effective---absolutely no flaws except it is a bit more cumbersome than the previous model and did not come with all the handy attachments (which most women never use anyway)....it is ideal for nose hair removal---never use tweezers and sneezes again. WARNING: should not be used on your eyebrows....unless you are trying to remove them....and yes, i tried that...still waiting for them to grow back...</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this based on the reviews and the Panasonic name but I only used it four, maybe five times and it is completely non-functional. I thought that the battery had died so went out and bought some new ones but nothing happened when I turned it on. So I took the blade assembly off so there would be no load on the motor but still nothing. Unfortunately I cant open this unit without  breaking it so there&#x27;s no way to see if it is just a loose connection I could solder. Given these issues I can&#x27;t recommend this product and the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that I HAVE had it for about a year and a half - even though I can count the number of times I used it on ONE HAND! Maybe mine was the one bad unit they produced, I honestly don&#x27;t know, but I wont be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Being able to replace the blade would take this to a whole new level. I like the product, and have been using it for well over a year. But now I wish I could just buy a couple/few replacement blades and NOT have to purchase a whole new unit...given the only issue now is a dull blade. Or is there somewhere to buy replacement blades?</li>
    <li> I have owned better but this one isn&#x27;t all that bad. Does an adequate job of getting the hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well and in all those hard places to reach.  Lol!  But really, works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this model after purchasing a different brand / unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other unit promised not to pull / tug, and since I am a wimpy guy I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;That unit doesn&#x27;t pull or tug because it doesn&#x27;t clip anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a human bear, but, and I apologize for the graphic language, I do get a few nose hairs that will grow WAY too long. This seems to do the trick wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;Several of the comments say it doesn&#x27;t cut like the old model, which I had for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;I think this one works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature appears to work (nothing in the sink...), but it&#x27;s a weird sensation.</li>
    <li> Dudes --- for your nose and ears -- this thing rocks. I&#x27;ve gone through probably 10 different models and manufacturers -- this is by far the best. Panasonic knows what they are doing when it comes to these little gadgets :-)</li>
    <li> I emphatically join the other enthusiastic reviews for this product.  As a nosehair trimmer, this one leaves nothing behind.  I&#x27;ve never felt better-groomed.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it, the older you get the more hair comes out of your ears!  eeewww!</li>
    <li> This trimmer us awesome! It&#x27;s very powerful and works perfectly.This really is a quality item and it looks like someone took the time And made it right I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> The title says it all -- the product works very well, is easy to use -- and is cost significantly less than similar products I&#x27;ve seen in other stores / catalogues / online.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a couple of years ago and while cleaning it, the blade fell down my sink drain.  I could not find a replacement blade as Panasonic does not sell that part individually.  So, instead of shelling out another $20, I bought a cheaper version on Ebay for $7.  Bad move.  That thing yanked the hairs out of my nose.  I&#x27;m assuming the blades weren&#x27;t sharp enough and it also did not have the vacuum feature that this Panasonic unit has built-in.  I had to purchase this item again since the cheaper version was brutal.  I am pleased with this model and glad I don&#x27;t have to clean up hair clippings afterwards.  The only downside to this unit IMO is the small mirror on the cap.  It&#x27;s actually not a mirror but a piece of silver plastic which is dull.  Other than that this unit is built well, comes with a carrying case and the vacuum feature is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* - The mirror actually has a platic film protecting it.  It&#x27;s not a piece of silver plastic as I thought.  Simply peel off the film and the mirror is exposed.  Whoops.</li>
    <li> Works great, the vacuum feature works as advertised. Bought as a gift for someone that usually doesn&#x27;t like what you buy them. They bragged about it to their ear doctor. Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> In general, it seems to work well.   It has a good shearing/vacuum action. I have had it for about a month and it seems satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Okay.  Does nose hair but wish it had a little more something, blade or power not sure.  It takes numerous attempts to shave off some hairs like by eye browns and nose.  But for the price I&#x27;m not complaining.  Better then what I had which was nothing :)</li>
    <li> When received, the trimmer did not function. It had to be sent back.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great!  Safely cuts the hairs close without pulling.  You can actually feel the vacuum working.  Very easy to keep cleaning by rinsing with water.</li>
    <li> Received as described but please order  AA BATTERY SEPARATELY</li>
    <li> The volume of this thing is intense - as is the vibration it transmits to my nostril.  It took a few uses to get past the unbearable tickle it produced!  I like the vacuum - the filter is easy to clean and the lack of falling bits of hair is very nice.  I do not miss the lack of an LED - no issue with getting a good trim.  The noise and vibration seem to be byproducts of an effective rotation speed - rather have the speed and clean cuts than to have my nose hairs yanked out!</li>
    <li> This is the best one to date and I have had many. The small mirror attached to cap is useless.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is strong and precise.</li>
    <li> This thing vibrates way too much. It is impossible for me to put it in my nose without extreme irritation. Very annoying.</li>
    <li> This machine cuts hairs as they should be and leaves them as short as they can be. It is a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> Good clippers tickles a little not surely the vacuum makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I bought it in 2009, very light use.  First thing, the included case is of very poor quality, attracts a ton of dust, and is not quite fitted for the product&#x27;s shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it worked well I guess for a couple of years of very light use, but recently I have been noticing the speed of the motor is varying while in use  - it speeds up and then slows down - sounds like it is \\&quot;dying\\&quot; - I&#x27;ve replaced the battery, but have detected no change.  I feel it is rotating a bit slow mostly compared to when it was new.  I probably need to buy a replacement pretty soon.  Good thing the price has come down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On final note, the idea is quite good - it worked well when it was new, not perfect, but alas, the quality is a let down.</li>
    <li> i used it to trim my eyebrows and i like it</li>
    <li> very good trimmer, i hve had several trimmers but nothing like this, this is great, works fine and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product only worked for 6 months the it stopped even if I tried replacing the battery.  Waste of time.</li>
    <li> This was the best trimmer I ever stuck up my nose, or in my ear.&lt;br /&gt;It cut quick, clean, never pulled. It was faster than any I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;For about four uses. Then it stopped working entriely. Nothing would&lt;br /&gt;make the motor run. Recharged battery, new battery, zip.&lt;br /&gt;Had to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;Worse, noplace local has them.&lt;br /&gt;If they did, if there were a way for me to return them under warranty,&lt;br /&gt;even every week, I&#x27;d still want it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;See other reviews. this seems to be a common complaint.</li>
    <li> This works great. I should have gotten this a long time ago but was afraid that it would be a flimsy toy that wouldn&#x27;t work well or it would cause pain by pulling hair. Actually, it works precisely as advertised and does a good job.</li>
    <li> This is too appealing to my 4 year old who uses it as his ray-gun everyday. Other than that, it does a great job for its intended purpose! Can someone help me find it now, please?</li>
    <li> The item is easy to use, ruggedly-constructed and met my needs.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son.  He hasn&#x27;t complained about it so I guess it works ok.  Satisfied</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years. It spins reliably, is good on batteries, but simply does not get all the hair, I feel like I&#x27;m ironing, over and over, and it still leaves some behind.</li>
    <li> Small, simple and effective. It simply works.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I had a cheap one several years ago--and it didn&#x27;t remove hair at all.  After seeing the reviews for this one, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Other than the fact that it works great, there&#x27;s not much else to say.  I recommend this product, if you&#x27;re looking for a good nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> easy to clean, sharp cutters do the job and the shape is easy to use. Don&#x27;t understand the vacuum system.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son because his cheaper version had broken.  He said it works great an loves it!  Received it quickly too.</li>
    <li> This does the job very well, without grabbing and pulling. It&#x27;s also pretty quiet and easy on the ears when it&#x27;s time to get into that area.  Cleaning appears to also be easy, though care should be given to dry the parts before reassembling. The parts, especially the tiny little springs that hold the cutting blades against the cylinder, may rust.  Even if this trimmer lasts only a year, it&#x27;s still a good bargain and a good tool. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and my nose hairs easily fall victim to this trimmer which has the strength of a lawn mower.</li>
    <li> Works very well - great close shave - great price.</li>
    <li> This little GISMO is fantastic.  It works far better than some of the expensive ones I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Bought it thanks to the amazing reviews on this site. I used to have a cheapo nose hair trimmer before.     This has been an absolute revelation as to how different a good product can really be. There is no pinching, no pain - and the cut hair gets sucked out by the vacuum. Compact and completely worth it.</li>
    <li> is nice and safe when using</li>
    <li> Beats and nose / ear / what ever needs close trimming</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  Does a great job at shaving down nose hairs to nothing.  No mess left behind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with nose hair for a long time. I bought a cheap trimmer to deal with the issue. It didn&#x27;t work too well at all, even brand new. This model works great. The vacuum pulls the hairs into the blades. The blades on this model do what blades are supposed to, and the hair is gone.   If you need a nose hair trimmer, buy this one. It is a quality piece of work.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer a few weeks now and do not fear using it inside my nose at all.  I was weary of sticking a spinning blade in my nose but this trimmer does not yank the hairs.  Plus it does an adequate job of sucking the clippings out of my nose.  Its not perfect because I still blow my nose afterwards but only a couple of hairs remain.  The cutting feature is so safe that now I dig the trimmer in my nose every which way to cut the nose hair and I am confident that I&#x27;ll get good results with no pain.  Highly recommend if you are tired of yanking hairs out of your nose.</li>
    <li> my husband loves it. works great.</li>
    <li> I have owned two others clippers and round tipped scissors.  There is no comparison for this clipper to the others, it has more power, it is sharper, and my only complaint would be that it slightly tickles.  I&#x27;d buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I love the vacuum aspect along with the dual cutting edge.A very important item to have in the hygiene kit.Price is worth every penny.Thank you Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used of couple of clippers in the past &amp; I can definitely vouch that this is the best. And @ this price, it&#x27;s a steal</li>
    <li> It is functional and looks good. The vacuuming part can be a little bothersome on nostrils, so rated 3 -  \\&quot;it is ok\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The vacuum feature is probably a bit overstated.  Otherwise, it performs exactly as needed.  Also, for $17.49 you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  I bought one at Brookstone for almost double the price to only have it die after a few months.  When the battery outlasts the product that&#x27;s a problem.    Great Price / Great Product / Satisfied Customer!</li>
    <li> I never believed that this little trimmer could do so much, and be so comfortable and quick. For trimming eyebrows and loose hair around the face, it is definitely a winner. My husband has used many different trimmers in the past, with most grabbing the hair and yanking it out (!), or ignoring the hair totally. Now, his nose and ear hairs are cleanly and easily trimmed just the way he likes them. The best we&#x27;ve ever seen, and now we&#x27;ve stopped looking! Good for Amazon for providing such quality products!</li>
    <li> I replaced a universal shaver that had a nose trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;It was flat and not round so I would tear up my nose and inhale the hairs before sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is perfect for my nose and does not pull, cut or damage anything.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum that is built in sucks the loose hairs and shoots them out the side :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is slick and decided to throw my headphone in there</li>
    <li> The best nose ear trimmer money can buy. Do not look at any other kind. I tried many and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I read a bunch of reviews. I&#x27;m glad I bought this. The vacuum feature is very nice.</li>
    <li> This might be an early review. I recently get this one from Amazon.com. I like it.  Much better than the ones  I  have had before.</li>
    <li> great trimmer no issues</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job most of the time and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of other trimmers and this one works the best by far.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars since it doesn&#x27;t always remove the hairs and I don&#x27;t know if a trimmer exists that gets the hair every time.  The only disadvantage of this trimmer is that it weighs more than most trimmers, but with the extra heft you get a trimmer that works.  Don&#x27;t spend another minute finding a better trimmer.  Try this one and you&#x27;ll likely be pleased. I just bought my second one to put into my travel kit so I think that says something about my opinion about this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I think the vacuum helps to also stand the hair up to cut.  I only have to use it once a month because it gets everything the first time.  With others it would take longer and more often and have poor results.</li>
    <li> I have had several of these trimmers over the years and have to say this one is the best one I ever had. I purchased the Sharper image GR-T200 Deluxe a while back and was extremely disappointed with it. This Panasonic unit has great cutting power and gets most of the clippings with it&#x27;s vacuum. Great buy, great product. I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband, not expecting much different from other products that we used in the past and it turned out that this is the best one ever.  In addition to the vacuum feature, the blades are sharp and do not pull at delicate hairs.  I highly recommend this Panasonic trimmer.</li>
    <li> Perfect product!! Works very well for my grooming needs.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, so far. I&#x27;m normally hesitant to stick something up my nose that&#x27;s got sharply honed blades spinning at the speed of light, but this thing was quiet &amp; comfortable. Won&#x27;t delve too deeply into the reasons for it&#x27;s need, but the fact is that when you reach a certain age, hair begins sprouting from every visible orifice. Eyebrows bush-out like shrubbery in spring. Where was all this hair when I was young and wishing I could grow something on my face other than zits?  Well, it finally arrived and now I don&#x27;t want it. If you chance upon me in the street and catch a glimpse of a single stiff hair poking out from a nostril or ear canal, please lemme know so we can zap that sucker with the new trimmer.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. This is a point of personal grooming, and I cringe when I see a guy with nose hairs sticking out of his snout, or a unibrow. This thing works wonders for both of these spots. Men, use it. Women... some of you use it too, please.</li>
    <li> Very good, but not quite as good as earlier models.</li>
    <li> Hard to get all the hairs in the nose cut with this item. Does an OK job if you get the head in to the right place.</li>
    <li> Best one I have used.  Does what it is supposed to, which is all I ask.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for a decent nose hair trimmer.  I always end up throwing them in the trash because they just plain dont work.  This Panasonic is incredible.  The inside of my nostrils have less hair than a babies butt.  They haven&#x27;t been like this in years.  I cant believe what a great job this product did.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through quite a number of these. So far this Panasonic is working well.  The price was good.  Time will tell if this is the ONE.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought a nose hair trimmer and I am very impressed with the results of this product.    Unlike plucking nose hairs, this is painless. It does tickle a little bit at first, because of the vibrations.    The job is done quick, the cut is very close, there&#x27;s no mess. This device is very comfortable to hold. The narrow tip allows you to get everything easily. Works great for trimming excessive eyebrow growth also or if you have hairy ears (which I don&#x27;t have haha)    Great, modern style, and comes with the little bag to hold it in. Sturdy cap to prevent damage.    Battery not included. Takes 1 AA battery.    All in all: This little toy is a must have for any mans arsenal of hygiene tools. It&#x27;s totally worth the value. Having a clean nose not only looks good, but feels good, allowing you to breath more freely.</li>
    <li> Never had one of these, and with the typical male problem of increasing hair growing in difficult areas with advancing age, I decided to give it a try.  I thought this would be less easy to use than it ended up being.  This is fast, painless, safe, and shows every indication of remaining so.  Thanks for a great &amp;#34;niche&amp;#34; product!</li>
    <li> Finally a nose hair trimmer that doesn&#x27;t yank the hairs.  Well designed with curved blades that cut the hairs and doesn&#x27;t pull at them</li>
    <li> If there is anything my wife hates...it&#x27;s seeing unwanted hair anywhere on my face except my head.  Why is it we can&#x27;t grow hair where we need it when we get more mature?  This Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Ear, Nose &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer is one gift I should have bought long ago.  It&#x27;s light, well made and easy to use and you will get no nicks or burns from this baby.  Perfect gift for your loved one.  Less than a minute and you are hairless!!!  And about the same time to clean it for the next time.  The single AA battery supplies plenty of power for many trims and changes in seconds.  Nice cover to protect the cutter and a zipper pouch to store it in.  If I had it to do over again, I would buy this same unit without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked better than I expected.  No pain, no mess, just effortless trimming.  I would only list two minor drawbacks.  First, the trimmer has several pieces to remove when cleaning it out, and the pieces are delicate, so you have to be pretty careful.  Second, I wasn&#x27;t aware that this trimmer ran on a AA battery when I bought it, although I see it is listed in the product description, so be aware of that.  I have used the trimmer several times and haven&#x27;t had to replace the battery yet.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the trimmer. The cost is justified. The only things that maybe I will say is, the nose clipping could be better.</li>
    <li> Not that I have a lot but keeping the nose hair from tickling my nose is always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, have a vacuum and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Trims nasal hair easily &amp; quick. It quietly takes care of the trim work &amp; cleans up by taking the trim head off &amp; rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> Perfectly functioning</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this product. No pain while using it to remove the hair from the nose or ear. Also it removes the hair completely. The instruction manual is somewhat very short in decription and not much useful. Other than that its a very good product for its value as compared to my other various trimmers purchased before.</li>
    <li> find something else. It&#x27;s quite but if it doesn&#x27;t do what you&#x27;re paying for it to do then what&#x27;s the point?!&lt;br /&gt;Forget this item and move on.</li>
    <li> Finally, I got this in my hands, and it worked like it designed to.  No more scissors inside my nose with shaky hand, this makes life easier and simpler.</li>
    <li> For some reason my noses hairs had decided to grow long and luxurious.I know the hairs in your nose are there to prevent things from getting in and irriating your nose but my golly! They were longer than my nose and very un feminine. Luckily I read a review about these trimmers in Hammacher Schlemmer.I highly recommend these. Easy to use and best of all-Painless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for someone else and they liked it so much that I purchased one for myself. This item does what it is supposed to, very well.</li>
    <li> It is very good , it removes all unwanted hair on the nose and ears with ease . I can recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to wax poetic about a nose hair trimmer.  I will say that it does what advertising says it will do.  I like the vacuum feature.  This is a step up from the cheaper, smaller trimmers and worth the extra bucks.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a nice little device.  My husband likes it.  But he said there no vacuum at all.  I don&#x27;t think that is a defect.</li>
    <li> My previous nose hair trimmer did an ok job.  Or so I thought.  This one is leaps and bounds better.  No hair pulling at all!  And though I assumed the vacuum thing was a gimmick, it actually seemed to work well.  I originally felt it may be to large, however after using it i feel it is acceptable.  I may miss it having a light a bit.  But that&#x27;s so minor compared to the benefits.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;2. Picks up cut hair automatically&lt;br /&gt;3. Battery lasts 6+ months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair that you need. I have to spend 2x the time to cut all the nose hair. May be easier to just use small scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past experience: small nose scissors</li>
    <li> Still all time favorite. I tried several brands but this is my favorite nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well - no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bit on the pricey side but I like how it does not cut me and vacuums the hair.</li>
    <li> By far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten. you will like it a ton.  the bag is lame, but who&#x27;d use it anyway.</li>
    <li> I have tried many of these type trimmers over the years and to date, this is the best - without question - of any of them!  Of course, I have also used many electronic-other  components manufactured by Panasonic and have never had a bad experience.  The name Panasonic, in itself, is a reflection of the quality of their product line.</li>
    <li> Cuts a lot closer than my old Wahl trimmer, and the tip is rounded so it doesn&#x27;t scratch. The end of the tip cuts too, just don&#x27;t press too hard against soft tissue or it will bite.  It doesn&#x27;t leave cut hair behind.</li>
    <li> This is a great appliance to finish a haircut--makes it much more professional looking than just hair clippers.  Cleans up after itself.</li>
    <li> This item worked great on my husband.  He actually used it, didn&#x27;t complain about the pain and no unsightly hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone so long without this thing.  It takes out the unwanted hairs and even vacuums them away!  Very effective.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have massive amounts of nose hair. I just like to keep everything neat and trim in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my fourth nose hair trimmer. I tried a cheap one from target, Norelco nose and hair trimmer. It broke after about a week. Being as dumb as possible, I ran out and got another one. It broke a week later. So, I went on Amazon and got this one. Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer. Apparently I didn&#x27;t read it well enough to notice that it is not powered. It works ok, but it feels like it is pulling out your hairs more than cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer, however, is wonderful. It is a breeze to use and clean up. It doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of trimmed hairs in your nose because of that vacuum. I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little large, but it works well and appears well made. The second set of blades on the end is really useful. My only compliant is that it is extremely loud when trimming the hair in your ear canal.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is twice the size of my older one but it works much better. The vacuum is very weak but it definitely kept the trimmings out of my nose and ears. The cap looks like a pen cap and the \\&quot;pocket clip\\&quot; has a mirrored strip which can be used if no larger mirror is available. My older Panasonic would pull a bit but this new one cuts hairs without making your eyes water. It comes with a nice zippered travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need one alkaline AA battery to run the thing (not included). I tried a rechargeable battery and it worked fine with that also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice trimmer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several trimmers like this one and this is by far the best.  The vacuum makes a huge difference. I&#x27;ve always hated inhaling the clippings from regular nose trimmers. This one probably picks up 95% of them.  The blades work great. The dual blade is definitely noticeable as you don&#x27;t have to spend nearly as much time rotating and moving the cutter head around to clear the hair.   The mirror on the cap is a nice touch, but pretty small. It&#x27;s hard to really see anything in it.  The carrying case is pretty chintzy, but I don&#x27;t anticipate using it. Probably not even necessary with the included cap.  All in all this is a great value and well worth the extra couple of bucks for the vacuum model.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the many others I have tried.</li>
    <li> i used to get irritated and sneeze all day after shaving nose hairs but using this gets rid of that issue. great prices great shipping</li>
    <li> Due to the decent reviews, I gave the Panasonic ER430K trimmer a try. It does not come with the required AA battery, so I loaded it up and gave it a go. This trimmer will tickle initially... until it catches your skin and you end up with a bloody nose. I can&#x27;t tell if the blade made contact with the skin, or if the spinning motion of the ill-conceived blade design pulled the hair rather than cut it. Since I am not willing to risk further injury to find out, I&#x27;ll just strongly recommend you look elsewhere for a trimming device.</li>
    <li> Do not get this; it&#x27;s a COMPLETE waste of money as it DOES NOT TRIM nose/facial hair AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing to see the number of 4 &amp; 5 star ratings for this Panasonic ER430K. I would have it 0 (Zero) stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Nice clean cut, with no mess.  Used it just once so far but it performed just as it describes...worth the purchase price</li>
    <li> This works great and I use it every few days.  The battery life if good and it trims well without pinching.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> If ur looking for a product that does what is says it&#x27;s gonna do, then look no further, this here will give you alot of good and long use!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic item u won&#x27;t be sorry. 5 star</li>
    <li> I was researching on a good trimmer with some good features. I compared this trimmer to Wahl and other products available and got this product from amazon. This is bit bulky but it&#x27;s because of the vacuum inbuilt which works damn well. I said bulky as compared to others including other Panasonic models and this doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s very huge and cannot be easily carried. I haven&#x27;t found any cons as such so only listing the plus points which will describe the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good design. Sexier and classic looks&lt;br /&gt;- The dual blade technology works as in video. It doesn&#x27;t pull but is ultra smooth and can&#x27;t even feel while its working.&lt;br /&gt;- Super rotating blade speed. I am using new batteries and the speed of the motor is marvelous which makes the cutting even better.&lt;br /&gt;- No more pulling and pain. I usually read the negative reviews too to get acquainted with any issues a product may have. But am using it for several weeks now and am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a small carrying bag. Useful for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;- The vacuum blows the cuttings from another vent. FYI, it doesn&#x27;t collect the cuttings.&lt;br /&gt;- Washing the tip is really easy when the trimmer is off. Just rinse it under the water and good to go.&lt;br /&gt;- The cap comes with a mirror. Extra feature though I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;- It powers by 1 AA battery, not included in the original box. This model doesn&#x27;t have a light/torch inbuilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update April 26th 2012 4.35PM EST:&lt;br /&gt;No issues yet. Using the same battery, working great. Using almost once or twice a week. Always use a good battery for good performance. Just neglect the bad reviews, I have no idea why this product didn&#x27;t work for them!!!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with my old one. It never seemed to do the job right, plus before ditching it, it used to \\&quot;zap\\&quot; me...so I didn&#x27;t looked forward to using it. Read the reviews for this one and was swayed. I really like this product, excellent design, and works really well, don&#x27;t have to use it as often. Only downside, it&#x27;s a bit bulkier than my old one. Not a huge deal though, recently took it to Europe with me. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works great, it is cheaply made, but so is everything made in China, get over it.</li>
    <li> Both product and seller are excellent .</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd trimmer in the past 10 years that I bought my husband and it works both were this brand and model so I feel that it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the best nose hair trimmer for years.... and I did not care how much it cost.... I have spent .... over 100 dollars on worthless... trimmers.... and just wanted one that worked.... I have never done a review before.... but I was so pleased by this product... I wanted to put it out there for those who are searching for a quality product... cuts... great and fast... nose and ears... the vacuum part works surprisingly well but not completely... still the best I have used .... I even use it for the wild eye brow hair that sticks out straight.... that is almost impossible to get with scissors or a trimmer....Ohhhh and I thank my wife for finding it and getting it for me LOL</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the exact same one that I dropped on a hard tile floor. They work great just don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface.</li>
    <li> I must have a ticklish nose because this thing really tickles.  Other than that, it works well.</li>
    <li> this one is the best- it really cuts instead of pulling, 100% of the time!!! yea!</li>
    <li> The trimmer seems to cut hair in my nose and ears. It takes more effort than I think it should, but that may be due to my not knowing how to get the most out of the product. I don&#x27;t think there are classes on the subject and there may not be a need for them, but I could use some direction.</li>
    <li> Tried other trimmers from various other stores, but never got a quality product. Either didn&#x27;t work or performed poorly. But this one is all that was advertised. Works great, very good price and super fast shipping. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like hairy noses it drives me insane. make sure you clean it out just like the manual says</li>
    <li> What a great nose trimmer for such a cheap price . Nose trimmer also have a vacuum machine sucking all your nostril hair. Before I needed tissue and wipe it down after I shaved it. Not anymore</li>
    <li> I have owned a half-dozen clippers over the years.  These are better than any I have tried, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different nose trimmers and all of them were pretty much the same. My main driving factor before was price. When my last one broke I found this one and figured I would give it a shot. Wow. Very impressed. It&#x27;s built very well. The real standout though is its function. It clipped my nose hair with ease. I didn&#x27;t need to move it around a lot and really grind it on my nose. It quickly and efficiently trimmed the hair. I am very happy. I cannot believe I am writing a review on a nose hair clipper. First time for everything I guess!</li>
    <li> Had a few of these over the years and this one is no fuss and work. don&#x27;t need a light, just need it to work.... Works great....</li>
    <li> Excellent. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It snips nose, ear and other little unwanted hairs. .no pain, just snip.</li>
    <li> better than i expected</li>
    <li> It works very well. There is no itchying or pain. It does a very clean job. It&#x27;s a little hard to open it and put AA battery at first, but that&#x27;s only minor.</li>
    <li> item would not even come on. Broken defective items.</li>
    <li> Husband LOVES this set!</li>
    <li> Buy it. You will like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer.  Does its job well.</li>
    <li> worked well for two years, but suddenly stopped working</li>
    <li> The nose trimmer worked once.  We cleaned it, stored it and when we went to use it again, it no longer worked.  Changed the battery and still nothing.  Past the time for return.  A big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Exceptional quality compared to products found in typical retail stores. This product works really well!</li>
    <li> great product。bought it for my father</li>
    <li> Works good, nice little unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these electric trimmers over the course of my 35yr life- this one takes the cake.  Trims without pulling hair and doesnt seems to leave as much cut hair in your nostril as other units- the &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; action must actuaslly be of benefit.  Going to buy one for the other men in my family.</li>
    <li> An excellent product and on time delivery.</li>
    <li> Great item! I bought this for my husband, and he really likes this.</li>
    <li> serves its purpose. does exactly what it advertises. for the money its a great value. why spend more on a similar product</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this trimmer because it&#x27;s able to reach places inside of my nose that other trimmers are unable to. This was actually my main reason for buying the Panasonic ER430K. My biggest complaint is that if pressed upon the skin too hard or at the wrong angle, the blade inside of the nozzle quite easy butts up against and scrapes skin. As you can imagine, this isn&#x27;t desirable given how sensitive the inside of the nose can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that complaint the trimmer works well. Battery life is pretty good but not great. The trimmer is very easy to clean. Water can introduced into the trimmer while it&#x27;s running without causing any problems. The top section disassembles for easy cleaning. The included carrying case is a nice addition but I feel that it&#x27;s made of lint grabbing material so I haven&#x27;t used it. If it were more difficult to accidentally come into contact with the spinning blade I would have given the trimmer another star. If the battery life were a little better I would have rated it five stars. Next time I need a trimmer I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The product worked great initially but after about a year it was doing alright possible because the blades started becoming blunt. Now after a year and 4 months it has stopped working completely. For the $20 that I paid, I expected the product to last longer.</li>
    <li> No complaints with this product so far.  I am still on my first battery and it shaves my nose hair as I had hoped...</li>
    <li> This works well, quick painless and simple to use. I like it when I travel because I lave little time to clean up. Hotel mirrors are not the best so once I got used to it, easy quick clean up</li>
    <li> I find that this trimmer barely cuts nose or ear hair.  It is so ineffective as to be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2005 I bought the previous model (ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer) from Amazon -- and it was MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, recommend to all. Portable and can be taken everywhere as it is battery operated. No need to worry about adaptors or voltage of different countries. The vaccum does a good job on the suction, so no trimmed hair falls to the ground.</li>
    <li> Had it 2wks and so far so good, works great for eye brow trimming as well as nose trims...very surprised at quiet but efficient motor...its wonderful, does all it said it would, not often an item like this works so well..I highly reccommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. It does what it says it will do! I must admit at first I was a skeptic but I said to my girlfriend that I would give it a try. Prior to getting this I used a trimming sissor which didn&#x27;t get around the inner edges too well. This speed of this product has solved that problem. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! Very worthy purchase! If you&#x27;re looking for a new nose hair trimmer, look no further! You found it! Just love it!</li>
    <li> This is top of the line. Great cutting and really does vac out the hairs well. Get this one and spend a bit more you are worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer for the price.  The vacuum feature is especially cool because it sucks the little trimmings that would otherwise be flying around. It cuts decently close as well.</li>
    <li> December 12th 2011 ...   Disreagard the April 11th review ... This nose clipper is GREAT ... &#x27;NEW&#x27; BATTERYS Make all the difference ...   Motor is louder than it is strong, but it really WHIRRRRRS ... It does do the job attacking those nose hairs.  Those Little Tiny Hairs .. growing out of my noand if it didtn&#x27;t tickle so much, I&#x27;d have given it a 5 ...   It&#x27;s a good product.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  April 11th, 2011  Motor:  This has some motor.  God forbid you hit a &#x27;hair&#x27; ... it stops ... Must toggle on/off switch  ... then it starts again ... motor very weak.  Vacuum:  Yeah, this trimmer sucks all right ... (who knows ... who nose) ... I&#x27;ll have to place some white paper under my clipping attempts to see if any hairs are falling ... or being sucked up ... I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tested this aspect.  Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed, ... but they are all like this ...   I plan on returning this one, because I can get one just as effective for half the money ...</li>
    <li> This a very nice trimmer.  Much sturdier than some off brand versions I have had in the past.  It cuts quickly and efficiently.  It&#x27;s convenient to have the carrying pouch and is simple to clean.  The vacuum is a nice feature.  As for the mirror cap you might find it helpful if no other mirror is available.  You have to be sure to peel any plastic from the mirror cap in order to obtain a clear reflection.  You may think you have peeled it off but there is a second plastic film layer in addition to the packaging plastic film cover (if it still looks dull you may not have taken off the second plastic film layer).  I have only had it for a few months but I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this item. When I open the box, everything seemed fine.  Until I used it and it wasnt cutting any hair. I looked closer and saw that the inner blade never came with the item!!! what kind of customer service is this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a reasonable price.  Easy to use and clean.  Only negative is the noise from the motor should be reduced in order to avoid hearing loss.</li>
    <li> bad.  bought three.  all die pretty quickly.  worked ok in beginning.  not very strong/powerful.  not last.</li>
    <li> Its good and works great --- I like the compact size along with the &amp;#34;case&amp;#34;.  I think all of these will &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; a bit when using it on your nose.</li>
    <li> I bought this Trimmer in 11/2010.  After 1 year and 3 months of occasional use, it has stopped working.  When it was working, it did a great job.  Trims hair quickly and with no pulling at all.  Overall, I&#x27;m still satisfied with the product and plan to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> The current crop of personal nose hair trimmers don&#x27;t work as well as the old ones- it seems that the blades are now contained in a housing that increases safety, but in turn they are harder to use. I have tried several that don&#x27;t work at all, in fact, but I thought I would give Panasonic one last try when I read good reviews of the 430K. This one actually does the job quite well when it comes to trimming nose hairs and the vacuum feature makes for easy cleanup. In terms of trimming ear hairs, I find that it doesn&#x27;t work at all, due to the safety blade housing I mentioned earlier, but I have resigned myself to using tweezers for that task. While not as good as the older trimmers, this one is nice to use and easily the best of the bunch.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my sweet husband, who has complained about the creeping hairs coming in that he never used to have. Even with feeling a little weird getting this as a present (I still don&#x27;t understand how personal grooming products for men is popular during holidays!) I figured he maybe would appreciate it so I went ahead and got it. Now I want to explain that he was the type of person that would pull his nose hairs by hand and toss them away. Not that it didn&#x27;t hurt (WOW!!!) but he just didn&#x27;t want to bring attention to that area. So anyway, he&#x27;s been using this product for several months now and he even says he&#x27;s glad I got it for him. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to trim the hairs and it gets the job done without irritation. I&#x27;m so pleased that he likes it and he&#x27;s happy he doesn&#x27;t have to pull the hairs out by the roots - wherever they sprout from.  Oh, and I cut his hair as well and we&#x27;ve integrated this tool to beat back the wild ear hair too. Works great.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t recieved till now, and I&#x27;ve checked and check with my leasingroom stuff,  I think it&#x27;s been lost, would you please  resend it? thanks</li>
    <li> my husband love this. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is compact and works very well. I am impressed with how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have discarded three different nose hair trimmers as they only lasted about 12 months and were uncomfortable to use. This unit is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I will buy again. Very well packaged. For sure will recommend the vendor. I was a little awared of the quality of this product but i am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Returned this.  It was not quiet at all!</li>
    <li> Fast, quiet and efficient. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it works quite well. No pain at all, just trims and vacuums.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband and he says it works great...best one he&#x27;s had and would highly recommend it!  Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose Hair Trimmer is great.  My husband received it for Christmas and he loves it.  I do, too.  Now he has the most beautiful nose around.</li>
    <li> Good product. The vacuum feature works very well.</li>
    <li> I had read a review of this nose/ear hair trimmer in our local newspaper.  I was skeptical, because I&#x27;ve never found one that really does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I would find myself boring into the nasal passages, winding and grinding, and still hairy.  So when I popped the battery into this one, I had little hope.  Much to my amazement, the thing went right to work, effortlessly taming the interior of my nose, without my usual excavation.  AND, it vacuums away it&#x27;s trash!  I recommend this product with no reservation.</li>
    <li> Works great, far better than my older Sharper Image model.  Very happy so far.  Isn&#x27;t any louder than any other model I&#x27;ve seen.  What is that about, anyway?  :)</li>
    <li> great little&lt;br /&gt;machine</li>
    <li> What can I say? It just works very well. I am very satisfied and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It really does...</li>
    <li> i like this product. it works just how it says. trims and vacuums up all the extra hair trimmings what else could you ask for.</li>
    <li> wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the jump from a Wahl to this Panasonic, Big step up from my previous(also first) nose hair trimmer in terms of build, handling and overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 makes a big difference in the world of nose hair trimmers, this unit is quiet, painless,doesnt tickle &amp; cleans very easily. this unit also quickly and easily cleans/shaves the nostril area much better than other trimmers, closer,cleaner shave at that. the vacuum also makes for a unit that isnt messy, nothing to clean up afterwards around sink area. the device opens easily to tap/blow out and goes back together tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;having the vacuum on this device is a great feature, if you were all dressed,ready to go and suddenly noticed in the mirror that you wanted to clean up you would be able to use this without having to worry that hair would be all over a crisp white shirt.</li>
    <li> first one never worked... but they sent the replacement back in just 2 days and it works great...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé who was previously using baby nail scissors...yes, baby.nail.scissors. He said that all nose hair trimmers tend to pull out his nose hair roughly and cause lots of (man) pain. Anyhow, I went out on a limb and purchased this one and he LOVES it! Works great for nose and ear hair trimming....and now with no tears ;)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> looks good works as should which is about all that can be said 7n more words is too many yes</li>
    <li> The trimmer is just what I wanted. It&#x27;s a little thicker than the previous one I had but it only helps to hold it. It&#x27;s quiet and the internal fan helps to remove the hair in once it&#x27;s been cut. Great item. Nice little cary bag as well too.</li>
    <li> Excellent little trimmer that does just what you want it do. Painless trimming, cuts close and runs relatively quietly. Motor feels like it&#x27;s plenty powerful for the job at hand. Uses a single AA battery. I use rechargeable batteries so I don&#x27;t care how good battery life is. The vacuum thing seems to work well enough.    Comes with a deluxe, black-velvet carrying case. Yes, you read that correctly, black velvet (oooooooooo... aaaaaaaaahhh...). The carrying case is very soft and feels good when rubbed on your cheek.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for the price.  It trims wonderfully.  The vacuum feature takes a little to get used to.  Every time.  Mirror feature is useless, but who cares.</li>
    <li> this trimmer absolutely serves its purpose, and trims very well.  i also use it to micro-trim some facial fuzz around my eyebrows (areas too small of a surface area for a razor).      My concern/complaint: it does not vacuum very well, and when you clean it, make sure you oil the blades back up.  otherwise, the wetness could lead to it rusting.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  I have really stubborn nose hair and this does the job.  I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;AS SEEN ON TV&amp;#34; brands, Remington, Norelco and others, but the Panasonic is the best out of all of them.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last since most trimmers have a short life, but for the price, I would definitely repurchased this item if the product fails.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic er430k Vacuum nose.facial hair trimmer. I purchased this item on the advise of a friend. It is,by far, the best trimmer I have ever used,  regardless of price. The ordering process was easy and I received the item in a timely manner.Once again, great product.</li>
    <li> I have only had to use 4 or 5 different types of nose hair trimmers in my life. This is by far the best. I put a battery in it and I have used it around 30 times without the battery running low. I imagine that it will last a while. It does an amazing job. It gets super close and it&#x27;s light weight and easy to maneuver around with. I would completely recommend this to anyone. It is probably going to be my primary clean up tool for many years to come. A++</li>
    <li> After years of owning [[ASIN:B000063XHR Panasonic&#x27;s ER112BC Nose Hair Trimmer]], it was time for something new: the old trimmer wasn&#x27;t starting up reliably, requiring a firm smack to get it going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I had too many complaints about the old trimmer, but ended up with this ER430K model after reading the positive Amazon reviews and rationalizing it was worth spending a few bucks more. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with my old 112 model, the 430 cuts at a higher RPM, and doesn&#x27;t get bogged down -- not that my nose hair is particularly bushy, but I could always detect the subtle changes in RPM while the old 112 model went about its business. Also, the old 112 either pulled some of my hairs or else lightly nicked my skin, while this 430 can be held or pressed at any odd angle without such an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; function of this 430 model -- well, I haven&#x27;t completely figured it out, i.e. where the clippings disappear to and how much actual  suction is occuring -- but I&#x27;ll tell you that I don&#x27;t breathe in any sneeze-inducing clippings like I did with my old 112 model. So whatever this vacuum is/isn&#x27;t, its intended purpose works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap mostly stays on when this rattles around my drawer, and the case is a nice touch for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t understand why Panasonic markets so many nose hair trimmers in such a narrow price range, but ultimately it&#x27;s their business to do so. But as a consumer, I can&#x27;t see why somebody would settle on the the 112 model when for just a little more, they can own this ER430K, which is clearly superior.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer does a great job of getting those hairs out of way.  I&#x27;ve had a few others but this one seems to do a great job.  It comes with a nice zipped pouch which makes it nice for traveling.</li>
    <li> The product is well made and trims hair without pulling. Works well on ears, nose and face. Has a nice fit to you hand and is not awkward to use. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. It really makes taking care of the stray nose hairs a breeze. I don&#x27;t have to pull them out or go at my nose with a small pair of scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the highlights:&lt;br /&gt;  - small portable design that comes with a carrying case&lt;br /&gt;  - battery powered, no charger to carry around&lt;br /&gt;  - sharp blades that cut hairs without pulling at them&lt;br /&gt;  - vacuum action that sucks in the hair for easier cutting&lt;br /&gt;  - filter that collects the vacuumed and trimmed hairs&lt;br /&gt;  - solid construction that is easily maintained&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this device. My nose hairs will be kept tame now.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer has a cool Design ,but doesn&#x27;t trim well...my old Panasonic Trimmer does a better job....so ,it is sitting  in the bottom of  my drawer. Unfortunatly didn&#x27;t save packaging to return it!</li>
    <li> I have used several similar products, including the big one from Sharper Image.  This Panasonic unit is the first I have used that does NOT irritate the inside of my nose, yet trims really close.  I wholeheartedly recommend it over all others.</li>
    <li> Bought for my fiance. . Lol it does the job.  And didn&#x27;t hurt him.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but the vacuum makes the thing buzz like crazy.  It&#x27;s like putting a vibrator up your nose.  Makes my eyes water every time.  It works though, I&#x27;ll deal.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as I had hoped</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, exactly as described.  I really like the product, it does a great job and is extremely easy to clean!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We have purchased one of these in the past.  This one works even better. It was definite a good buy.  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Can be used for nose, eyelid hair. Works well and easy to clean.  The hand grip feel comfortable and kind of solid.</li>
    <li> Piece of garbage. Very loud motor.  Sent it back the same day I oot it back.  Just a real piece of China junk.</li>
    <li> Most times it fails to operate when turned on; have to shake it and play with the battery to get it to engage - with limited success. A piece of junk, and Panasonic should be ashamed...</li>
    <li> Perfect product for nose, ear and facial hair. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for my brother. He uses it weekly, and hasn&#x27;t complained about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp so provides a smooth and painless nose trim. It has been 6 months since and it&#x27;s still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it breaks before a year or so, I&#x27;ll update. Otherwise, assume it&#x27;s working as designed.</li>
    <li> Just put a decent battery and let yourself trim those lengthy hairs in your nose. Pretty comfortable actually, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. He absolutely loved it. Great price for a product that seems like it was a good find. Hopefully, the future of the product is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Easy and comfortable to use.  No hair pulling!</li>
    <li> Wow... is how I explain this trimmer... why I never purchased one earlier and use expensive scissors all these years... who know. It was well worth every penny! Does it cut close as scissors... NO but it is close enough... now my ears and nose are clean and cut with ease. Cleanup under water makes this a wonderful solution for any man!</li>
    <li> I want to echo all the other positive reviews, these are really great trimmers. Ive used many over the years and these are my favorite for sure</li>
    <li> This is the second trimmer I have used till date, the first one being a Remington. I find this far better than Remington in terms of perfection/nicks/buzzing etc but the one great feature I find with this trimmer is the vacuum which scoops clean, the unwanted hair. I took away one star because of the fact the I have go over the area again and again to ensure that the hair is removed. It might be a acclimation thing, so I am going to revisit my post later on to if I find any difference. A great buy !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few of these and this one really works. Trims nose, ears and other stray hairs.  Hopefully, the blades will stay sharp. Works great!</li>
    <li> Bought primarily for nose hair trimming but tried on eye brows and ears also and performed extremely well. This trimmer will trim as close to your skin as you like. It is shape well for easy manuevering and is powerful enough to cut all of my facial hair no matter how coarse it may be. The zippered carry case is nice for travelng.</li>
    <li> Not experiencing any problems at all. Works as advertised. With that said, I have nothing to compare it to. It is the first and only one that I&#x27;ve purchased ever.</li>
    <li> Excellent present. For fathers day my husband loved it.  Not expensive and comfortable comes with an special bag and easy to storage</li>
    <li> It generally works, but am not sure what the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; is designed to do.  There is plenty of \\&quot;spillage\\&quot;, but it does trim well.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Very easy to use, comfortable. I had a similar item previously and this surpasses the other item significantly. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This inexpensive trimmer is easy to use and clean.  It trims as well as it claims to do.  It&#x27;s a good value for the money and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> COMPACT , EASY TO USE ,EASY TO CLEAN ,SMOOTH CUTTING, NO PINCHING NICE CARRING CASE . GOOD FOR EARS AND NOSE . WORKS GOOD ON TRIMING MY &#x27;STASH !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Nature dictates hair to grow along the rims and inside of my ears and inside my nose, unless Nature wanted to see the creation of a tool such as the Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer. It is a fascinatingly elegant tool that works as advertised, and even comes with a mirror on the cap, which protects its rotary blade that&#x27;s motored by a single AA battery. It cuts pesky hair follicles and vacuums them into a chamber easy to clean. There is also a stylish bag with a zipper that makes for a complete package.</li>
    <li> No problems thus far. I have a pretty stringent rating system.&lt;br /&gt; I have only had a month or so to test, but it&#x27;s fine so far</li>
    <li> My husband is pretty happy with this devise. It does the job! We definitely recommend this product! Fast shipping, happy customer!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. It does exactly what it says and it does it extremely well. I can&#x27;t find a flaw that would discourage me from recommending this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I was looking for such a device, and investigated many options, before making decision, so I am happy that I purchased this one. It works perfectly, and removes nose hair effectively and with no pain :-) it&#x27;s easy to maintain, the upper part, compartment for the blade, is easily detachable and can be washed easily.   I would really recommend purchasing this equipment!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could say that this worked at all.  But nope; just grabs a few hairs, just enough to get them stuck and then yanked out quite painfully!  Back to the drawing board with this technology!</li>
    <li> Very nice design on the trimmer. You do have to remove two covers on the mirror. Not sure how&#x27;d you use the mirror though. Seems to trim nose hairs well. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. Works great, doesn&#x27;t bind up and actually does vacuum up the stray hairs so I am not sneezing clippings a hour after I use it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Runs batteries down pretty quick.  Feels light and cheap but it does work.</li>
    <li> Simple product that does what it is supposed to do.  Vacuum works really good which surprised me. Disassembly to clean is quick and easy.  Great design and highly recommend.  Purchased after reading many other amazon reviews and glad made informed decision.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. He hasn&#x27;t given me a report on how well he liked it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does exactly what it says it will do...turn your shaggy self into a debonair bon vivant in 5 minutes or less.  It puts the dap in the dapper, turns the hip into hipster, and cures the ugh in ugly.  You could remain in the stone age if you want, but could you still grunt, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll have an Iced, Half Caff, Ristretto, Venti, 4-Pump, Sugar Free, Cinnamon, Dolce Soy Skinny Latte&amp;#34;?  Huh, could you???  I don&#x27;t think so.....</li>
    <li> For the price I was surprised it was so well built, and cuts really well...going on a couple months of use now.  Been using rechargeable batteries still haven&#x27;t had to change them yet.</li>
    <li> works exactly as described. great service. thanks!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, and the receiver absolutely loves it. It works very well, trims things up nicely, and it doesn&#x27;t drop clippings all over the place, which is awesome. Great for ears, nose, etc.</li>
    <li> Have tried a number of different nose type shavers and they have all been very useless at actually cutting hair. This one works just great, use it for nose hairs (pesky things!) and trimming around my beard. Great product.</li>
    <li> Okay this is one gadget that actually works well.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Great deal....thank you!</li>
    <li> Great. Works better than the rest.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace another that had just died and could not be more pleased. It performs exactly as advertised. UPDATE:  This product was great when first purchased, but started failing (would sometimes work) after a year and died completely before a year and a half.  Have now purchased a different product to replace this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased two trimmers, one for my son and one for my husband.  Before my husband used his trimmer I used it first (since it is washable I thought this would be okay).  While using it on the left side it pulled the hair in my nose causing some discomfort.  I pulled it out and tried again rotating my wrist as the instructions say and the job went more smoothly...until I got to the other side of my nose and then it pulled again, this time cutting the inside of my nose!!!  I have used trimmers before so I am pretty sure I was working it correctly so when it cut my nose I was not happy.  However, my son and husband both like theirs.  They like the grip style and they especially like how easily they are to clean up.  I am sticking with our old trimmer and will look for its replacement...use at your own risk ;)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied so far with this trimmer!</li>
    <li> Works like a normal trimmer, however the vacuum function doesn&#x27;t seem to work.Not sure if it&#x27;s the one i picked up or most simply have a weak vacuum. Easy to maintain and clean.</li>
    <li> Do great job, working already second year...</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to cleanly and pain free. Not loud or high pitched, comfortable noise level.  Not so sure about the vacuum part, but overall does its job.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have a single complaint about this trimmer. I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 months, and I&#x27;m still on the original AA battery. Yes, the blades cut at a 60-degree angle instead of 90 degrees, but I don&#x27;t see this as even meriting a comment; possibly it takes me 2-3 seconds longer to do the job, but who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum system works, the wet-dry function works, the mirror works, and the clipping is close, pain-free (no hair pulling!) and sneeze-free. It&#x27;s all I could ask for.  Prior to this, I used a fancy Norelco that didn&#x27;t cut as closely or comfortably as this one, and, IIRC, cost about 50 bucks.  After about 5 years, it just up and died.  This is a better product at less than half the cost.</li>
    <li> I like the compact design of the trimmer.  I was worried about the noise but it is very quiet.  It is easy to use, too!</li>
    <li> Used it on both ears and nose and it works as advertised!  Keep in mind you will need a AA battery to use it, which is not included.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever bought!! It does a great job!  My husband loves it!! When this one dies I&#x27;ll definitely buy the same thing to replace it.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve used in my life. Love the speed and battery life. Works well and doesn&#x27;t nip your ears or nose.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the older model (could cut better) but not bad</li>
    <li> I think the older (Top rated model ER401) did a better job. Here is why: Panasonic not only changed the body (for the better) but the also changed the blade cutting angle. Luckily, I save the old cutting head from the ER401. They seem to be interchangeable, except the new tip is slighly longer, which means that you have to change the entire head. Just changing the new blade with the old works, but is slightly nosier. Why do they have to change something that already works very well?</li>
    <li> great product, just as the advertisement says.  nice and clean, very quiet, but it could cut a little closer.  I like it</li>
    <li> I like this, I&#x27;d give to others for gifts</li>
    <li> Item works well and even comes with a nice pouch for storing it. Easy to clean as well. Highly recommended!    On a side note, Amazon delivered it in one day even though I had it set for 2 day shipping!</li>
    <li> This thing works very good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for hubby...he love&#x27;s it. Says it does tickle a little but nothing to terrible. Clean up is a breeze thanks to the vacuum feature. No more little hairs to clean up. Easy to use and compact for travel. Uses one battery and haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet...since January. Great buy! Happy Trimming.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> Finally got tired of wife always making comments on my straggling nose hair&#x27;s lol. Purchased this and I&#x27;m completely satisfied and no more worries when she grabs the tweezers!</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands.  After 14 yrs. the old one still worked and was wearing out.  The new one is terrific and the VALUE of this unit is great.  Very reasonable.  I would not buy anything else  but a Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product because it can vacuum nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;But after a month, it stopped working!&lt;br /&gt;Replaced battery didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;It just died.&lt;br /&gt;I could find many review regarding this issue meaning it is an intrinsic problem of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does a great job and I have no complaints with its use. The price made it an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this nose trimmer for my fiance.  He used it a few times and then it stopped working.  Since we were outside the 30 day window we were unable to return it.  What a rip off.</li>
    <li> Of the several trimmers I&#x27;ve owned over the years, this Panasonic is the best ever! The trimmer is comfortable to use, and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag.</li>
    <li> This gets the job done without risk to injury. Also, the price is very affordable -- better  and cheaper than products at drug stores.</li>
    <li> The boss loves this to trim my rapidly growing ear hairs and I use it for the nose.  We have used this for 2 years and have replaced the battery, maybe 3 times.  Well-worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Cleans nose and ears just fine. The vacuum is not really noticeable but I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because I was tired of hearing him complain about itchy nose hair. He loves it and I love the lack of complaining.</li>
    <li> Bought it based on great reviews, but it is just okey.</li>
    <li> If you need one of these like I do, Just get one.  Makes nose and ear hair trimming a breeze.  You will not be disappointed.  It is very easy to clean and it does not eat batteries.</li>
    <li> Pulls a little, but better than cheaper versions.</li>
    <li> does what I thought it would</li>
    <li> Well Design and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works just as described.</li>
    <li> I just turned 30 with older age comes the nose hairs. I read up on this and decided to purchase it. It is fantastic! Albeit it was strange trimming the nose hairs, it tickles and hard not to sneeze from it, but none of the hairs were pulled which is what I was worried about.</li>
    <li> The other one I owned for about 5 years, still works by the way. This one is better powerred and doesn&#x27;t have that stupid light on the end that does nothing but shine in your eye if you hold it wrong. This is the best trimmer for the $.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple batteries in this unit and it just does not have much juice.  Maybe it is trying to do too many things.  The vacuum concept is cool, but if that part is taking too much power, then the cutter stops working.  I have tried cleaning it to see if something is jamming it, but it isn&#x27;t.  Total waste of money.  If it had more power, this would be a really great unit.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> This product is really neat!  Collect trimmed hair where you can depose of it nicely.  No mess at all!  Really cool product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Does a good job any hair in the ears which is what I bought it for.  Good on nose hair also</li>
    <li> Excellent and Precise trimmer, I even use it for trimming sideburns. It&#x27;s, Simply, the best I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this on at the end of 2012. Just avoid warranty, it stop working..... very depression.... be watched out!</li>
    <li> Works much better than cheaper versions i have tried.  Motor seems very strong and blade cuts from the tip as well as the side which makes is much easier cut nose and ear hair.</li>
    <li> This is my first nose/ear trimmer and is just amazing.  Trim fast with no pain, in just 1-2 minutes. I&#x27;m using it with a rechargeable 2.400 mh battery, and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well.    It doesn&#x27;t snag and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 6 months. Not water resistant.</li>
    <li> I was initially terrified of stuffing this into my nostril, for fear of getting cut by the blades&lt;br /&gt;However after using it I realised it is pretty good, it will only cut the stray hairs that are long enough to enter the head of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried pushing the head of the unit against the skin of the nose so I am not sure if that will lead to a cut&lt;br /&gt;However I have been using this about once every 2 weeks for the past 2 months now and so far it does an excellent job of trimming the hairs without any cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE OCT 2012*&lt;br /&gt;While cleaning the blades with an alcohol soaked cotton bud the blades accidentally fell to the floor. Following which, the unit now makes a hissing sound when turned on. And I am not willing to use it now for fear of getting cut. Lesson learnt never to drop the fragile blades on the floor.</li>
    <li> At long last when I have my Grand-Kids set on my lap for a story.....won&#x27;t have to answer THAT question....Gwampa, why do you got hair gwoing out your nose???</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product. The trimmer is very efficient, the batteries are lasting a long time and overall it works really well.</li>
    <li> This purchase was for my hubby, he seems to like it so far so good.  He&#x27;s not making weird nose hair sniffing noses so I&#x27;m excited that he&#x27;s pleased.</li>
    <li> Great little touch up tool. Easy to use. Works good for the job. Small and easy to travel with. No problems.</li>
    <li> Worked just as indicated, I would recommend again.  They only thing is if you don&#x27;t have long nose hair like my BF then it won&#x27;t work well for you.</li>
    <li> Works perfect ...! buy it, don&#x27;t think twice.</li>
    <li> Very good product, and very clean with its mini vacuum. Takes some getting used to as it does tickle.</li>
    <li> ...it works well - I&#x27;m impressed. The motor is very efficient</li>
    <li> ear, nose trimmer works perfectly, had used one of lower quality for years and cursed it daily! This one works, and works! Don&#x27;t use it for facial hair so can&#x27;t comment on that issue. But, for the specific reason I bought it, it works excellent!</li>
    <li> Great nose-ear hair trimmers.It cuts the hair and vacuums it.I have not been hurt from this trimmer.I just shove it up my nose and move it around and all the hairs are cut.Buy it  for somebody that has hairs sticking out of there nose,you know who im talking about,so unattractive.</li>
    <li> I was just in the bathroom trimming and realized I bought this years ago.  All of the items I bought at the time are dead or don&#x27;t work properly.  This item has worked and worked.  I cannot remember changing batteries.  Every time I use it, I wonder when the darned thing is finally going to run down and need batteries.  I empty it over and over, but I am amazed that it still works as if I just put the batteries into it.  Rechargeable items have dead batteries.  All of my electric shaving items are dead very soon.  I am a pilot and travel.  The items I carry on the road have died over and over, but this thing just never stops working.  It seems to never need batteries.  I think it has batteries ... it isn&#x27;t plugged into the wall (and no apparent nuclear glow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so amazed by this unit, that I wrote down the number and decided to come here and write a review ... it is that shocking.  The EverReady Bunny has nothing on the Panasonic 430 with the vacuum.  Unless I got some rare machine that was constructed when all the planets are aligned, you will not be sorry you bought this.  It isn&#x27;t rocket technology, but getting one of these that works and doesn&#x27;t break down right away, seems to be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product.  It impressed me enough to come to the computer and write this.  It is easy to get on and write bad reports while I have steam coming out of my ears, but never has something been soooooo good that I just had to write a review.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The vacuum feature is useful and easy to clean, the tool works well for its purpose and is very easy to use. The &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; on the cap is useful when travelling.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and very effective.  What more can I say? If you are looking for this kind of product, this one is definitely the best.</li>
    <li> It tickles and who is it that doesn&#x27;t like a good tickle now and again? Besides. The device rids the shallow crevices of that unsightly hair that some of us sprout after a certain age? It works and seems to be made of substancial materials.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the unit only once and it is the best one that I&#x27;ve ever used .and I like it very much</li>
    <li> Sometimes pulls the hairs just a bit too hard. Not terrible though.</li>
    <li> Broke after two uses.  It just stopped cutting well, plain and simple.  Then on use three I dropped it (my bad) and it exploded like an old cell phone...parts everywhere.  Unfortunately it didnt go back together like my old Nokia.  Yes that was my fault...irritating, but my fault.  The 2 stars though are completely related to the cutting performance, but for the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much more.</li>
    <li> The most important feature of a nose hair trimmer is that it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out of your nose, right? This one does occasionally. You&#x27;ve been warned. :)</li>
    <li> Works really well. Sharp blade and great vacuum. I would definitely recommend. If you like a quality product then by this!</li>
    <li> Works great. Been on the same battery since I purchased it, but I only really use it once a week at most for about 5 minuts. The vacuum tickles my nose a lot so I&#x27;m not a huge fan (no pun intended), but otherwise it does the job nicely.</li>
    <li> This little thing is very useful and works very well. I&#x27;ve been using it for over three years now and I haven&#x27;t changed its batteries a single time. Its very easy to clean and does the job in seconds. I am very happy with the product. I am not sure, if Panasonic has introduced any upgraded version of this, but the value you get from this product is way beyond the price you pay for it. It&#x27;s worth it; It saves my time and makes me look and feel better.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby.  He is happy with it cause it is rotary but still says it tickles.  He would like one without the tickle.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000FYVOJC Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Ear Hair Trimmer, Gray]]  This is a wonderful product. It works excellent. I have told everyone about this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well and feels robust. Early days but I like it.</li>
    <li> This product is no better than the $10.00 models you can get at your local store.  Very disappointed.  The real problem is that no manufacturer has yet to make a personal trimmer that actually does a good job. I should have known better than to think this product was the one.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband, asked him if he had any comments... He said &amp;#34;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, it tickles, but it works!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nice improvement over the 15 year old model I had.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fit as a expected. I like and I am , very happy. Tanks Amazon</li>
    <li> This is replacement of one I&#x27;ve lost.... works just fine thanks</li>
    <li> Does an outstanding job!</li>
    <li> a handy little trimmer for ear and nose hair. not super great on eyebrows though. it is sturdy and has a fast motor and gets the job done. However, I really miss my old Sharper Image ear and nose hair trimmer that had multiple attachments. This only has one attachment, and it is the one pictured.</li>
    <li> Works great, no pain. Kinda loud, but nothing excessive.</li>
    <li> Ah -- Panasonic has solved a problem of long standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use a nose hair trimmer, the loose cuttings make me sneeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vacuum Nose-Ear Hair Trimmer works as advertised, sucking up the loose hair as it cuts, preventing the otherwise inevitable sneezing and nose blowing.  And I guess it prevents cut hairs from falling into your inner ear too, although I don&#x27;t think this has ever posed a problem for me (\\&quot;what&#x27;s that you said?\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers should note that if the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; on the cap appears dull and unreflective, you need to peel off yet another layer of plastic coating.  There is a shiny, reflective glass mirror underneath, I assure you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the little cloth travel case included; my previous Panasonic nose trimmers lacked this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I miss the light on this model?  No, because the light never pointed at the trimming point any way -- it was more show than go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this nose trimmer definitely sucks -- and I mean that in the very best way!  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Used unit before and its the best I have ever used// The way it is packaged is awesome and will be easy to take along on trips//</li>
    <li> Quiet, works great!!!</li>
    <li> Helped me tackle the long standing and ever returning issues related to nose hairs. It tickles a lot and hurts very little. We are talking about inside your nose, remember. Has worked great on rechargeable batteries, even without charging often.</li>
    <li> Durable, fast, wet/dry, twinblades, powerful motor is fast for only using the 1 AA battery that it uses. Seriously outperforms my old trimmer X5. Nicely done panasonic....</li>
    <li> I have read the other reviews and, cant say I agree with a good many of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the older panasonic and the sharper image trimmers and by far, this thing is way better than any of them !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You dont have a lot of choices in this type of product, thankfully, you have a excellent choice with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum function really does work great, it trims great, it&#x27;s just a great product all around.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed by this product, i will not lie when it worked it was working very well, but after second use it started to stop while trimming and after fourth use it broked.</li>
    <li> got it and doesn&#x27;t work very well.  The movement of the spin is always stuck as the motor seems too weak.</li>
    <li> Bought this for hubby as his old one died on him. He is not happy when he can&#x27;t breathe through his nose due to nose hair. He likes this product and enjoys the light that lights &amp;#34;the way&amp;#34;, if you know what I mean. He cleans up nice with this product without any discomfort and looks pretty spiffy too. No more dangling hairs.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> works fine-just have no other to compair to.</li>
    <li> Very nice and comfortable I love it thanks to manufacturer .</li>
    <li> I like its function. It does what it is supposed to do. However, I have a small problem with the lid, the lid seems not intuitively designed.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that all is good.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I bought this to replace an aging Sharper Image unit that uses a larger  (&amp;#34;C&amp;#34;) size battery and has a light. The SI unit also has longer slots going down the sides - which I think is better as it seemed to trim closer that this Panasonic. The speed of this Panasonic unit makes for a painless clip and generally makes up for the lack of power the SI unit had. The SI had a light and this Panasonic has a &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; - which does work quite well. In short, they both work and had have different approaches to the same challenge - time will tell about battery life. The larger battery lasted about 2 years of use - I&#x27;m guessing the &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34;&#x27;s won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Doing what it is supposed to do.  Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve always used nose trimmers that pulled my nose hair which is a pain. Saw the great reviews on this product and I&#x27;m glad I ended up buying it! LOVE IT! The vacuum does a pretty good job of collecting the hair. Cleaning was a breeze, you simply take off the top piece and rinse, dry it and reattach.</li>
    <li> I drop it by mistake and now is not working.  You need to be  careful with it . Not rugged</li>
    <li> Owned a cheaper trimmer previously. (I think it was a freebie in some packaging) This trimmer works great.  The blade is protected in such a way that there is no concern of accidentally nicking yourself with it.  An added bonus is that you can hear when it slices a hair.  This is great when trying to reach something in your ear that you cannot necessarily see the whine of the the blades changes and let&#x27;s you know that you have gotten something, and more importantly a lack of the sound lets you know that there isn&#x27;t anything else for the trimmer to get.</li>
    <li> Good product...meets expectations for a really good price. However cleaning it seems complicated.</li>
    <li> I have had no less than 4 of similar products, but never one which is so ideal for removing ear and nose hair...very well designed product indeed...would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works excellently in getting rid of unwanted facial hair.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the second ER430K I&#x27;ve purchased. The first one lasted 3 or 4 years. It still ran, but my tough hair wore the blades to the point where it was starting to pull hairs instead of cutting them. I have no problem with that at all. Every other trimmer I&#x27;ve used prior to the Panasonic would last only a couple of months and start pulling hairs. This is a good product. Easy to use and easy on batteries. I&#x27;m going to try Wahl clipper oil with this one and see if it helps make the clipper blades last longer.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, easy clean up. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything more. Worth the price we paid for it.</li>
    <li> Works great for the nose and ear, cuts the hair very well and does not leave a mess. The vacuum draws all the hair in and then you can very easily rinse the trimmer off under water when your finished. I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I had another brand, I think it was Wahl, died after little use. This has been working perfectly for quite a while now. Battery life very good. Very smart design makes proper cleaning easy. Comfortable in use for both nose and ear. Reach and access to hair in difficult places very good. Has that Panasonic quality and feel to it that&#x27;s reassuring, like my very expensive Panasonic shaver which is fantastic. Price here is extremely fair for the quality you get.</li>
    <li> Trims the hair in my nose greatly.</li>
    <li> What is there not to like? Excellent trimmer with vacuum. I still blow my nose after trimming just to get a few hairs out but not as many as one without a vacuum. Should have bought one of these long ago.</li>
    <li> great little nose trimmer! works very well.</li>
    <li> It works great but already I am getting concern the motor might be failing.  It slows down quite a bit just when running and not cutting.  New batteries do not help.  We&#x27;ll see.  but the job it does on hairs is great.</li>
    <li> Perfect grooming product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product regularly for nasal hair removal since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;You should know that it does not SHAVE the hair but trims it very close and nice. The head is smooth and does not irritate the nose.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is inside a housing which makes it very safe to easily maneuver and reach all the corner without being afraid to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of blade is very good and after many years it still cuts same as the first day.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that a screen collects the hair and prevents themfrom entering into other parts makes the cleaning of the item super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> A gift. The person loved it.</li>
    <li> hubby loves this...the vacuum eliminates &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; in the nose!</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased this for me for my birthday.  I guess she though jamming a pair of scissors in my ear was a bad idea.  This Panasonic hair trimmer is great.  I keep it in the car and use it every couple of weeks to trim unwanted ear hair.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I chose this product after reviewing others comments... and yes, it is all that they said it would.  Definitely the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used in that it can remove hair quickly without a mess.</li>
    <li> A great tool to get rid of that disgusting nose hair . Very easy and comfortable on the sensitive tissue  in your nose</li>
    <li> Sorry I don&#x27;t know how it worked to rate this really.. I gave it as a birthday gift and they never have said how&lt;br /&gt;it worked.</li>
    <li> this works great we are all using it at home, we tried so many more and none of them worked as good and clean as this one.</li>
    <li> I am glad I got this model instead of the more popular cheaper model from Panasonic.  The vacuum function really work and I love the fact it not loud.  There is a buzzing sound when turn on but it not like a blender loud noise.  Overall I highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This works as expected but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be much better or worse than any other that I have used.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best ear and nose hair trimmers I have used. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it for my nose and ears</li>
    <li> Its perfect and easy to use, works well, perfect to carry anywhere so practice and perfect, y recommended it always</li>
    <li> I found the ear Vacuum to work extremely well. Very sharp and very precise.  I highly recommend the use of this great product</li>
    <li> A bit complicated to first learn how to use, but once you get over the learning curve, it does the job.</li>
    <li> No man wants to admit that he is getting old enough to need a device such as this, but let&#x27;s face it,&amp;#34; unwanted hair protruding from one&#x27;s nose and ears is just plain gross!  This is a fabulous device for great grooming and I am sure my wife appreciates it too !</li>
    <li> Barely grabs any hair through tiny openings. What hair it did grab and cut was still very visible, like a 5:00 shadow length. Sent it back.</li>
    <li> Works well surprisingly.  I have tried many of these and most break quickly or don&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> There are few things that are completely as advertised, this was. Works easily and as advertised!  Travel bag is handy.</li>
    <li> I had never had one of these gadgets before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  I have previously always used scissors to accomplish the tasks this little machine was created for.  It works very well, never seems to pull or tug.  It is clean and quick and seems well made.  I will say that for me it is a very unpleasant sensation to insert the nozzle inside my nostril, and it &#x27;tickles&#x27; and makes my nose itchy (it&#x27;s itchy now just thinking about it!) and I don&#x27;t like using it much, but it works very well.  For the ears it works perfectly.  Getting old is crap, and sprouting hair in some new places, while losing it on others, well, it&#x27;s just not fair lol.</li>
    <li> This has certainly been the best of this type of trimmer I have found.  The vacuumn prevents me from sneezing terribly from the small hair cut.  It does reasonably well when it is at a reasonable angle of approach.  Certainly better than anything I have experienced in years.</li>
    <li> this trimmer makes me sneeze every time i use it in my nose. it&#x27;s pretty powerful, it just has the perfect vibration to it that i can&#x27;t prevent myself from sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it really works great, and so far after more than a year of use, it&#x27;s been holding up really well. it seems like it needs minimum maintenance, too. i like.</li>
    <li> It is OK, It lasted me about 2 years before breaking, so I can&#x27;t complain. I think there are much better ones on the market now however.</li>
    <li> Worked great and then died after just a few months. Will try to return it, but not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> An excellent value for the money and works beautifully! I am very pleased that I proceeded with buying the unit.</li>
    <li> We both use this trimmer - him for nose and ear hair, and me for chin hair.  It&#x27;s very gentle and works great.  I wish we would have bought one years ago!</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> I just use it for less than 10 times, right now it&#x27;s all good. Quite and usefull. I like it.</li>
    <li> This this is the Ferrari of nose hair trimmer, no more looking like a walrus.  It is a little louder then i expected, but that is because of the vacuum and the powerful motor.  Do yourself a favor and get this thing, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Works great. The suction doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hairs but it work well otherwise.</li>
    <li> Nice product, fast shipping. I  bought this trimmer for my husband. He is happy with it and say, that easy to use and result is great. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Publicly reviewing a nose hair trimmer, I have no shame. This unit works very efficiently and painlessly. Cleanup is quick and easy and by using a standard AA battery the device does not become useless like some other trimmers that have non-replaceable rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The internal vacuum does a great job at collecting all the trimmed hairs without leaving them in your nose/ears.</li>
    <li> I only used this for the nose and nothing else. Does a great job trimming lose unwanted nose hairs. Great grooming kit in case you go to a job interview. :) Happy!</li>
    <li> It trims well without pulling.  Cleanup is easy (I just tap it tip-down against the inside of the sink and all the trimmed hair falls out).  This is the third trimmer I&#x27;ve owned and it is by far my favorite.  I run it on rechargeable batteries (Eneloop in case you were wondering) with no problems.</li>
    <li> Works but vacuum is non existent.will go cheap next time.</li>
    <li> and works exactly as described.  also helps on ear hair, and shapping up around the eyes and the middle area between eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Great, but too much for the nose. Eyes get red and water.</li>
    <li> Great razor and easy buying experience</li>
    <li> It works well and does vacuum. I had to make sure it was working as the head does not spin but it does a good job, not great, of cutting excess hairs.</li>
    <li> Works very well, low noise level and pain free. It is easy to carry around and has long battery life.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he uses it I don&#x27;t notice the hair in his nose or his ears so I guess it works good.&lt;br /&gt; He hasn&#x27;t told me he dosen&#x27;t like it., and its all about making him look good so I like that.</li>
    <li> Very nice all reviews were correct</li>
    <li> Works great for personal grooming. Doesn&#x27;t need charging - just batteries. I have too many things plugged in as it is. Works great for lip/ chin/ eyebrow  touch ups between waxing.</li>
    <li> Had it for quite some time and it is still going strong recommend this to anyone looking for this type of trimmer.</li>
    <li> The unit feels solid enough but the battery compartment lid feels pretty cheap.  The unit cuts by plunging it into hairs you want cut and doesn&#x27;t do well if you run it along the surface, this is sort of the opposite of how electric razors are used but it works so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> Fan makes a lot of noise, clippers barely work.  I will have to buy something else</li>
    <li> Such as in and behind the ears and in your nose. Love the product. Very compact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is a tad flimsy. You got to be careful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 5 years since I bought this and it stills works very well. Painless and very clean. It will suck and hair and keep inside which can be easily cleaned.</li>
    <li> Quick ship and product was as described.</li>
    <li> Works better than previous hair trimmers I have had.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used it&#x27;s predecessor for years until I dropped it and it stopped working. I like the feel of this new model. It is compact and feels sturdy (will try not to drop it however). I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days but so far I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this Panasonic trimmer.  This is my third trimmer and is by far the best.  The vacuum action wisks away the hair eliminating the ticking of the nostrils that I experienced with other trimmers.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer as a replacement to my other non vacuum trimmer.  I have used it a few times and can tell the difference when I put some energizes batteries and cheaper knock off types.  With the better battery you get better and noticeable performance out of this bugger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is well rounded and smooth and gives a very clean and close trim.  I really appreciate the vacuum design as it pulls and sucks away the cut hair leaving a hair free nostril.  You still get a lost strand here no there, but gone are the days of blowing your nose and finding a small fake eyelash in your tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will take some getting used to is the bulky design of this trimmer.  Maybe I was used to the slim and thinner design of its predecessors, but this trimmer will take some getting used to as it is a big boy.  Nothing that will hire you to wear a back brace or get a clearance letter from your doctor, but it is bigger than other models on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at this price point, it is an excellent buy.  I recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your funds - this device just does not work well.  They were out of stock on the one I wanted, and I settled with this device - I ended up tossing it after repeated attempts to use it.</li>
    <li> Met needs of user. Vacuum may be good feature but have not used it long enough to know. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good. Vacuum part takes away a lot of the power for the actual trimmer which can cause some issues. Need to have very good battery in the trimmer for it to work really good. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It is powerful and gives you a clean cut every time. It also sucks the hair out of your nose. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> for years I have been Plucking my nose hair . it is painful and unsafe to do it I should say. so came across of this product and was a little bit skeptical at first but when used it , realized I really been missing out on a very essential men equipment. first off you can&#x27;t hurt yourself with this even if you want to.second its fast and quite and keeps a good charge . I would totally recommend this . it is also very good to clean up side burns and clean up eye brows . very accurate and again emphasizing on safe part.</li>
    <li> Not as close trim as older models.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is everything it advertised to be.  It easy to use, fast, efficient, and cleans easily.  I would recommend it to anyone as a great grooming product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is terrific!  it&#x27;s got power and stamina and fits smoothly into the hand.  I like how it feels and how it works to trim hair.  It&#x27;s definitely well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Very nice! Works quite well! The travel case is a total bonus. Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I purchased the Panasonic ER430K to replace a Wahl trimmer that was ten or more years older.  When I got the Panasonic trimmer, I threw the old one in the trash thinking that I had a much better trimmer!  But I was wrong and  I ended up digging the old Wahl trimmer out of the trash because the Panasonic trimmer was worthless.  Maybe it is the way my nose hairs are, but the ER430K did not seem work for me.  Glad I didn&#x27;t empty the trash right away!</li>
    <li> I have used this unit several times since purchase. I agree with some of the other reviews who question the vacuum effectiveness but the trimmer certainly does the job without tugging, ripping or pulling. Good \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; equipment!</li>
    <li> I read all good reviews about that product and made the order. It turns out to be a pretty right choice. Very effective and comfortable. We are very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My first experience with this type device.  Was really surprised how easy the process, and how good the result.  Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> While this is the best of a bad lot I&#x27;ve tried since my OLD Sharper Image trimmer broke, it&#x27;s no where near as good as that one. But the new Sharper Image one is both more expensive and doesn&#x27;t look to be as good as this (although I may try it next if I can&#x27;t find anything else that looks better). It&#x27;s frustrating that they would take off the market the only trimmer that worked great for both nose and ear hair, but since I know how good one of these can be, I know this one isn&#x27;t as good as it can be. But it may well be the best on the market, but I&#x27;m going to keep trying.</li>
    <li> It really works and easy to use.  Every man/woman with a nose should choose this one.</li>
    <li> the product is really worthy and works as expected.. Nice . I would recommend this to my friends ...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand these positive reviews. This thing doesn&#x27;t do anything in terms of cutting. I have tried every angle, cleaning it, ect... and it doesn&#x27;t cut any hair. My remington broke and I thought this was an upgrade but I guess not.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ER430K Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vacuum hair removal systems arrived as promised and on time.</li>
    <li> I just love it! Easy to clean too</li>
    <li> Works very well in my nose!! Never had an issue with this product. Would definetly buy again. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it Great! Product is better than described.  Works really well and is powerful, close cutting action and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Here we go again. I bought this for the &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; feature, as well as the blade design. I am a little hard of hearing on one ear &amp; not so bad in my other, but when you put this guy to work, your ears will be a ringin&#x27; afterwards. It actually hurts my good ear. So if you have excellent hearing, DO NOT purchase this, it may harm your hearing.</li>
    <li> Fast, painless and effective. This product is not quiet, but not offensively loud. Gets all the nose hairs without ripping them out of my skull.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product as this trims effectively nose ear hair. very convenient to use and clean this. a very good product for day to day use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to deal with all the attachments that come with those do  it all clippers out there so I decided to splurge 20 bucks for this dedicated nose/ear hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every week or so. It takes less than a  minute of maneuvering it around the inside of the nose and getting all the visible hairs trimmed. It does not pinch or give me any trouble.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Other than being a bit pricey, this thing is great for what it is.</li>
    <li> One of the best trimmers I have seen. Very good quality. Just nice to use. Sturdy. Easy to disassemble and clean.</li>
    <li> This is a unit that I have needed for a long time.  I used to use the old mechanical spring loaded, finger controlled rotary clipper but was frustrated that it continually needed lubrication between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This battery powered unit is fantastic.  It does not pull my hair and it is very easily cleaned.  I even use it to trim my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast from the vendor.</li>
    <li> My husband laughed when I gave him the Panasonic ER430 Nose, Ear and Trimmer. He is not laughing now. He really  likes  this trimmer. Easy to operate, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get a clean look on his nose and ears. I considered it a good buy for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My previous nose hair trimmer was from sharper image. It was big and expensive. And it did not cut quite as well as this one. Also the vacuum feature is great. It keeps the blades from being clogged.</li>
    <li> Does its job very well and has continued to work effectively for over a year.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for nose, ear and facial hair. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These never seem to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months, used it regularly since, and didn&#x27;t have any problems.  It worked great, did a good job, and was easy to clean.  I thought it was well made and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I almost decided to write a glowing review about it too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then for some unknown reason I decided to put the incuded plastic cap on which I&#x27;d never really used before.  I  didn&#x27;t think anything of it.  I figured it&#x27;s just a cap.  What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to take the cap off the next day, and the whole top cone piece of the trimmer came off with it and now is stuck inside the cap and doesn&#x27;t come out.  The blade unit also came loose as result and I tried twisting the top back but that annoying clip won&#x27;t go all the way and again, the top cone piece is lodged inside the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that despite the good reviews, the Panasonic brand, and the fact it did a decent job when it worked, it&#x27;s not very durable.  Next time I think I&#x27;ll just get a $10 one to replace it.</li>
    <li> Bought and had issues running within a week. It loses power at certain angles. Pulls the hair instead which is painful.</li>
    <li> Poor product does not work as sold. Where do I get a refund?</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Great!  I know it&#x27;s supposed to be used for human ears/nose but I bought it to use on my dog.  It&#x27;s faster, easier and much less painful to remove her ear hair to reduce instances of ear infections. I tried other brands but none of them actually cut the hair!</li>
    <li> works well, powerful motor, quiet operation, easy operation. Can&#x27;t find a single thing to fault this for other than breakdown for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction and product</li>
    <li> Sadly to say I&#x27;m old enough to require one of these.  It works and it&#x27;s fast, what&#x27;s more to say.</li>
    <li> No complaints.. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> I cannot complain about this purchase. As the years accumulate towards the fullness of time, I have found the need to trim my ears a bit. This indeed does that. The promoted vacuum feature is slightly more than a gimmick in my honest opinion. It&#x27;s weak at best, but it probably does work a little bit. I can&#x27;t really tell. But it&#x27;s not a force to promote. The thing is built well, feels solid although a bit lighter than you might imagine. This is probably a good thing honestly. I can&#x27;t really say much more about this, it works well.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the other reviewers here I haven&#x27;t tried other devices so my point of comparison are scissors. And I can&#x27;t say how happy I am not having to seek out bright lighting and a magnifying mirror to trim my ear and nose hair. No more concerns about nicking myself and never getting to everything that needs to be cut. The Panasonic is gentle, effective, fast, thorough and will hopefully be reliable. If it is anything like other Panasonic consumer care products I&#x27;m assuming so. If you are still using a scissor you are suffering needlessly!</li>
    <li> Works great for intended purposes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely storable in velvety zippered bag.&lt;br /&gt;Takes only one AA battery and seems to last for a long while.</li>
    <li> I have had numerous ear &amp; nose trimmers and the Panasonic ER430K is the best.</li>
    <li> Bought for a Christmas present, my husband hasn&#x27;t complained he said it works so that is good good value for the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good,convinent,and good price performance. I think it is suitable to most of people.It&#x27;s better for the travel and biz trip.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job trimming nose hairs. This is by far the best nose hair trimmer I have used, It does a quick clean job.</li>
    <li> I have been buying nose hair trimmers over the past 20 years and this is the best ever. My wee brother in Scotland is getting one for his birthday.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job Christ man, it isn&#x27;t always subtle. I also found that even with fresh batteries you had to give it a smack or two to &amp;#34;wake up.&amp;#34; I hope ther is some new technology out therensoon. So far I have yet to find anything better.</li>
    <li> This little puppy is awesome. It&#x27;s compact and packs a lot more power driven by a single AA battery than my previous model driven by two &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; batteries. Blades are sharp, no pulling. No complaints.</li>
    <li> If I turned 50, I noticed that I accumulate a lot of Nosair. With this groomer, I get to keep it clean, at all times. If you suffer from this issue, I suggest you might want one too.</li>
    <li> This is a great little nose trimmer but the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work all that well.  It leaves nose hairs in my nose and I have yet to see any in the little collection area when cleaning the item.  If I ever need another trimmer I would order the Panasonic trimmer without the vacuum feature.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve only had it for 24 hours but I used it immediately and was I was impressed. This trimmer works really well.</li>
    <li> This unit seems to be all that it promises to be, so far. I&#x27;ve only used it once thus far but it seemed to work flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Takes 1 AA. Those with AAA batteries are not really powerful enough.  This one is made with power AND quality. (My first Panasonic wa s125 years old and lost it&#x27;s &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;.)</li>
    <li> This works great!  The price is good.  I bought one for each member of the family.  It does a great job of grooming hair, nose, ears, eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Product is the best of many I have tried. Trims closely and easily.</li>
    <li> Does what is says it does.  It cuts my ear and nose hairs and sucks them out so they don&#x27;t make me sneeze or itch.  I haven&#x27;t used it but a couple times, so not sure about the battery life, but it works great.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself and are easy to clean.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This purchase replaced a damaged one like it. Used it today , works fine but I am not going to answer another survey.</li>
    <li> We all like to deal with that unseemly ear hair. This is the product for that. Easy to use and it does a great job and you don&#x27;t have to plug it in. Buy it! Now!</li>
    <li> This product works fairly well. I have tried several and it is probably better than most, but none of them are that great.</li>
    <li> Works excellent. I didn&#x27;t think i would ever need a device specifically to cut my nose hairs but this saves time. Either be careful with a scissors or just use this. Vacuum is also nice to clean up and hairs that drop.</li>
    <li> Works better then older ones of other brands. Blades seems really sharp. Would purchase again if I needed another one.</li>
    <li> it is meh....not a big deal really. It does irritate my nose, not sure if the vacuum part is working or not</li>
    <li> It trims without pulling and I have no complaints. It does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I had it for years now and it works very well. I have to used it about once a month.</li>
    <li> My husband is very disappointed with this trimmer.  Not as powerful as the one I bought at $1.00 store.</li>
    <li> Tufts of hair poking out of ears and nostrils are endearing on old English gentleman, they are not on me. For years I have used scissors and mustache trimmers to tame the field, but doing so has been spotty at best and bloody at times. The ER430K is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair in terms of both thickness and density. Most trimmers bend the hair making it difficult to actually cut it. First use, I quickly cleaned up nose hairs, ear hair, and my eyebrows with ease. There was no fear of catching nose hairs in the blades (ouch!) or cutting the sensitive nasal cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It fits nicely in my hand and is easy to move around into just the right position.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty quiet though anything you stick in your ear canal will be noisy.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts from the end and the sides.&lt;br /&gt;The carry bag is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It tickles my nose hairs making me sneeze.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance, he now looks much better! :) He said it felt fine using it also, I recommend this product for people with nose hair.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is far superior to the Vidal Sassoon trimmer I used for years. It has a robust and powerful motor, and the blades trim with painless efficiency. The vacuum feature is a very welcome innovation that works wonderfully well. The ergonomic handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate. Great product all around.</li>
    <li> This is the first ear/nose hair trimmer I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to.  The unit feels substantial and well made.  The battery cover comes off in a 1/4 turn and appears watertight.  The blade end easily disassembles for cleaning, although there is a thin plastic \\&quot;stick\\&quot; that seems a bit frail and if it fails I sure the whole thing would die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results go, it certainly cuts hairs.  It actually tickles a little in your nose and is loud in your ear.  In your nose the hairs are left very short and prickley.  I found this to be an uncomfortable feeling for the first 24 hours, but then got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it is supposed to do, although it is very loud when used in your ear.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this since Dec. 2009.  I had great expectations, but the performance is not that much better than our $8 cheapo.  It still doesn&#x27;t catch the hairs without a lot of manipulation and effort.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this one is worth while.  I&#x27;ve had a couple different trimmers over the years, but this one certainly wins the award for best EVER.  It requires 1 AA battery and amazingly spins at extremely high RPMs.  As a result, hair trimming is quick, easy, &amp; painless.  It didn&#x27;t pull the hairs or make my eyes water...I&#x27;m impressed.  Also, the vacuum feature seems to work as advertised.  I had no left over trimmings in my nose to cause itching or sneezing.  The only negative I could find is that it will actually trim VERY close and thoroughly, leaving almost a stubble in your nose that can be irritating for a couple days when you rub your nose.  Now I just don&#x27;t trim as thoroughly and I have no issues.  Thanks for a great product Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what is it supposed to do.  Cuts the hair without ripping it out like a previous trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised for trimming nose hair.  Only used it once so only four stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and it works very well for me. It sure beats using scissors. The only drawback which to me is minor is the mirror on the cap which is difficult to use. I don&#x27;t use it as the bathroom mirror works just fine. I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product as 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Seller. A+++++</li>
    <li> It works exactly as advertised&lt;br /&gt;I really like this&lt;br /&gt;I can take it with me when I travel&lt;br /&gt;Great price and service</li>
    <li> Finally got the suitable device for this function, I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Especially like the vacuum!</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend, very please with it.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised, I&#x27;m not so sure the vacuum function does anything that significant, but the volume is not really the problem.</li>
    <li> Good buy, no complaints</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve owed it for about a year now.</li>
    <li> Does the job pretty well, very efficient !</li>
    <li> The vacuum tickles at first, but it does the trick and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My favorite of this trimmer is the vacuum function because it leaves the hair mess to a minimum. Most of the trimmed hair will be sucked inside and you can clean the filter easily under running water. Other cheap trimmers will leave a lot of mess in/on whatever you use the trimmer (i.e. nose, ears, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
    <li> I really like that this trimmer has a vacuum to help get rid of the hair trimmings, but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of them all.  I usally have to blow my nose a few times to get rid of a few leftovers, but for the most part this makes cleanup easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the top of the trimmer was removable so it would be easier to clean (sometimes it gets boogers stuck in it), but it&#x27;s still not difficult</li>
    <li> Does the job it is designed to do at a low cost.</li>
    <li> Great! Can occasionally pull on hair, but not very often. I was scared to put this in my nose, but it works quite well and is not painful. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband was looking for.  It&#x27;s very smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs and cleans up quickly.</li>
    <li> My Rate reflects the Great Service provided,&lt;br /&gt;I liked the accurate dates and quaity of the received product&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended this to all buyers</li>
    <li> Works great, very pleased with this product. I love Panasonic products, as they make fantastic good quality stuff!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, including the vacuum feature.  Best little grooming tool in it&#x27;s class.  Comfortable and easy to hold and use. Pouch is a nice bonus. Mirrored cap is &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;, but it protects the cutter head. Could be easier to clean, but no stars off for that. Buy this one if you are in the market for one.</li>
    <li> This has been a solid purchase.  It takes away all my unnecessary hairs with out a hiccup.  The motor is very strong and I have not had any issues with this product.</li>
    <li> It goes up your nose and cuts your hair.  And it cut any stray hair you need cutting.  I wish it used c batteries.  For longer operation kife.  I also missed the light my last one had.  Some people mock the light but I think it was a nice option.  I used to have one from sharper image.  It had a light and bigger batteries.  It was not water proof.  It had crappie blades.  And where the battery cover attached to the body  broke.  The connection points were made out of plastic.  It lasted a long while but it did fail and made it useless.  Over all I am happy.  I would have rated 5 stars but it lacks bigger batteries and a light.  Other wise smart buy.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Works great, best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used for the nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice that it disassembles easily to clean trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a Panasonic product and in my opium the trimmer is good quality trimmer for the money I paid.</li>
    <li> I have recently start using this and I can&#x27;t complain. It does it&#x27;s job nice and smoothly. It&#x27;s also easy to dissemble to clean.</li>
    <li> This is the best ear/nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve had to date. The cutting and vacuuming combo is the only way to go for now on</li>
    <li> This little trimmer buzzes through nose hair like a weed whacker.  It chews up thick hairs with a tiny \\&quot;bzzzzt,\\&quot; like a minuscule shrubbery shredder or hedge trimmer.  You don&#x27;t have to wait for your nasal passages to dry.  A little snot doesn&#x27;t slow it down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A guy who looks to be picking his nose isn&#x27;t always.  Sometimes he&#x27;s plucking out pesky nose hairs.  For decades my thorny nose hairs caused maddening irritation as they vibrated against my nasal passages.  When the itching and sneezing got to be too much, out came the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid to use a trimmer for fear the device would get choked with \\&quot;thorns\\&quot; and yank them out by the root.  I thought Nads, a waxing product, would be a good alternative but my shipment from Amazon arrived with the package pierced, a grave oversight by the lummox who processed my order.  Amazon makes it easy to return a shipment, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason Nads nose wax is not available from retailers.  So far I&#x27;m happy with my \\&quot;shredder,\\&quot; and not disappointed that Nads didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> so far this works really well.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with my purchase of this product from panasonic....due to genetics, I have a ton of facial hair, and this trimmer does a really fine job for me.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Vacuum tickles a bit, but you get used to it. Would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband said it is the best one he has used. Delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> Clips nose hairs with the greatest of ease. The internal suction of this product is minuscule, but more than enough to trap tiny hairs in its screened filter. Easy to clean and reassembles in seconds.</li>
    <li> Pain free, love it. I used to pluck. (I&#x27;m at that age where the hair on my legs quit growing but now is coming out my nose &amp; ears.) Easy to clean, save a lot of grooming time.</li>
    <li> a product much like this but it doesn&#x27;t vacuum out the hair I have to use a wet Q-tip to get the hair gone away I&#x27;m sure this will help with that hair messiness!!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd trimmer I have owned.  The other two were junk.  This is a quality piece of equipment.  The motor is plenty strong and it works as advertised.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Found it easy to use and effective for ear, nose and facial hair elimination, I definitely recommend it to one and all</li>
    <li> Far better than using the attachments that come with my  norelco beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer vacuums the clippings and cuts closer, too</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this thing. It is indescribably ticklish. I&#x27;d equate the sensation to being electrocuted. Perhaps there&#x27;s something defective with my particular unit, since no one else seems to have noted this problem in reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw away the box before trying it, so I&#x27;m stuck with it. At least it was only $20.</li>
    <li> Get yourself one of these.  It sure quickens putting on the finishing touches.</li>
    <li> As I grow older ( 77 yrs) hair comes from places where I didn&#x27;t have hair before....very strange!  I can&#x27;t grow hair on myhead, but I can produce a bumper crop in my ears and in my nose.  Thanks to my Panasonic ER430K, bumper crops are no  longer ugly or a problem.  Thanks a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;Bill Leistner</li>
    <li> My husband asked me to write this review for him.  He said it was a great gift &amp; does the trick!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use, not a lot of noise, and still works like new!  His ears &amp; nose are hair-free so we&#x27;re both happy:)))</li>
    <li> Product performs as advertised. Convenient, efficient, and easy to clean I am very pleased with the product performance and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really a nice trimmer, using almost a year, and this trimmer is definitely the best!&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to change batteries so often and vacuum works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Just started using this item.  So far, so good.  The construction seems solid enough in the device itself, though both the covering cap and the travel case seem a bit flimsy.  I don&#x27;t need either, so to me it&#x27;s not a problem.  Although it&#x27;s a bit on the noisy side, sounding like a mosquito in a steroid rage, the cutting head is accurate, easy to control, and very effective.</li>
    <li> Before making a purchase I always check out the reviews from others and I was not disappointing with them for this item. I have to date purchased two similar trimmers and both have basically been a disaster, one is little over 2 months old but performed miserably hence the reason why I wen out and purchased this guy. It arrived super fast, great packaging and exactly as described, put to use immediately and can confirm that this is by far the best I have had to date, great close trim, no hair pulling, very pleased with result, would I recommend this to others, yup I sure would!</li>
    <li> I got no complaints. I have had it for a few months, used it a bunch of times, washed it in running water and like the energizer bunny, it keeps on running (maybe I am using energizer batteries??)  Seems to be a sharp set of blades, so the nose and ear hairs are cut instead of feeling like the are being ripped out.</li>
    <li> No more tears when trimming ear and especially nose hairs.  Wished I would have bought this bad boy much sooner.  It not only is pain free but does a wonderful job.  Not all trimmers are created equal!</li>
    <li> Every well groomed guy needs one of these! My first Panasonic trimmer lasted eight years until I accidentally dropped it on a concrete floor and cracked the housing and bent the blades. I&#x27;ve used other trimmers before but this one does the job without pulling the hairs inside your nose as it cuts.  I don&#x27;t know if the vacuum part really works that well since hair particles still end up in the sink and in your nose when finished. It is easy to clean in running water and I always spin the trimmer head in a small container of rubbing alcohol to keep it sanitized after I use it.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Does use a AA battery about every two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is the best one I ever had and is worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> Works great. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my nose and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> great trimmer! works well!! very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t get to very many hairs</li>
    <li> Best trimmer on the market. Amazon did a great job in selection as usual.</li>
    <li> My much larger and heavier trimmer from Sharper Image, stopped working so went looking for a replacement.  This one takes up less space, is lighter and does just as good a job, if not better.  AND, comes with a case!  Great price too, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic Nose/Ear Hair Trimmer for my husband.  He was skeptikal as he has had 2 or 3 others, and they all seemed to pull the hair out rather than cut it off.  He uses it often and is so pleased with results.  He is 100% satisfied.  He would recommend it to anyone.  Granny Grump[[ASIN:B004A6127U Panasonic Er430k Vacuum Nose/ear Hair Trimmer, Gray Vacuum Whisks Away Hair Clippings]]</li>
    <li> This is my first nose and ear trimmer and I find this product very effective. I was able to get very good results in my first try. Got it at almost 50% off retail price.</li>
    <li> Purchased this unit for myself... these units are only made to Last 3 years.. so when I hear all these complaints of the previous model worked better &amp; this model didn&#x27;t last, take it with a grain of salt.  Vacuum unit workes fine &amp; even comes with clip on cap with mirror.       Purchased other \\&quot;Panasonic lighted ear hair trimmer\\&quot; to do my 85 year old Dad&#x27;s ear hair, that works fine as well.  These units are double this price in some retail stores. Thanks Amazon!...</li>
    <li> What can I say about a nose trimmer? It should either work well or not. This is the best one and at a fair price to boot.</li>
    <li> So I bought this trimmer for my husband (OK, and maybe for me since his nose hairs really don&#x27;t bother him) and he is pretty impressed with it.  Especially the sucking action that takes care of the clippings.  He says its easy to use and really powerful.  Buy it -- you and your wife will love it!</li>
    <li> Put the battery in, turn it on, and go. Works like a charm. 5/5</li>
    <li> Works perfect. Great quality, as advertised. Wish it was recharagable rather than AA-battery operated but I guess I cant get everything I want :(</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband for his birthday and he loves it, it take care of the nose hair like no other he has tried!!</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Not sure it&#x27;s the best out there but for the price it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper for those hard to reach places in the ear and nose.  It&#x27;s sturdy and comes with a little carrying pouch and plastic cover for the tip.</li>
    <li> It works great and is much better then scissors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely stubborn when it comes to personal hygiene products, and this is no exception.  I&#x27;ve been a long standing owner of the first generation Sharper Image nose hair trimmers and after years of service and inability to replace the parts or the unit itself, I decided to try something new.  This choice was a wise choice, although I&#x27;ve only used the nose hair trimmer, it works perfectly; and the bag is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Works better (if only slightly) than any of the other cheaper ones I have used. However it does work and am happy when I use it every so often.</li>
    <li> Last year, my wife bought me the Wahl nose trimmer as a gift. She said that I was difficult to buy for, because whatever I need, I just go and get. Previously, I had no problem using nose scissors for the occasional snip. I got accustomed to using the Wahl, even though it was a little loud. Soon, the cover kept falling off, then the cutters became dull and started to pinch little...and then, the switch stopped working. After reading reviews, I purchased the Panasonic. This is a huge improvement!  The motor is quieter and revs more RPM&#x27;s. The smaller head is makes it easier to navigate for precision. The blade cover snaps on more securely. Also, the unit stands up - which makes it easier to store in my medicine cabinet and grab hold of. The switch is also much better. Time will tell how well this product will work well, but it seems to be well made enough.</li>
    <li> Now...it&#x27;s kind of an embarrassing thing to review...but I can&#x27;t help the way the male body is designed to grow more hair everywhere except on top of the head as we age. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does exactly what it advertises, and very well.  I actually like that it uses batteries instead of charging (one less charger to keep track of).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It breaks down easily for cleaning...just be prepared to give it drying time if you rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...minor thing...the little mirror on the cap  is useless.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer my father ever owned!  It&#x27;s easy to use and works quickly and efficiently.  He has owned many over the years and this is by far better than any.</li>
    <li> Works great. Fast and clean.  Still can&#x27;t find where the hair goes though. Take off the heads and no hair.  Oh Well.</li>
    <li> As mentioned before, I am hairy all over including my nose. (see Norelco Bodygroom Pro review) If I don&#x27;t keep it under control, I will have these long unsightly hairs sticking out of my nose like snakes escaping from the zoo. Before I would take an Excel razor to the inside of my nose. But after a series of nicks that caused my nose to swell I decided there had to be a better way. (Don&#x27;t tell my wife about swelling. She calls the eyes-nose configuration the triangle of death. She&#x27;s drunk the kool-aid of Dr. Oz.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Panasonic Trimmer but used it only once because it caused too much sneezing. I put it away for a few months and went back to the razor and back to the nicks and swelling. So, I gave it another try and this time no sneezing! The second time, only one sneeze. This little trimmer worked great! I was able to mow down the nose hair to a nice neat size just as good as the razor but without the nicks. Oh yeah! I&#x27;m sticking to the trimmer from now on.</li>
    <li> Use it whenever I need to. Easy to use. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t really suck up all the hair that is trimmed.</li>
    <li> strong and durable.  no mess with built in vacuum.  trims face well too.  a big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a couple of trimmers and none of them would really take care of the hair the way I wanted.  This one cuts close and does it quickly.  With the others I would have to go over the same spot multiple times, but with this one it&#x27;s just one or maybe two passes and I&#x27;m done.  I was never bothered with trimmings hanging around, so I didn&#x27;t buy it for the vacuum, but I wonder if it helps gather the hair together for trimming, which is the real benefit.</li>
    <li> Works as designed, compact, ergonomic, nice zipper case for storage when not in use or for travel, battery operated. Received as a gift and would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. It worked fine for a few years, and then the motor slowed down and trimming was ineffective. But I bought the same model again, because it is the best of the trimmers I have tried.</li>
    <li> This product is ineffective.  It barely cuts anything (nose or ear hair).  I would not recommend it to anyone and if I hadn&#x27;t thrown the box away, I would ask for a refund.</li>
    <li> Does the job efficiently! Also not that expensive. I had a previous Panasonic that lasted for years! Just needs new battery once in a while.</li>
    <li> Use it for nose hair and ear hair (I know.. disgusting)... but it works like a charm and gets rid of all that nasty hair.</li>
    <li> Warning: this may be TMI for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, and guys who are thinking about this too, I purchased this exclusively to use &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34; I would not recommend this even if you have your SO/bf/gf/husband/wife helping you with this task, because we tried it and it violently pulled a clump of hairs and caused bleeding under the skin and a whopping amount of pain. But if it works on nose hairs, perhaps it will work &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; if you first trim them very short with some scissors, which I admit we did not do. I will have to try it next time and then update my review. But for now, due to the painful experience, its gonna stay 1 star. If anyone else successfully used it down there, please let me know about your technique.</li>
    <li> Did not last long and motor seemed to run out of power even with new batteries; I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It works just as described, it vacuums the hair leaving little or none at all behind.  My old nose trimmer, what a nightmare, it leaves everything behind.  I have to hold my breath and clean out my nostrils after every use.  Well done Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Delivered before estimated. Good value! Great produce....</li>
    <li> This tool gets every nook and cranny without a hiccup, dry or wet. It&#x27;s comfortable to use and you won&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself with the layer of protection it has. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy, these are definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I picked up on this unit while on the internet. Wow, what a great piece of grooming equipment. As a senior I can grow more hair in my ears and nose than on my head. I&#x27;ve tried various trimmers with all the gadgets and they are mediocre at best. This unit really works. The first time I tried it I thought I could hear the voices of angels. There are no extra attachments. All trimming is done with the single cutting head. I hope never to be without one.</li>
    <li> I have had other nose trimmers and this one is very good. My other ones have worn out and this one keeps ticking</li>
    <li> Product came on time and in great condition.  I have tried many trimmers over the years,  and this one is the best so far.  It does a good job and I like being able to rinse the blades under running water without it shorting out.  The vacuum works ok, but there are still plenty of cut hairs left in nose.  The trimmer itself works good and cleaning is easy, so I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little trimmer set up, case is rather chintzy, but the trimmer itself is very solid, and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My last experience with one of these type devices was a painful terror; it ripped out nose hairs painfully. It went in the trash after one use. Years of using tiny scissors was less effective and tedious and painful at times as well. After seeing several men in our office with National Forests growing out of their ears made me decide to give this Panasonic a try. I figured with a name like Panasonic, it couldn&#x27;t be painful like the last one I bought. I was right and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item. It is a breeze to use and only rarely does it cause pain.</li>
    <li> works but poor quality</li>
    <li> This should have lasted longer than it did. For the past month or so my husband changed the batteries 3 times thinking that was the problem but you have to keep shaking it and it&#x27;s barely staying on now. This is not exactly a tool that is used daily so come on, there&#x27;s no reason for this.&lt;br /&gt;Gonna try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> The blades are getting dull soon.there unfortunately is no part replacement for it</li>
    <li> Works great, charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be that guy at the office with spider legs coming out of his nostrils.  Just get this and use it, it may help your career and love life.</li>
    <li> accomplishes its work, is a very practical tool, the only incombeniente that I have found is that the noise is a bit strong, I&#x27;ve had other models of the same brand and did not have such a high sound, if you plan to use this ears take into consideration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many of other models and makes before but this is the best so far.  Works very well.  Very precise and good ergonomics.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by the efficiency of this trimmer. It replaces a trimmer from Brookstone that was a bit more expensive and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> item is as described, it&#x27;s quality made, so far it&#x27;s holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.</li>
    <li> i got this as a gift for my bf and he loves it alot. he was nervous cuz he thought it was going to pull hairs but it doesnt at all! plus the vacuum works really well&lt;br /&gt;money well spent! super recommend</li>
    <li> I gave this to my brother-in-law for Christmas (he requested it on Elfster). He told me it works very well on all areas that need trimming.</li>
    <li> It does the work. Great trimmer, easy to clean, all plastic, well designed. Just need one battery. The only bad thing is it got too much noise when you tried to clean ear hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times, but I like it way better than the two I&#x27;ve owned previously.  It seems to work much better at getting those pesky nose hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic Trimmer.  Easy to operate and sucks all loose hairs to prevent sneezing.  Very quiet. Comes with a nice cloth bag.  Wish it had a brush.</li>
    <li> Have no idea how I ever lived without this thing.  Have owned for over 3 years. Great for eyebrow, nose and ear trimming for both men and women.</li>
    <li> Fast delivered, very nice!</li>
    <li> very pleased with item. only reason for four stars is it did not exceed what i was expecting.  Great product</li>
    <li> It works well enough to trim nose and ear hair. These things usually stop working after a year or so. The trouble is, Panasonic are the best I&#x27;ve tried so I keep on replacing them. One particular issue I&#x27;m having with this model is that whenever I put on the plastic cap to put the unit in a drawer or suitcase, taking off the cap almost always causes it to fall apart. I have to reinsert the blades and mechanism.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I highly recommend it to anyone.  I have been using it know for a few couple of months and it works as advertised.  Shipping was ver fast.</li>
    <li> use it to trim my nose and i love it, i can breathe a lot better and my hair doesn&#x27;t come out my nostrils when i smile... lol</li>
    <li> It was a lot larger that I thought.  But it still works well. No issues as of yet.  The one thing I dont like it this format required a certain amount of words.  So I have to be long winded and not brief in my feedback.</li>
    <li> It cut my nose inside. First time I thought it may be a skin growth inside my nose, but after repeated cuts, I looked up my nose and found that it cuts what appears to be a normal skin. I have pictures of my cut. I will see if I can post. Very well made product otherwise, but I do not think anyone would want a well made product that cuts inside nose.</li>
    <li> None of the trimmers I have purchased in the past have been very good but this one is better than most.  I have a newer one now in a different brand but I tend to reach for this one when I need a trim.</li>
    <li> Works okay at best. Doesn&#x27;t work as good as another brand i used to have.  I will try to find one like my old one.  This doesn&#x27;t trim hair effectively down to the skin.  It is extremely safe which is probably why it doesn&#x27;t work like i want it to.  Hair is still visible after it has been cut to its shortest level</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of trimmers.  This one us by far the best I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now, and am still on my first battery.  I&#x27;ve heard comments on short battery life.  I use it 2-3 times per week, and I&#x27;m still going, so perhaps the folks who are noticing short battery life are using it almost daily.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised really well its just that i vibrates alot and the sensation of having that kind of thing in your nose takes some getting used to. The vacuum works extremely well as well. as someone that hates seeing the hair shaving on my bathroom counter tops it is a welcome feature.</li>
    <li> The older model 421 is better.  This model does not trim was well as the older model.  I lost the older model and purchased this model.  I am disappointed.  I will reorder to purchase the older model.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who loves the product.  Would highly recommend it especially to those of us aging and need to keep up with random faciial hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer. It works as advertised and doesn&#x27;t cause discomfort. A little bulky for such a simple item, wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for travel.</li>
    <li> This product works great! The only complaint is its a bit loud when trimmming in your ears. Otherwise it is safe and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ear/nose trimmer performed MORE efficiently than I expected.  Trims were very close and fast.  Thank you, Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I had an older Panasonic trimmer for many years and it worked great, but finally gave up the ghost. I was well satisfied with the earlier model so I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment. Yes, it trims just fine. The problem is that it is louder than a 747. If you have to trim inside your ears, as I do, it&#x27;s actually dangerously loud. Worse, the noise it makes is very irritating, a high-pitched buzzing/whining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t a personal hygiene product it would be on the way back right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware. Buy something else. I know I am.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from a spinal cord injury and has problems with dexterity.  He has no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> First, this is the fourth nose trimmer of this type I have owned. None of them pulled my nose hairs, probably because I used them properly.  It takes about ten minutes of use to get rid of all hairs. First you glide it on the interior surface of each nostril pushing it up and down and rotating it about ten degrees nine times. Then you use your index finger to press the tip of your nose towards your face. This changes the shape of your nostrils. You then angle the device about 20 degrees with respect to the vertical and do the above mentioned ritual. Then angel the trimmer 45 degrees to the vertical and to it all again.      Then you check the results. Insert your thumb in each nostril and put your index finger on the outside of the nose. Press them together and pull them towards the opening. This will reveal hairs that are still too long.     If you have not yet died of boredom, repeat all of the above ritual but just in the are of the newly discovered long hairs.</li>
    <li> I never had a need for this type of trimmer in the past.  But that was the past because now it has become a must have.  I bought the Panasonic after researching professional reviews as well as the more important user reviews.  This trimmer is fast and efficient and I see no negatives at this point.  Does a great job and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.  I would definitely select the Panasonic again.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It works as stated. Perfectly. The vacuum is nice it doesn&#x27;t make a mess anywhere. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cut me. It&#x27;s relatively quiet and pretty small. For the price its just right! Works really well!</li>
    <li> It works very well and is reasonably priced. It is a very fast and efficient grooming tool. I am not sure what to make of the comment about batteries burning out too soon. It is after all an energetic little device and I suppose if a person needed to leave it on for a while the batteries would soon expire. About five to ten seconds of \\&quot;on\\&quot; time is as much as I have needed. Perhaps knowing where a person is going with the thing before turning it on is the best practice.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting use to the tickle factor when trimming nose hairs. Easy to clean lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Works very well and comes with nice travel pouch.  The vacuum from clipping works really good. It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great, and leaves no mess due to the internal vacuum. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Does not grab and pull hair, making eyes water.  It is smooth and quick.  Great price, and arrived fast!</li>
    <li> Decent trimmer. Does what it claims to.</li>
    <li> My father in law loved it</li>
    <li> This is the first nose/facial hair trimmer that I have owned, and I would consider it a five star product.  I have owned it for about a month now and have not experienced a single tug or pull while trimming my nose hair and other hair.  It gives a very clean cut.  The Vacuum system ACTUALLY works!  When done trimming the hair is contained with the trimmer&#x27;s head and easily washes out.  It does make me sneeze, but what do you expect when putting something that is vibrating up your nose.  It&#x27;s unavoidable.  This is a great product and would recommend to anyone.    PS.  I have some pretty thick hair too</li>
    <li> No muss no fuss with this trimmer. It works well without pulling at the hairs in the nose or ears. I bought this to replace an old model from a different brand. I have purchased many over the years for my husband and this one works the best to date of all the others. The case is a nice idea as it can be stored in a drawer instead of having to be put into the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, I do not know how I ever survived without it!  I also recommend this for trimming those inconvenient butt hairs too!</li>
    <li> Had to return and give credit where credit is due.  After trying other products that \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the hairs out or have motors that bind up under load I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  I would have been happy with a product that just trims nose and ear hair well.  It does that and cleans up too.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect a vacuum on an instrument like this to be much good but it actually works.  The batteries seem to last a long time too.  This purchase exceeded my expectation.</li>
    <li> Works well.  No discomfort.</li>
    <li> Works well for nose.  Haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else.  Now if they could just keep my eyes from watering...</li>
    <li> My Panasonic nose and FAcial hair trimmer seemed to work ok for a few months, but after just 4 months the Blade broke from the joint and the unit no longer works.  Panasonic trys to make the return process as painful as possible to minimize the number of returns they receive.  Do yourself a favor, and select a different trimmer.  I will be mailing the unit back to Panasonic using my own money to pay for postage.  We will wait and see if I ever see or hear from them again.</li>
    <li> I have used other type of trimmers and this one is the best.  It is not as noisy as others and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got this because of all the great reviews and it was a great price.  It works great, does exactly what I needed it to do and does it well.  Not a lot to say about it, pop a battery in it (not included) and your good to go.  From the time it arrived to opening it and using it was like 10 minutes max.</li>
    <li> A little louder than expected, but not bad. Is quite effective in achieving its purpose. I was doubtful of the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; claims, but so far it&#x27;s handled water very well.</li>
    <li> In all honestly, I&#x27;m not sure why I purchased this item.  I recently turned 50, and I guess I just thought I was getting older.  So I found this one on Amazon at a reasonable. . . . It had favorable reviews. . . . .so I got it. . . . and I used it.  ..  .and I HATED it. . . The reason why I hate it was quite unexpected. . . . .and no one who wrote reviews of the product said anything about this. . . . The reason is. . . . After you cut your nose hairs. . . then the \\&quot;ends\\&quot; (stubble) is sharp. . .  Then when you go to blow your nose, for example, and you&#x27;re pressing against your nose, the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; goes into the opposite side . . . and it&#x27;s \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not quite as bad as pins sticking in. . . but . .  .it&#x27;s certainly \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve not trimmed for a few weeks now, and it&#x27;s gotten better.  Unless I really feel that trimming is necessary. . . then I&#x27;m not going to do it any longer.  Certainly it makes sense for those people who have such issues. . .  .but.  .. at least for now. . . I&#x27;m really not one of those people.  But I&#x27;m glad to have this item, should I get a \\&quot;wild hair\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use.  I have been buying this product for years and still think it is great.  Make sure you get the ER430K model.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T suck nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Very simple, solid construction, and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Is working well so far however I do still have hairs, unfortunately, that get missed. Feels good in your hand and shuts on/off easily.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Arrived exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> So far, so good...have purchased less quality variants of this before that hurt like hell as they pull out noise hairs when they trim. So far, the ER430K trims with no pulling and is very easy to use. The vacuum function is nice touch to reduce mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I age and start growing excess hair where I don&#x27;t want it, this product helps keep the dream alive!</li>
    <li> works well for nose, ear hair trimming - battery operated</li>
    <li> This is a very capable trimmer which I will gladly keep and use.  I dropped one star only because it isn&#x27;t quite as good as its&#x27; predecessor, the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear n Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System, which I had before.  Unfortunately, I dropped it about six inches onto the counter and it popped open, bent the cutting head and is no longer functional.  The vacuum feature of this one sounded good, so I replaced with the newest model.  The new one works fine, I just don&#x27;t get as much &#x27;debris&#x27; when I clean it. Since I know about how much there is, I&#x27;m wondering where in the mechanism it is hiding?  If I&#x27;m missing something, will someone let me know.</li>
    <li> Perfect ,strong enough,I buy and buy another one is excellent</li>
    <li> Works much better than my old one. Quiet, and the vacuum actually works!</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Okay not great but okay</li>
    <li> Extremely hard to open the battery pack.</li>
    <li> My husband really thinks this is great. It does trim very well.</li>
    <li> The unit operates fairly quietly; there&#x27;s no pulling or yanking when it shaves; the vacuum feature operates exactly the way it should, so there&#x27;s nothing to make me sneeze afterwards.</li>
    <li> Cuts the hair forest inside my nose incredibly close, without cutting skin.  Works way way better than a small haircutting scissor, and much faster too.  Good build quality and power lasts really long time using typical batteries.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Next generation product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a $8 trimmer.  This one is sharper, more powerful, doesn&#x27;t nick.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Simple, safe, and effective.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research on these. This one does everything advertised. A cool tool.</li>
    <li> I always found the idea of sticking a device in your nose and ears...powered and cutting...very scary. At the very least, I&#x27;ve heard some very painful &amp;#34;hair pulling&amp;#34; stories.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, this guy works great, and I find the extra features this more expensive model has well worth the money:&lt;br /&gt;1) No hair is staying put...it&#x27;s getting (gently) vacuumed out...I used to sneeze a lot when trimming before due to it staying behind.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is very easily cleaned...just run some water in there. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t hurt, agitate, or annoy...at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only funny part is the little &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; thing -- I can&#x27;t see it ever being useful.&lt;br /&gt;The product, however...is immensely!</li>
    <li> Makes life so much easier. Batteries last a decent amount of time. Works cleanly and thoroughly and is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is without a doubt the best I have tried over the years.  The feature that I like best is the fact that it collects the hair as it cuts.</li>
    <li> I purchased another one somewhere else and it broke within 5 months.  This seems sturdier and hopefully will last longer.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 years now. It does its job . Simple and perfect.</li>
    <li> Cuts the hairs better than I thought being a round head. This was my first trimmer. I&#x27;d buy this model again if the one I have gets &#x27;lost&#x27; by the kids.</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer is compact and works very well.  Quiet and trims nicely and quickly.  Good quality product for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is very good</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! Every man should have one. It trims all my nose hair in a matter of a few seconds, its mildly uncomfortable but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice, works well, but consider spending more for a trimer with a straight edge blade for more versatility.</li>
    <li> Makes life so much easier. Works great!</li>
    <li> I gave it to my husband and he has only used it about 3 times so far but it works well.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> Better than one I had</li>
    <li> The groomer works well. In certain instances, it will not remove hair that has already been cut down by the machine. In other words, if you don&#x27;t pass over the hair correctly the first time, then it will get too short for removal. All in all, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell how long it will last but so far it works great.  It is far superior to my pervoius trimmer.  It cuts cleanly with no pulling.</li>
    <li> OK, hard to write a review about this product without wanting to crack up laughing....however, it works, it&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and the little mirror on the cap is a great idea. Seems like a very well made product.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised.  The recipient of the gift loves it.</li>
    <li> so far, it works good.....not great</li>
    <li> An epic nose trimmer.  It just mows down those unsightly hairs.  I have used several lesser trimmers which pulled on my hairs or took over 5 minutes.  This thing busts it out in seconds.  I can leave the house knowing I will not offend innocent people and keep a professional clean cut appearance.</li>
    <li> One AA battery and your good to go. Vacuum feature makes for easy clean up, just rinse the catch when your done and you&#x27;re good. It also is very portable and can easily be used on the go, especially because of the vacuum feature. You never have to worry about hairs landing on your shirt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zipper pouch could be nicer or have a little padding. It is just a microfiber-like cloth wrapping for the device.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good quality product.  It does just what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> This shaver is extremely irritating to my nose I can&#x27;t keep it for seconds without sneezing like crazy ! it also not very effective in catching hair so yeah it was disappointing for me :(</li>
    <li> Broke really quickly&lt;br /&gt;And it wasn&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed in Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Finally found a good one, nice and close</li>
    <li> Cuts &amp; sucks up the hair, no sneezing!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this for ears &amp; it&#x27;s not effective for ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is great. Cleaning is little tricky.&lt;br /&gt;I like the travel case also.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this. Cleans my nose nicely, is effortless and painless.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use, it&#x60;s fun!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum has a cooling tickle to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is easy. Just rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the 5 star scale. I give this 7 stars!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vacuum Nose/ear hair trimmer is outstanding!. d:~)+&amp;lt;</li>
    <li> Wish I would have had one of these decades ago. The vacuum action is excellent, as it sucks up the hair as it it shaved off. I have not cut myself with it and stuck it around in my nostrils without care.</li>
    <li> works great  got here  fast</li>
    <li> Really practical and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a family member and they loved it. feels sturdy and durable. Does not feel like a cheap plastic. and is still working.</li>
    <li> The basic model didn&#x27;t tickle my nose, probably because it didn&#x27;t have the built in vacuum</li>
    <li> nice product, works as advertised, safe to use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cheap product. It broke after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Best Nose Trimmer, I&#x27;ve ever bought. Cuts great. No mess or sneezing</li>
    <li> nice product, recomended</li>
    <li> The best I have used and the built in vacume prevenst me from sneezing.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd ER430K trimmer.  First purchased from Art of Shaving store.  Lasted for 4 years. My only complaint is that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sell replacement blades and heads.  Once worn the whole trimmer needs to be replaced.  July 2016 Update: Still working great.  Have to replace batteries every 6 to 9 months which doesn&#x27;t seem too often to me.</li>
    <li> works as expected. arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this, it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  Bought for husband and he was very happy with the ease of use and the results.</li>
    <li> does job perfectly.. using since feb 2015&lt;br /&gt;vacuum feature is +1</li>
    <li> Used this once, pretty easy and good to use.  Just like the description.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than the trimmer I had previously.</li>
    <li> It is good to have a real Ear Hair Trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer, easy to use, lightweight, doesn&#x27;t hurt your nose. I also like that it is larger than others, so is easier to handle. Probably are better trimmers out there but for the price point and something as simple as trimming your nose hair this is a good buy</li>
    <li> The trimmer is small, easy to hold, quiet, and has a convenient carrying case.  Its nozzle is tiny, and trims closely with no uncomfortable pulling.</li>
    <li> Works great so far, batteries seem to last well in it, wish the head of the trimmer had a slightly different design, but mostly comfortable and effective.  Great price also, and it&#x27;s pretty durable so far, have dropped it on hard ceramic floors, numerous times and it has not busted yet, great for when you travel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite preferable when nose hair have been trimmed and sucked off even though the job need more time to perform perfectly.</li>
    <li> Dull blades, noisy and battery did not last.  Why are you carrying this, Amazon?  My wife bought it as a gift or it would have been sent back a long time ago...</li>
    <li> is not that strong and wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
    <li> Worked right out of the box. Trims allot better then my old one and have reduced the number of times I had to use it.</li>
    <li> This Trimmer is Battery powered, and the the vacuum works very well. It operates with 1 AA Battery and does not come with any for those hoping it would. I popped in one of the batteries from my stash and started it right up. The cap on the top of it has a very tiny mirror-like, reflective surface on it but it is not really big enough for me to use for anything. It took me a few minutes to get use to the vacuum tickling my nose but once I got around that it worked perfectly. The over all size of the unit is small so you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it taking up too much space.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. It works just like it&#x27;s described. I was doubtful about the vacuum functioning properly but it does work and it works great. It&#x27;s easy to clean and is definitely a trimmer I would recommend.  The best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> These things never work well.  Or if they do, they break easily.&lt;br /&gt;Not this one.  It&#x27;s a jewel.  Effective, sturdy, and well made.  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews. But this product is so bad that I took the time to review it. The nose hair trimmer is very ineffective. All it does is tickle my nose and trim a few small pieces of hair. A replaced this with a $10 nose trimmer I saw in CVS. That&#x27;s much faster and more effective than this one. This product is a complete waste of money - do not buy.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and works well!  I&#x27;d buy it again if I needed to. I use it mainly for trimming nose hairs.</li>
    <li> My father is in a nursing home and is not able to properly groom himself any more. I never imagined that I would have to care for him in this way. In other words, I have no prior experience in grooming someone.This trimmer does a professional looking job and is simple to use. The vacuum feature is excellent. No mess, you don&#x27;t have to concern yourself with hair all over the place. You just have to clean the head of the trimmer. I am extremely satisfied with this trimmer and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic trimmers for years and finally decided to get a new one.  I am glad I did and I would recommend this one to everyone.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thing. It&#x27;s great that it vacuums up all the hairs so it leaves no mess. Very light and easy to use. Highly recommended over other brands.</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLDER, SMALLER VERSION OF THE PANASONIC TRIMMER, BUT IT DOES THE JOB</li>
    <li> It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to. If I were to have one complaint, the most that it would be is that it tickles the inside of my nose!</li>
    <li> Broke after a month and Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it. I don&#x27;t understand the reviews.</li>
    <li> bought for my father in law he really likes it</li>
    <li> Bought one for my brother earlier this year and he loves it. Ordered one for me and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> works great and long lasting battery.</li>
    <li> Very good ptoduct! Works far better thnn I expected.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for some now for a dedicated Nose trimmer. Can&#x27;t beat this one for use, price &amp; free delivery. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I was not totally satisfied with its performance-it does not clip close enough and it is slow in doing the timming-my old model did a lot better job.</li>
    <li> Very good for grooming</li>
    <li> The previous Panasonic model that I had for years worked very well, but in this version only the vacuum is working OK. It will take you a lot of time to catch a hair or two. You will be much better off using tweezers or scissors. And what is the deal with the stupid mirror? For the first time in my life I see a mirror that doesn&#x27;t reflect anything.</li>
    <li> as entitled, this product is that, powerful and sturdy. i put in the energizer advanced batteries and the blades turn like that of a chainsaw. i also like the wide body for the grip, unlike the other slender bodied ones that i have purchased before</li>
    <li> This trimmer is as good a trimmer as one would find anywhere.  The only&lt;br /&gt;downside is that it cannot come in to skin close.  For that, a hand held scissor&lt;br /&gt;or shaving blade is required.</li>
    <li> it worked ok, not bad, not great. Basically in line with what i expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the problem is it stopped working less than 6 month i bought it. so Don&#x27;t BUY this.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer stopped working after about 6 months of use. I would use it about once every two weeks so I didn&#x27;t overuse this thing. I changed the battery and still nothing. This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It makes your nose hairs real nice and trimmed.  Nice carrying case to keep it concealed in your dob kit away from other items.</li>
    <li> This is a great product orks well makes an awkward job easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;Getting the model with the case was worth the extra money I would highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this model to anyone considering purchasing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace my previous Panasonic trimmer. The trimmer head on my previous model and this one are practically identical, the upgrade is the vacuum which is a very welcome addition. This model is slightly louder, because of the vacuum, but the sounds doesn&#x27;t bother my ears, but it seems that the vacuum makes the trimmer work more efficiently. I use an Eneloop battery, and it lasts for several months between recharges. I would definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot I can say about a nose hair trimmer.  The important thing is that it does what it is supposed to do.  It doesn&#x27;t tickle too much, and it comes with a nifty carrying case for travel.</li>
    <li> Great works good.. A+ A+ A+ A A A a aa a a a a a aa aaaa  aaa  a</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Headlight&amp;#34; is silly, but the trimmer is first class.  Great results; extremely pleased by its performance.</li>
    <li> Iy does what it says and very well too...</li>
    <li> Trimmer works very well if the hair is short - longer hairs must be clipped and then the trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it. He&#x27;s tried several other more expensive brands, and apparently none of those trimmers worked properly.  This one does the job, and the vacuum feature is nice.  So far he&#x27;s only used it once, so at this point I can&#x27;t attest to its durability. But for under $20 you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Easy to use.  Works great.  Would buy again.  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I initially bought one of these for my husband from Neiman Marcus years ago.  He loves it and I just bought another one for our Florida home.  Nice product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have bought (or received as a gift) many nose hair trimmers over the years. This one works better than any other I&#x27;ve used. Who cares if it costs a few more bucks, my nose and ears are hair free!</li>
    <li> Never had such an item before. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Spin up really fast compared to cheaper no name versions.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t felt a tug yet.</li>
    <li> The ultimate trimmer. I give this product 10stars!!</li>
    <li> it is ok, not to strong for some areas of hair although the promotion said it was, can help only on ears and inside nostril, not other uses  will be completed with this device as it is not powerful at all.</li>
    <li> I dropped once and it was over.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped others and no problem.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bolqui and not heavy duty</li>
    <li> Far superior to the Philips Norelco trimmer that I discarded the same day it arrived.</li>
    <li> This is the only device that does NOT pull any hairs.  It cuts very quickly and smoothly.  Not sure how well the vacuum works but it most likely helps a bit.  It also works well on facial hairs. I would give this item 6 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> my husband is very satisfied with it</li>
    <li> So useful, and really gets at those nasty dirty nose hairs hanging down. Also, hearing is  improved without a hair mop hanging out of these ears. Good for removing ticks and hairballs from the cat too. Just try not to  cut up the cat&#x27;s feeler whiskers, as my cat&#x27;s head is now covered with wet cat food juice, yuk.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool all around</li>
    <li> So glad that I bought this model with the vaccum.  Brilliant</li>
    <li> It works, does the job better and not as painful as a pair of tweezers. :)</li>
    <li> Does the job intended. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This trimmer actually works and never cuts you!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend</li>
    <li> One of the best nasal trimmers I have used.</li>
    <li> Great product. I do love the vacuum addition and effectiveness, though it does tickle something awful when you&#x27;re getting those nose hairs!</li>
    <li> Well made -  seems like it will last a long time. Nice weight in the hand. It is made up plastic, but feels very durable. Nice metal tip and plastic cover to keep things neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well on my eyebrows and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel case is a simple, but nice touch. It makes the whole process seem much tidier and sanitary than it probably is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely glad I spent the few extra dollars over a cheaper, equally highly rated version. I suspect this will last a very long time so the cost is only a few extra cents per use. That is worth the mild amount of pleasure that comes from doing a very uninteresting task with a piece of quality equipment designed specifically for the purpose.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well as advertised. Looks scary at first but after using it a couple times could see that it was perfectly save with no pinching or any other discomfort. If you&#x27;re an old coot with hair growing out of weird places that are hard to get at this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I enjoy &amp; trust purchasing Panasonic products because I am confident that the items are  well designed for the end user &amp; of a quality that I will get years of service. This Panasonic hair nose trimmer is exactly what I needed.     If you are in the market for a nose hair trimmer this is the one to buy. Spend the money &amp; buy a quality product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair trimmer, added advantage of vacuum to minimise hair clutter. Battery lasts over a month. Good compact design and does the job efficiently.</li>
    <li> Good quality and value.  Easy to use and clean.  Would recommend this purchase to others.  No complaints from me.  Excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> they do what they have to do but i wouldn&#x27;t suggest them. My first time using them was my last, the trimmer heats up too quick and they&#x27;re too ticklish</li>
    <li> awesome piece of equipment, works great, easy to clean, this is the second one i&#x27;ve owned, i used to have an older model and it worked great for about 6 months, the thing about this is to take good care of it, make sure you let it dry before putting it away and dont use for more than 50-60 seconds at time, just 50-60 seconds and let it cool off, otherwise it will overheat and the blade wont last for more than a year.</li>
    <li> hey i just got this thing like a month and man it works i use it for my nose and it cut everything out like nuthin and  works with AA BATTERY its easy to use but only thing is i wish it had a charger with recharge battery it dont come with thAt but its really sharp and work i recomend it thanks</li>
    <li> This thing is really powerful. I like the vacuum on this thing which helps get a lot of nose hairs. It also works as a pretty good facial hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> The best nose trimmer I ever used. I will not buy or use any other brand. Told my friends and family about how great it works.</li>
    <li> it worked for a awhile, and then became history,which really amazed me, since the brand sells itself, to be honest a bought it led by the brand.</li>
    <li> This trimmer only arrived the other day and it is really top notch. Does the job brilliantly. The only improvement suggestion I would make is to make the battery a li-ion battery, rather than requiring AA batteries, but I suppose that would drive up the price significantly.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it.  Nose hair is not attractive on anyone.  If you can&#x27;t keep it trimmed, what can you do?  This trimmer is a must-have - even if you have those other nose trimmers or even the popular &#x27;bikini&#x27; trimmer shown on TV.  Those trimmers are good for trimming the circumference of the nose (the skin portion in a circular motion).  However, nose hair is tricky and likes to grow in the worst of places.  While you got the hairs on the edge of the nose, you can still be growing long hair deep inside the nose.  That is where the Panasonic Vacuum Nose Trimmer comes in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Does what traditional personal trimmers can&#x27;t do&lt;br /&gt;-Gets the hair deep back in the nose at the source&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum actually does suck out those hairs&lt;br /&gt;-Device is easy to take apart to remove old hairs and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Let&#x27;s get serious.  That so-called mirror that is attached to the handle of this trimmer is just a reflective sticker.  You&#x27;d be better off looking at your reflection in a pool of motor oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent to be a gift for your friends. It cheaps and do its work fine.&lt;br /&gt;battery life is very good, so we almost forgot to replace battery when we start for new journey. Anyway you can buy this AA battery everywhere.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an older Panasonic model that had a light but when I was cleaning it under the bathroom faucet, the blade washed down the drain!  Be on alert when cleaning and best practice would be to close the drain just in case!  The new unit is as good an probably better than the old one.  I don&#x27;t miss the light because frankly, it didn&#x27;t really reveal anything that I couldn&#x27;t already see with the bathroom light and frankly, it&#x27;s not a good idea to trim or shave with the lights off :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature works well and I would have to say that compared to the old unit without this feature, I would say that there isn&#x27;t much cut hair remaining in my nostrils when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it gets the job done and at a very reasonable price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Before having this nose trimmer, I had one without the vacuum and non rotary blades, although it was good for cutting, hairs were left inside my nose and then I basically had to sneeze after trimming the hairs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the vacuum system all the hair get sucked and then just clean as the instructions says. I use 1 Sanyo eneloop AA battery and have been using it for a month without any extra charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item twice but it leaves weird oil looking smudge in my nose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get hairs to slip into the head slots where they&#x27;ll actually get cut.  I find myself individually targetting ear hairs and spending longer than I&#x27;d like wiggling around trying to get a decent amount of nose hairs.  I&#x27;m hoping there&#x27;s something better out there.  This is my second trimmer (the first was a manual version held with two hands--no batteries and lasts forever, but didn&#x27;t work any better).  I&#x27;m beginning to think there isn&#x27;t anything on the market that would do what I expect.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for the first month. But then suddenly it died. I used the trimmer probably once (or twice, rarely) a week. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Hello - I am someone that likes to be neatly groomed at all times. I bought this hoping that it would take care of my needs and it hasn&#x27;t ever disappointed me. I use it 1 time a week for my nose, my ears, and even sometimes around my goatee. It is strong, precise and works like a champ. I&#x27;ve never been injured by using this, and it gets right down to the skin line. Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Feels funny when you first use it because it has a vacuum suction to it as it cuts the hairs.</li>
    <li> its water proof and fairly quiet, does its purpose well, but I haven&#x27;t tried any others to compare. Its small and compact and very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kind of tickles the noise a bit, but oh well</li>
    <li> The first one I bought broke.  Thought it was my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one I bought also broke.  Now I am convinced it was not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, buy something else.</li>
    <li> Have had my old trimmer forever but this one is 100 times better</li>
    <li> Best little trimmer I have seen.</li>
    <li> Bought this years ago and still use it today</li>
    <li> Really good, simple to use, painless.</li>
    <li> Best Trimmer I have found so far (and I have been trying them all for 30 years).</li>
    <li> After a couple of times using it, it stopped working.</li>
    <li> At first it was a little disappointing, because the vacuum didn&#x27;t worked properly and left some cut air on my nose, however I discovered that it was because I set some old batteries on it, since the product doesn&#x27;t bring their own. Once I replaced them with brand new ones it worked amazing. Overall it is a nice product.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!  Easy to use, fast and ultra effective.  Husband has very happy ears and nose!</li>
    <li> it is high quality super disign, awsome excellent item. thanks. I am really happy and lucky to have it. super.</li>
    <li> Everything about this trimmer is great but the fact that they advertise this for facial hair on the box, and I hardly see it being able to do a good facial trim.</li>
    <li> works well for most hairs but occasionally an ouchie pull occurs.  Size is reasonable.  relatively slim profile and carry case is nice.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! I use it weekly on my husband, easy to use and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Where do I begin.  I have a unibrow, and some straggelers for nose hair.  This handy tool does the trick.  It is powerful and cuts through the bushes in my nose.</li>
    <li> still looking for the perfect one, but this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use. And very well made.&lt;br /&gt;As for its primary, hair removal, it does that great as well.</li>
    <li> Used on nose and ears and not a single hair pulled.  Very easy to clean.  I tried one of the manual devices for a couple of years until I dropped and damaged it.  Then I purchased this unit and wished I had purchased it years ago.  So much easier to use and does a much better job.</li>
    <li> Every other trimmer I have used has been junk until I used this one.  It works great and I will continue to use this one until they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> This nose hair trimmer is fast and efficient at removing unwanted hair. I would recommend this product to anyone with a nose hair problem. The only drawback to this product is Vacuum aspect. Unfortunately after using this product you still have to blow your nose in a tissue to get rid of the residual clippings. It sucks up some of the hair, but by no means the whole massacre. Also it tickles for your nose with the first couple of uses, but you get used to it. All in all a great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this along with Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro to complete my shaving/trimming needs.  Works great for ears, nose, mustache, eyebrows.  Small and easy to handle, store in pouch.  Easy to clean and it can get wet.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husbands stocking last year and still works great. Nice that it sucks up hairs instead of leaving a mess for me to find later. Nice item</li>
    <li> great product. Definitely less clean up with the vacuum. I wonder where it goes through. buy it now. ha ha</li>
    <li> Awesome...well as awesome as a nose and ear trimmer can be. This is the best nose and ear trimmer I have owned in 10 years.  High powered which prevents any pulls.</li>
    <li> my husband has gotten to the age where he has more hair in his ears than on his head : (....ordered this for him and he loves it....has a little vacuum to clean as you go....it is quality merchandise...no cheap stuff....he loves it!!</li>
    <li> Vacuum nose/facial hair trimmer works great and is the best one I ever used.  I would recommend this over all the ones I tried before.</li>
    <li> I think my husband loves and appreciates this product.  It takes care of business and is quiet.  He has not had it long but so far it is doing a great job on all the unwanted hair in ears, and nose.</li>
    <li> compared to the small nose hair trimmer scissors, this panasonic trimmer does a better job, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the vacuum function is a bit more on the gimmick side than functional.  I still have a lot of hair pieces in my nose.  So I think i probably would recommend the cheaper version of this.&lt;br /&gt;2. to clean the blade fully you have to loosen to parts of the trimmer head and this is a bit wonky to do.  The instructions emphasize that the blades are thin and can be easily damaged, but accessing them should be made easier.  I think it could be more likely I&#x27;ll damage the blade while trying to access it than clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, it gets the job done well and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical regarding the vacuum function - it works !&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results and would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works beautifully better than expected,i was very pleased with the value and effectiveness,would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for an awesome trimmer</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it will do. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good nose/ear trimmer. The price may seem a little high for some, but think of how much embarrassment you&#x27;ll avoid. In conclusion, don&#x27;t be a cheap a$$ and buy something you&#x27;ll later regret.</li>
    <li> This baby is really powerful and doesn&#x27;t consume the battery much at all. I have the batteries in this baby and use it maybe once a week and now is roughly almost a year or so owning it. The thing still works like a charm and no battery replaced. Trust me, it can really trim...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I think it works great. He usado el producto por varios meses y me parece bueno</li>
    <li> This just arrived and i have not test it out yet, but i will. It comes with a nifty little traveling bag which is cool! And it takes one AAA battery. I cannot wait to try it out :D</li>
    <li> the head is a bit large , and it tickles my nose when i insert it, makes me feel like sneezing</li>
    <li> Have tried other nose hair trimmers and been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;This is clearly the best of the bunch. Panasonic makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected, I considered the &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; a novelty but it does help with sneezing. It works great for nose and ears.</li>
    <li> Dropped my first one onto a tiled bathroom floor and &amp;#34;hurt it purty bad&amp;#34; so I ordered a replacement the very same day.......&#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> never owned a nose and hair trimmer.  this one had good reviews so i thought i would give it a try....very glad i did!  no more plucking and no more pain!</li>
    <li> I have always spent too much money for trimmers and have gotten a very poor product. Not with these! I have use them once a week since I&#x27;ve gotten them and they trim my nose hair to perfection. I know that is a little weird but for something that is a standard grooming practice that we all do, at least men do, it is a godsend to get these. I would recommend them to my best friend.</li>
    <li> Broke after three months of use</li>
    <li> Keeps the wild growth down in less than 30 seconds for both sides. Does make your eyes water from that nasty nasal vibration tickle. Best ever. If you don&#x27;t like Chewbacca Nose, this is the trimmer to get. Stay tuned...in 4-5 years I&#x27;ll review on the ear hair trimming ability.  It runs in my family, guaranteed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go to Walmart ever again to buy a trimmer this is more durable than anything I&#x27;ve ever bought before at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ER430k trimmer works so well that you barely ever get to use it. I used the trimmer once and it cuts the hair so close that I have not needed to use it even one month later. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It works better then most on the market and believe me ive tried 4 or 5</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace an older nose hair trimmer. My initial thought was that at the price, it&#x27;s not a big risk, and the whole vacuum thing might even work - although I didn&#x27;t really hold out much hope for the vacuum. I was surprised in a couple of ways. First, the nose trimmer itself is superior to my old one. It doesn&#x27;t occasionally grab a little bit of (sensitive) skin occasionally like my old one did, and does a nice and comfortable job. And, much to my surprise, the little vacuum function actually works! No, it&#x27;s not perfect, it will not suck up all the trimmings - but it does a lot of them. Which is a big plus in my book.</li>
    <li> We have tried numerous products in the past and found this to be a product that performs as stated.  Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Nose and ear hair are gone. Easy to use. AA batteries last a long time. Look your best each day!</li>
    <li> ordered the product as a gift and when it was opened hair fell out of it.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. I have used it several times and it works flawlessly.  Very good product. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only nose trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased and I am very pleased. The vacuum feature is very convenient, I can use it just before I head to work and don&#x27;t worry about random cut hairs. The motor is strong and the trimmer is sharp. It consistently cuts the hairs easily. I clean out the hair-catching area of the trimmer, about every month or so. This helps keep the trimmer running well, I notice if it collects too much hair in there then the motor struggles a bit. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year, and it still performs the way it did that first day I turned it on. Surprisingly well made trimmer for the price. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product stats out cutting just fine but it soon dulls and pulls nose hairs even with a new battery---I would suggest investing a little more and get a cutting head that holds up</li>
    <li> Other reviews made this out like it was the best thing ever.  However, I found it to be a 5 on a scale of 1 - 10.  Also, you&#x27;ll find yourself replacing the battery fairly often.</li>
    <li> Easy to cause nose blood</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned,it cuts the hair does&#x27;t pull it ,smooth.</li>
    <li> Very nice upgrade I did I purchase one about 10 years ago and broke on a couple of weeks ago they are made strong Great product..</li>
    <li> A wonderful personal groomer that goes and goes. I&#x27;m used to screaming as my personal groomer runs out of battery and yanks a nose hair out. This device will have none of that. The blades have no problem zipping through the thickest of hairs and then vacuuming them inside the head. It fits perfectly into the palm of the hand and comes with a sleek little cover. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> works great for my husband. Love the fact it sucks up the hair as you go so it doesn&#x27;t go all over you. Love that it has a cap too to protect the head</li>
    <li> Very nice little travel companion that does the trick. It is not loud, has a smooth comfortable cut so your eyes won&#x27;t tear and takes care of business quickly. It&#x27;s light weight and has a nice travel case. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fired up like a Ferrari</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to do</li>
    <li> Great product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> An excellent trimmer! I had another brand, and wasn&#x27;t very pleased with it.  This model is excellent, fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> Does the job well enough.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and works very good. occasionally feel hot, but it is ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and it is a good product, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Perfect for facial hair...Nose especially</li>
    <li> Nice size, works well and it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t leave a mess to clean up after your done trimming.</li>
    <li> This is the first unit I have gotten for trimming ear and nose hairs, and it works very nicely, although it tickles a bit when trimming nose hairs, which is not off-the-wall, since there are a lot of nerves in the nose, hence so what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, and it is much easier than using a Remington mustache and beard trimmer or a tiny pair of scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not come with a battery, so you need to get a single AA battery.  The cutting unit unscrews so that you can clean it, which is easy to do.  It is well-designed and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This really work, very easy to use, does a great job.</li>
    <li> Husband seems to like it.  Great for getting his crazy eyebrows (antennae) , nose hairs, and ear hairs under control.</li>
    <li> I use the trimmer for both my nose and ear hairs for a neat and clean look.  I also use it to trim the corners of my mustache and the hard to shave side burn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a cleaner and healthy look not to have hairs showing from parts of your face and next that is unattractive.  It is a clean look, and it beats trying to remove unwanted hairs with a tweeter.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. Love it. No special cleaning required. You just run this thing under the faucet and the water comes out of the top part and cleans it. After cleaning, I don&#x27;t put mine back in the case -- I leave the top off so it can dry. I did a lot of research before buying and this one had the best reviews. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought one each for both my wife and myself. We both like it very much. It works much better than a cheaper competitors model. I think the vacuum is a real plus, and it seems to be very easy on the battery power too.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for the money.  It does the job I expected and more.  Cuts the nose hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this for my husband.  It does the work ok, but great.  Besides, it&#x27;s super loud.  Is there anyway they can make it quieter?  That would be huge improvement.</li>
    <li> As the years pass and more hair grows where it&#x27;s not wanted it came to the point of this purchase. Easy set up by adding one AA battery (not included) and its ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts quickly, close and most importantly it does it safely due to the design it would be extremely hard/unlucky to nick your skin with this.&lt;br /&gt;After using, it instantly felt better and you become less paranoid about those stray hairs that seem to pop up.</li>
    <li> Great product, light weight, contoured perfectly for my big hands..</li>
    <li> Great groomer. it will trim the unwanted hair from the ears and nostrils in a flip of the switch. It is easy to handle and is conveniently shaped to do the job.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Does a nice, clean, painless job.</li>
    <li> Great nose hair trimmer. Tickles a little but worth it. Works great. Doesn&#x27;t break after one use like many others. Doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy like others. Even has a little vacuum to suck up all the hair it trims to prevent you inhaling hair or having it everywhere. Comes with a little pouch to keep it in.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it -says it works good.  I like the pouch it comes in so you don&#x27;t have to look at it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Great feel to product. (Built quality)&lt;br /&gt;About the size of an average guys Palm.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts evenly&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum feature is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I have to say it was a great purchase. After researching several items this one was the willer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> Recieved on time and enjoy it and wnd works great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve gone through a few.  I didn&#x27;t believe a decent one existed...until I got this one.  Other trimmers will miss hair, but this one is easy to use, smooth, painless, accurate, efficient, small, light...all in all an exemplary product.</li>
    <li> Works better than my old one did!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> Use this on my maltipoo&#x27;s stubborn outer ear fine hairs.  She hates it but it gets the hair out of there.  Does not work well on longer hairs - clip those with hair clippers.  Easy to take apart and clean and last long without having to replace batteries.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very efficient and powerful compared to my old Andis. The double blades work very well and includes a nice case.</li>
    <li> The vacuum is so great.  I can trim those pesky nose hairs, and when done the sink is clean!  You can remove the tip when finished to allow access to the hair reservoir.  Just rinse out and you&#x27;re all set for the next time you need it.  The travel case is very nice as well, and I usually just store the trimmer in there even if I&#x27;m not traveling.  But the main point I&#x27;d like to convey is that the vacuum is not a gimmick - it works great and keeps the wife off my back since I&#x27;m not missing any hair during clean-up.  Awesome idea that was properly designed - and an excellent finished product.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the result</li>
    <li> I have just received this, and used it once, so I cannot comment on durability or longevity yet.  I CAN SAY THAT I LOVE IT!  MAKES GETTING RID OF NOSE HAIR A BREEZE!  So fast and easy.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, won&#x27;t yank out hairs or pinch the inside of your shnoz.  Delighted with it so far.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the nose hair trimmer and it works great.  I hope they upgrade this product to lithium rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> Great product. No itching or sneezing while using this. Best one I&#x27;ve used so far. I highly recommend to anyone seeking a good efficient trimmer.</li>
    <li> This works great and has good power to cut nose hairs.  The vacuum is an added plus and it is very cool on the skin.  Overall the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had in my life.  Let&#x27;s see if it lasts more than a year.</li>
    <li> Ran for two months and then stopped working.  This was a replacement unit purchased for one I purchased about 18 months ago that also quit working.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is totally awesome....easy to use...quick and effective....it makes a quick job of trimming...I&#x27;d buy another one right now!</li>
    <li> I will refrain from being graphic, probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve only used this one. I&#x27;ve never felt so clean and shiny &amp;#34;up there&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems easy to clean, as the tip has removable parts, and you can rinse it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, discreetly, recommended (as discreet as something can be on one of the biggest shopping websites in the world).</li>
    <li> small, efficient, quiet&lt;br /&gt;All positive things to say about this Panasonic product&lt;br /&gt;Nothing negative to say about this Panasonic product</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer that can be used not only for ears, nose, but also very good for trimming&lt;br /&gt;the edges of your beard. Love the vacuum!</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget...wanted to get rid of my nose hairs &amp; this trimmer does it quickly &amp; painlessly. It&#x27;s also very easy to take apart &amp; clean, &amp; everything just snaps back together. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, works perfectly without any flaws!</li>
    <li> Works great. Like the vacuum action. Fast devivery.</li>
    <li> Gift my dad says it works wonderful.</li>
    <li> That vacuum feature is GREAT!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty cool trimmer it does what it says it will do. Very unique. The only thing I wish it could do is eyebrows. I like it alot</li>
    <li> Very nice to use and easy to trim</li>
    <li> The trimmer works very well.  It does not burn whatsoever when applied to this sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the carry case and cap.&lt;br /&gt;It was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> feels comfortable when using.  do not feel like sneezing and no pain.</li>
    <li> Works great. Perfect grooming item for any man</li>
    <li> Update:     My bad, I just needed to clean it and all was working good after that.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Dead after 6 months. Built-in obsolescence after return period.    I guess small scissors are still the most reliable, but really wanted the convenience of an electric motor.    I wish someone would make a heavy duty one that doesn&#x27;t die so quick.</li>
    <li> I like it. Good quality and low price for trimmer model.</li>
    <li> HOW DID I EVER LIVE WITHOUT IT ?</li>
    <li> Let me say first that I really like this product.  It has never nicked me, for example.  So, I&#x27;m on my 3rd one.  It works great for a few months, but then it - slowly - starts to loose strength.  Of course, I replace the battery, but that never helps.  I&#x27;ve tried both lithium and alkaline batteries.  Makes no difference and eventually, it just dies.  So, I&#x27;ve learned to always have a spare one on hand.  Its covered by warranty, but for what a new one costs, going through the process just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. And it has the power to do it as well. This is a good product to cut them god awful ear and nose hairs ...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much more than it does what it is supposed to do. Have no idea how long it will last but I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price. The vacuum function works great and I use this device weekly. If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality trimmer with all the bells and whistles this is it.</li>
    <li> I like the vaccum mechanism.  I think it is a great product.  I do wish it was more compact; i.e. not as bulky but that does not affect the product&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> just what i asked for, and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This a great little trimmer. It is very quiet running , so nobody in the next room even knows you are using it. It does not pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is small enough to fit in a carry all bag or purse . Its a great little unisex product. I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the first nose trimmer i bought from Panasonic, the product is really easy to use and it woks perfectly. I can&#x27;t expect more from this product. 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> only for nose and ears. Clears out all those tree trunks.</li>
    <li> Fast turn around.  Part was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Originally I was buying it for a friend who just could not get his nose hair trimmed. He has one but didn&#x27;t use it as he said it hurt. I got myself one and tested it out and it works great. No pain and trims short. Im glad I don&#x27;t have to trim with those tiny scissors anymore and accidentally cutting myself.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do with no nonsense. Mirror is useless but not a big issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a number of this type product over the years. This one does the job best. ......more words......more words</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to replace one he had used for YEARS after trying a couple that were low quality. He really likes this one and says it works great! The travel pouch is really nice too.</li>
    <li> this is really good items. small and compact and perfect. free from pain of picking of nose hair. this is really necessary item of men and women.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very loud but does a great job. I have owned several over the years but this one tops them all. It is very powerful, I am thinking about going outside and trimming some trees with it later.</li>
    <li> Nice and quiet little gadget this and gets the job done, if you can get passed the tickling and sneezing from the vibration then your home free</li>
    <li> I works excellent . good quality and size and cleaned easily</li>
    <li> Not so much satisfactory. Top of the device easily removed when open the cap.</li>
    <li> I try all different kind of the product I like this one better worked last longer</li>
    <li> ergonomic, not loud, comes with nice carrying pouch for travel</li>
    <li> my husband loves it. he said it works well.</li>
    <li> read the reviews, but never really thought I would find a trimmer that works,,, This one does. I love it..</li>
    <li> This broke down pretty quickly and my husband was disappointed. We ordered a different product which works nicely.</li>
    <li> This little gadget works well and love that it&#x27;s portable and easy to use. Great for trips and when you need to get into them little hard areas that are difficult to reach.</li>
    <li> Works well, but is oddly the only nose hair trimmer that has ever caused me to sneeze uncontrollably.</li>
    <li> Great ,powerful fast cuttingdesign.</li>
    <li> works well - louder than smaller less robust version.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s pretty good, I would say!  Definitely better then the last one I had! Can&#x27;t say I remember the brand name of that one!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Easy to use. Effective. Easy to clean. Durable. I have not used wet yet and frankly don&#x27;t intend to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several small battery powered trimmers, but none of them have the round trimmer featured by Panasonic - which is SO much more efficient. This item is bigger than the last Panasonic model I had (purchased in the 90s) but it still fits comfortably in my hand, and does a terrific job. As a bonus, the cap has a tiny mirror, and the trimmer comes with a zipper travel bag. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was never much into grooming until now. I love the fact that I&#x27;m a lot safer using this product instead of scissors.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works as advertised, but I can not help but go into a sneezing frenzy when I first start trimming with it. However in the end it does its job and gets all those pesky long nose hairs... Sure beats using little scissors. Cleanup is not that difficult, but kind of a pain to do after every use.</li>
    <li> Ear hair, nose hair, mustache trim, side burn cleanup, all are no longer a problem thanks to this handy tool.</li>
    <li> Seems sturdy and does the job.</li>
    <li> Really nice and fast for taking case of those annoying nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it! Case could be a little better quality.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t pull at all. Get yourself some rechargeable batts for it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Easy to use and no pain !</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever used. I like how easily it comes apart for cleaning. One time, I was pushing the limits of my battery and it tugged on a hair. I was startled and it didn&#x27;t feel good. I knew the battery was dying, though, because I could hear the difference in the sound of the trimmer. My fault entirely. The product itself works great, just make sure you use good, charged batteries. Another stupid thing I did: I thought the mirror on the cap was useless at first, but then I realized there was a protective covering on it. Once removed, the mirror works fine.</li>
    <li> When I got this a few years ago I put in the battery. I am still using that original battery. This removes nose hair quite well. With the vacuum feature it sometimes makes me want to sneeze. It is easy to clean since there is a filter that catches all the nose hairs that get cut. I only use it for my nose hairs so I can&#x27;t say how well it works for ears or other facial areas.</li>
    <li> So far so great, works as advertised and absolutely no pull or discomfort when doing nose hairs or ear hairs and works quickly and efficiently unlike other ones I&#x27;ve used where your &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; inside the nose for minutes.  Eyebrows are more difficult to do b/c there is no way to ensure your not chopping off too much, there&#x27;s no guard.  Overall a very sturdy well built product after 2 weeks, love it.</li>
    <li> Best nose hair Trimmer ever purchased... This is not an item I enjoy, or I would any man enjoys purchasing, but this is absolutely the best there is in my opinion... Has made the process of grooming those areas easier and more effortless than ever. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> works as advertised...reliable....</li>
    <li> This one seems to be sturdier and cut the hairs better than others I have bought. I like the vacuum feature and it seemed impossible to cut myself with it.</li>
    <li> It is much better than other nose trimmers. No mess and easy to clean. We will see how long battery lasts.</li>
    <li> WORKS JUST LIKE IT SHOULD</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer, works as promised, easy to clean and I like the caring case, nice design, easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I am quite disappointed in this unit. All the other features deliver on promises except the cutting efficiency. It does not efficiently or quickly cut nose hairs, you must spend time trying to get at all of them. Does not also do a good job on ears, you need a unit with a safety type blade that will cut close to the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price.  I will soon be buying another.  I was just a little rough cleaning it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long and have used it once but it cuts very well and definitely shorter than is necessary for comfort.  People on here are complaining about their nose hair not being completely removed.  Well, that&#x27;s ridiculous because some nose hair is definitely desirable to boost the immune system.  Anyways, for the price and the performance, this is a great buy.  However, I haven&#x27;t had it long, so I&#x27;m unsure of the maintenance aspect or if the blades wear out quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my third trimmer due to the blades always seem to dull fast and when they start pulling instead of cutting yeh infection sets in and thats not a good thing! so I figured I would give another model a try. My last model was Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer It lasted about 3 months before the blade was pretty much useless. Just saying just in case anyone is looking at those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At anyrate. everything is great with this one so far time will tell how it holds up! Intial reaction is its a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great in trimming nose, ear hair, as well as cleaning up small areas around face and neck.  This is more durable than the other brands.</li>
    <li> I smarted and my eyelids fluttered fast as the blades tickled and hacked the vile hair to bits. While this is a good and powerful trimmer, you better be careful because this can seriously inflict a cut inside if you try ground your roots too much. Leave some of the lawn alone! I bled for half an hour mildly. Felt like a lawsuit moment for a bit but gave it up as i love panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good trimmer with a nice vacuum so that&#x27;s a big relief. Good suction and nice grooming tool. Groovy groomin&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other con with it is that its got a fat head so you&#x27;ll have to shove it inside your nostril. Might need Rhinoplasty after twenty years of use(yes Nose hair is here to stay and gets worse with age) if the trimmer head is this fat. It&#x27;s like inserting a walking stick handle inside your stril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for utility value. 1 star removed for being too thick.</li>
    <li> Such a simple way to make a good impression on someone.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you keep your nose hairs trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;This Trimmer works, keeps my nose hairs trimmed, and sucks up the trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Clean, Easy to Use.&lt;br /&gt;Works Great</li>
    <li> I have tried several nose hair trimmers over the years to tame that jungle, but this is one that actually works</li>
    <li> Hubby likes this as it vacuums as it removes hair.  No more sneezing. Would recommend to any one else having this problem.</li>
    <li> this machine gets a little loud but it is good at taking care of the hairs that you want to get rid off. Can be rinsed with water is a plus. The cap has a small mirror, another plus as you can use it in a pinch. Batteries last long. Recommended.</li>
    <li> For the money! My husband loves his, so we got one for a friend. He loves it, too. Great trimmer.</li>
    <li> comes with a carrying case. dos the job and does not vibrate as much as another one i had</li>
    <li> Good product so far. only one I can compare to is Sharper Image product.  Would like this product better if it were rechargeable.</li>
    <li> This is a must! This product does what it says. I have used others from Sharper Image and they just didn&#x27;t cut it like this does. It&#x27;s very easy to use and will remove those stubborn hairs in the nose and ears without any problem at all. Very easy to clean and easy battery change. It comes with its own velvet storage bag and even has a mirrored cap to allow you to see when using this. The built-in vacuum makes it a \\&quot;no mess\\&quot; way of taking care of sucking up all the hairs this unit cuts. You will be amazed as to how well this product works compared to others on the market. Well worth the money spent!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loves it. It works great and he hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Compact, efficient, and functional.  Also seems to be good at prolonged battery life.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product to friends. The ease of it use and function as well. Small and convenient for travel</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  The first one still works after three years, but has become a little dull.  It is very safe to use, and the vacuum function is very good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my now dead Sharper Image model, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried at first about the smaller (AA) battery, but the trimmer works great. There is little to no irritation from the cutting, and the vacuum does a nice job of collecting almost all of the hair it trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel cast it comes with is functional.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works very well. Too be honest I thought it was going to be cheaply made for the price, however it is very sturdy and gets the job done nicely!</li>
    <li> Like this trimmer especally the vacum feature.yes I would give this a 5 star rating and recomend it to a friend looking for same item too&#x27;</li>
    <li> Good product, it works in a pinch without pinching you. The gadget works. I bought it and it comes in handy. As far as the seller goes. You batting 100.</li>
    <li> The 3rd time I used it, the power button broke off. Still works, but the button is held in by poor craftsmanship.. No other issues with it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased. I found that this product does as advertised. Very pleased and I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great, does not pull on hairs and is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This product works really well.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is far better than than my first one. It is fast and doesn&#x27;t pull hair as it cuts.</li>
    <li> It does what I needed it to do - I recommend it to anyone who is looking to trim their nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had a different Panasonic one previously that broke, but I like that this one comes with a velvety case. The mirror on the cap was an added bonus I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but it proved to be useful.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband and he just loves it!!! that is all I can say  - does a great job</li>
    <li> It does not clean your nose completely.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this trimmer - it uses a single AA battery and I was really worried that it wouldn&#x27;t have the required power or shelf life.  My previous trimmer was from Sharper Image and required 2 C batteries.  But this Panasonic trimmer worked just as well and is a lot smaller and lighter.  The case is a nice touch and fits the trimmer well.  Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased.</li>
    <li> Find this handy when in a hurry.  Not a real close job, but it works well enough enough. Like the little bag.</li>
    <li> I had nothing but good luck with these nose trimmers They simply do the job. They cut very close and don&#x27;t pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is a God sin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to</li>
    <li> works very well. the fresh breeze tickles my nose.</li>
    <li> Used this trimmer as soon as received, and it definitely did the job very efficiently, trimming nose hair to the max....  Excellent!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts fast with no pulling&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none</li>
    <li> Very pleased, would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two other trimmers and by far, this one is the best. It has good power and very sharp blades.  I rarely miss any hairs. I love that the cap has a built in mirror so I can see what I am doing. And I love the vacuum feature to remove the cut hairs from the nostrils. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it has no light--my previous Panasonic lasted over 10 years and did have a light which made it handy.  The new clipper does have a vacuum so you don&#x27;t get all the loose hairs.  It appears to have more power than my previous clipper.</li>
    <li> Got real noisy. So noisy, that I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for the last three years and it finally fell apart, so my decision to replace it with the same unit was a given, great hair remover and the best thing it has a two year warranty.</li>
    <li> This is the third one that I&#x27;ve tried.  Ordered and returned 2 of the ER415, that were AWFUL.  Have reviewed them already, but to sum it up: they were underpowered; appeared to have a electronic short; didn&#x27;t cut well; and, hurt.&lt;br /&gt;This one was/is a very pleasant surprise.  Has plenty of power and cuts nicely.  Time will tell as to how reliable it will be, but out of the box it works great and I love it (which I cannot say about the previous 2).</li>
    <li> This product works good, however, there are no replacement parts available for it.  You have to purchase an entire replacement unit when the blade wears out.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Panasonic Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vacuum Cleaning System (ER430K) for my hubby. Trimmer is operated with one AA-Battery and the vacuum feature is great because he is no longer leaving a mess for me on the bathroom counter…After he used it for the first time, he commented on the how light the trimmer is…How he no longer dreaded trimming because this particular trimmer does not pull…Also, how easy it was to clean the vacuum compartment and the fact that he can use it wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent device.</li>
    <li> It was a gift, but he seems quite pleased with it so far. Apparently there is even a little mirror on the lid.</li>
    <li> Holy cow!!  No more embarrassing nose hairs creeping thru your nose.  This unit really cleans you up.  No discomfort or pulling of hairs.</li>
    <li> Good And Quality Hair trimmer. Gets the job done with minimal fuss.&lt;br /&gt;Love the panasonic products.</li>
    <li> This thing works so good that I keep one at work and I have even given them as gifts. \\&quot;Keep your nose clean\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I use the Panasonic ER430K for those pesky little facial hairs that we women begin to see in our later years. :(  It works great for facial hair removal.  It&#x27;s compact and the battery seems to allow for many uses between changing.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best Ear and nose hair remover so far. I bought one and then I gifted it to my Dad. I bought the same again. I am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good quality as are all Panasonic products.  Replaced old one, poor quality, different brand I had received as a gift. Very satisfied with this product.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Trimmer works very well,seller ships fast.</li>
    <li> Best one I have used. Absolutely NO pulling. Now I&#x27;m not dreading trimming nose hairs which can be real painful with a poorly made trimmer. This is definitely the go-to trimmer.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know why hair grows out of your ears or nose but if you use this everyday both will have a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Works excellent! Does not clog up like other trimmers! I love how it is waterproof, so that I can wash and clean it after each use!</li>
    <li> I have long been in that age group of men when I lose hair where I want hair,and get hair where I don&#x27;t want hair.  This is, by far, the best at removing nose hair trimmer I have ever purchased, and I have several in my possession.  What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;And, the price is right.  Thanks to Amazon for carrying this product.  I ordered on June 24, I believe.  Fast service.</li>
    <li> Great value. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my nose and eyebrows and hair. It works well for the nose and ears. It will cut your eyebrows and hair but it takes a while and it is not designed for these functions. I would not recommend these. I had a different one for 7 years that had a couple of different heads and that worked great. Unfortunately the power cord broke .</li>
    <li> excellent - easy to use and confortable</li>
    <li> I like the heavier feel to it than some of the other products out there.  It&#x27;s kind of like a putter in golf; if your tool is very light, it can be harder to get a feel of what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a vacuum feature that I don&#x27;t think is all that.  I have a lot more cut hairs left in my nose than in the filter.  (I also recommend using a nasal rinse to get all the cut hairs out after using any nose hair trimmer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is very nice.  I haven&#x27;t used the mirror yet, but I&#x27;m not sure how useful it can be, as it is very small, and I use my bathroom mirror to see if I have any more hair sticking out as my ultimate test of whether I am done or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I like this a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nose trimmer.  It works nice to get unwanted hair out of my nose and ears.  It appears well built and I expect it too last for a good long time.  I&#x27;ve had good experiences with Panasonic products and hope this is no different.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from the vacuum part of this trimmer but it does work well.  I have not noticed any hair over the sink so I guess it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> This looks nice and feels good in the hand, but only functioned reliably for a month or so. I hardly used it more than twice in a month, but by the fourth month it simply stopped working. Now before this, I had one that cost less than $3, and it lasted me more than four years. I am extremely disappointed. It lasted long enough to avoid a return.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I trim my brows with it.</li>
    <li> After many hair trimmers over the past decades, this one is by far the best.  My wife trims my ears about once a week and is constantly amazed at how much better this one performs.</li>
    <li> Quite a battery hog for such a small unit but it gets the job done FAST .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very , very careful when using it on any section of your face and ESPECIALLY in the upper section of the nostril , IT  IS SHARP !!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion : worth the money  go for it .</li>
    <li> Ordered it for hubby...he feels like it works better than his old one so not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Had mine for many years. Followed the instructions to a T on how to clean it and finally one day it crapped out on me and wouldn&#x27;t cut a damn thing. It was almost like the blade was no longer sharp. Thought about buying another but I went with a more reputable brand that did more in less time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Wonderful. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO REMOVE UNWANTED HAIR GROWTH IN MY NOSE. DOES THE JOB.</li>
    <li> Great for the nosehairs. Love it.</li>
    <li> Motor burned out within two months. Worked good while it last.</li>
    <li> Surprising very good compared to the half dozen or so I bought in the past. This is definitly the best nose/ ear trimmer I have ever bought..... And no nasty nose hairs falling anywhere because of the vacuum feature. Wish it was rechargable instead of running on a battery.</li>
    <li> Performs better than I anticipated. Nice work.</li>
    <li> cheap and feel cheap but does the job.</li>
    <li> Wow. What a difference from the nose-hair clipper attachment on my beard trimmer...This one does the job incredibly quickly and thoroughly. I had poked around endlessly with the clipper attachment trying to get at all the target hairs. This device immediately mowed down everything in its path, right down to the skin, without any irritation except some mild tickling. Nice solid build and pleasant carrying case too.</li>
    <li> My first time using anything like it, and it works great! It also tickles quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Trims nose hair very well with no pulling / pinching.  Easy clean-up.  I don&#x27;t know, but this works much better / faster than other similar tools I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Quiet noise level - so quiet I can trim my wife&#x27;s nose hair without her even waking up. I&#x27;m kidding - no nose hair on my wife. Good nose trimmer - cuts the hair without it feeling like it&#x27;s tearing the hair out. My 14 year old son has used it too for getting rid of his peach fuzz blond &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; that pops up from time to time.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Just what I needed</li>
    <li> I am fully satisfied in that it doesn&#x27;t hurt like plucking does, it vacuums the hair so I don&#x27;t get that uncomfortable feeling after, and it&#x27;s compact enough to take on the road if need be. Batteries not included.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more disgusting than a guy who has nose hair and ear hair sticking out.  He&#x27;d been using a cheap model I&#x27;m sure he had for over a decade, so when I bought him this higher end unit, he was hesitant to try it.  &amp;#34;Mine is perfectly good&amp;#34; he said.  Finally he &amp;#34;accidentally lost&amp;#34; his old one and had to use the one I got him.  He loves it.  He no longer looks like a Hobbit and his nose hair and ear hair issue has been tamed.  Now to tame the crazy brows ;-)</li>
    <li> This works so good and I love it because it doesnt pull or snag hairs! It is easy to use and clean!</li>
    <li> This uses a AA battery instead of AAA battery, so it&#x27;s much more powerful than my previous trimmers.  It&#x27;s not the best in cutting longer (quarter inch) hairs because it&#x27;s a circular head and the hair must go down into the blades.  But it&#x27;s still the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried pulling hair out with tweezers.  Not only is there a 50% hit rate, but when you do, OW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose runs, eyes tear up, and I say to myself, \\&quot;walruses look cool, so I do too.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, no.  Nose hair doesn&#x27;t get the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this product gets the nose and ear hair.  So maybe now, I&#x27;ll get the ladies who were once afraid of my unibrownostril growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it has replaceable batteries.  Trust me, proprietary batteries that are \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; suck.</li>
    <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s a trimmer, it works.  Looks nice, comes with a nice case.  The vacuum function is interesting, seems to keep things a little cleaner, but do get an occasional mild tugging.  Overall, it works well, looks nice, and keeps thing clean.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband of course.  He says it works great and much better than the old one he had been using for years.</li>
    <li> perfect of what i expected. so i will recommand for hair dresser too. will be the right idem for saloon or home</li>
    <li> I needed to get something to combat &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;.  This unit really fit the bill.  It does a great job of cleaning up that annoying hair that you just can&#x27;t shave.  I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now and it does all it said it would.  I&#x27;d recommend this to people.</li>
    <li> Everything seemed good the first time I used this trimmer, but then it started tugging after the first use--I&#x27;ve given up on it.</li>
    <li> This was my second attempt at finding a nose hair trimmer that works.  It does not cut well and after only a few months it seems as if the blades need replacing.  I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Love this device it&#x27;s very precise for those pesky nose hairs and unibrows.  It will also get random hairs that get left behind after shaving.  This is recommended for any guy with pesky facial hairs.</li>
    <li> Significant upgrade over my previous trimmer.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This thing does it&#x27;s job well, but it chews through batteries like a wood chipper eats branches.  I used this 4 times and had to change the batteries (Stone cold dead), which is going to get annoying quick.</li>
    <li> gave this as a Christmas gift and used it twice so far. It cuts well and does the job. Hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Really good! I love it. Even better than my previous bought Panasonic GN30.</li>
    <li> It has made the annoying trimming of needless hair of the nostrils and ears. I guess the vacuum feature works...but that seems too high tech for me.&lt;br /&gt;It makes the job quick and easy. Good enough for me...</li>
    <li> The trimmer sounds like it is running on a weak battery constantly even though I used a new one. However. after going over a spot a few times it gets the job done. For the money I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Well now that I&#x27;m getting older and hair is growing in places that I never thought they would grow. This little trimmer is a great assistant for those hard to reach places. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and its holding up really nice.&lt;br /&gt;The case is ok and it function nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Sucks it all up, trims it all short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sucks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sucks, it sucks, it sucks like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more short hairs in the sink.  Okay, now this review is long enough.</li>
    <li> works well, makes it safe and simple.</li>
    <li> Nice vacuum suction so the hair doesn&#x27;t go all over the bathroom sink. cuts nicely to the skin with no pulling or cutting by accident. Nice product! Works as expected and better!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband as he recommended it as a gift. He liked it so much I purchased one for myself? Highly  recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is marvelous. I find it easy to use and it gives me a close trim of my ears and nose.  It&#x27;&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my very picky son and he loves it.  If it meets his standards it must be fabulous!!</li>
    <li> Finally a nose trimmer that works and is quiet. Excellent product. Nice close trim. Far better than any other trimmer I have tried.</li>
    <li> I replaced one of these that I bought for my husband a few years back -- it  works the best of any hair trimmer (nose particularly) that he has tried.</li>
    <li> I did not enjoy watching my boyfriend pluck his nose hairs with a tweezer!&lt;br /&gt;I got him this and now I&#x27;m no longer squirming at the sight of his nose hair trimming..!</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap. It broke wthin a month. Do not buy it! it is Waste of money.</li>
    <li> The best ear &amp; facial hair trimmer i used !</li>
    <li> I have had a few others that just didn&#x27;t seem to clip any nose/ear hairs.  This one does the job and I really like it.  I don&#x27;t like the way the cap comes off for cleaning, but other than that, it works very well, which is why it gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It works ery effective and easy to clean. It also works in both dry and wet conditions. I bought this for my dad and he is no longer use scissor to trim his noses.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, no problems whatsoever. Good product. Does what it says as marketed. Compact and easy to use package.</li>
    <li> After 15 months started pulling on hairs, making my eyes water. Opened it up and cleaned off the very tiny rotating blades, that made it clip well again. Just clean the blade every six months or so, scraping off the junk.  That will keep it trimming without pulling.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have used- It is versatile and effective. I have no complaints with this product and a new respect for Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This is a very good nose hair trimmer.  Have never had it pull a hair or nick any skin.  The only drawback I can see is that it is very difficult to clean out and sterilize.  It has suction to pull hairs into the receptacle, but says you can&#x27;t submerge the product in water.  Cleaning out the hair in the catch chamber is difficult.  Maybe I just didn&#x27;t read the manual well enough?</li>
    <li> Got it from another site. It works great easy to use and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing the mirror on the clip has a peel here sticker. But if the mirror is funny looking after you peel it. Fell it mine had a clear sticker on top of it. I used my finger nail and removed and it and the mirror is nice and clear.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t come any better...awesome closeness and no hair &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; very sharp and easy to use...you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up from a middle-aged husband who found facial orifice hair growing faster than he would like!  He said it worked, was mess-free, and painless.  He had purchased a different trimmer from one of those high-end gadget stores you find at the mall.  He did not like that one because he said it \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; on the hairs and didn&#x27;t want to even try another brand.  I bought him the Panasonic one anyway, and he said it works great!  Hurray!</li>
    <li> So, I had this jungle growing out of my nose. The vines had become so long that little monkeys and such would start swinging from one to another. Tarzan took Jane for a ride on my nose hairs. Guinness called. I tried plucking them, but, OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ex-wife once bought me a nose-hair trimmer for my birthday. Yeah. Thanks, ho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my current wife was afraid to buy me one. But I persisted and persisted (hey, why should I buy one for myself? That would be too much work)! So she bought me this one off of Amazon. And WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my old one, I would have to blow my nose for quite a while to get all the stupid little hairs out. I never got the majority, though, and they caused horrendous sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Panasonic ER430K. Now, we&#x27;re talking. The Vacuum system is exactly what I needed. Not only does it eliminate your jungle, but it will vacuum the hair out as it&#x27;s cutting so that you don&#x27;t have all the follow up work and sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more do I need to say? I carry it in my glove box so that I can use it on my way to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Tarzan. No play here.</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend it perfect for the job works great will buy more as gifts for my friends and family</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several trimmer devices.  This one is the clear winner!  The vacuum feature alone is fantastic but, this one really gets in there and actually trims things up.  Love it!  If I had to, um, snub my nose at one detail, it would be that I wish it was able to be plugged in.</li>
    <li> This little beauty makes nose and ear hair trimming a piece of cake. It&#x27;s very well-designed and the blade spins very fast which reduces nicks. I owned a previous model of the trimmer but the ER430K is vastly improved. Just keep those batteries fresh and it works awesome.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Just use a set of scissors and save you money</li>
    <li> My husband wanted this item. It has been very handy for him to have. He liked the smooth cutting action. However, the vaccuum for collecting clippings did not pick up very much. He still thinks it is a very worthwhile tool.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do, seems like it would work better if it was a little longer. Will only be using this for nose and ear hair. I can&#x27;t see how it could be easily used for other body hair as the instructions talk about. Bought another product for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Keeps my nose hair trimmed and the trimming out of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that this has the vacuum function built in.  I was using another base model rotary trimmer and this is a big step in the right direction.  Before I would need to get a q-tip and a tissue and try to muck out my nostrils immediately after trimming.  Now I can use a tissue and blow my nose and I don&#x27;t see much hair at all.  Great piece for the price.</li>
    <li> I am plesaed with this shaver.  It has a carrying case.  The shaver is very powerful and works very well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works far better than any of the other brands I have tried on my hubbies VERY hairy ears. Clean up is alot nicer with the vacuum feature.</li>
    <li> A disappointing replacement of an earlier excellent product.  It is bulky, cumbersome and weighs about twice what my first trimmer weighed.  The cutting blade doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well.  I cannot recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Had a Panasonic before this one. Works great. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I am a man in sore need of Noise trimmers at times, being blessed with mighty body hair, so when I saw this and the reviews I had plunked down my money and have to say: it works! It&#x27;s very tidy and clean in it&#x27;s working and very straight forward in cleaning and maintaining, though I will make a mention of this: I don&#x27;t if it&#x27;s the power it uses, or the vacuum itself, but the sucker does vibrate a lot, enough that it will tickle your nose a bit as you use it. This lead me to a bit of a sneezing fit the first I used it, and maybe your nose isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine, but thats the one drawback. After a few uses now I have gotten used to it, and continue to use it for trimming. It work great, and it&#x27;s great not to have blow the hairs out like I used to. It&#x27;s also great entertainment for my wife, as she sits and laughs at me, laughing at it, tickling my nose, so the entertainment value is high.</li>
    <li> Best I have used so far, I only wish they were rechargeable, but even so they work great.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better then this device. I loved it from the first time I used. Very easy to hold and reach any place you need to.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I hoped for. I need to spend much more time removing hair than I expected.</li>
    <li> As one gets older, hairs on your body change.  Some get grey/white and begin to grow faster and more brittle.  When they are in your nose, they make you want to keep a finger up there to deal with their near constant irritation.  Stick this baby up there, and the problem is solved.  No kidding, solved.</li>
    <li> I HAD ONE FROM THE IMAGE AND THE SHABIING HEAD CAN BE DIASSMBLED FOR CLEANIG&lt;br /&gt;AND THIS ONE IS HARD TO CLEAN</li>
    <li> This product is really great. I never used a nose hair trimmer before and it would hurt so bad every time I plucked a nose hair. Therefore, I decided to get this. This product not only gets the job done, but does it pretty well too. This product does not hurt at all when you are using it. It tickles a little when you are using it. It is nothing that you cannot stand though. No pain what so ever. It also leaves no mess and is really easy to clean. You can open it and it has different compartments and you can just easily wash it out. It is super simple. On top of that, it comes with a case to put your trimmer in to protect it. It is a really good investment for the price it is being offered at. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The noise level on this unit is horrible.  If I used it in my ear, I&#x27;d go deaf in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a website &amp;#34;Panasonic Sucks&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> Simply works as advertised. Hard to find a grooming device of this nature that works as it should.  This one does.</li>
    <li> Much better than other units I used that missed hairs. A few seconds gets the hairs with a need to mow over and over.</li>
    <li> Fantastic device, works extremely well. Great purchase</li>
    <li> It works. but its vac feature is weak. you have to wash your nose after using it. not bad product</li>
    <li> Guys, trust me, hairs growing out of your nose and/or ears are not features that endear you to others. Get this product, use it, and discover that more people find themselves willing to spend time in your immediate proximity without staring at your nose or ears.</li>
    <li> It is very well designed and cuts difficult nose hairs better than others I have used. I like the carrying case. The cover would be better designed if it snapped in place.</li>
    <li> Great PRODUCT.  Does all functions well.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my boyfriend, and he loves it!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas Gift. He loves it. Nice quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> Works great! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just received this today and I love it.  I used it for both my nose hairs and to trim stray eyebrow hair and it worked great.  The vacuum feature seemed to work well as there were no hairs left on the bathroom sink when I was finished.  I had lost my previous trimmers on a vacation and they were Panasonic as well.  I was very happy with them as I had had them for about 5 years and they still worked great and that is why I chose to go with Panasonic again.  It looks like I made the right choice.</li>
    <li> perfect little device</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I&#x27;ve had several others that all left hairs inside my nostrils, which then caused irritation. The little vacuum inside this is great for taking all of that out and not leaving any mess. Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought it on December 2012,  and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this trimmer, still going on, and I didn&#x27;t have any kind of problems or issues with it, if you are interested in buying this do not hesitate, this unit is inexpensive, with a very lasting battery life ( I use a AA rechargeable battery, and I can&#x27;t  remember when was the last time that I have to recharge it), portable if you need it (never tried to pass it through the airport checkpoints,though so I&#x27;m not sure if it is allowed), and the most import part for me: is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim my nose hair, and does what supposed to do, about facial hair I never tried but I will  so I can provide a better review,  bottom line: you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to shape your beard and mustache, it will work, but I don&#x27;t think is the best tool for that.</li>
    <li> They say there&#x27;s always a better mouse trap, but it&#x27;s hard to see how this trimmer could be any better than it already is. I&#x27;ve owned several knock-off brands that fell apart after only a few uses — with their flimsy battery compartment and/or trimmer nozzle twist-caps coming off during use, right out of the box. The Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Ear, Nose &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer is solid in every of the word. It even cleans up after itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read in some review prior to my purchase that it cannot be used with a rechargeable battery, and I found that to be patently false. I also verified with Panasonic that there is no such disclaimer on this product. I use my Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Ear, Nose &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer exclusively with a Duracell Rechargeable AA/HR6/DX1500 NiMH (1.2V/2000 mAh) battery and have had absolutely no problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Maybe because I am upgrading from a trimmer that is over 5 years old, but I think the Panasonic ER430K does a great job.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One of the better trimmers I&#x27;ve tried, out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good design, but time will tell with these devices.&lt;br /&gt;its all about how long they last...</li>
    <li> This is a great product to have when you have a lot of nose hair. The best thing about it is the vacuum that sucks up all the hair so that you do not sneeze. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to trim their nose hair!</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is a gem. Seems to be well made&lt;br /&gt;and gets the job done with no fuss or bother.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several nose trimmers over the years. This is by far the worst.  I have to spend over 30 min to get the job done.  When I get close it starts irritate the inside of my nose. Very dangers piece of junk</li>
    <li> A big improvement on the little blunt nose shears i have been using for years.  Has not hurt me yet.  I especially like to use it in my ears. The screen needs more frequent cleaning than I expected but it is fast and easy to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he received some derogatory comments about  his nose hair from our grand daughter, whose small stature requires looking up his nose when she wants to talk to him. Anyway, this product received good reviews,so I bought it.  How good can it be if you can&#x27;t even turn it on? Major lemon. Had to return it</li>
    <li> I like it because it is easy to use, long battery life.  looks good.. I have bought several other of their products.</li>
    <li> This is so wonderful to use. The ease in cutting nose &amp; ear hairs makes this cutter the best I&#x27;ve every bought. This is a super product for the money. The carrying case makes it easy to store. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer for a year and a half.  Have never had to change the batteries and it does it job fantastic.  I am very happy with this trimmer (I only use it to trim my nose hairs)</li>
    <li> This thing mows down nose hair like a diesel powered combine.  Incredible.  The vacuum function works very well too, so you&#x27;re not leaving a bale of nose hair trimmings everywhere.  Cleans up the ear hair well too, and the touch up needed around the brows sometimes.  Excellent on the batteries, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and still haven&#x27;t replaced the batteries. Cleanup is simple and easy.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that I could trim my nose hairs without it feeling like an angry two year old was ripping the hairs our with a tweezers! This device is so smooth and gets the job done incredibly fast. I love it!</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but it works! It doesn&#x27;t really vacuum very well...</li>
    <li> works well... very happy</li>
    <li> Sure beats using sizzors</li>
    <li> great product, really works well in the nose, ears, even stray eyebrows - cuts the little hairs without any pain and is easy to clean.  Just needs one  little battery!</li>
    <li> Works as good as most trimmers, not significantly be ether than anything lease I&#x27;ve tried.  The larger handle does make it easier to hold and rotate in your hand.</li>
    <li> GOt this as a gift, Service was great and the person I gave it to loved it</li>
    <li> This works like no other I have ever tried. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Best personal hair trimmer I&#x27;ve found so far! I&#x27;ve seriously been through about twenty personal hair trimmers in my day, either purchased or given to me as gifts. This one has been the best to date and was also reasonably priced. I really like the fact that it&#x27;s basically waterproof and you&#x27;re encouraged by the manufacturer to clean it under running water. Panasonic&#x27;s &amp;#34;Super Duper Hyper Viper Blade&amp;#34; system does indeed seem to give a much better trim than any of my past models. The little elongated mirror on the side of the unit is crap, and the little cute case that comes with it is just fluff, but the units functionality is good and I&#x27;ve used it a lot. ME CAveMan!</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Very high-speed motor and extra sharp blades trim everything in their path.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This tool works great. Perfect for once a week trimming. Strong and get the job done</li>
    <li> Both my sons love this as a gift.  Very effective and good quality.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this unit. It does its job and cleans up after itself in a highly satisfactory way. My only issue is with replacement blades. I bought this in 2009 and now in 2014 am thinking it might need a replacement blade. All suppliers of the replacement blade including Panasonic&#x27;s web site want $20 incl s&amp;h for the blade parts. A $22 trimmer with a $20 blade? On further research, I found out that the Panasonic ER-GN30-K uses the same blade and is listed here for $12.50. (That&#x27;s right, its a $12 trimmer with a $20 blade.) So i ordered that and plan on using its blade as my replacement. As a deranged engineer I will be holding on to the rest of the new trimmer in hopes that i can use it to further my goal of world conquest. More on that later...</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace another trimmer that had the battery compartment break when tightened.  This looks much sturdier.  The vacuum takes away the metallic smell.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this for my dad but had to return because he already has this one, he wanted another one with multi funtons and removable heads, but he said this one works just fine as a ear and nose trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband had a different type of trimmer but he hated it because all it did was rip the hair out.  He requested a new trimmer and I found this one.  It works great!  He says it  doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs ever, it has a nice clean cut and it&#x27;s super easy to use.  It&#x27;s not overly loud, has the vacuum feature that keeps the hairs clear of the area being shaved.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and can be used in the shower even.  And it comes with a cover to protect the cutting tip and has it&#x27;s own carrying bag for storage making it easy to travel with too.  Overall, a great trimmer for the price!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this!</li>
    <li> Work well. Love it. nostril still itchy but different problem</li>
    <li> This thing  just works well. As a first time owner who struggled with using scissors and other means to deal with extra hair, this thing is a pleasant surprise. tI didn&#x27;t realize I missed it until I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, safe, quiet, clean, easy to use. Not much more to say.</li>
    <li> This was a gift my husband had requested and so far so good! I really like the vacuum feature-no mess.</li>
    <li> got tired of other brands that where junk. try this one and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Very good love it. Made very well best one I have ever seen.  Trims well. And quality is very good. Love it. And actually vacuums the hairs. Great trimmer. Nothing bad to say about this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Hard to say much other than it works really well.  It spins very fast, causes no pain...though the speed and vibration cause a tickle for me.</li>
    <li> This product works fantastic and is exactly the product ordered. It is my first Nose trimmer and feels a little weird, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Whenever I used other trimmers I would end up inhaling cut nostril hairs which would sometimes go down my throat.  The vacuum on this trimmer keeps that from happening.  Cleanup is a snap since you can rinse it out under the tap. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Not as good as previous  Panasonic  nose,ear trimmer that finally  gave up after 5 yrs.  Doesn&#x27;t cut as close and motor runs at erratic speeds. Sometimes it runs fast and all of a sudden speed drops to an almost stop, then speeds up again. very annoying .</li>
    <li> Excellent. i have no complains what so ever about the product. The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Great Product... Fast Shipping...</li>
    <li> Gave this as a surprise Christmas gift to a female friend who often complained about those personal nasty little maintenance issues woman need to take care of.  She was tired of all the plucking.  She LOVES this and said it was her favorite gift!  Item packaged nicely.  Personally speaking, it&#x27;s the gift every woman would want but is too embarrassed to ask for.</li>
    <li> Absolutely outstanding!  I could not be happier with this item!  Incredible value for the bucks!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Don&#x27;t buy the smaller version</li>
    <li> Struggled for years using scissors around nose hair and makes it painful and never gives good a good clean feeling. Found this while browsing for a Panasonic Shaver on amazon and wonder why I didn’t think of this before – makes the experience so painless, easy to use and leaves you feeling clean around the nose. It cuts hair fine and leaves no residue. No more scissors for me. Good investment. Have to see how long the battery lasts but for the cost – this is a great investment on personal hygiene. I even tested it on my eye brows and ears and it does a wonderful job – cut the hair fine around these sensitive parts.</li>
    <li> This grooming tool works as it should first time and every time. I find itr quite versatile and I use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> It works like it should. Did not break after a few uses out of it.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to use. Good to trim my nose hair! Better than the manual one, which always hurts my nose.</li>
    <li> I had an old Panasonic trimmer that was fading.  I bought another brand that needed to be recharged.  Worked good, but the charging is a hassle.  I lost my luggage and that was in it.  So I bought this one.  Works fine and uses batteries.  I like that better.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have used.  Over the years I have tried a number of products...all of which worked, but always just OK.  This thing is crazy powerful (not painful) and works FANTASTIC.  Like a high end weed eater for your nose/ears.  :)  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it especially the vacuum feature and it shaves my nose hair accurately and precisely. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was used to others that really pulled and hurt. He loves it. Great value.</li>
    <li> Have tried different trimmers some of which fell into disrepair quickly.This one seems to work well and appears to be well made.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does. Easy operation, trims well, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, and easy to clean.  I have only had this for a couple months so cannot comment on its durability just yet but it looks like it is a well built. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Good item!fast shiping!I like it!amazing！High quality！</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product, the main complaint was that quite a few people had the same issue - that it stopped working soon after purchase.  This happened no matter if the product was taken care of or ignored.  But there were plenty of people that didn&#x27;t have the issue and it worked fine.  Well, I bought it and here I am 6 months later with a product that has stopped working.  For the first six months, it worked great.  No complaints.  Then, it just stopped.  I changed the battery and nothing happened.  I tried it again a day later, nothing. I cleaned it head to toe, nothing.  I guess Panasonic should stick to electronics.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> If you are not skilled to cut your hair with this type of instrument, you are going to be like &amp;#34; Aht... Aya... Aht... Aya... Aht... Aya... &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric trimmers and this one is the best value and cuts efficiently.  I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> terrific item.  works really well.</li>
    <li> What can I say except this is the one Nose, Ear and Facial Hair remover. Never bogs down and never has it pulled. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works great. Much better than others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have owned several of these trimmer. Most of them did a mediocre job. Usually because they were under powered. This one has the power! Panasonic probably put a stronger motor in this one due to the vacuum feature, which by the way is worthless. It&#x27;s big, but manageable and it feels good in your hand. It does a great job even with thick hair.</li>
    <li> This little thing has lasted me for quite some time. I have never had a problem with it and the battery life is pretty excellent. I like that there&#x27;s a bit of a vacuum to it so you don&#x27;t have hair flying around all over the place. Not that I have some giant hairy nose but I can imagine some falling in the sink like when you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
    <li> works great! it totally disappeared my other half&#x27;s crazy nose hair. one for the record books.</li>
    <li> Like this one after failures with several others.</li>
    <li> This thing does what it is intended to do. It can&#x27;t be any simpler.</li>
    <li> This works surprisingly well. I had my doubts when ordering but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband and he loves it.  It does tickle when used in the nose but works as expected.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  It works all the time, powerful and well built.  Good design, and lasts a long time on a battery.  Packs well.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality unit.  I think it does a great job.  I wasnt sure if the vacuum feature (that sucks up the hair) was a gimmick... but it does work.  I recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> I found it to be too noisy in my ears.  It is quite loud and disturbing. I have stopped using it after a week, and have ordered another Panasonic product that I assume will be quieter.  I think that it is the vacuum system that is so loud. I like Panasonic products in general.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with how the trimmer performed.  However, after only a year IT BROKE.  I&#x27;ve bought $2.00 trimmers on (auction site) that lasted as long.  I would expect an item to last a lot longer if I&#x27;m spending ten times the price for it.</li>
    <li> Tried so many of these nose hair clippers, middling performance for many.This one seems to perform the best and the vacuum feature seems to work as designed so am pleased with this clipper so far.Robust construction,and also comes with a nice storage bag. The cutter head design has longer cutting slots and also protrudes further. Have not experienced any nasal hair pulling with this model either. Pleased with this purchase and Amazons Prime Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Works about the same as most rotary trimmers.  I do not notice that the vacuum function makes any difference in performance. It is easy to clean, and the carrying case is nicely made. I also purchased the Philips Norelco NT 9130 and find that it trims closer and is easier for me to use.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it and uses it (a lot)!</li>
    <li> Good shipping and this is my second one (a gift) and a great product</li>
    <li> it does its job, better tha the most expensive one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs.  Trims well and doesn&#x27;t make my nose/face itch with a bunch of loose hairs.  Battery lasts through uses.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time. Works great, fast delivery and service.</li>
    <li> Works fine but tickles the nose a little.  Just Joking!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Husband loves it. Gets into all the little areas.</li>
    <li> Love this, very easy to operate and clean!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I have tried many of these and this is probably one of the better ones. I am guarded in my praise because I have been disappointed before.</li>
    <li> Really, this item works excellently. It has a battery which is very nice; you do not need a charger and you can take it to Europe and nt worry about power issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for three months. Zero complaints or concerns.</li>
    <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer.  It does the job and it does not leave a mess.  They are comfortable and they work really well.  I would recommend these to anybody.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Finally, nose hair trimmers that actually work. My last pair of Panasonic trimmers (a different model) never worked unless you took the whole unit apart first - every time. No such problems with this model.</li>
    <li> Great product. The best one I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Really works.</li>
    <li> Very good but I have to use it often, I like the other style better I think but this is good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few over the years and this one is the best one that I&#x27;ve found. Sure there are more expensive models in the department stores, but their quality doesn&#x27;t match up to this Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Cuts very well. Quality construction.  Only complaint is that it is very noisy more than expected especially when using it around your ears.</li>
    <li> It felt cheap and didn&#x27;t work for me.  It ended up sitting in my closet until I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great. I am going to buy another one for my wife.</li>
    <li> A great improvement over prior trimmers.  I particularly like the vacuum system that captures all of the cut hairs into an easily emptied receptacle.</li>
    <li> Did all of the things it promised at a reasonable price.  I am sorry I need this product...but it works admirably.</li>
    <li> Best one I have EVER used.</li>
    <li> It is a good trimmer with an accepted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the battery does not last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the included bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Rodi</li>
    <li> Not only does the cutting trimmer work easily and cleanly but the unit retains all those nasty little hairs that stick to your clothes and skin.  Easy to use and easy to clean it is truly the best product out there for facial hair trimming.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than seeing somebody with long nose hairs, and there&#x27;s nothing worse than not having anything to cut them. Here is your answer!  This thing works very well and very easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> My nose is bald from the inside.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good for me or not but no more hairs sticking out my nose.  This thing has power to spare. Just stick it up your nose(you&#x27;ll have teary eyes from the vibration, you&#x27;ll know what I mean when you first use it) and whirl it around.  A minute later a bald nose.</li>
    <li> Very good and quality product. Works and looks great. I am very pleased that bought this product. Recommend to all.</li>
    <li> It is rare when you buy something that exceeds your expectations. I wanted a good trimmer and that is all. This trimmer works perfectly and did the job in seconds. I was amazed at how perfectly it removed all the hair and did it so fast. Really, it is kind of miraculous it worked so well!</li>
    <li> Best one I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Not worth it for 6 Months of Use...go with Conair. This is the one of the worst product that Panasonic ever made.</li>
    <li> Was a little leery of ordering a nose hair trimmer as I figured it would pull the hairs out rather than actually cut them,but seems to do a very good job</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s all those tight spaces</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Fails to work after a month or so--just after the return timing. I love Panasonic but this is clearly not their finest hour. I got this because I had a previous model from Panasonic that did great--not so with this one. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY POSITIVE REVIEWS. Total junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks great but the inside parts and components are clearly cut rate. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer, no complaints.</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised. Quiet, effective and a good design that fits the hand.&lt;br /&gt;The added case and cutting tip cover makes it a good buy.</li>
    <li> the suction is not strong but somehow helps</li>
    <li> I have owned other Panasonic nose, ear and facial hair trimmers that worked well. This top of the line trimmer simply does not cut ear hair Basically useless. Unfortunately the return window has expired.</li>
    <li> This is basically a chainsaw for the ear and nose trees. With a little built in vacuum and removable/ washable screen guard. Can also be used on facial hair (trimming or edging a mustache or beard). Excellent. Long battery life and perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> It does the job quite well.  As you get older, men, be aware -- you&#x27;ve got nose hair!</li>
    <li> Some of these will actually twist the hairs and jerk them out (ouch) but this one cuts cleanly.  Comfortable trim takes just a few minutes.  Travel case is cheaply made, but works..</li>
    <li> One year later after purchase, it started failing on me. The razor seems to be stuck or slowed down by something inside the mechanism and won&#x27;t rotate.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my dad. My husband has been using this since a long time and loves it. The packaging was great and it arrived on time too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad! He loves it so much!</li>
    <li> So far, this trimmer is the best that I have tried of 3, including a prior Panasonic.  It is very effective, it doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt, feels comfortable in my hand.  I am extremely pleased.  I will followup to see if it is reliable and durable.</li>
    <li> After looking at various trimmers, I researched and found this one - this is the best build quality &amp; features I have seen for a nose trimmer. Very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Seems like a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it seemed to work well (nose).  Note that it takes a single AA battery.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband , I would say it&#x27;s good but I think he didnt like  so much hahaha</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and he loves it.  Works as advertised and there are no fly away hairs thanks to the vacuuming system.  Perfect and practical.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Does the job as expected safely and quickly.</li>
    <li> Product  Is  pretty good but does not cut hairs close enough for me.</li>
    <li> EL producto hace exactamente lo que dice, es de buena calidad y los resultados son apreciables a simple vista, el mantenimiento es super facil y el estuche con el que viene conveniente, recomiendo el producto.</li>
    <li> used once so far, meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to use and plainly it gets the job done</li>
    <li> I received the trimmer today.  It came in an easy cardboard container to open, and what you get is the trimmer, and a black felt bag for I guess if you travel, or if you choose to store it in the bag when at home.  You also need to have a AA battery to insert. In order to insert the battery, the instructions says to turn counterclockwise and match the line A with B, and pull to open.  Course, with me being literal, I tried to find the letter A and B to match it up but couldn&#x27;t.  There is no A or B.  A is a not so noticeable line on the bottom &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; part of the trimmer.  It&#x27;s on the little &amp;#34;spoke&amp;#34; next to the screw (but you don&#x27;t unscrew it).  B is the battery cap that has the Model Number, and on the cap, is an arrow that points to a &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34;.  The &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; is B, so you line up the DOT with the line on the spoke, and then you pull.  Doing a few times you don&#x27;t even need to look.  And it is hard to see so make sure you have some light and/reading glasses (if you need it) but again, once you do it one time, it&#x27;s so easy to remove and replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, reading the instructions, to perform maintenance on it, you need to remove 5 separate things (including the cover) sot hat you can clean the outer blade and inner blade, and filter.  The last item is the housing for the outer blade. Besides blowing to remove the hair, it says to use a soft tissue and gently wipe the blades and it says it can be washed in water.  Course I don&#x27;t know if its totally waterproof so I would take out the battery just in case if you were to go that route.  It also says if used once a week, for 1 min, the blade should last 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, I was a little nervous about taking each item apart to clean as I think I might not be able to put them together again. I tried couple of times and again, after a while, it should be easy to maintain. The instructions are pretty clear on how the separate pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, the first time I used it to remove the nose hair, I gotta say, it sure tickled. Not sure if I will ever get use to the feeling vs using scissors, but like anything, eventually you&#x27;ll get use to it....maybe  LOL  It seems to be made good quality wise so if anything changes, I&#x27;ll do an update.</li>
    <li> this is the best one I have found today. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;it is my first experience in using hair trimmer machine and really it is so good for me&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it for every man</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd unit but at this price who cares! They last about 6 months at a shot but the trim job they give is great. I&#x27;m very happy with the product performance... just wish it&#x27;d last a year.</li>
    <li> My nose hair is all gone now, I got a little carried away using this lol. Does as intended.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly - exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Works just fine. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Gets the gob done. Period.</li>
    <li> Got it for my BF... Quiet, nicely designed and most importantly, very sharp and cuts very well and fast. Great little storage pouch. Definitely beats the previous one he had of a different brand.</li>
    <li> This is a nice good quaity trimmer that trims your hair with a pretty good bit of precision.  They only upgrade I could think would be for it to have a rechargeable battery instead of needing the AA battery but that isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
    <li> I knew someday that someone would make a great Nose,Ear, facial hair trimmer and Panasonic did it with the ER430K.&lt;br /&gt;It was actually fun to use a product that works so well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be glad you took my advise.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This item can&#x27;t be beat for the price.  It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use, no pinching or pulling. Very good quality and comes in a nice case.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these to replace my Wahl trimmer, which has started making a weird grinding sound.  Talk about an upgrade!  One issue I had with the Wahl was that the cutting head was huge.  The head on the Panasonic is far more compact, fitting easily wherever I need it to go.  I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the motor on this one; paired with the dual edge blades, this trimmer does more, better, on the first use. After all that, the super effective vacuum action is just gravy!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and recipient was delighted. Blades are excellent. No danger of cuts.</li>
    <li> very quick delivery, works on 1 aa battery and it does the job very efficiently !!!I wish I had ordered this product years ago rather than waiting till my visit to the barber shop. highly recommend it you cant go wrong with it !!&lt;br /&gt; update march 2014 !!!&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer died down after few months ! I have tried everything but it woudnt work !! I went back and read customers reviews and I saw that numerous people have this problem with \\&quot;Panasonic\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;avoid this product and buy something else !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and this is the best one. It does exactly what you buy it for. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It turned out just as I expected.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried others and this is AMAZING. Worth every penny, and just what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this over the others.</li>
    <li> This really vacuums the nose hair as you trim them. The motor is also very strong. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.I had another Panasonic with a light attached to it and that one had a really weak motor plus the light it provided wasn&#x27;t any use. Get this trimmer. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Best one of these I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Quiet, fast, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Dad loves it first time he has had the vacuum and no pulling of nose hairs</li>
    <li> Nice grooming tool.  Well made.  Easy to use and seems to be safe when doing its job.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. The head keeps falling apart and won&#x27;t lock in place. Not worth the money. Not worth the Panasonic name.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND I LKE WHAT IT DOES.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is perfect for nose and ear hair.  The batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done with a bit of pulling discomfort. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know yet how effective it is in actually keeping the cut off hairs from getting into the ear canal. Purchased it at the direction of a hearing professional. Seem it bit difficult to clean but do not know for sure what to expect.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very convenient to use product.  Fits comfortably into the hand and seem very sharp doing a good job.</li>
    <li> Works well and is new in retail package.</li>
    <li> The vaccuum is extremely loud, but other than that it works ok.</li>
    <li> This more than met my expectations. It is exactly what I anticipated receiving and is very well made. Should the need arise I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Really great for the price. The travel case is a good plus to have. The best thing is that it sucks up the hair while using it. Still haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean it since I threw out the box and everything.</li>
    <li> works well - no pain... :)</li>
    <li> Trimmer arrived on time and works very well. I had a cheap trimmer which was next to worthless. This trimmer does a very good job and doesn&#x27;t seem to pose any problem with nicks or cuts in this sensitive area. It is very well made and should hopefully last a long time.</li>
    <li> Does a good job without pulling too much.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> It barely lasted a year, had a tendency to need to be hit on the counter to get it to start to work ... often went slowly at first, and now sputters if it works at all.</li>
    <li> The best nose hair trim.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t take out all the hair, it will itch for a week.&lt;br /&gt;This works fine to trim up the edges. Just trim the ends and you will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars? I fell like it could be a bitt better built, but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the Nose &amp; Facial trimmer, I thought, O No.....not another dud.  Was I surprised!!!  This little dynamo is just that. Now you see it, now you don&#x27;t.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Product worked just as described would highly recommend this trimmer and the price is very reasonable. Note it did not come with a battery.</li>
    <li> Great product - since it runs on AAA batteries there&#x27;s no need to worry about recharging. The vacuum eliminates mess and reduces the &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; sensation that all nose-hair trimmers give you. Easy to disassemble and clean - for sterilization I just use a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol on the trimming foil when I&#x27;m finished. All in all, this thing does its job and it does it well.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and he said it worked great.  Every now and then he just says again how much he likes it.</li>
    <li> A very good piece of machinery. The motor is strong and quiet. And once&lt;br /&gt;you angle the head correctly, it does a nice job of cutting in those tough to get places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good buy and so far very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works well for its intended purpose. Some tugging but overall is great for eliminating unwanted nose hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced the vacuum function does a whole lot. There are still usually more hairs left in my nose than in the little grille where they&#x27;re supposed to be caught.&lt;br /&gt;Still, this seems to be a bit higher quality than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used, so worth it anyway. (But none of these commodity products is built as solid and lasting as a shaver, for example.)</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ER430K Nose, Ear, And Facial Hair Trimmer arrived quickly and undamaged. It works well as advertised. I remove the tip and clean it with hot water after every use.</li>
    <li> Amazon offers a dizzying array of trimmers...I thought I had selected a rechargeable model but this takes a AA battery.  It also &amp;#34;vacuums,&#x27;&#x27; yet I&#x27;ve yet to discover where the hairs go...eventually, one would suspect it would need to be emptied?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may say Panasonic on the box, but this is Red China Panasonic, with nothing but cryptic instructions.  Considering I&#x27;ll use it once a month or so, I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.</li>
    <li> This unit has been a HUGE upgrade over my old trimmer.  It cuts nose hair like butter, and the vacuum feature does cut down on leftover hair bits up yer nose, but it&#x27;s not perfect, you&#x27;ll still need to do a little Kleenex digging to get them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to watch for- the cutter cuts upwards as well- which is a big help BUT..  if you shove it in too far it can catch fleshy bits and give you a painful pinch or small cut.  I found this out the hard way.  I suppose you don&#x27;t need to trim so far in anyways, but feeling how well the thing cut, I couldn&#x27;t resist trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy with water, and as with all electronics, water resistant or not, I always allow it to air dry disassembled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is a little annoying with that arm-  it&#x27;s not like it could clip to the pocket, so the arm is a mystery to me.  All it does is prevent it from going on within a 90 degree arc or so.  The case works if you plan to take it along on your travels.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a present and I think the person liked it.  my my my my my my my</li>
    <li> not sure if it was necessary to get the vacuum but I hate the thought of nose hairs everywhere so I guess it is fine.</li>
    <li> Best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve come across. Works well to get those hairs right at the edge of the nostril. Quiet by comparison.</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband - he says this is the best product</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking it was a great product. And it is - for about 20 days. The motor stopped working - and I tried changing the batteries a few times - and it never worked again. Won&#x27;t be purchasing this sort of thing again!</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine.  A little slow, however.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Great for the price and doesnt hurt or pull one bit.</li>
    <li> This works well and I like the vacuum feature. Works well for the nose and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The very best. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Works well without blood! :)</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I was looking for. Nice, high quality and works very well. I recomend.</li>
    <li> None of these trimmers is perfect.  This one is pretty good.</li>
    <li> good device , you can try one of this it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> This really works well.  It trims closely with no pull.  It is easy to clean under water.</li>
    <li> Vaccum? Where are the hairs collected? To me, this is a regular trimmer. My last Panasonic trimmer did not last long. Hopefully this will last much longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to trim my nose hair and it succeeds at the task. No bells or whistles, although I&#x27;m not really sure what sorta bells and whistles someone would be looking for in a nose hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It indicates that there&#x27;s some sort of vacuum system involved, so I figured I&#x27;d just trim up in front of the bathroom mirror at the sink and I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about cleanup. My wife&#x27;s subsequent question of &amp;#34;did you use that nose-hair trimmer in the bathroom? I can tell.&amp;#34; determined that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> Best Nose Trimmer on the Market..No sudden pulls on any hairs...speedy little blades...Does a nice job&lt;br /&gt;on Nose and Ears...even Eyebrow hairs that get a little long!</li>
    <li> Very effective facial hair trimmer.  The vacuum system works fine, taking care of most clippings.  However, for travel purposes, I think this model is a bit of a space hog for what it is.  I leave mine at home.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works very well, and is very sharp.  I had a Norelco version I purchased a while back, and it just did not do the job.  I really like that you are able to run it underwater to get it clean.  I would recommend this to anyone.  You cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> product worked as described  and performed well. Have used others remington etc  and this by far is the best performer.</li>
    <li> Great product that does exactly what it is supposed to do.  You do have to fuss with it a little when you first assemble it and then every time you need to empty the little chamber of its hairy contents, but you don&#x27;t have to empty it very often, and it&#x27;s only a minute or two at most to accomplish the process.  My other small complaint is that it is noisier than my last ear-and-nose trimmer, but that is probably because it has a more powerful motor.  The first battery I put in it a few months ago is still going strong, so it&#x27;s not a battery drainer like some little gadgets.  It doesn&#x27;t look like it could get all of an ear hair, but there is nothing to see after I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;mowed it&amp;#34; with this device, and that&#x27;s the bottom line.  This would make a great little gift for anyone who has the problem of unwanted ear and nose hairs.  Update 11/15/16:  Well, it was great while it lasted, but it should have lasted a lot longer.  The problem is in the battery chamber.  The batteries don&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;pressed together&amp;#34; enough most of the time for it to function.  Sometimes I can shake the thing and get it to work for a short while, but lately even that has not been doing the trick.  (Yes, I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries; it has nothing to do with the batteries running down.)  So my five-star review has devolved into a two-star review and I am in the market for another trimmer.  :-(</li>
    <li> Best ever. This is my second because a little piece flew out of the last one when I dropped it on the counter. It flew into the toilet and was never seen again. I could not get a replacement part so I bought a replacement trimmer. And I now keep the toilet lid closed while trimming. It trims hairs close without knicking or tugging.</li>
    <li> the batteries last a long time and this works very well.</li>
    <li> gift for hubby, very nice</li>
    <li> Trina my hairs nicccely.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I was really happy with the purchase &amp; would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best nose hair trimmer ever.  You get older and hair starts growing where it didn&#x27;t before.  This works to get it under control.&lt;br /&gt;Really works well.</li>
    <li> My son loves this would tell friends about it</li>
    <li> Does its job. No issues. I dont go mining into my nose so this thing hasnt broken - works just wonderfully. Case is nothing special. Dont waste time wondering how much youll save on a nose trimmer. For an extra few bucks, thisll get you taken care of.</li>
    <li> I love this. Cleans my nose and sucks out the hair that is cut. It is smooth and cuts the hair clean. Nicely shaped with the cap at the top.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband. He says it&#x27;s so easy &amp; works so well , he uses it daily. The vacuum part is my favorite, no cleanup is needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok , nothing special about this product&lt;br /&gt;I dont think the vacuum was powerful as i thought it would be</li>
    <li> Not sure about the whole vacuum thing since I don&#x27;t know how you empty or clean it but this works fine.  I replaced another Panasonic that I broke during a recent move.  It&#x27;s the model just below this one and I recommend that, too.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, my husband (this is his account) was like, &amp;#34;Why the hell did you buy that?!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Well, because I absolutely hate plucking nose hairs... who doesn&#x27;t right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s one of those dudes that will just reach in there and rip a pinchful right out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after I used it the first time and explained to him that it sucks away any loose hairs, he FINALLY gave it a shot... he totally digs it, too. We&#x27;ve both used it several times and have had zero complaints.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d actually be excited to write a review for a nose and ear trimmer!  But I am, because this little gadget works!  I have had some very expensive personal groomers, and I was never happy with the nose and ear trimming functions--they just did not do the job.  I would often have to use blunt scissors in addition to the trimmer.  This little trimmer works perfectly--your nostrils and your ears will be clean!  And yes, it does vacuum the cut hairs away.  Another reviewer had wondered, where does the hair go?  Well, it goes into the blade chamber itself, which you will see when you clean the blades (you must clean the blade-chamber after every use).  The blades are delicate and need to be cleaned carefully--I advise using a brush of some sort or a cotton swab.  The instructions say, that with normal use, the blades will wear out in about three years.  I like this product so much, I thought of buying another just to keep as a spare!  (I checked, you can&#x27;t buy replacement blades, the product is not built that way). One slight drawback--it works on batteries, you can&#x27;t plug it in.  What I do is, keep the batteries out of the chamber when not in use, that way you&#x27;re not draining the batteries while the trimmer sits idle--the batteries go in so easily, that it is not a big deal to take them out and put them back in.  (I use the trimmer once every two weeks or so).</li>
    <li> Great at getting nose and ear hair. It does tickle and takes time getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Been through a few different devices and systems.  This by far - does the best. The vacuum has a major impact on it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> Very good strong trimmer. Like the accessories coming with the US version only. Cons: 1) Relatively heavy 2) Noisy</li>
    <li> Used three times now and I am happy with the product.  The vacuum works well enough that my nose does not itch after using it.  It is a little louder than I expected.  It fits nicely in my hand as it is a little larger in diameter than my previous trimmer.  It has a simple, but usable case to store it in.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> When we moved recently, the only thing lost was his old trimmer.  This replacement does the job well enough.  Recommend</li>
    <li> worst product...broke in a month.</li>
    <li> I used it to trim my nose hair and it is the best I have ever used. The only negative thing so far, is that the battery lid was a bit difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Trims well and quickly, clean up is very easy.</li>
    <li> Finally was able to intercept my premature old man nose hairs and get rid of the jungle in my schnoz easily and cleanly.  Very happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Nice product, as advertised, delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Powerful, sharp and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> easy to disassemble the blade section for easy cleaning. Also has a very very light suction to try and keep the trimmings out of your nose.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this</li>
    <li> Having said that, it still doesn&#x27;t quite get all those pesky little hairs in my nose, but it does a better job than the other two disappointing trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Hair removal is painless and fast.  You can use the Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer to shape your eyebrows, too!  So far, I really like it!</li>
    <li> I used to think I sneeze a lot because of pollens.  I realized it was caused by my overgrown nasal hair!&lt;br /&gt;This really helped a lot!  Very ticklish at first,  the trick is don&#x27;t breathe through your nostrils while using it.  :P</li>
    <li> I have owned this for years and am only writing the review now. This little trimmer works very well and rarely painfully pulls a hair from my nose or ear. It cleans easily and needs a new battery only once or twice a year with semi-regular use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Clipping ear and nose hair.  It vaccums the clipped hair.  Nifty gadget for a tedious task!  Recommend it to all that have the need!</li>
    <li> Effective and well made. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Used sparingly for a little while, worked fine. Then went dead, changed battery, and simply will not run. Amazon will not take item back since it has been too long. Buyer Beware, do not buy this item! I am very disappointed that Amazon will not take this lemon back.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he really loves it. The vacuum feature is great and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend says he likes it and I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make a mess. comes with a little case to put it in for travel or storage.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot because it replaces my old nose hair trimmer and yet far exceeds my expectations. This is also a replacement for my old trimmer.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it is supposed to do. it trims the hairs without pulling or causing any pain. battery has a good, long life. very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Works SO much better than other units I&#x27;ve owned without the &amp;#34;suction&amp;#34; part.  Everything about this unit is superior, from the finish to the quietness of operation, and at basically the same price as other/lesser units without the vacuum/suction element.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with no fear of a messy sink area, I use it more often and to better effect.  If this thing ever breaks I will buy another, but it seems rock solid so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn out many battery powered trimmers like this, but this thing is a beast! Works about like most of the others I&#x27;ve had, which is to say that it does a perfectly adequate job. Doesn&#x27;t wow me or leave me disappointed; just adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing is, the motor on this thing is so powerful as to be almost comical. If you have REALLY course nose hair, I&#x27;m betting this is the trimmer you&#x27;ve been looking for. :)</li>
    <li> This is not my first and will not be my last. Works as expected, trimming without &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; ear and nose hair. Quite efficient and now you can do it in your shower...Great product.</li>
    <li> just like advertized...cut that black hair right outta my nose and I am so glad I bought it....getting old ain&#x27;t for sissys thanks</li>
    <li> Nice and  quiet and it cut those nose hair with no problem.Make sure you buy 1  AA Battery to make this bad boy purr.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but feels kinda under powered. I wish they make a powerful lithium ion rechargeable version. Also the trim is not very close but suffices my needs.</li>
    <li> works very well. it has a lot of power which eliminates snags . its easy to clean. I trim around the ear and it is loud. You can actually hear how its doing because you can hear when it cuts a hair.</li>
    <li> Husb loves it...well he loves the fact that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. He&#x27;d actually love it more if he didn&#x27;t need to use it but he has &amp;#34;wild hairs&amp;#34; that grow on his ears and in his nose and he has had mannnny of these and this is the only one he has commented on and truly likes. He has had this for more than two years and it&#x27;s still going strong. He has actually mentioned buying these for gifts like for our son and my dad.  Yes, it is more $ than some others but there&#x27;s a reason for that, this works!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Gentle to use but very good quality. It requires constant maintenance and perfectly shaved ajustandoce to hard to reach places. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> .....for the money it is a good product however do not get close to your lips it will cut you w/o fail.(Caucasian)It happen to my twice also if you are rather ticklish inside your nose you are in for some experience.</li>
    <li> It is decent quality, and I appreciate the additional soft zip up case... but this thing EATS BATTERIES like none other. Use it for a total of 5 - 7 minutes and the batteries already start to die. Also, the guard on the razor isn&#x27;t actually that spectacular as I have found out on a few different occasions and ended up cutting the inside of my nose. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that though, I was very happy with the product overall. Great quality, decent price, and reliable.</li>
    <li> No complaints from me. It does what it is supposed to do. I am happy with it. Three more words.</li>
    <li> My first device in this line last 4 years and it was splendid and effective. Naturally, I bought a replacement of the same type and find it as good or better than the first.</li>
    <li> So I had a request from my husband, to get him a nose hair trimmer for father&#x27;s day - because the one he had didn&#x27;t do its job very well, it just wouldn&#x27;t  cut the hair (my husband has very thick type of hair) .. I looked it up online and I thought this thing had good enough reviews - this is why i got it. My husband is happy with it, so far, he said it works great.. I am happy as well :)</li>
