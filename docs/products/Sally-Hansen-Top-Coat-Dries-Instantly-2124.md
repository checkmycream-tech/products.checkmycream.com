      <li>and I was surprised because the color of the nail polish lasts perfectly for more than 12 days.</li>
      <li>This top coat dries in about 3-4 minutes but it smeared my stamping a bit.  </li>

      <li>This top coat is legitimately my holy grail product for my at-home manicure routine.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Paint this baby on over top</li>
      <li>I love sally hansen nail products.</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>and i am glad that i did.</li>
      <li>This polish is magic in a bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many others - Essie, OPI, even Seche Vite -</li>
      <li>This stuff is best applied about 45 seconds after your last coat.  </li>
      <li>Before I found this, I was using the Insta-Dri top coat and it was my go to, but this one is even better.  </li>
      <li>Lost count of how many times I have had to repaint a nail or 4 for smearing.</li>
      <li>but I love sally hansen</li>
      <li>&amp; this Top cover keeps nail polish on MORE longer,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but nothing has worked better or satisfied me more than this $4 bottle of Sally Hansen</li>
      <li>I get compliments using this top coat.  </li>
      <li>Dries Instantly top coat.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite top coat.</li>
      <li>I love that.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t smuge and then use another coat on top.</li>
      <li>and I was able to do what I had to do without worrying about chipping my nails.  </li>
      <li>I could not believe how fast the top coat dries it is just remarkable.</li>
      <li>: if there&#x27;s a top coat you really like that really keeps your nail polish from chipping, I would apply that and then apply this top coat to get the best of both worlds and make your manicure (because we all know pedicures can survive atomic bombs)</li>
      <li>I love this top coat - I picked it up originally at a drug store on a whim, when looking for a replacement for my favorite discontinued top coat.</li>
      <li>then go back to first nail and put a good amount on brush and apply normally,this way its perfect and smooth without bugging art work.</li>
      <li>Although, as soon as it isn&#x27;t tacky anymore (which happens VERY quickly) you are able to pick up things.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great in-between mani-pedis to give nails and toes a great shine with the benefit of a quick dry.</li>
      <li>this product so far works great.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and coats.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it with all of my polish brands (julep, BL, nicole (OPI), nyx,) to name a few and the top coat works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Like many people i was looking for the perfect top coat that actually did what it said - Dry quickly and leave a good shine.</li>
      <li>it allows my nails to stay chip free for 4-5 days which is great since i usually only leave polish on for about a week before i change colors.</li>
      <li>UV light and all.</li>
      <li>If you do more than one top coat this issue will be more apparent, but you don&#x27;t need a lot for your nails to look shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes dries very well but chips away very easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that now I can do my nails right before bed, give them about 5 minutes to really set, and then go to sleep worry-free!</li>
      <li>/&gt;i dont like long nails  LOL</li>
      <li>This was my first experience with a top coat.</li>
      <li>The quantity is great and It&#x27;s not thick at all like other top coat/base coat nail polishes!</li>
      <li>Has a nice gloss to it and makes any of my nail polishes look professionally applied!</li>
      <li>Great product - nails dry quickly.</li>
      <li>Plus I&#x27;ve been really inti nail art lately and this top coat is perfect!!</li>
      <li>It dries instantly and keeps your manicure looking good for the week.</li>
      <li>This top coat works really well.</li>
      <li>I love it so much.</li>
      <li>It quickly hardens my polish, and I never have a mishap.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I have always used a top coat by itself with no nail polish and worked great, BUT, this I put on late evening yesterday and woke up and found 1 had peeled off and was stuck to my leg.  </li>
      <li>It dries incredibly quick, I never have to worry about smudging my nails when I use it.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly as advertised, but lacks in shine.</li>
      <li>I am using this product for quite a long time and it is really good.</li>
      <li>I have tried all the high end products when it comes to top/base coat nail paints, but Sally Hansen is THE BEST, hands down!</li>
      <li>This actually never happens any more!</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says!</li>
      <li>A quick swipe of this topcoat on my nails rescued them completely and they look better than before.  </li>
      <li>Really like this product,because its cheap but works.</li>
      <li>Also a great added benefit is that it really is shiny enough to be your only top coat.</li>
      <li>(if you apply your top coat right away) so careful not to &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; the polish while grabbing things :) and</li>
      <li>I can go to sleep right after using this and not worry about dents or bubbles.</li>
      <li>Ya right.  </li>
      <li>Dries instantly but peels off very easily.</li>
      <li>It works just like any other decent top coat (claims to prevent chipping and claims to maintain shine too) except I&#x27;ve never seen a top coat that dries this fast!</li>
      <li>Especially busy mommies!</li>
      <li>sure you scrape off the excess polish before applying to the nails as the polish is thinner than regular polish and it will collect in the edges of your nails.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
      <li>last even longer!&lt;br /&gt;Loooove this top coat.</li>

    <li> Like many people i was looking for the perfect top coat that actually did what it said - Dry quickly and leave a good shine. I considered seche vite, essie good to go, and many others but in the end i still was undecided. Finally i choose this top coat and i am glad that i did. I&#x27;ve used it with all of my polish brands (julep, BL, nicole (OPI), nyx,) to name a few and the top coat works perfectly.  It goes on smooth and dries completely in about 5 minutes. it allows my nails to stay chip free for 4-5 days which is great since i usually only leave polish on for about a week before i change colors. It also give my nails a high shine which is perfect for my matte finish polishes.</li>
    <li> Ive been using all kinds of Nail polish,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; this Top cover keeps nail polish on MORE longer,&lt;br /&gt;I generaly put two  thin coats on,&lt;br /&gt;my nail  polish of any kind stays on  for a week,&lt;br /&gt;My nails are short,&lt;br /&gt;i dont like long nails  LOL&lt;br /&gt;but i even bought the cheap nail polish  &amp; i added this over it  &amp; WHAMO !!!  it works !!&lt;br /&gt;but.....&lt;br /&gt;if you buy CHEAP nail polish  at a drug store,  This will keep  it on LONGER !!&lt;br /&gt;be sure to use one Layer,  Let it dry for 2 min,&lt;br /&gt;Add a nother layer  &amp;  Thats it,&lt;br /&gt;Two coats&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;i  bought 2 at once,</li>
    <li> Dries quickly, easy to apply, not too expensive, leaves a nice shine. This product is very well rounded! Get this topcoat, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome when you randomly pick up a product not really excepting it to do everything as well as it claims but then it blows you away by doing just that. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times i&#x27;ve painted my nails and waited, waited, waited for them to be fully dry or gone to bed and woken up with them smudged. NO MORE! Paint this baby on over top and you can continue about your day in just a few minutes!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME. For the longest time I never painted my nails because they took forEVer to dry completely. I could paint them after work and still end up with sheet prints in the morning. I bought a bottle of this just by chance while on vacation a few weeks ago and was AMAZED at the results. I&#x27;m thrilled that now I can do my nails right before bed, give them about 5 minutes to really set, and then go to sleep worry-free!</li>
    <li> Yes dries very well but chips away very easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at rite aid, but I wanted to leave a review anyway. I am a stay at home mom/wife so I don&#x27;t really have time to sit and wait for my nails to dry.  I bought this product thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but boy was I pleasantly surprised!  My nails were dry within 2 minutes and I was able to do what I had to do without worrying about chipping my nails.  It also has a really nice shine which I love. It is definitely comparable to a gel polish manicure as far as shine.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  I love sally hansen nail products.</li>
    <li> It really works, girls! By the time I finish top coating my right hand, the nails on my left hand are dry!! Amazing.. I think I&#x27;m done trying different top coats. I found one that&#x27;s perfect for me. It works just like any other decent top coat (claims to prevent chipping and claims to maintain shine too) except I&#x27;ve never seen a top coat that dries this fast! Lost count of how many times I have had to repaint a nail or 4 for smearing. Well those days are over! ;) You won&#x27;t regret getting this! Especially busy mommies! P.S. just be careful as the nail polish underneath the top coat will still be wet (if you apply your top coat right away) so careful not to &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; the polish while grabbing things :) and another tip: if there&#x27;s a top coat you really like that really keeps your nail polish from chipping, I would apply that and then apply this top coat to get the best of both worlds and make your manicure (because we all know pedicures can survive atomic bombs) last even longer!&lt;br /&gt;Loooove this top coat.</li>
    <li> I have never had an instant dry that was true to it&#x27;s word....... THIS IS it for me....  ..  Even when I thought it was dry and had painted the nails way before bedtime.... would wake up with smudges....  This top coat is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m not young!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  PIE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Sally Hansen products and this is a must-have.  It dries quickly and helps set my color and gives it the wet look that I like.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical on how it would work, but after applying a coat of this Top Coat, it did dry much faster than any of the other brands I had previously tried.  I am not exactly saying that it dries &amp;#34;instantly&#x27;, but within a minute it my nails felt dry to a medium touch.  I wouldn&#x27;t try a lot of manual work for a bit after but I could certainly do things like brushing my hair, or putting on clothes that weren&#x27;t too manipulative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you scrape off the excess polish before applying to the nails as the polish is thinner than regular polish and it will collect in the edges of your nails. If you do more than one top coat this issue will be more apparent, but you don&#x27;t need a lot for your nails to look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased and I am glad I purchased two bottles.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and coats.  Dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly as advertised, but lacks in shine. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Last night I put on two coats of regular nail polish, omitted the top coat out of laziness, went to bed and woke up to find them dull and imprinted with the fabric pattern of my sheets.  A quick swipe of this topcoat on my nails rescued them completely and they look better than before.  Wouldn&#x27;t say this dries in 30 seconds, more like 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> It actually does dry instantly! I love that. If you make designs on your nails, then when you put the topcoat on, it doesn&#x27;t even it out, it just seals it. I like that though.</li>
    <li> Love this! It really does try instantly. First do a clear base coat then two colored layers then this SH top coat and it works great!!! No more waiting for 15 minutes to let it dry!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for quite a long time and it is really good. It dries instantly and keeps your manicure looking good for the week.</li>
    <li> This top coat is legitimately my holy grail product for my at-home manicure routine. I have tried so many others - Essie, OPI, even Seche Vite - but nothing has worked better or satisfied me more than this $4 bottle of Sally Hansen Dries Instantly top coat. I&#x27;ve also tried their &amp;#34;No Chip&amp;#34; top coat, but that one was goopy and took approximately 80 years to dry completely. This one dries fully on the surface level in just over a minute, and it will be completely and totally dry in a couple hours at most. This top coat is freaking AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Really like this product,because its cheap but works.Its great for nail art,what I do it pat it on the art work on each finger of one hand then go back to first nail and put a good amount on brush and apply normally,this way its perfect and smooth without bugging art work.</li>
    <li> Dries instantly but peels off very easily. Not my favorite top coat.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Dries completely in 5 min! Has a nice gloss to it and makes any of my nail polishes look professionally applied! Love that i don&#x27;t have to worry about smudges, dents or nail polish peeling off any more! Thank you Sally Hansen!!</li>
    <li> I love this top coat - I picked it up originally at a drug store on a whim, when looking for a replacement for my favorite discontinued top coat. It really does dry within a minute or two to a touchable finish, and after using it, messing up my nail polish almost never happens.</li>
    <li> This top coat works really well. Puts a nice coat on and keeps nail polish on longer without chipping.</li>
    <li> I have a ridiculous amount of top coats that I&#x27;ve tried out, and this is hands down one of my favorites.  Before I found this, I was using the Insta-Dri top coat and it was my go to, but this one is even better.  It dries incredibly quick, I never have to worry about smudging my nails when I use it. I use this more than the expensive top coats that I have!</li>
    <li> This top coat really does dry nails instantly. While they are not rock hard, they are dry enough for you to go about light duty work. I wouldn&#x27;t dig my hands into my purse because the polish underneath is still soft, but you can still go about your day and not worry about messing up your nails for the first half hour. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this topcoat peeling or chipping my nails.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a top coat. I was looking for a solution to the problem of my nail polish NEVER drying. Ever. Even when I sat for hours after painting them.  I applied this top coat about 3-5 min after my second coat and waited about 5 min before gently touching my nails to see if they were dry. They were, I&#x27;d say, MOSTLY dry.  Still a little bit tacky. And if you try to push a little on the nail (as I did as an experiment) it would still leave a thumbprint or a chip.  So my solution was to wait another 5 or 10 min.  Overall, not too bad and certainly more convenient and effective than waiting all night for your nails to dry...only for them to never actually dry. Two more things to note: when I woke the next day, I did not have the dreaded &amp;#34;sheet imprints&amp;#34; in my nail polish like I usually did before using this product. Also, I did get a few compliments from people asking me if I had my nails professionally done or if I did them myself.  I appreciated that!</li>
    <li> When they say quick dry,they mean it. I could not believe how fast the top coat dries it is just remarkable. I know it takes a total of 5mins to dry and you are good to go.I Love it.</li>
    <li> have been using this for months.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it works quickly and beautifully! Even using &#x27;quick dry&#x27; nail polishes, they never actually completely dry by themselves, not for a long time. But if you add this top coat once the color first sets, then within a minute or two, EVERYTHING is completely hard and dry, and WILL NOT smudge or fudge. It&#x27;s a life saver for nail polish, whether you&#x27;re doing just a simple plain color set, or intricate nail art, and I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really awesome, does exactly what it says it would do! I love it!</li>
    <li> It did not cost $20, and it works.  It makes my home manicures look like a pro did them.  I get compliments using this top coat.  I have always used OPI everything, however, this is now my BFF topcoat :)!</li>
    <li> It dries fast and initially has a shiny finish, but in less than a day, it got super dull. I have to add another topcoat to get the shine back.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and find myself painting my nails in stolen moments of freedom in the airport.  This usually means boarding a plan soon thereafter, and traveling with wet nails usually means messed up nails.  NOT ANYMORE!  This stuff is a miracle in a bottle for someone who needs to look nice but doesn&#x27;t have the time to spend waiting for 3 hours before they move their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hints: This stuff is best applied about 45 seconds after your last coat.  It will still smudge if you hit it too hard, but if you are careful for about 3-5 minutes afterwards, your nails are set for good.</li>
    <li> The other reviews are correct. This polish is great and dries quickly. Will order again!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry instantly but it gets pretty close. Not perfect but definitely worth the price. Dries quickly. Leaves a shine. Easy to apply. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always used a top coat by itself with no nail polish and worked great, BUT, this I put on late evening yesterday and woke up and found 1 had peeled off and was stuck to my leg.  A couple hours later another peeled off.  Decided to check my toes, they have polish on them and this product so far works great. DOES dry  in a couple of seconds.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It fully dries to the touch within seven minutes. Although, as soon as it isn&#x27;t tacky anymore (which happens VERY quickly) you are able to pick up things. Thanks to Sally Hansen, you no longer have to sit for an hour, waiting for your nails to dry. Or use oily liquids to speed up the drying time. I painted my nails 15 minutes ago, and I&#x27;m using the computer and typing, my manicure still looks great! I would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> It actually helps to get the nail paint dry faster ( 1 min) and then adds shine to the nail paint too.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat!! It actually works and it makes your nails shiny!!(DUH) Its very hard to find a topcoat that works but I love sally hansen so I decided to give it a try and I was so amazed, I even bought two bc I love it so much. Plus I&#x27;ve been really inti nail art lately and this top coat is perfect!! 5 STARS!!!!!</li>
    <li> This polish is magic in a bottle.  I&#x27;ve never bothered writing a review for nail polish.  This stuff is almost scary it works so well.  I bought it one day at RiteAid because of the &amp;#34;Dries Instantly.&amp;#34;  Ya right.  No, Seriously, it really does, even if you have 3 layers underneath it! I was shocked. This stuff dries SO HARD and DOESN&#x27;T CHIP.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve had my nails done professionally.  I do a lot of rough work with my hands working on different projects, and this polish is industrial strength.  I hope they never stop making it.  My neighbor randomly said the same thing and she has only been using it now, too.&lt;br /&gt;I use Essie base coat and polish colors, typically, and this as a top coat.</li>
    <li> This top coat dries in about 3-4 minutes but it smeared my stamping a bit.  I think this is a great back-up top coat because it does what it is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> Great product - nails dry quickly.</li>
    <li> I cant believe that this product actually performs the way it says it will. This actually never happens any more! But this one is real. I am a Mom and the only time I get to myself is at night just before bed and I can now paint my nails and turn the fan on them for the length of a commercial break. They are dry! Also a great added benefit is that it really is shiny enough to be your only top coat. I had gone to the gel nails, I have the entire home kit. UV light and all. This product may make me come back to the regular polish side as it saves a lot of time to not sit and wait for nails to dry. Then you make one wrong move reaching for something, and your whole do is messed up. Lady&#x27;s you know what I am talking about!;( As we speak I am typing with nails just painted about five minutes ago!&lt;br /&gt;The advantage over the UV gel nails is that this product makes application much quicker. I can paint and get out the door if need be. The process for gel nails is longer but the results also last much longer (up to two weeks). This product also opens my options back up to all the different shades and colors of regular polish, as gel colors are very limited when you want that perfect shade of pink.&lt;br /&gt;Both are options I will keep in my bag of tricks to always have fierce nails!!!!SNAP&lt;br /&gt;Buy it now. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I always carry this when I go to the nail salon. It quickly hardens my polish, and I never have a mishap. It&#x27;s great in-between mani-pedis to give nails and toes a great shine with the benefit of a quick dry.</li>
    <li> I find when I use this product as a lone topcoat, it really make my nails look very dull. I prefer to use it so I don&#x27;t smuge and then use another coat on top.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says! Saved my manicures! I can go to sleep right after using this and not worry about dents or bubbles.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly, leaves my nails shiny and really keeps my nails from getting chips for at least 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> It really dries fast.</li>
    <li> I got this today in my mailbox and I am super happy with my purchase! The quantity is great and It&#x27;s not thick at all like other top coat/base coat nail polishes! I have tried all the high end products when it comes to top/base coat nail paints, but Sally Hansen is THE BEST, hands down! It dries in an instant, and saves me sooo much time! It has a shine which is distinct to it as the coat dries up and the shine lasts long! I will defintely buy this again in the future! I highly recommend this! Sally hansen rocks! :) Trust me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase! :)</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Dries Instantly really works and I was surprised because the color of the nail polish lasts perfectly for more than 12 days.</li>
