      <li>It shipped quickly and made a nice gift</li>
      <li>The price was great for such a nice size bottle.  </li>
      <li>As always, my favorite cologne is Azzaro the original one</li>
      <li>The logo is not on the top of the cap, the silver stripe is not there, the shape doesn&#x27;t match the original bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought to many parfum there to think  that wasn&#x27;t the original..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has strong smell.</li>
      <li>The packaging and everything was fine.  </li>
      <li>Take Safari for Men by Ralph Lauren-smells awesome and costs a little over twice as Azzaro.</li>
      <li>do I consider it reformulated as it would be easy to detect in Azzaro&#x27;s straightforward scent.</li>
      <li>Have always been a huge fan of Azzaro and will continue to be so.</li>
      <li>A fabulous scent.  </li>
      <li>Iconic, yet rarely encountered.</li>
      <li>well that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s cheap&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Buyers, be aware: Azzaro is a great cologne which I wear since my early teenager times.</li>
      <li>If you have ever purchased ANY perfume (forget designer brands), there is one unique thing that you will see on each packaging and the bottle.</li>
      <li>Original scent</li>
      <li>had originally used a sample of this perfume, found as a promotion sample in a magazine.</li>
      <li>appears to be original, but it came with a shaved validity both in the bottle when in the box.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying this!</li>
      <li>This is not a barcode but a unique identifier.</li>
      <li>Smell - doesn&#x27;t smell anything close to Azzaro (and I have an original bottle bought from Amazon as well)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I have not seen the original Azzaro bottle</li>
      <li>the wasn&#x27;t the original .please</li>
      <li>The new scent isn&#x27;t as nice and it seems to fizzle out after a couple of hours</li>
      <li>I could not find better price and fast service anywere els.</li>
      <li>Spicy,semi-bitter,and lightly sweet.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite Colognes that work on my skin chemistry and stays long living a nice manly smile.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS NOW, AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT IT WAS STILL AVAILABLE, AND AT</li>
      <li>I love this type of perfumes; classic perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
      <li>love the smell highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Great Eau de Toilette</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Designer houses may occasionally sell cheap product but they will always ensure that the packaging is top class.  </li>
      <li>Good product, I like it as expected.</li>
      <li>use this 5 days a week after the gym, several reasons, like the scent a lot strong bottle, fits easy into gym bag, get compliments on it about once every 2 weeks</li>
      <li>Great soft classy masculine scent which will make you feel relax and set you into trance hypnotic feeling effect.</li>
      <li>Good clean smell but scent for yrs past .</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>So lets get more objective.</li>
      <li>This way the bottle can be associated with the exact packaging.</li>
      <li>D&amp;G. Please do not blind buy, you will be wasting your money.</li>
      <li>Back when I started wearing Azzaro many years ago this was in a splash form in stores.</li>
      <li>Give &#x27;em Drakkar Noir,Red For Men by Giorgio,Aramis EDT, or Halston 1-12(another personal favorite of mine).I love Azzaro EDT personally</li>
      <li>I will try to provide a more objective reasoning for my complaint.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>Last a long time and has good projection.</li>
      <li>WAS NOT THE REAL</li>
      <li>This is the real deal here.</li>
      <li>So there you go- the absolute test to know if the product is a fake.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>I knew this product before I ordered it; and it is scarce in my area, reason why I went online to search it and thanks to Amazon.com for helping me find it.</li>
      <li>but I can say that this bottle definitely looked cheap.  </li>
      <li>Pulled the tape gently and the box was cut.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a decent budget and great value for money,Its not a very strong smell but still a spicy fragrance which will make your presence felt.</li>
      <li>Before I really get into this cologne by Azzaro</li>
      <li>Will absolutely buy again.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Through the spray bottle giving a noticeably smaller dose than a single hand splash I found Azzaro to be become mild unless I sprayed more.</li>
      <li>This product has the same scent as the original, but it&#x27;s a demonstration tester.  </li>
      <li>It is for older men(40 and up)</li>
      <li>Classic Fougere.</li>
      <li>Classic timeless, manly scent.</li>
      <li>I can live without that...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this cologne and the price was awesome!</li>
    <li> appears to be original, but it came with a shaved validity both in the bottle when in the box. box placed in a black sticker covering the place where the validity was torn.</li>
    <li> I like it, in fact I love it!</li>
    <li> Great soft classy masculine scent which will make you feel relax and set you into trance hypnotic feeling effect. It&#x27;s worth buying this!</li>
    <li> Subtle, but pleasingly powerful!</li>
    <li> WAS NOT THE REAL THING,,SMELL DOESNT EVEN LAST AN HOUR ON THE SKIN !</li>
    <li> I knew this product before I ordered it; and it is scarce in my area, reason why I went online to search it and thanks to Amazon.com for helping me find it. It is an amazing product and I love it.</li>
    <li> Buyers, be aware: Azzaro is a great cologne which I wear since my early teenager times. It&#x27;s my favorite cologne to this day, however this time the Azzaro I received is a fake product. I say it&#x27;s fake not based on subjective factors, but based on:&lt;br /&gt;- Smell - doesn&#x27;t smell anything close to Azzaro (and I have an original bottle bought from Amazon as well)&lt;br /&gt;- Bottle - the bottle is a poor copy with the original product. The logo is not on the top of the cap, the silver stripe is not there, the shape doesn&#x27;t match the original bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have pictures, side by side, comparing the original product versus the fake version in case someone wants to see them.</li>
    <li> The bottle came in good packing, but when I opened it, the nozzle spray was missing...totally useless. I had to return it and now I cannot order the replacement as the price has shot up by 50%...too bad!</li>
    <li> Before I really get into this cologne by Azzaro I feel there&#x27;s a few comments to throw into the wind.For starters I don&#x27;t think this would make an instant satisfier for someone that heard of it&#x27;s past tense reputation but hasn&#x27;t smelled it before.Speaking in terms of gift giving for Christmas or birthday present.Give &#x27;em Drakkar Noir,Red For Men by Giorgio,Aramis EDT, or Halston 1-12(another personal favorite of mine).I love Azzaro EDT personally but as a herbal/spicy cologne if I was inquired about it in person I&#x27;d say &#x27;how do you feel about anise&#x27;?.Still intrigued? well let&#x27;s get to the bottom of this scent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azzaro&#x27;s Scent:&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s lightly soapy for starters with a good hit of anise/black licorice that makes it spicy but not cloying.Spicy,semi-bitter,and lightly sweet.There&#x27;s a nice minty like quality that fuses with the anise but it&#x27;s actually the herb known as basil.Lastly there&#x27;s a musky padding under all of this that sort of softens the edges out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has Azzaro EDT been watered down/weakened?&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion no it has not nor do I consider it reformulated as it would be easy to detect in Azzaro&#x27;s straightforward scent.Back when I started wearing Azzaro many years ago this was in a splash form in stores.Then over the years spray bottles replaced a lot of colognes in splash form.Through the spray bottle giving a noticeably smaller dose than a single hand splash I found Azzaro to be become mild unless I sprayed more.Someone&#x27;s rebuttal might be &#x27;well that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s cheap&#x27;.Take Safari for Men by Ralph Lauren-smells awesome and costs a little over twice as Azzaro. But Safari gives the same perception lightening to a low projection/close encounter as Azzaro&#x27;s spray would...and always has.Every cologne&#x27;s potency varies cheap or expensive but it shows some were just destined to come in a splash on form for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended if you see it on a tester stand to give it a shot and not let the negativity fool you.If you&#x27;re convinced and like Azzaro does make a 13.6oz size splash bottle too!f you&#x27;re convinced and like Azzaro does make a 13.6oz size splash bottle too!</li>
    <li> Pretty good cologne--a little weak though.</li>
    <li> This cologne is the epitamy of class!! You feel like a million bucks when you wear this stuff even if your dirt poor.  Last a long time and has good projection. A winner for sure! When My bottle runs out I will definetly buy more!</li>
    <li> This product has the same scent as the original, but it&#x27;s a demonstration tester.  For the price it&#x27;s acceptable, but nowhere in the description is this fact mentioned.  Also, this company charged the fed-ex rate for shipping and it took over three days to arrive.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed and highly recommend. Works perfectly well within the expectations that I had to make the choice to purchase. Whenever you need to buy the product back.</li>
    <li> I love it, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I think they have changed the formula on this one, it does not smell the same as I remember from several years ago. The new scent isn&#x27;t as nice and it seems to fizzle out after a couple of hours and you can barely smell it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Colognes that work on my skin chemistry and stays long living a nice manly smile.</li>
    <li> It was easy and deliveried on time😃!</li>
    <li> Good product, I like it as expected. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite. Will absolutely buy again.  It is somewhat difficult to find in department stores so was delighted to find it here</li>
    <li> I could not find better price and fast service anywere els. Amazon.com is the best.</li>
    <li> the bottle is big it makes a great gift</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been used this perfume for a long time and still does the trick. Smells good as always remember since I got for the first time.</li>
    <li> this product was giving as a gift and they complain about the how the smell didn&#x27;t hold in the skin long and the wasn&#x27;t the original .please let me know what happened with this product.i cannot believe that you can sell a product that isn&#x27;t original..or maybe was a old product that was on the shelf for to long.let me know whats going on.I bought to many parfum there to think  that wasn&#x27;t the original..I hope that i don&#x27;t have to report this to attorney general...&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> This is the real deal here. Classic Fougere. Remained mostly unaltered. Classic timeless, manly scent.</li>
    <li> One of the best. I can live without that...</li>
    <li> Iconic, yet rarely encountered.</li>
    <li> Perfect 90&#x60;s cologne!</li>
    <li> Was a gift. The person who received it was happy.</li>
    <li> Bought this from &amp;#34;Amazon.com LLC&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, i was displeased by this product.&lt;br /&gt;I had originally used a sample of this perfume, found as a promotion sample in a magazine. I liked it and that&#x27;s why i ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;But when  the full product arrived, it was as if it didn&#x27;t smell like the sample i had previously used. It was like a totally different smell, which i didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;I will be very careful in the future, when ordering perfumes again!</li>
    <li> Remember being better, still like.</li>
    <li> Great delivery very satisfactory</li>
    <li> thank you I love it i love it</li>
    <li> this perfume is definitely a good choice and very attractive to girls.I havnt got more compliments after i wore this perfume.I definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a decent budget and great value for money,Its not a very strong smell but still a spicy fragrance which will make your presence felt.</li>
    <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
    <li> A fabulous scent.  I had it in the mid-1980s and had forgotten how great it smells!</li>
    <li> Very good! I recomend it!</li>
    <li> As always, my favorite cologne is Azzaro the original one and it never disappoints. Will buy it again and again</li>
    <li> It is nice perfume. I like it!&lt;br /&gt;It has strong smell. I love this type of perfumes; classic perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
    <li> I have been using Azzaro for about 28 years and this is by far the best deal I have seen! My order went very smooth with no problems.</li>
    <li> Azzaro the King! NOT..... Super lame over hype. Generic alcohol smell, not a yves or D&amp;G. Please do not blind buy, you will be wasting your money. It is for older men(40 and up)</li>
    <li> This is my hubby&#x27;s favorites scent.  The price was great for such a nice size bottle.  It shipped quickly and made a nice gift</li>
    <li> use this 5 days a week after the gym, several reasons, like the scent a lot strong bottle, fits easy into gym bag, get compliments on it about once every 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Let me explain, Azzaro is one of my favorite colognes.  The packaging and everything was fine.  The problem is whatever is in the bottle is extremely sour and old smelling.  I have also learned that I cannot return this product and have been advised to dispose of the product.  I have have learned my lesson, I will never make another fragrance through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very Good and Good price</li>
    <li> Bought it from Amazon, received in very poor packaging and original packaging was smashed but shrink wrapped, it looks like Eau De Toilette sat in ver hot warehouse for a long time or is the fake one because the scent is not only is not a scent of Azzaro but not even the scent of cologne kind of rancid scent.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever buy cologne online or Amazon</li>
    <li> Have always been a huge fan of Azzaro and will continue to be so. Totally love this one here. Thanks</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS NOW, AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT IT WAS STILL AVAILABLE, AND AT A GOOD PRICE THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I reported to Amazon that the product was FAKE.  The 5 star amazon CS promptly refunded me the money- no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I calling the product FAKE. I wanted to post a video review to explain the issue but I cannot do it for this product so here I will try to explain why the product was fake.&lt;br /&gt;I always read reviews about the perfume not smelling right, not lasting long enough, etc as the reasons for calling them fake. But this is subjective and not a good test to distinguish original vs fake.  I will try to provide a more objective reasoning for my complaint.&lt;br /&gt;1. When I opened the package, I noticed that the box of the perfume looked very very cheap. Designer houses may occasionally sell cheap product but they will always ensure that the packaging is top class.  Not the case with this product. The lettering looked a little smudged. Looked at the box more closely and there was black tape around the box, as well as a few patches at the bottom. Pulled the tape gently and the box was cut. Pulled out the patch tape and there was a small square cut as well.  At this point without even opening the box, I wrote to amazon to complain and they did issue a immediate refund.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Went back to the box and decided to take the bottle out.  I have not seen the original Azzaro bottle but I can say that this bottle definitely looked cheap.  I then pressed the atomizer and it was a little hard to press it. Also the spray that came out was not even. It smelled ok but another indication that something is wrong with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;3. The packaging or the bottle again are not enough to call the perfume fake right. So lets get more objective. If you have ever purchased ANY perfume (forget designer brands), there is one unique thing that you will see on each packaging and the bottle. Every package will have a text ( combination of letter and numbers) imprinted on it . This is not a barcode but a unique identifier. The exact same number will be imprinted on the actual glass bottle as well. This way the bottle can be associated with the exact packaging. If they are missing, this is a sure indicator you have a fake product.  So on my package or the bottle this unique combination was missing all together. So there you go- the absolute test to know if the product is a fake.&lt;br /&gt;4. If it is a tester, you will notice the word tester ( not just a sticker) on the bottle some where. In most cases it will be etched on the bottle but I would imagine different designer houses may do it differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If if your bottle fails test number 3  you are 100% sure that you have a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL AMAZON IF YOU HAVE SUSPICION. But do your due diligence  to ensure that  you were shipped a fake product.</li>
