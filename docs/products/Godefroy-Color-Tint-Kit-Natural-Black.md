<li> it lasted on me for 3 days totally worth it no more eyebrow pencils!</li>

<li> or so I got tired of paying so much for something that only lasts for a couple of weeks.</li>

<li> Not sure I&#x27;m going to try it again.</li>
<li> That was a little scary.</li>
<li> Before buying this product it never occurred to me that any product made to go so close to eyes could be that caustic</li>
<li> I know, that was so dumb  of me!  </li>

    <li> 1st time using eyebrow dye. Ordered &#x27;Natural Black.&#x27; Let it stay on for about 3 minutes. Eyebrows were very black afterwards. Had lots of left over product as well.  Next time, 1/3 capsule would work and total time on: 1  minute tops.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Just what I needed</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use. This is the product I was taught to use in esthetics school and is the best I&#x27;ve worked with.</li>
    <li> Very good product, it did the job.</li>
    <li> This stuff burned my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have colored my eyebrows for about 10 years now, starting off going to the salon, then after a year or so I got tired of paying so much for something that only lasts for a couple of weeks. I found an eyebrow and eyelash dye that was well reviewed called Roux which is just like the ones used in the salon and lasts about the same length of time You pay the same price for the product that lasts for over a year as you do for one or two trips to the salon. I went to re-order some of this a few months ago and couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon (it&#x27;s available again now) so I ordered this product. I noticed this one wasn&#x27;t to be used for coloring eyelashes, but as I don&#x27;t do that it didn&#x27;t bother me. Well now I know why it can&#x27;t be used for eyelashes, when I applied the Godefroy product it was like putting acid on my skin, I dread to think what it could do to someones eyes! I put Benadryl cream on my eyebrows to help with the burning and redness for about three days until it stopped hurting. Before buying this product it never occurred to me that any product made to go so close to eyes could be that caustic and I really didn&#x27;t want to believe it was the product, so I tried it again after about three weeks, (the tint color on my eyebrows lasted about 10 days) when my skin had recovered. I know, that was so dumb  of me!  This time it was actually worse, my daughter saw what had happened and told me to throw it away, I did, feeling a little guilty as it isn&#x27;t cheap. I went to a local beauty supply store (Sally&#x27;s)and asked if they had the Roux eyelash/eyebrow dye that I used to get and they did! It was about $15 more there than I pay on Amazon but by this time I didn&#x27;t care. I have been using the Roux product again now for the last couple is months and there is no irritation at all :) I did notice it&#x27;s available on Amazon again now, so I&#x27;ll buy it from there next year year I need some more.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! My brows are pretty thin, so I would have to fill them in with pencil daily. Instead, I now use this dye every 10 days or so, and it saves a ton of time. I have very dark brown/ black hair and this shade is just a little lighter than my hair color. The color looks extremely natural and comes out even every time. I follow the instructions on the box- the only thing I do differently is use each color capsule for 4-5 dye jobs. You definitely don&#x27;t need the entire capsule for one time.</li>
    <li> Love this I have been using it for 2yrs now recommend it to everyone who wants more filled in darker eyebrows</li>
    <li> It looks good after your done but results only last  a couple of days, not weeks</li>
    <li> Product is ok wear away quickly!!!</li>
    <li> love love love! only takes 2-3minutes it lasted on me for 3 days totally worth it no more eyebrow pencils!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser tried to color my eyebrows with the same color she put on my hair and it had no effect at all. I used this and it worked perfectly. It was very easy to use and didn&#x27;t color anything but my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> great product, my brows were on fleek</li>
    <li> Lost several eyebrow hairs on the first use. That was a little scary. Not sure I&#x27;m going to try it again. The color faded within a week.</li>
    <li> I struggle everyday with having to fill in my eyebrows and when I found out about this product I HAD to order it and it was the best decision of my life! Now I wake up with perfect brows and don&#x27;t have to bother with filling them in. I will most definitely be buying this again when I run out</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this product.  I love it. You don&#x27;t need to use the whole capsule at once. And the effect is really nice, the color stays on for about 3-4 weeks. Tip, if you put on some cream before you apply the mixture it won&#x27;t stain your skin. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> works like a charm!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin this will last for about 3 days only.</li>
