<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i bought this for my bathroom faucet but it does not screw on. i had to pay for shipping it back plus i assume I&#x27;m losing the shipping charge for coming here so i just put it aside for the 20 dollar refund it may not be worth shipping back. i then tried another faucet but it did not fit it neither so here it sits.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Easy to hook up and use, then store out of sight. Great device, glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I tried fitting a RediBreeze unit to a &amp;#34;Glacier Bay&amp;#34; faucet and to a &amp;#34;Moen&amp;#34; faucet, both sold by Home Depot, and it didn&#x27;t fit either one of them.  In trying to make it fit without leaking to the Moen faucet, I inadvertently stripped the irreplaceable brass internal threads of the Moen faucet to the point where I can&#x27;t even re-install the aerator which came with the faucet, necessitating purchase of a new faucet.  The new faucet I purchased is a Delta, and the RediBreeze unit works fine with it.  I&#x27;ve given it 3 stars (okay) because while I finally got a Delta faucet that it works on, I had to dispose of a $91 Moen faucet that the RediBreeze adapter stripped the irreplaceable brass threads on.  Oral Breeze should provide a list of faucet brands that their units will work on and/or a list of those brands that it doesn&#x27;t work on.  That&#x27;s a common practice for many manufacturers of after market accessories.</li>
    <li> This invention is absolutely brilliant.  Simple parts, efficient, easy to control. No more refilling a flimsy plastic water reservoir and listening to the hum of wasted electricity. These should replace all electric water picks. You can control the pressure and temperature of the water stream with a touch of the taps, and you never have to fiddle with flimsy plastic parts. This device is well-made, durable, and feels much cleaner than the electric variety. I&#x27;ve had mine nearly two years and it&#x27;s as good as new. Highly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know whether this product is good or bad because I can&#x27;t use it! Can&#x27;t get it on the faucet, tried all the little peices and&lt;br /&gt;it just doesn&#x27;t work, so can&#x27;t use the darn thing. Most frustrating. I might just return it, will try AGAIN. I&#x27;ll keep you posted!</li>
    <li> If this is anything like the Standard Oral-Breeze, I will be very happy.. I got this to take on trips... it will be a little tricky to regulate because this unit relies solely on the Tap&#x27;s controls.. the standard adds a secondary valve to help regulate the spray&#x27;s strength....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it has the same solid build and ease of use -- it really  feels like it can clean the teeth as well as the gum crevices and pockets so hard to reach with a brush...</li>
    <li> It took me while to get this hooked up, just didn&#x27;t get around to it.  I wish  I had done it earlier.  This works great.  Very easy to use.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I am delighted.  This is a great device--works beautifully--well made, easyt to set up.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product -- easy to install and works great because you can control the water temperature and the velocity of the spray, good quality and I think it is very reasonably priced!!!!  The company also has one of the best customer service departments I have ever experienced!  I ordered the RediBreeze originally and preferred something I could disconnect and put away in the vanity (not realizing the Quick Breeze was just what I wanted!).  Their customer service department sent me the Quick Breeze and I sent back the Redi Breeze and I am just delighted!  You could not ask for a better product or company to buy from.  I have told all my friends and neighbors about this wonderful product and I also plan to pass this information along to my dentist to recommend to his other patients who need a dental irrigator.  I highly recommend either the RediBreeze or Quick Breeze to anyone looking for a dental oral irrigator.  This is a great product!!!! If you have any questions, their customer service department is very helpful and can help you make your decision as to which product would work better for you.  DEFINITELY A FIVE STAR+ PRODUCT AND COMPANY!!!</li>
    <li> This is the absolutely best oral irrigator that I have ever used!  I have tried three of the powered pulse type irrigators and was not nearly as pleased as I am with the QuickBreeze.  There are several reasons I especially like it.&lt;br /&gt;  First, it is absolutely the simplest to install.  No tools are needed and I was able to use it almost immediately.  Secondly, it is easy to connect and disconnect from the faucet each time and the user gets to select temperature and quantity of spray.  Thirdly, it is extremely economical to buy and own.  It uses no power except the pressure of your own water, which you can adjust, and its cost is extremely reasonable considering how well made it appears to be.  The warranty seems to be second to none also.&lt;br /&gt;  I really like the QuickBreeze irrigator and recommend it without reservation!</li>
    <li> The quick breeze works exactly as stated.  A good product but you have to be careful on the amount of water pressure you use or you could do more harm than good.</li>
    <li> The QuickBreeze is easy to install and use.  Over the years I&#x27;ve had several tank type dental irragators.  I definitly prefer the Breeze technology and recommend it.  [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator]]</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I am very happy with \\&quot;Quick Breeze\\&quot;. It really works! I wish I would have known about this product before, but is never too late. The service was excellent. I actually received the product sooner than expected. I very much recommend this product to everyone, especially to people that have gum disease. Thank you Amazon!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I am so amazed with this item. It is so easy to use and it just snaps on the faucet. You get more than adequate pressure from the faucet and it does a wonderful job, just like the dentist ordered. More people should have one...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product which I have found to be superior to the Dental Water Pik.  It doesn&#x27;t require a separate water container or a nearby electrical outlet to power up.  It is permanently attached to a bathroom water facet and becomes a simple process of attaching a small detachable directional tube, adjusting the water flow or pressure to your liking and proceed.  I religiously floss my teeth but have found that even after flossing, the Irrigator would still flush out small bits of stuff.  It is now a daily routine for me, floss, irrigate and brush.  I&#x27;m 75 and still have all my teeth and can&#x27;t over emphasize the importance of good oral hygiene.  This product is an important tool to achieve the latter and is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product due to the good reviews.  However, I was unpleasantly surprised.  I tried to install it in the guest bathroom and it would not fit.  I emailed the company and they sent me a bag of adapters.  I should have returned it then, but I gave them the benefit of doubt that it would work.  I used it in the guest bathroom and it worked but I got water everywhere.  My wife said I needed to move it to my bathroom sink because the guest bathroom needs to stay clean.  So I proceded to try to install it on the faucet in my bathroom (which has a Delta faucet which was recently installed - Delta is a common faucet that is available almost everywhere).  Of course, it would not fit.      So I emailed the company again and was told that I should practice using it to stop making a mess.  They also said that they did not have an adapter for my faucet.  They said I should go to a hardware store to find one. I said NO, that is your responsibility.  So I took the aerator out of my faucet and sent it to the company requesting an adapter with the same size threads as my faucet.  They sent it back and said they didn&#x27;t have one.      I requested reimbursement and was told that the company does not reimburse if it is purchased through Amazon.  Amazon will not reimburse if the product is opened.  So I AM STUCK WITH A QUICKBREEZE ORAL IRRIGATOR THAT I CAN&#x27;T USE IN MY BATHROOM.  That means I wasted money buying a product that is not backed up by the company.  The company says they will give a full, no-questions-asked refund within 30 days (I emailed them within 2 weeks of purchasing).  This is true only if you buy from the company.      My suggestion:  If you are going to buy this product, I suggest you take the aerator off of your faucet and send it to the company first.  Hopefully they can match it.  If they can&#x27;t, you have lost nothing.  I would not buy this Quickbreeze from Amazon or anyone else unless you can return it opened.  Chances are, it will not fit your faucet,especially if it is a common faucet, such as Delta.</li>
    <li> Cleaning my teeth with this simple device is now something I look forward to. I simply adjust the water temperature and pressure out of the tap to give a comfortable cleaning of my teeth and gums. Works fabulously in every way. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use a shower waterjet system which cleans my teeth unbelievably. I wanted a basin application and was lucky to find this item on Amazon (would never have found it otherwise)......Thanks Amazon.    Attachment is very well made and the quik connection works great, not as effective as the shower unit but this is what I will use when I don&#x27;t take a shower before bed.</li>
    <li> Stop -- Buy the RediBreeze NOT the QuickBreeze! I bought the QuickBreeze and it leaked at the faucet connection AND at the head connection area for starters... secondly, this unit will block a facet unless you snap it off and on each day... AND you have NO WAY of adjusting the water temperature or pressure of the jet without making a bloody mess of your bathroom - trust me... what a poor poor design!!! My RediBreeze does not leak... a quick flick of switch and you can turn on and off the water jet, adjust temperature and pressure... it is a dream upgrade for anyone who owns a QuickBreeze or the place to start for an educated consumer... hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This QuickBreeze Irrigator is wonderful for people with braces.  Installation was a snap.  I can blast my teeth and braces clean with warm water in no time - I&#x27;m usually amazed at how many little bits of food I knock loose, even right after brushing.  Temperature and pressure is easily controlled by the faucet handle.  I can squirt my girlfriend with it from across the room!  It detaches easily and goes out of sight into a drawer when I&#x27;m not using it, so my counter stays uncluttered.  And talk about great customer service -- a few months after purchasing it, I received an email from the company offering to send me a free reinforced hose replacement because the original hose had received some complaints.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a oral irrigator that didn&#x27;t cost too much money. I figured, the QuickBreeze would be a good choice because I could take the irrigator off of my faucet after each use. I had no problem switching my old faucet aerator to the one that was provided. I have been using the QuickBreeze for about a week now and I think it&#x27;s great! For the price, it is worth it. This thing is not made of cheap plastic! Also, the part that hooks up to the faucet is metal, so I believe this thing will be lasting for a long time.   After I had placed my order, I received instructions on how to install and use the QuickBreeze. Also, they sen&#x27;t me a free toothpaste squeezer along with my order.  NOTE:  - If you want an oral irrigator that you can easily remove from your faucet after each use, get the QuickBreeze.   - If you want an oral irrigator that stays on the faucet at all times, get the RediBreeze.</li>
    <li> I have 6 different bathroom faucets in my house and doesn&#x27;t fit on any. I was really looking forward to this too. Waste of time of money, pretty disappointed not gonna lie.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) No reservoir to get dirty/gross like the competition.&lt;br /&gt;2) No refills of a reservoir necessary due to the fact it&#x27;s directly attached to your faucet!&lt;br /&gt;3) Easy (very) to install.&lt;br /&gt;4) Company emailed me a PDF file with installation instructions and tips on use separate from those included with the actual product. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;5) Money-back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;6) Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;7) Made in USA (for those of you in which that&#x27;s a concern)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible Issues/Cocnerns:&lt;br /&gt;1) I have no idea what the differences in attachment colors are other than the basic knowledge that the stream/spray sizes differ. (Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.) Product images show yellow/green being shipped with product. I received blue/red.&lt;br /&gt;2) Even with low water pressure (which is how it should be used), it can make a small mess and result in spray outside of your sink. (In my case, all over my mirror). Best to have head down and get it into your mouth fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you order the QuickBreeze, be aware that you will have to remove it from your faucet after _every_ use. The RediBreeze (which I would have ordered instead had I paid more attention) had a knob that allowed you to switch between regular tap and irrigator functions -- quite a bit simpler.</li>
    <li> This irrigator is a necessity when you have braces. Easy to use, practical, does not take any space in your bathroom - it&#x27;s just a short string that fits into a drawer. I can take it with me when traveling because in some cases I can fit it in hotel bathrooms, including Caribbean faucets. I&#x27;m an adult wearing braces and prefer to clean up my mouth every time I eat. This is the most efficient way to do it. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing and very high quality product. It is a version of a water pik that you will use every day because it is so convenient. No filling, no batteries or charging or looking for an outlet. Just snap it on and go to town. And because there is no silly timer that shuts it off, spend all the time you need to get the job done right. Not only did they include a dvd, but also e-mailed me a pdf file for more complete information.  Ditch the cheap, flimsy water pik and get one of these. Simple to install and to use.</li>
    <li> The company sent me this QuickBreeze after the RediBreeze didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I only have one bathroom, so leaving the RediBreeze on the faucet didn&#x27;t look very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QuickBreeze is easy to take on and off, has good water pressure, and generally works the same as the countertop models.  I haven&#x27;t met an irrigator of any type (faucet or countertop) that doesn&#x27;t make a huge watery mess around the sink, but at least this one doesn&#x27;t require tons of set-up and filling time!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product at all! It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do as far as cleaning my teeth goes. The attachment did not fit on either of my bathroom sinks, even though they are both standard faucets. I had to put it in my kitchen, which is very inconvenient. It is also really difficult to control the pressure with this product. The pressure is either too low or WAY too high. There is not really an in between.</li>
    <li> If you forget to turn off the tap before taking it out of your mouth it sprays everywhere. A simple valve would make it so much more pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;That said, installation was a breeze - though there were many &#x27;bits&#x27; in the box that I couldn&#x27;t find a use for - and it does seem to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I have only just received this device so perhaps I will learn to make less mess.&lt;br /&gt;4/&#x27;14 2 years after buying the &#x27;Oral Breeze&#x27; I have indeed learned to make less mess, though a simple on/off tap would be nice. What I can say is that ALL of my gingival pockets have receded to normal - even the 5&#x27;s have become 3&#x27;s with no evidence of inflammation or infection.&lt;br /&gt;And since chronic dental infection seems to increase the chance of heart disease and higher dental bills, this might be the best $25 I have ever spent!</li>
    <li> Easy to install. The water pick feels more like you are taking a water hose to your teeth. If you are use to waterpik, this pick will not have the same force or as tight of a stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having lots of problems with waterpik failing shortly so I tried this but I have since figured out the waterpik problem. The spring on the button lock on the waterpik. You can read my waterpik review for more details.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a handheld battery operated unit that died after very little use. Simply a faucet attachment, hose, and sprayer tip. The unit comes with 2 and I ordered 2 more.  It attached in seconds and unattaches just as quickly. It works with the water from your faucet, so there is nothing to refill. No batteries, takes up a small amount of space, and works quietly (just the sound of running water).  I&#x27;d love to get the shower attachment as well, but I already have a handheld showerhead that won&#x27;t accommodate a side attachment like an ordinary showerhead will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very impressed with the prompt, courteous, and informative customer service. I got emails with instructions for installing it, and the offer of a free adaptor if the unit didn&#x27;t fit my sink faucet. There were also oral hygiene pointers. The product came in the smallest possible box, also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes all the bells and whistles are unnecessary, as is the case with a product like this. It simply does what it is supposed to do, for a reasonable price. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy from Oral Breeze again or recommend their products to anyone.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I purchase a oral irrigator.  I looked at various systems and read the reviews.  I saw this one and purchased it May 2007.  It still works well today.  I brush, floss and then use the QuickBreeze.  I have had no problems with it and it&#x27;s easy to use.  The small price is well worth the investment in your dental care!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. The hookup and instructions are easy to follow. I use it in the morning and just before bedtime. The minor dental irritations that I had like sensitive teeth, gum and pallet pain are gone. I should have got this product a long time ago. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I returned a Water Pik after reading reviews. That noisy, cheap and vibrating hunk is gone. The Oral Breeze device is pure quality and I enjoy using it. It does what it does very well and without all the noise. And it&#x27;s guaranteed for life. Thanks Oral Breeze.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;The Oral Breeze works better than described. I wish I had ordered one many  years ago. It is easy to use and keeps my mouth clean. It does an excellent  job of stimulating my gums and cleans inside the gum line.  If you use this  irrigator on your tongue you will not neet to use a tongue brush. Also I   don&#x27;t know how they mailed it to me so quickly..\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I had braces and a palate splitter 20 years ago, and my orthodontist gave me a product just like this, which even had a bulbous device inline on the hose that created water pulses at an adjustable frequency. I used it religiously, but finally my last tip broke and I can not find a replacement tip (WaterPik and Interplak tips don&#x27;t fit), and sadly the orthodontist is gone. I thought - no problem by now the internet will have dozens of these things... wrong. Still, this product fits the bill just fine, with a few negatives:    - No pulsing of water, just a continuous stream (the 20 year old one has it).  - No rotary action on the tip head to allow easier angling within the mouth (the 20 year old one has it).  - Why, after 20 years, is there no other company making competing products? My dentist says there is an inherent danger to using the pressure of a normal faucet on the gum line. In particular, make the pressure low before putting it in the mouth, and the stream should _never_ be pointed down into the gums, but instead up from the gums toward the teeth to avoid impacting material between the teeth and gums. I think that&#x27;s why the big name products have resorted to lower and lower pressure, despite how inconvenient they are. Ok, so were people damaging their gums and that&#x27;s why the sink connected ones don&#x27;t seem to be out there any more???</li>
    <li> We have used many \\&quot;water pick\\&quot; type irrigators over the years.  This little gem puts them all to shame.  The design is ingenious, the quality of materials used is first rate and installation is very easy. Most importantly, the thing works like a charm and it does so without the noise associated with a motorized irrigator. An added advantage is that it can be packed easily in your luggage and used while you are away from home.  We are pleased with the product and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> ...how smart is this thing?  Low tech, high function. So simple and well designed. It just works. Well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this oral irrigator for about a year and a half. I love it. It is easy to use, simple to adjust the flow and water temp. and I have not had any problems with it. I use it everyday and it does a great job, especially on my bridgework. Now I am looking for a portable to take when I travel.</li>
    <li> Liked this so much, I got another for someone else.  Easy to install, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a bunch of different styles of waterpiks and oral irrigators over the years and this one is pretty handy.  My favorite by far is the kind that attaches to the shower head, but if that&#x27;s not possible, this one is the next best thing.  You just slide it onto the faucet, turn the water on to the pressure you want, and then use it.  When you&#x27;re done, you slide it back off and hide it away in a drawer.  Super cool.</li>
    <li> The item is very good when it is in use-------------my problem is the \\&quot;so called\\&quot; Quick disconnect &amp; Quick connect. It takes me about 5minutes to attach the product to the ring attached to the faucet.I have a MOEN unit in my bathroom &amp; it is pretty new</li>
    <li> I never owned a water pik before... wasnt sure if after I got it I would continue to use it.  But it&#x27;s so easy and I like the way it makes my mouth feel after I use it.  I&#x27;ve been very good at using it every night before bed.  Well worth the price. Fast shipping.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It delivers everything it promised. Easy to use and store. Hope my dentist is as impressed as I am.    UPDATE:  I have been using this product for 4 months now and just came back from a teeth cleaning.  My hygenist was most impressed with the improved health of my gums and was going to research the product herself.  If you have problems with gum pockets and brushing and flossing alone don&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick, I can wholeheartedly recommend this product.  I particularly enjoy being able to adjust the pressure and temperature of the water since I have some sensitivity to temperature.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  Gets tons of stuff out of your teeth that both brushing and flossing don&#x27;t.  My gums/teeth have never been in better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR FLOSSING.  It will not do the same thing.  It is a fantastic supplement to it.  I brush+floss+irrigate all together, in that order.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have a oral irrigation product, but didn&#x27;t want it sitting out on the sink all the time. I found this product, and the reviews were almost universally positive. I agree with those who say it is well made, and my husband was very impressed with the materials used. It&#x27;s made to last.  I love that you can get the pressure as soft or as strong as you like, and it&#x27;s very simple to put on and off the faucet. I&#x27;m anxious to go the dentist in a couple of weeks to see if he can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> This device is so convenient I use it after every meal.  I always found the other kind messy and a pain, but this is just so easy. It&#x27;s very easy to dis-engage it from the sink faucet for other uses.  Just a really great product, and I wish I had it years ago. Can&#x27;t wait to see what my hygienist says next time I see her.  You know you should use a water pik - now this one makes it easy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best product I purchased ever! I always dislike flossing but this product change all that! It is very easy to use and I can adjust the strength of the spray. It does not require electricity and it works! I find I am using this water pik multiple times a day and my gum is thanking me everyday. Thank you Oral Breeze for inventing this product:)</li>
    <li> I wondered if all the positive reviews were from real customers, because the product sounded too good to be true. It is great, easy to install, simple to use, and very effective. I was concerned about the 16\\&quot; hose but it&#x27;s not too short. Don&#x27;t hesitate; buy the Oral Breeze; you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I bought my Oral Breeze back in 2008.  I am in my third year as an adult in braces, and I can&#x27;t imagine doing without it.  I find it far superior to the reservoir-type systems that I tried first.  The faucet adapter is easy to install, and the product is hassle-free to use.  I especially like the fact that you can vary the pressure to suit your needs more than with a reservoir unit.  My dentist told me I have the gums of a 30 year old (I am 54).  I attribute that fact to my Oral Breeze.</li>
    <li> OralBreeze is an excellent product. Works great, well-made, and is very easy to use, once I figured out the instructions. Perhaps the instructions should be reworded for easier comprehension; or maybe I&#x27;m just a dim bulb. The only thing I would recommend would be to first wrap faucet threads (if attaching the OralBreeze to the outside of the faucet) with Teflon tape. Voila! Perfect.</li>
    <li> I would love to see a product like this which actually works.  The idea is terrific and as such would like to see more R &amp; D.  The seller refunded the purchase price but made no effort whatsoever in assisting to make the product work.  It would not attach to my particular bathroom faucet so I attached it to the kitchen faucet where it attached perfectly and did not spray me or my clothing from where it was attached to the faucet but sent a powerful spray all over me, my clothes and the kitchen from locations in the mechanism itself which could not be tightened to stop the spray out the sides of the mechanism.  I hoped the manufacturer/seller which is the same entity could help with the problem so it could be used but instead they ignored my attempts to make it work w/o spraying me in the process &amp; simply refunded the purchase price.  Great idea, faulty product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  There are no motors or bulky reservoirs to take up space on the sink.  The pressure is enough and more, simply controlled by adjusting the water pressure from the faucet.  You may also remove the hose contraption and store it, leaving your normal faucet intact.    Products like this support my idea that simple is often better.</li>
    <li> Product is very well made and works exactly as described!!!  Would recommend to anyone in the market for such a product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know teeth could feel this clean. What an amazing product!  You will make a mess until you get a feel for it, but great ceasers ghost, this thing is amazing. Easy install, fast delivery, and the price is worth it. Heavy duty one handed attachment fits on almost any sink (I haven&#x27;t come across one it wont fit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not really explain how much I love this thing.  I told my girlfriend I want to marry it. Yes its that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****REVIEW PART 2*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I love this thing.  I have 2 now (1 in each state I visit).  It leaves your mouth so clean it feels like a trip to the dentist office, at night, in my bathroom.  Also if you are feeling a little daring one day, you can turn up the power, slightly, and really knock all that crap out between your teeth.  I bet this thing could take paint off a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> \\&quot; Excellent product!, no container on your counter, does not use electricity, does a fantastic job!.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This item did not fit my bathroom sink.  I had to attach it to my kitchen sink, which is not what I wanted.  It works well, but I can&#x27;t use it in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Solid, beautifully manufactured product. Exceeded my expectations by a mile. Works extremely well. I will never go  back to the vibrating reservoir tank oral irrigator. Customer service is exceptional!</li>
    <li> I agree with all the positive comments so won&#x27;t repeat them...however, I want to add that after you do your oral cleaning, simply point this down toward the sink and the amazing thing will power wash your sink for you...also used it to power wash the gunk from around a ridged juice bottle cover!  I know, not what it was intended for, but hey, it&#x27;s a multi-purpose tool...might as well use it for what it does well.</li>
    <li> When my dentist said I should be using an oral irrigator because of my aversion to flossing, I bought and tried a cordless similar product. It was bigger than I expected it to be and hard to handle because I have small hands and arthritis. Then I bought this little gem. WOW! There&#x27;s no tank to refill (I had to refill the 7-oz waterpik tank 7 times for one cleaning), no batteries to wear out (rechargeable or otherwise) and it takes up very little space. You can adjust the pressure to whatever you like (not just \\&quot;high\\&quot; or \\&quot;low\\&quot;)  I just run the water until it&#x27;s the right temp, turn it off and attach the &#x27;Breeze, and away I go! Got to remember to put the tip in your mouth before turning the water back on :-)  I highly recommend this for anyone who hates flossing and isn&#x27;t really fond of other oral irrigators.  It takes about 2 seconds to attach and detach on the faucet.  So happy I found this!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different oral devices. This is perfect for me. No need for an electric outlet and it is engineered perfectly to last. Another brand I used needed replacement every few months.You will be pleased with this device.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;HONEST,QUICK,Cares about customer,Very rare Today,I had a small prolbem, I called &amp; replasment part was sent right a way! I have purchested more for christmas presents.GREAT PRODUCT,GREAT SERVICE!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> i was impressed by the minimalist packaging and ease of installation. but best, i love the way it works. i was a waterpik user for years and when my pik and i were temporarily separated, i decided to try the quickbreeze. i am telling people about this amazing little thing that is portable and takes up no counter space. also, i love the way it makes my mouth feel. an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This item is very useful. I have never used a waterpik before, so I have nothing to compare it to. The very first time I used this product, my teeth felt immensely better. My gums had been very sore and tender, so I couldn&#x27;t even brush them. After using this item, me gums felt instantly better, and I was able to brush my teeth and gums without pain. The shipping was very fast, and the seller was very efficient in their delivery and making sure I received my item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned or used a Waterpick, so I can&#x27;t offer any comparisons. But I can say that I chose to buy the Oral Breeze over a Water Pick, because of the fact that it is simpler, smaller, doesn&#x27;t use electricity, and is just generally more convenient. I bought it on a whim, and I am VERY happy with my purchase. I think it&#x27;s actually a really good product. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on Amazon, if that gives you an idea of how much I like it.    Yes, you do have to get used to how it works, and finding a pressure that works for you does take a little time. But not much. And my gums have improved SO much. I have a permanent retainer in the bottom of my mouth (just a few permanent brackets) and I can&#x27;t floss there. So much better. And so are the rest of my gums. I should say, though, that I floss in addition to using the irrigator. I haven&#x27;t tried just the irrigator, but I know that it is helping because I used to floss consistently before getting it and my gums are way less inflamed.    Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> 1. Instructions are poor.  Included are 3 plastic adapters but no explanation of what to do with them.  I suppose it is to fit non-standard faucets.    2. I found a faucet that the unit would attach to.  However, once you attach the main unit and turn the water on, it separates from the faucet adapter at higher pressures or just dribbles out at the connection site at lower pressures.  I ended up trying to support the unit with one hand while pushing the yellow wand around my mouth with the other.    3. It hurts my gums even at low pressure.  I guess I&#x27;m just used to flossing.  I noticed no evidence of cleaning.  That is, not a single particle of debris appeared in the sink.    4. I called the manufacturer&#x27;s support #.  It is only an answering machine promising to return the call.  No answer so far[[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze, Oral Irrigator]]</li>
    <li> This seller wass great!  They sent me an email on how to use the Quick Breeze before I ever received it.  They were very prompt in shipping.  A thoroughly enjoyable purchase.  Now, after using the Quick Breeze for several months, I can say it is even better than I had hoped for.  Well made, easy to use and makes teeth and gum care actually enjoyable.  Worth six stars, no, make that ten.    Frank T.</li>
    <li> The OralBreeze line is an immense improvement over the WaterPik-type dental irrigator for several reasons:     - no countertop unit to take up valuable space  - no electricity needed, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a free outlet that is close to the sink, or rig up an extension cord  - an infinite water supply;  there is no tank, so you never need to pause and refill it  - immediately adjustable water temperature (more than once I have had to dump out my old WaterPik tank because the water was too hot or too cold)  - quieter operation because there is no motor  - greener/smaller carbon footprint/more sustainable/less to ultimately end up in a landfill, since it basically just consists of a hose, a dental tip, and some metal clamps and washer, and as mentioned in another context above, it uses no electricity    I bought the QuickBreeze variety, which clamps on and off the faucet to an aerator that screws in to replace the standard one on the bathroom sink, and basically functions normally when the QuickBreeze is not in use.  There is also a model called the RediBreeze, which stays connected to the sink all the time but has a switch that allows you to shift between it and the faucet, and a shower model, which allows you to perform at least two of your hygiene routines at once.    It was remarkably easy to install.  A small wrench was required to remove the old aerator, possibly because it had been in place so long that it was partially corroded, but this one screwed into place easily by hand.      Water pressure is adjustable by hand, just as temperature is, and I found it every bit as forceful -- or not, as is your wont -- as an adjustable WaterPik.    The only improvement I could suggest would be to change the tip design mount so that it could take WaterPik tips, and vice versa, since they are more readily available, but I suppose there are proprietary reasons why that will never happen.    (Oh, and kudos to the OralBreeze company, from whom I bought it through Amazon, for dispatching it so rapidly.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dental irrigator for a month. I like it&#x27;s simplicity and the fact that there is no tank to sit on my bathroom counter that will need constant cleaning. If this device had a simple on/off button on the end of the hose, as does another similar produce I saw on Amazon, it&#x27;s get an additional star from me. Not being able to control the water flow at all except with the sink handle is significant issue in use, but not a deal breaker.    I did find that the connector (same type as on portable dishwashers) only attaches in one position so you have to line it up just right, which is not mentioned in the instructions. This took me a week of frustrating attempts late at night to discover.     But it&#x27;s the lack of on/off that make this device messy. It&#x27;s hard not to get showered a bit by it.  I also agree with another reviewer that it is overpriced for what it is.    But still it&#x27;s worth trying this or some sort of irrigator, because it&#x27;s certainly better to have clean gums and wet pajamas than dental bills.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Oral Breeze a year ago upon the advice of my dentist, who recommended an irrigator to preempt periodontal problems.  Although I was generally very pleased with the product, there was a problem with the connector between the sprayer and the hose.  I called customer service and within three days I had not one, but two, improved-design replacement parts. After using the Oral breeze for a year, I purchased a second device for my second home.  I couldn&#x27;t happier with Oral Breeze--simple, user-friendly, effective, and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a water-pik, but it does do a pretty good job and eliminates the bulky unit on your counter.  After a few months of use, it became more and more   difficult to remove the unit from the faucet.  If you accidently turn on the water while its attached, it spins and sends water everywhere.  The product could be much improved if it had a switch valve so you could leave it in place and still use the faucet.</li>
    <li> WARNING: a majority of reviews for this product is FAKE, FAKE, FAKE. Most of these supposed \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; have reviewed only one product and such a glowing review at that!!    They send you $10 worth of metal fittings and plastic tubes. Even at low pressure, it will flood your mouth with too much water so that you will spend the entire time bent over the sink with water gushing out of your mouth. After all this, no evidence of significant cleaning. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean the way it does with Waterpik. That&#x27;s because you cannot achieve a high pressure with QuickBreeze unless you are willing to put up with all that water coming out of it.    The company&#x27;s money back guarantee is worthless. You will have to go through Amazon to return this product. If you call the company&#x27;s 800 number, you will reach an answering machine. Your calls won&#x27;t be returned, of course.</li>
    <li> I had had a gum pocket which I tried to treat with dental loss with no success for  three months last year.  At times my teeth would bleed badly with bacterial infection during flossing. I started worrying that I would lose my teeth. But as soon as I started using this dental oral irrigator, the problem has disappeared in two weeks. This is an excellent investment for overall health.</li>
    <li> I would give this product 6 stars if I could. I have braces and, to make matters worse I broke my right dominant wrist. My arm and my thumb are in a cast which makes regular flossing impossible. I actually bought this product before my accident and it is a life saver. I used to hate flossing because it took me so long and I was always left with bleeding gums. I can now waterfloss in less than  a minute. I love it!!!! It was very easy to install and user friendly! The price is lovely and the effects are amazing!   This is one of the must haves, especialyy if you wear braces!</li>
    <li> I installed the QuickBreeze in under 5 minutes.  The design is simple and elegant.  It is easy to use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The Oral breeze Qquick Breeze is a fine product . It is even better than I expected. It is well made, easy to install and does a great job. Much better tan the electric powered irrigators that I had used in the past. A fine buy for the money.</li>
    <li> The Oral Breeze irrigators are excellent--more effective than flossing, and my kids actually use it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric counter top oral irrigator. This oral irrigator is so much better, easier to use, quiet operating and the water stream is adjustable to a comfortable pressure, everything I&#x27;ve been looking for.  And as a plus, the item was delivered a couple of days ahead of the projected delivery date, well packaged.</li>
    <li> Did not fit on my sink but I will keep it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and have found this tool to be not too useful in getting rid of the plaque.  It is good for getting food particles between the teeth.    If your goal is to replace and to supplement dental floss, I would recommend skipping this item and stick with dental floss.    After using this product, I am still able to see plaque on my tooth and eventually have to use floss to do the majority of the work.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these, it worked very well (and was built very sturdy), but I returned it and bought a Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for one reason: The Waterpik site cites studies that show their &#x27;pulsating&#x27; action works better than straight flow. I asked the QuickBreeze folks about this, but got no reply. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter that much, but I&#x27;d rather have something that works better, no?</li>
    <li> My QuickBreeze arrived quicker than I thought it would. As an adult, I just had braces put on, and fortunately for me, my QuickBreeze arrived the same day. I purchased this over other oral irrigators due to its high level of customer satisfaction. It hooked up easily and works great!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I use it every day and I can see an improvement in my teeth and gums! LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around and did research before selecting the QuickBreeze as the oral irrigator for me. I liked the idea of it not having to fill up a reservoir over and over. With the quick breeze you have a continuous flow of water with different temperatures. I also like how it does not take up sink space. You can tuck it away in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate to floss (like me) get this product! I find it so much easier to just use the QuickBreeze and then brush and im done! I dont floss anymore....this product is 100 times more effective than floss anyways! :)</li>
    <li> The QuickBreeze does an incredible job, much better than the self contained models that are a whole lot more expensive! The only downsides are: 1. The unit doesn&#x27;t have an on/off feature, when the water is flowing it&#x27;s on making it quite a bit messier to use than the self contained models. 2. Since the unit attaches directly to the faucet and has no basin, you can&#x27;t add any mouthwash or debriding agent to the water you&#x27;re flossing with. Still, I love this product and would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> The Quick Breeze is every bit as good as most reviewers have rated it.  It arrived in just a couple of days (using Standard Shipping) and in a tiny box smaller than the ones checkbook refills come in.    While the instructions were indeed not the best, we figured it out OK.  Installing was quick and easy, and we even have taken it on a visit to our daughter&#x27;s house, and used it there easily.    It takes no space, makes no noise, requires no electricity or batteries, requires no cleaning afterwards, gives water that&#x27;s easily temperature-controlled via sink faucets, varies the water pressure by using the faucets, and it does its job well-- flushing food particles from teeth that already SEEMED to be clean.    Our only caution is to be sure the wand remains in your mouth while the water is turned on, to avoid water spraying out.  Overall, a great product, a reasonable price, quick delivery.  Top-notch.    We even recommended it to our dentist, who had advised us to get a Water-Pik in the first place, and he seemed very much interested in the Breeze&#x27;s alternative concept himself.</li>
    <li> I am so tickled with this purchase that I have to add my kudos even though I have nothing new to add.  This device is so cleverly simple.  No tank to clutter the sink top.  No fuss, no muss.  Lovely.    I had bought the Waterpik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet from my dentist less than a year ago.  It recently died, which was fine because having to refill the tank a couple of times per use and struggling to clean out all the debris that got stuck in all its nooks and crannies were irritating.  I had noticed the QuickBreeze a while ago and was happy to have an excuse to switch to it.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.    Addition:  I&#x27;ve read the concerns of those who found the hose too inflexible.  The hose is, indeed, firm.  Having now used this for a while, though, I don&#x27;t see the problem.  One has to rotate the hose only 180 degrees back and forth when switching from inside to outside to inside.  It is easily flexible enough for that.</li>
    <li> This product is simple to install and performs the same function as much more expensive options. It takes up no counter space and eliminates the need for cleaning reservoir. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It hooks up easily enough, but it leaks! Where the water pik hooks into the tubing, and where you hold it, water leaks out.  I checked, and double checked, it is firmly snapped in place.  I finally used some duct tape to try to seal it.  I am in a wheelchair, and the water was managing to travel up my arm and into my sleeve.  I finally gave up and got a new waterpik.</li>
    <li> I had to return this and went with the Hydrofloss. The good news is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s compact and comes with a nice aerator head for the faucet. And the price is low.    The bad news is that it&#x27;s almost impossible to control without making a mess. There&#x27;s no on/off valve so you have to turn your faucet on to adjust the strength of flow and temperature. Then you put the jet in your mouth spraying all over the place and when you take it out of your mouth again it again makes a mess all over the sink. It&#x27;s even hard to control inside your mouth.    The Hydrofloss, even though it takes more counter space is just much more practical.</li>
    <li> Oral breeze arrived promptly, and was a quick installation.&lt;br /&gt;A lot less hassle than using a previous water pik which I got maybe a year&#x27;s use before the hose crimped and restricted water flow.&lt;br /&gt;Love that you can store the Oral breeze in a cabinet drawer taking up minimal space and it&#x27;s lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my next peridontal cleaning will show improvement.</li>
    <li> Convenient because there is no motor to plug in, no water tank to clean, takes less space. You cannot leave it attached to the faucet if you intend to use it as a regular faucet, so it must be detached. No pulsating action so you have to be careful not to turn it too high, and you really need to detach it and let the water run to get the proper temperature. You&#x27;ll need a washcloth or some other clean place to lay it when not in use. Seems a bit pricey, still I prefer it to a plug-in model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my QuickBreeze for about 3 weeks now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was unable to install, but their excellent customer service called me and resolved the problem&lt;br /&gt;by mailing me an adapter (at no charge!).&lt;br /&gt;Installation took all of about one minute.&lt;br /&gt;One more brief thing:  I was concerned about mold build-up in my Waterpik, so I did break open the handle&lt;br /&gt;in order to look inside.  Even though I had been trying to carefully maintain it, (running a vinegar solution through it,&lt;br /&gt; and trying to always pump out all the water after each usage) it wasn&#x27;t pretty.&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s unit was the same.  In a word, Disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;Ergo, the QuickBreeze for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Waterpik for many years, and it does a nice job, but in my opinion, it does have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;The inside components are sealed, and therefore never completely dry, and consequently,&lt;br /&gt;regardless of how it&#x27;s maintained, mold may be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Of course this is my own experience, and others may differ.&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this review is not meant as a put-down to the Waterpik, but a testimonial&lt;br /&gt;for the QuickBreeze.&lt;br /&gt;06/30/2015 Update to first review:  I&#x27;m still using my QuickBreeze daily and getting fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;Developed a small hose leak that easily fixed with the expert guidance of customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot more to say--Janet in customer service still the best and great product!</li>
    <li> I have no experience with oral instigators, so I have nothing with which to compare this product. I decided upon this unit because of all the terrible reviews of everything else and the mostly good reviews of this one. I have a very sensitive tooth that screams at me if it touches anything cold. So it is essential that I get the temperature warm enough before I put the device on the faucet. Once the device is on the faucet (a fairly quick and easy maneuver), it is a little problematic to set the temp. Meanwhile, a pretty powerful jet of water is coming out, and sprays the bottom of the sink, and often a fine mist splatters all over the counter-top. Then, you have to get it into your mouth without turning it in any direction or you will wet the whole bathroom. I also find that the spray sometimes makes me feel like I&#x27;m gagging, but I&#x27;ll readily admit that this may be just a personal idiosyncrasy. It does seem to wash things our pretty thoroughly, particularly under my bridge. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Simple, uncomplicated product with no motors or moving parts.  Very easy to install and use.  I used motorized gum irrigators for years - I&#x27;ll never go back to that.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Took me a few seconds to install on my faucet, but it was rather easy.  Very impressed with the design and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take up my precious counter space.</li>
    <li> After three gum surgeries and multiple crowns, I started irrigating my gums and teeth twice a day with Quick Breeze. It&#x27;s now been years since I had a cavity or gum problems. I&#x27;ve now recommended this product to several of my friends!</li>
    <li> I considered getting the Waterpik but was turned off by 1) the cost and 2) the reviews on its poor build quality. After reading all the rave reviews on the QuickBreeze, I decided to give this a try and ordered 2 units - 1 for me and 1 for the parents.    I just received my QuickBreeze and I love it.     Apart from the initial difficulty unscrewing the &#x27;aerator&#x27; from my tap, I had no trouble installing the product. The instructions say that the supplied adaptor works with all standard US faucets. I can now verify that this has worked on my 2 run-of-the-mill faucets in Singapore so I suppose it is pretty much universal!    My mum squealed at the ticklish sensation when she first used it but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll get used to it. As for me, it seems to be doing a pretty good job so far.    I like this product and it has my thumbs up!:)</li>
    <li> This is my second OralBreeze product and I love the new design that lets me easily remove the device from the faucet.  Since there is no on-off toggle, you do have to pay attention not to spray water everywhere but it is designed to last without leaking.  The old design started leaking after a year or so, especially with very hard water. I&#x27;d have been happy to simply replace it but was delighted to see this version and am glad I gave it a try.  In either case, it&#x27;s much better than having an electric device to pump water for rinsing your gums - those things are messy, clumsy, unsanitary, take up too much space, AND have to be replaced regularly.  I had three of them before I found OralBreeze and I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the perfect solution to clean teeth and not too much space used on my bathroom counter at a great price.  My first problem was installing it.  The spout of my faucet is inside the fixture and I couldn&#x27;t get it screwed in.  I tried attachments too.  After a couple of days, my son helped out - it did fit my spout, but needed very strong fingers to get it on.  It worked fine for a couple of weeks, then water began coming out of the tool even though the lever was in the down position as directed.  Now it is good only for cleaning toothpaste out of the sink.  I have sent emails to this company asking for help with both of these problems.  There was never an acknowledgement of either email or a solution to my problems.  I&#x27;m going to disassemble this and order the WaterPik Ultra - a more dependable product.  I should have done this in the first place instead of dumping the cost of this irrigator.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to start using an irrigator for my teeth and gums for while but could never seem to bring myself to buy a bulky water-pik style unit.  When I saw this product, I had to give it a try.  I started out with the Redi-Breeze, which is a permanently attached unit with a lever valve that diverts the water from the aerator to the irrigator.  The unit I had had a couple of problems and I contacted them to process an exchange.  Before I sent in the unit, I realized that the OralBreeze is fully removable.  I asked the company if it was OK for me to swap the RediBreeze for the OralBreeze and they said &#x27;sure&#x27;.  I received the OralBreeze and installed it in minutes.  It is wonderful.  When I am not using it, I can detach it from the faucet and have a regular aerator.  A quick snap and I have my irrigator ready to go.  The product works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t have the bulky and awkward counter-top unit with a tank.  The most challenging aspect of using the unit is getting the pressure adjusted, but that&#x27;s not hard once you get used to it.  I also must say the company was excellent to work with.  They even sent me an email before I got the initial unit with instructions on how to install it.  This was a home run in every way, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> No motor to break down or make noise. Does a fine job. Small and easy to store, and clicks into place effortlessly. Other than the tubing and the mouth piece, it&#x27;s all metal and should last. Wow!</li>
    <li> I am amazed by the quality of customer service that this company provides and would highly recommend this product if for no other reason than that. However there is no need to base my positive opinion on just there service because the product is very well made and performs exactly as advertised.  I would heartily recommend purchasing one to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this item.  My Waterpik stopped working so I thought I would take it apart to see if it was clogged.  I figured it was broken so what i the harm in taking it apart. Ever see what is inside of the Waterpik? Black mold! The entire inside was covered in mold. Do you want to spray mold in your mouth?  Didn&#x27;t think so.  After seeing the inside I decided to buy the Oral Irrigator. Now I do not have to be afraid of getting electrocuted when I charge it, it does not need batteries, and I am not spraying mold in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent simple idea, wish I thought it first and should use it more than I actually do.</li>
    <li> Wow. It was shipped quickly by the seller, and it came in a tiny box. (It was so small that I wondered if something was missing - nothing was.) Like they said, it is a simple design, and it installed quite easily. The instructions in the PDFs that come on the tiny CD and on the web site weren&#x27;t that great to be honest (it&#x27;s like someone sat down and did it in MS Word or something), but I figured it out on my own pretty fast. The video on the site was more helpful.    On the power of the stream: When they say turn on the water slowly, they&#x27;re not kidding... This thing shoots FAR and with a lot of pressure. When I turned on just the cold about halfway, it shot across the bathroom. I turned around and shot my wife 10 feet away with no problem (other than having an upset wife :)). When you turn it on, aim it at the drain and turn it on slowly - or be prepared to super-soak something. Unlike some other irrigators that give you a set pressure, you have to figure out what pressure works for you. It would be nice to have just an \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; switch for starters with a pre-set, \\&quot;safe\\&quot; water pressure, but I can see how this pressure flexibility will pay off down the road.    After soaking myself and half the bathroom by accident, I tried it out for what it was intended, and it worked well on the gums, etc.. If you want to clean out the back of your throat or around your tonsils for some reason, it works pretty well too, but that attempt brought up the only obvious downside - the hose is too short. I wanted to stand up and look in my mouth to see what I was doing but I couldn&#x27;t. They cut it down to a minimum length (maybe 24\\&quot;), assuming 1) that you will be bending over every time you use this tool, and 2) that extra 12\\&quot; when it wasn&#x27;t being used would&#x27;ve taken up more sinktop space, but that shortcoming was frustrating. Maybe I&#x27;ll learn to appreciate the shorter length down the road, but that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t give an otherwise good product a 5 star rating.    I&#x27;ve read how some people want to add extra chemicals to the water they shoot in, and it is true that you can&#x27;t do that with this tool, but that&#x27;s not going to be important to a majority of users.    Bottom line: I&#x27;m pleased with the QuickBreeze - it was the right choice over other irrigators - but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
    <li> Did not replace the water pik.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install. FYI, I live in a newer home. Bought because my 12 year old son has braces and flossing is a challenge. His gums have gotten noticeably better. Just be prepared that they will make a water mess for a while while you get used to it. Yes this means water on the ceiling. Removing it is easy but he sometimes he forgets so you have to be careful or if you go turn on the faucet without removing it, it  will spray everywhere because it doesn&#x27;t have a valve shut off system.  The thingy that attaches to the faucet is real metal not plastic. Very durable. This product is so affordable and well made Im going to get the Shower Breeze too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t review many products that I buy from Amazon, only the ones that really impress me.  After about 2 years I am buying a second irrigator from Oral Breeze for my second home.   The non-replaceable hoses on my Water pik kept breaking so I tried this, only to find that not only does the hose not break, but I like the performance better.  I highly recommend this inexpensive device.</li>
    <li> This is too hard to adjust the water pressure and the temperature of the water.  The idea is ok and when I was a kid my sisters had something similar from the dentist for their braces and I kid you not, 45 years later it was still usable!  I used this one, though it was a pain to adjust, until it blew apart at the fittings.  There is nothing really holding the hose on to keep it from coming apart.  I was very careful with it, trying to keep the water pressure from being too hard but even that didn&#x27;t work.  I would just buy a contained unit if I were you.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 QuickBreezes, one back in June and the other one in Sept.  When I received the Sept package, I was surprised that it includes only 2 tips instead of 4 that came in the June package.  Also, the hose in the June order would sometimes come off under water pressure, while the hose in the Sept order was reinforced and works without problem.  I contacted Oral Breeze.  They promptly responded by informing me that they have sent out a package containing a replacement hose (reinforced) for my June order and 2 additional tips, which they included in their June special.  The package came after a few days.  I am very satisfied.  This is a company that stand behind their products and would go out of the way to make sure their customers are satisfied.  Bravo!!</li>
    <li> I order the wrong product and Oral Breeze was very responsive in solving my problem and send me a new product, very prompt and responsive seller. Would definitely recommend this product to everyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> Well made, easy on and off the faucet, you can control the force and temperature of the water. Price was right and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> great product. if they made one with a mechanism to control the water from the water jet area rather than the faucet controls, it would be a PERFECT product.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; water pick because from what I gathered, even the highest rated water picks fail after 6-12 months of use. Thinking back, my parents always used water picks but they seemed to constantly break or stop working properly.  I was a little weary of this but after using it for about a week, I can safely say I was not disappointed. Before the QuickBreeze was actually delivered, I got an email from the company containing instructions on how to install the product, and tips on the use of it.  When it was actually delivered, installation was simple...I just removed my old aerator and replaced it with the one that came with the QuickBreeze. The only trick is adjusting the water to find the right temperature and pressure.  So far so good though, it seems to do a good enough job cleaning between my teeth and gum line. Guess the real verdict will have to wait until my next dentist appointment. In any case, I am pretty pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I returned this product as it was difficult to set the right pressure/flow.&lt;br /&gt;The head design causes the water flow to tickle and sometimes that is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to getting a Classic Waterpik instead. The pulsing of the Waterpik seems much more effective in removing any debris caught in hard to get to places.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for an old \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot; machine that tried to do it all and broke down regularly. This new device makes use of standard plumbing and does a great job in cleaning my teeth. A great improvement.</li>
    <li> We also have a one that attaches to the shower head.  It&#x27;s nice not to have another electrical appliance sitting on the counter anywhere.  It tickles at first, but you get used to it. Teeth feel cleaner, mouth seems fresher, easier to keep dental implant area clean, would be great for braces too. Happy to support a veteran also - thanks for your service!</li>
    <li> This thing is so good, you will become addicted within a few days.   Installation is very easy and without any tools.  Because is very easy and quick to attach or disconnect the irrigator you will be actually using it.  With other systems you have to have electrical connection to use them and they clutter your vanity top.  This one can be easily disconnected and hidden.  It is great if you have braces.  Nice product.  The company is also easy to work with if you encounter problems.  There was a small problem I encountered with a tubing connector, I emailed them and the next day they had the part sent overnight to me.  Impressive!!!</li>
    <li> amazing water pressure…</li>
    <li> I have been a Waterpic user for years.  The last one (China Crap) was so cheaply made, I looked for alternatives and found the QuickBreeze product.  I wish I had known about this irrigator years ago.  It is well made, easy to use and keep clean.  The only downside is the chrome faucet attachment does not match my satin nickel finish faucet. Another upside is that it works!</li>
    <li> Very simple design but it doesn&#x27;t work like a pulsating irragator.  I used it once and removed it from the faucet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money...</li>
    <li> This is my first oral irrigator and I have no complaints thus far. The pressure can be hard on the gums but I control that with the right amount of water. I like that it&#x27;s so easy to use - one click to connect to the faucet and then one push to get it off the faucet - no need to clean water compartments and no battery needed!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Wow! Our family is LOVING this product. I had been pricing Water picks for a while, so glad I read reviews on this site! Less expensive than the competitors. No batteries or plugs are necessary, and it doesn&#x27;t need to take space on your counter. This product fits in the drawer, is simple to attach and take off, and easy to use. At first, we were misting the counter a bit, but now after 1 week experience, no extra water to clean up! Our gums are very happy! And they are SPEEDY, yikes it came within 2 days!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I bought it for my parents and myself, and we all love it! It is easy to install, no clunky parts, and works amazingly well! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love the oral irrigator because I can really adjust the pressure for cleaning between my teeth and massaging the gums, and it doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space.  This is especially nice for people with arthritis who have trouble using dental floss.</li>
    <li> This is the third Oral Breeze Irrigator I have bought, and all have worked great for me.  My dentist recommended getting one of these several years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using them daily ever since...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QuickBreeze is awesome because it can be put away, keeping your sink area neat, but still is so easy to reattach that it&#x27;s no hindrance to regular use whatsoever.  They&#x27;ve been making minor tweaks to the product over the years, and this latest model is definitely the best and easiest to use.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my daughter. This is HER review of the irrigator: \\&quot;So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it, thank you! It&#x27;s easy to use, works like it&#x27;s supposed to, and is easy to disassemble and put away. I&#x27;d recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is far more superior that the electric Water Pic...easy to install.  Easy to use.  Easy to store.</li>
    <li> SHIPPED &amp; DELIVERED PROMPTLY  The fittings installed easily on my Vanity&#x27;s faucet.  BUT I found regulation of the pressure very difficult and painful,  Also, I miss the pulsating action of a true Water-Pick:  I have the impression that the pulsating stream is more effective in loosening particles -- without pain.  I would have returned this item if it were not so cheap.  Returning it isn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. I would give it more stars if I could. I used it when I had braces and it was money well spent. I had used a water pik but that broke (stopped pumping) and because I needed to refill the resevoir 2-3 times every time I used it (according to my orthodontist, adults have more aversion to food stuck around braces than kids and teens), I looked for another product on Amazon that would hold enough water to last through my oral cleaning ritual. This device gives you access to an unlimited water supply and you can adjust the temperature at any time - how great is that? I was able to hook it up to my bathroom sink without help from my husband or his tool supply. When I first attached it I didn&#x27;t have it tight enough? and I had water running into the cabinet below my sink. I don&#x27;t know exactly how that happened but once I got it adjusted properly there have been no problems. It  came with several options for different styles of faucets, so if I ever move, it (and all the retained options) will go with me. [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator]]</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Oral Breeze. You have taken a revolutionary turn in dental hygiene. This product is so simple and quick to use, not to mention that it works just as well (personally I think better) than the expensive, bulky and loud machines that are on the market today.</li>
    <li> great design idea, works really well, flushes out food you didn&#x27;t know was there</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get used to it.  It installs easily.  You never know the adapter is on the faucet.  Well made!</li>
    <li> This broke almost immedaiytely in a way that was unrepairable.  The pressure of the watter forced the tube our of the connector to the piece that goes into your mouth.  I look at it sometimes (don&#x27;t ask why I haven&#x27;t thrown it out yet) and think, man, wouldn&#x27;t this be nice if it worked?  ::sigh::</li>
    <li> My dentist recently told me that I had excellent periodontal health (at age 75!) and wanted to know my secret.  I told him it was  the Oral Breeze.  This is my second purchase - so we can have a spare.  Both of us use it - will not be without it.</li>
    <li> As a longtime user of the tank variety of irrigator, I am even happier with the Quickbreeze.  No icky tanks, no cords, the ability to use warmish water with the turn of the tap, inexpensive--just excellent.  Easy to install and use.  There is one thing to remember, however--be sure to disengage the Quickbreeze from the faucet after using--the water sprays all over the place if you&#x27;re not on the ball.  But on the plus side, the jet can be used to clean all sorts of things--a mini pressure washer. This is going to be the holiday present I give to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had WaterPik&#x27;s since the 70&#x27;s and bought one of these little gadgets a few months ago after discovering it on Amazon. Now I&#x27;m through using the WaterPik and 100% happy with my QuickBreeze purchase. It&#x27;s so easy to install, they even supply Teflon tape for the threads. I tightened mine with only my fingers and it doesn&#x27;t leak a drop of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like the QuickBreeze model the best since it just snaps on when you want to use it. I keep it in a drawer by my sink and it&#x27;s out of the way when not in use. It takes 2 seconds to attach or detach. The fittings are good quality and the hose superior to WaterPik so it should last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tickles the first few times you use it, then just feels good. In the past I used the WaterPik at night before bed but this is so easy I find myself cleaning my teeth after every meal. In 1 minute your mouth and gums feel clean so it&#x27;s become addictive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that makes the device is impressive to. I travel overseas quite a bit and emailed them asking if they sold metric fittings for Asia. A nice lady wrote me back with news she was sending out the parts for overseas plumbing at no charge! I&#x27;m sold on the QuickBreeze and highly recommend it to anyone who wants strong healthy gums and no cavities!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d just like to add that after almost 2 years my QuickBreeze is still going strong. I use it faithfully everyday...the fittings, hose and tips are in good shape after all this time. It&#x27;s definitely made with quality. I highly recommend this device and company.</li>
    <li> Nice item with very helpful service dept. I needed an adapter for my faucet - and the correct one was sent expeditiously. Agree with one reviewer who siggest that the unit have a flow limiter so that an excessively strong stream would not be encountered. Also suggest that ifpossible, it could be made to give a pulsating flow which would be more pleasing. Certainly cleans well and the pop on pop off attachment is most useful.</li>
    <li> I love this product, so much more than my old water pik. It takes up less space, quicker to set up and put away, doesn&#x27;t require filling a tank reservoir and it&#x27;s quieter, with just as much cleaning power. Very, very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the ease of use. Hook it up to the fawcet and I&#x27;m irrigating in seconds. I had to run to Ace hardware for an adaptor but it was not expensive and the connection could not have been easier. The pulsing of the Water Pic is missing but I don&#x27;t think that reduces the efficacy. I really like it and highly recommend this irrigator</li>
    <li> my daughter has braces and is one that is not big on brushing. The dentist suggest (strongly) getting a waterpik. We didn&#x27;t care for the ones that sit on the counter taking up space.  When I show this, figured I would get it and have her try it.  She loves it, using it 3 or 4 times a day. It nice in that it screws into the faucet but you can release it to use as a regular faucet and you get fresh water every time plus are able to adjust the pressure.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Its a great product,,,easy to connect and use and since starting 18 months ago ,,,my dentist is amazed at the improvement in my gums,,,no more deep cleanings for me</li>
    <li> I really like this product and use it every day.  It is easy to set up and it feels good while using it.  I brush, then floss, then irrigate.  I have never had such a clean feeling.  It was packaged well and arrived in good time.    The only problem I had with it was the instruction sheet that came with it.  The actual instructions were unreadable and they referred you to the website for instructions, but there were none.  So, I had to learn the hard way, but it wasn&#x27;t that hard.  I learned, after the first try, about not using full pressure and how to navigate with the nozzle in your mouth so as to not irrigate your sinuses from the inside out.  Since then, it has been a pleasant experience.    I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My periodontist told me that if I want to avoid severe gum problems in my old age (I&#x27;m 60 and retired), I should irrigate my gum line after each meal. I had seen others&#x27; oral irrigators in their bathrooms, and the large contraptions were dusty and neglected looking, along with the electrical cord mazes of many other electrical toiletry items. My periodontist told me there were \\&quot;simple\\&quot; non-electric faucet oral irrigators when I complained about having yet another electrical item at my sink. So, I did a search, and bought the QuickBreeze oral irrigator. It comes with extensive instructions for mechanically challenged folks such as myself, and it works great! It must be attached and removed when you use it, but it&#x27;s very simple and if you designate a special place for it when not in use (I use a cute ceramic soap dish near the sink), it&#x27;s not an eyesore. Using it is a pleasant experience, so I&#x27;ve found myself willingly using it after each meal - it only takes 30 seconds. Watching all the tiny food particles spilling out into the sink will convince you to do it regularly! So, I&#x27;m now thinking of buying an extra adapter for $10 to use at my summer residence so I can take my irrigator along with my electric toothbrush. For short-term traveling to places where folks would frown upon you changing out their faucet adapter to fit your QuickBreeze, this isn&#x27;t a good idea. Use floss for traveling.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product and could not wait for it to arrive. I was very disappointed to find the adapters do not fit all sink faucets! No where in the advertising or on their web site does it state this major defect in design. I paid $6.00 shipping and had to pay $6.00 return I am now out of pocket the price of the item plus shipping.. I believe they should cover shipping since it is their responsibility to mention this important fact. The system did not fit one faucet in my home, we have Kohler products so beware...</li>
    <li> EZ setup once I figured out to use pliars to remove faucet \\&quot;aerator.\\&quot;  I thought the directions stated the entire process was \\&quot;no tools.\\&quot;  That threw me, so I prepared to send the product back after erroneously thinking my faucet did not have an aerator that detached since the connection junction (?) is not within view and I couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;twist\\&quot; anything off with my bare hands.  The rest of the hookup was indeed tool-less once I detached the faucet aerator with the pliars.  EZ to figure out from that point on.  It came in such a small package and I was surprised at how relatively small and unbulky it is. There were 2 tips included. The whole thing is EZ to attach/detach and store in a zip lock bag under my sink.  Simple to operate.  It does what it says.  What more can I ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Delivery time from the seller was unbelievably fast - like a day or two later.  There is a no-hassle 30-day moneyback guarantee if not satisfied.  There is also a lifetime product guarantee ($10 postage &amp; handling).</li>
    <li> I do not recommend it. You have to use it with the lower pression of water or the plastic products will wet you all. Besides, to install it you have to remove a part of your sink, so you can not use it to wash your face or hands, unless you unistall the product and install the original parts of the sink. Save money and buy the good one irrigator!</li>
    <li> Excellent product with ease of use. Just temporaly attach it to your faucet at your bathroom sink and you are good to go. When you are finished remove and store for next use. It took me about one minute to install.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product in the time specified by the distributor and also additional information regarding dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> It works as promised. Would like to have the flow-through ability too as in the permanent mount model.</li>
    <li> As an inveterate Water Pik user, I was reluctant to change brands. Here was this product I had never heard of that takes a different approach altogether. Without the customer raves, I would have passed it up. But, thanks to the positive reviews, I took a chance, and am glad I did. One caveat: If you have kids, don&#x27;t buy this unless you&#x27;re sure you can keep them from playing with it. If you turn the water on full, it creates a fire-hose-strength stream that could injure an eye. But for adults--what a product! As a travel irrigator, it takes almost no room in a suitcase and can be attached to a hotel spigot in about a minute.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer, I haven&#x27;t actually used this product but my review is based on my experience with their customer service. I received the item and during installation discovered that the piece of the faucet that has to be removed is rusted on. After filing for a return and explaining in my comments that it was no fault of the product, simply an unforeseen incompatibility, I received a response that all returns had to be approved by the mfc. Their response a few days later was to watch the installation video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the product and if anyone can recommend a method to removing a stubborn aerator, i&#x27;m all ears. I would still like to augment my daily brushing and flossing with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a water pick that was broken. I did not like the fact that whereas they used to give you four attachments so a family could use it, they now expect each person to have a machine of their own. I read about the QuickBreeze on Amazon and it is everything the previous reviewers say. It works better than the water pick and doesn&#x27;t make noise. I think it will last for a long, long time. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> First, 5 Stars for shipping. Oral Breeze shipped the same day I ordered. I ordered on Friday. It arrived US Mail on Monday. You can&#x27;t do better than that! It was the latest and greatest version, as advertised on the Manufacturer&#x27;s site. (2 tips, 24 inch tube.) Fantastic.    I&#x27;ve been using the QuickBreeze for a week and a half now. Already I can feel my gums improving (tingling). I give it 4 Stars simply because I can think of a few enhancements that would make it \\&quot;perfect.\\&quot;    As background, I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s, and after the eyes (presbyopia) the teeth go next. At my last checkup, my dentist saw the beginning of gingivitis and recommended a [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]. I was about to buy one locally and then thought \\&quot;Amazon!\\&quot; Good thing I did. Not only was the price lower on Amazon (with free shipping) but I saw a lot of 1 star reviews too. Fortunately, as with Macy&#x27;s in the movie \\&quot;Miracle on 34th Street,\\&quot; Amazon isn&#x27;t afraid to recommend other products to customers. I found the QuickBreeze in the \\&quot;also viewed\\&quot; and \\&quot;also bought\\&quot; section of the Waterpik page. Never would have known about the QuickBreeze otherwise. Glad I found it.     I probably should send these ideas privately to Mr. Spaulding, but I put them in the public domain so he can use them if he wants without legal hassles of royalties for ideas. (I&#x27;m guessing he&#x27;s thought about them already.)    First, a really small nit... I wish the hose was straight, as shown in the their photo. Mine is coiled, perhaps because it was wrapped for shipping in a small box. Maybe it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Mr. Monk\\&quot; thing (the obsessive detective on TV), but I&#x27;m always kinking the coil during use and trying to unwind it - in use, spraying water around the sink. Maybe it will straighten out with time or with heat? A hose without memory would be nice, so that it can be rolled up for stowage / travel but straighten out for use.    Second and more important, I think the unit should \\&quot;regulate\\&quot; itself somewhat so that youcan&#x27;t over-pressure it. The instructions warn about using too much water pressure, but also comment that everyone&#x27;s house water pressure is different. My dentist gave me instructions for the Waterpik which said never to go past the 2nd lowest pressure setting. So apparently too much water pressure is a bad thing. But how much pressure is too much? I dunno.     But I know it&#x27;s too easy to overpressure with the QuickBreeze. It doesn&#x27;t take more than a few degrees of rotation of my faucet to get a strong jet. (No one else in the house, so I don&#x27;t know what happens if someone suddenly turns off a shower while you&#x27;re irrigating. Does the pressure shoot up?)    I&#x27;m not a Fluid Engineer, but they made me take Fluid Dynamics in college. I wonder if there&#x27;s an easy way to set \\&quot;choke flow\\&quot; so that one cannot get too much pressure from the tap to the tip? If nothing else, it seems the I.D. of the inlet in the QB adapter is a lot bigger than it has to be. A smaller hole would act as a restrictor of sorts to keep the pressure from getting crazy high, as is done with low flow shower heads. (I might make my own insert to try this myself.) Or maybe a turbulator to increase fluid drag if the pressure is too high?    If OralBreeze wanted to make a Deluxe version, maybe a cute clear flow meter at the hose adapter, where a colored ball or disk, whistle-like, rotates / spins to give an indication of pressure / flow? Or a spring loaded ball for a true pressure indicator?    I saw one user request pulsed flow. I don&#x27;t know enough about dentistry to know if there&#x27;s any benefit to pulsed flow. I wonder if pulsing flow was simply a manifestation of the original Waterpik mechanics, where Marketing turned piston pulses into a \\&quot;feature?\\&quot;  Maybe it just feels \\&quot;cool.\\&quot; But if there is some benefit, again a whistle-like device with a rotating ball blocking / unblocking an orifice would give a pulsing effect if it&#x27;s really necessary.    Having said all this, the QuickBreeze is a good product. It&#x27;s cheaper than a Waterpik and less trouble. Nothing to leak and no reservoir to fuss with, grow bacteria in. When Oral Breeze comes up with a rubber based \\&quot;Ty-wrap\\&quot; temporary travel adapter that easily straps and unstraps around a hotel faucet aerator, it will be a lot easier to travel with than a Waterpik too.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get a water pick for a few years now.  The big problem I had was getting the big unit and putting it on my bathroom counter.  The other concern I had was how well one of these works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sold on the idea of this one because of how compact it is.  Installation is very easy, and I am not mechanically inclined.  I use this every day and put it away, every day.  If I didn&#x27;t tell you I had a water pick, you wouldn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a fantastic job of cleaning out your teeth.  I was curious if it would do as good of a job as regular floss.  This is much easier to use than floss, no waste, and I think it does a better job.  When I look in the mirror after I use it, I can see the little gaps between my teeth.  What is so nice, is that with this, the more pressure you give from your faucet, the more power you get in your mouth.  I really like to turn it up and feel it doing it&#x27;s job.  Warning, when you turn it up a lot, you will almost feel like you are drowning when you are using it on your back teeth.  You also have to come up with a technique for using it when turning it up so high.  I leave a lot of water in my mouth and let is slowly come out.  That way it doesn&#x27;t make such an impact on the inside of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a fantastic product.  I would recommend it to anyone, basically.  I would avoid recommending it to the very old and very young, for fear of drowning.</li>
    <li> This QuickBreeze water pik is proving to be a very good purchase. I bought it because I liked the fact that it would take very little room on the counter and seemed quick and easy to use. I&#x27;d also read lots of reviews for other similar products, and this seemed to be the best one for me. It does attach easily to the faucet as well. Just need to get more of the colored attachments, as it only comes with 2 (so different people can use it).</li>
    <li> It looked like a good idea but it doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  I wish Waterpik would return their original unit.  It was powerful and cleaned my teeth/gums awesomely.  The new ones are so weak.  As for this, I was desperate and tried it.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I LOVE THE ORAL BREEZE! AS I HAVE 25 IMPLANTS I HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE GETTING FOOD OUT OF THE GUM AREAS AND THIS TOOL IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE FOUND THAT REALLY GETS RID OF ALL FOOD DEBRIS. I LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN CONTROL THE WATER PRESSURE AS WELL AS THE SMALL TUBE THAT IS EASY TO REACH ALL AREAS OF THE MOUTH. FOR THE PRICE AND EFFICIENCY YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT.!!\\&quot;  HAVING USED THE ORAL BREEZE FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS MY DENTAL CHECKUPS HAVE BEEN CLEAR WITH NO PROBLEMS.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE HAD WAS THE WIRE SPRING COMING OUR OF ITS PLACE IN THE UNIT AND I HAVE FOUND THE COMPANY TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND REPLACE IT.  THIS OCCURRED AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF USAGE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ORAL BREEZE FOR A GREAT CLEANSING!</li>
    <li> I had an electric water pick that has a much more focused spray pattern, and seemed to do a much better job clearing debris from between the teeth. This is really an oral irrigator, not a water pick. Otherwise, installed easily and works.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. This product is absolutely the MOST useful tool that I have for maintaining my oral health between dental visits. It works exactly as described. I have a 9mm pocket on one side and a bridge on the other side. Prior to using this product, I would spend at least 20 minutes flossing and picking. Now I brush floss and irrigate in less than 5 minutes. GREAT PRODUCT.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received the QuikBreeze a few days ago. It was very easy to install--even for me. It fit my faucet just fine. I&#x27;m a little mechanically challenged, but did figure out after one failed try that you have to remove the washer that&#x27;s already in your faucet. It&#x27;s easy to attach and remove the tube as needed. I like the chrome piece that came with this one much better than the white plastic one on another similar item since it matches the faucet. It has also been my experience that white plastic tends to discolor over time and I didn&#x27;t want that. This is a great product. You can adjust the pressure and water temperature just the way you like it. It only takes the tiniest bit of practice to keep the water in the sink. I would recommend the QuikBreeze to anyone looking for an oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> Water-pic broke (you can read about that piece of junk) so we tried this. Easy to hook the adapter on the sink, easy to snap this thing on. It doesn&#x27;t pulse like a water-pic, but I find sort of tapping it on my teeth as I move it has a similar effect. Adjusting the water temp before hooking it up and keeping that temp consistent is the only drawback, and not significant. If you want something that works well and doesn&#x27;t break, try this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product except for a couple of small issues...&lt;br /&gt;1- I have a portable dishwasher so I have to change the adapter each time I want to use this because they are not compatible. (Weird since I was told my dishwasher adapter is a standard size...)&lt;br /&gt;2- The adapter also doesn&#x27;t fit on my bathroom faucet so I have to find an adapter to fit the faucet that the adapter for the Quick Breeze will fit into. So, I have to have 2 adapters to make it work with the one bathroom faucet.&lt;br /&gt;3- Hose is actually too stiff and too short.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, having said all that, I love the control that I have in being able to adjust the pressure using the faucet directly. I also love that I can use it for as long as I want/need to without having to refill a holding tank. Once I locate an appropriate adapter that I can leave hooked up, I will love love love this item.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  It quickly became a must for me to feel I had a sufficiently clean teeth, gums, etc.  Only drawback was that the hose came apart about 4 months of normal use, but the seller was fantastic and mailed me 2 replacements for free immediately.  So really no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have a double sick and I leave it attached! I went to my Dentist a few days ago and he said my teeth&lt;br /&gt;were much cleaner!</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you care about your teeth.  Super fast install, I did it in less then one minute.  The fan tips are why I order this unit and not another one on amazon.   I am glad i got this one.  There is nothing not to like about this unit.  There is a lifetime warranty not that I think you will ever need it because of its solid construction.  If you order this I am sure that you and your family will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product so far--2 weeks of REALLY CLEAN teeth. Easy to install. You do need a channel locks tool (big pliers) or any tool that will help you grab hold of the existing aerator on your faucet. Simply loosen the aerator in order to replace it with the aerator Oral Breeze provides you. Took me less than 10 minutes (and that included looking for the tool!). I especially like that my counter is free of a gadget and that the water pik can travel with me on long trips.</li>
    <li> Have purchased 3--one for myself, one for my husband and one for my sister.  They were all very simple to install.  I&#x27;d had problems with a particular gum pocket, and daily flossing just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. After about a week of using the QuickBreeze twice a day, my gum is as tight as a drum. Seeing my great results, my husband HAD to have his own, and he loves his, as does my sister.  What I like best is that I can control the water temp and use the irrigator for as long as I like. This is a wonderful product, and I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it. NOTE: Heed the caution about keeping the nozzle INSIDE your mouth while the water pressure&#x27;s on, or you&#x27;ll be re-drying your hair and wiping down the walls like I did the first couple times I used it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on 8/2 recieved it priority mail on 8/5.... That is great customer service. I ordered all three kinds of units because I wanted it to be convient for my son(with new braces) to use.  I installed redibreeze and the quick breeze in two different bathrooms.  Both were easy to install... worked great the first time.  Have not installed the shower unit yet  but expect it to be just as easy.  This is a great product... works really well to clean my between my teeth and the holes left by wisdom teeth removal.. Easy for my son to use with his braces.... I have not used a waterpik but cannot imagine how it would work better.  My only idea for the company might be to make a model that you can insert salt tablets or other kind of dissolving disinfectant into so you can get a salt water spray.   Along the same ideas they use for car washing.       Thanks for a great product... and Thanks for fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this to supplement flossing and bushing.  Seems to works great!  My husband does not like it because it tickles his mouth too much. I use a Sonicare and he uses a regular tooth brush. I guess i am desensitized to the tickle feeling. I am hoping my next dentist appointment shows the improvement in my gums. Remember your health starts in your mouth!</li>
    <li> Great product for dental health.  Quality parts and reasonable price.  Easy to install.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when purchasing this product, but it far exceeded my expectations.  I now look forward to cleaning my teeth every evening.  It&#x27;s easy to install (less than five minutes, with no tools), easy to use, and easy to care for.  An outstanding value.</li>
    <li> I have 3 good things and 3 bad things I want to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good 1. no need to refill water. it comes out of your tap so it runs forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good 2. adjust the pressure however you want with you faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good 3. no electric no recharge no battery needed. once you replace your aerator, which is easy, you attach it when you use it and detach in one second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad things are minor that&#x27;s why I still gave this product 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad 1. the holes on the tips are pretty big compare to Waterpik. So the water that comes out of it is not really like a string. I think they should give tips with different sized holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad 2. the color tone and the quality of the plastic tips are not elegant. and the quality of the paper box is not high. They are not too bad but just has a little bit \\&quot;dollar store\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad 3. I think the QuickBreez should come with a holder. QuickBreez needs to be detached every time you finish using it. Which I like because I don&#x27;t want a thing hanging in my sink all the time. BUT I think it should come with a holder. because after detach, it&#x27;s wet,and if lay flat it needs space. What I did was find a cotton ball holder to hold it.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to go with this item.  I&#x27;m very happy I did because it works exactly as others described it in their reviews.  The only problem is that you have to be sure your faucet will fit the adaptors.  Unfortunately, my bathroom sink doesn&#x27;t work with it, so I have to clean my mouth in the kitchen sink.  It makes it inconvenient, but I&#x27;m totally satisfied with how the product works.  And the portability is another great feature. I&#x27;m considering buying the shower irrigator so that I can use it in my bathroom for the future.  I&#x27;m sure it will be just as good as the QuickBreeze product.  J</li>
    <li> It is advertised as \\&quot;no tool\\&quot; installation, which is true of this product.  But since you must replace the regular faucet aerator after use (in order to use the sink for washing hands, etc.) you will need pliers or it will leak up inside the faucet.  Perhaps the one that stays attached permanently (with a switch to use it or the regular faucet) would be more convenient.</li>
    <li> The oral irrigator is better  than  I expected. It was easy to install, it works great, and it is easy to keep clean. No more moldy Water reservoirs. I especially like that I can regulate the water temperature, since my teeth are sensitive to cold water.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now. I love it. The best part in using this, my gingivitis is resolved.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this product for my 16 year old son who just got braces. He&#x27;s a non-flosser anyway, and I was looking for a waterpik for him, however while searching for one on Amazon, I ran across your QuickBreeze and it looked perfect for our needs!  He doesn&#x27;t have enough counter space to accomodate a waterpik , nor a convenient electrical outlet to plug one in safely. Your QuickBreeze is absolutely Awesome!!!!  He has been using it every day and it really gets the food out of his braces and off his gum line. I tried his, using the extra attachment and was thrilled with it as well, so I now have one for my bathroom. It was about half the price of a waterpik, doesn&#x27;t take up space or use any electricity, it&#x27;s easy to put on and remove, and doesn&#x27;t have any moving parts to wear out our burn out!!! Totally Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the quick breeze because I loved the one in the shower so much I wanted to use it more than once a day, and didn&#x27;t want to have a shower after every meal.  Also great for traveling!</li>
    <li> I bought the QuickBreeze to add to my daily teeth regimen. I use this before I go to sleep, and it makes my mouth feel cleaner. I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have as bad breath in the morning like I used to. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not using it to my full advantage or if I don&#x27;t eat foods that leave a lot of traces, but I&#x27;ve never used the QuickBreeze and notice large amounts of food from my mouth in the sink. It took me a while to unscrew my previous aerator from the sink, but the aerator they supply fit my sink perfectly. I didn&#x27;t realize that you had to use the clear rubber ring that the supplier includes when screwing in the aerator. I used the rubber ring that my previous aerator had, and I had leaking problems. Once I used the clear ring that came in the box the leaking stopped and hasn&#x27;t occurred since.</li>
    <li> QuickBreeze - the best dental irrigator I&#x27;ve ever used; no charging/recharging of device, no having to refill a container, has a small countertop footprint, you control the water pressure, easy to install on to existing faucet. Less is more: simple and effective. And it is q-u-i-e-t in use. Thank you OralBreeze.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the way the pick itself worked but not so much with being able to take it on and off the facuet.  Unfortunately the sink where it fit was also for company and I needed to remove it on occasion.  That proved to be very difficult to do and ended up not even being able to get it back on the facuet, the adapter broke.  If you can leave it on it is a great product, otherwise I would buy one that sits on the counter, which I just did, so ended up spending more money than I wanted.</li>
    <li> We use it everyday, so we just have it connected the whole time to our second faucet in the bathroom. Otherwise, I think it is troublesome to take it off everyday. The connection to the faucet is the standard circular connection which fits 90% of the faucets out there. If you have a newer model faucet that has weird, non-standard connection, then you are better to find something else. (another reviewer has pointed out that he/she got a new connector from the company for free)    My wife&#x27;s family all have trouble with their teeth. This has stopped her problem ever since she started using it. So I would say it is definitely working. It doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as flossing, but if you do floss and waterjet, the result will be amazine. We have no problem with the water pressure as some other reviewers do. The water pressure is controled by your faucet, so I don&#x27;t see how that can be a problem for you. Then again, we are in our 20s, I can&#x27;t say how it feel for those who are older.     Now comes the bad part. Because this comes with exchangable heads, the tube and the heads are not connected perminately. The connection is some cheap design that designed to be changed easily. But it can leak or break lose easily too. Now whenever we use it, we are holding the tube and the head together with one hand to prevent it from breaking lose. it can be annoying to some people, but we are used to it and we are still using it because of the great benefit to my wife.</li>
    <li> This hooked up effortlessly to my sink. Yes it sprays everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful... aim into the sink!  What  great cleaning tool! I used it before brushing and flossing to see what it would do. Seems like there was nothing left to floss, and brushing with toothpaste was almost unnecessary. Yes, I did continue to brush, but the moderate force of the pic water had really cleaned my teeth already. I got the shower breeze for my daughter along with the no fog mirror [[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]] She had tried my sink quick breeze and got water all over the bathroom. Shower breeze is perfect for kids/teens/messy adults. [[ASIN:B000CEMWHI ShowerBreeze W/ 3&#x27; Hose Oral Irrigator]] I may get the shower one and mirror for myself too!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator]]    I bought one of these over a year ago and was absolutely delighted by its simplicity and effectiveness--and the overall quality. In fact, I was so enthused that I heartily recommended the product to several friends. Well, I am now sorry I did so because when a friend showed me what she received, it was a flimsy, cheap imitation of the original. What a shame. Sure, it costs less than the version I bought, and it may still work, but it doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence. I would look around for better quality rather than buy this crappy looking thing.</li>
    <li> I ordered a QuickBreeze Dental Oral Irrigator a few weeks ago.   The unit was low priced and was delivered quickly.  When I attempted to install it, I found that the three small ball bearings which the unit snaps onto had gotten loose, and actually went down the sink drain, preventing me from using the unit.  I was disappointed and annoyed, and vented my feelings in feedback.   To my great surprise, a week later I received a new unit -- WITHOUT ASKING FOR IT OR CONTACTING THE COMPANY IN ANY WAY!!!  I have now installed and tested the new unit, and everything works the way it should.    I am amazed by the outstanding customer service this company provides.  They apparently read my negative feedback describing the problems I encountered, and responded positively by sending me a new unit for no additional charge!  I was even called by the president of the company who inquired about the nature of my problems.    This kind of service is outstanding and almost unheard of in this day and age!  I am deeply impressed!    The unit itself is lightweight and easy to attach to the sink.  I use it on a lukewarm water setting at relatively low pressure.  It seems to do a fine job of getting rid of food particles, etc., stuck between the teeth.    I would rate the unit as very good, and the service provided by the company after sale as outstanding!</li>
    <li> This was easy to install.  Easy to use.  I was having some issues around a crown in the back and was told by dentist it would need deep cleaning at $250.00.  I ordered this and used it for a week and the dentist said I no longer had the issue... my gums around the crown were healing.  This product is worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I had many portable, rechargeable oral irrigators, but they always need recharging and lost power after few minutes, plus water reserved would not last more than 30 seconds. I&#x27;ve solved all my problems with this simple yet amazing product. Install done in less than a minute, could not be happier. I also found it kind of restrict water pressure to certain level so it does not hurt your gums.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a while ago but I rarely use it.  When I do - it works well.  The flow of water is totally dependent on how much you turn your faucet on so you control whether it&#x27;s high powered or softer. They are easy to clean and use, but mine only fits in my kitchen sink.   I don&#x27;t know anything about faucets, but if I knew there was a difference between my bath room and kitchen sink I would have bought a different product. I assume I could go to home depot and change out the connector piece, but it works fine in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> One year with intermittent use and the fittings that attach to the faucet are both shot.  There is one fitting that screws in like a a facuet head.  I recommend you use white thread seal tape otherwise it will freeze to the faucet and you will never get it off (in fact you may cause damage doing so)  The second fitting is the adapter that fastens onto the \\&quot;new\\&quot; faucet head.  To make this happen you have to press down uniformly on a circular clip, doing so makes 3-4 ball bearings recess and allows a very narrow clearance for sliding the clip onto the faucet head...the problem, after a while it breaks down (and no I didnt force it) so you dont get the clearance you need to make one piece fit into the other, then youre left with 2 parts and no functioning water pik and you end up in this site explaining why.  They do have a lifetime warranty, \\&quot;What!!?\\&quot; you say, \\&quot;Why are you still complaining?\\&quot;  Well because to avail of the warranty you have to send them an extra $10 \\&quot;for shipping and handling\\&quot; to get new pieces that will do the same thing.  I purchased this thinking it would save space, clutter, and because it was a cheaper option at the time... its ended up more expensive than the irrigators I was comparing it to.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Wow, I love this product. I was looking for an old fashioned water pic for my teeth but thought I&#x27;d try this instead. Easy hook up and works great. I recommend this to everyone.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great product but it turned out to be more trouble than it is worth.  Makes a mess, hard to control pressure.  It gets in the way of everything else</li>
    <li> I was having quite a bit of pink-in-the-sink and the dentist suggested that in addition to professional care I should use an oral irrigator, (he said \\&quot;water-pik type device\\&quot;) at home. I have a small apartment, and don&#x27;t have much space for another device of any type, so when I saw the Oral-Breeze I was interested. Based on user reviews I decided to give it a try and am very pleased with the results.  1. It really does take only about 10 minutes to get up and running, even for someone with as little mechanical aptitude as I  2. It takes up no room, and there is nothing to plug in  3. It does a great job. After about 2 weeks of use, my dentist complimented my dental hygiene efforts. My gum health has improved already, apparently, and the Oral-Breeze is the single biggest change in my routine that I&#x27;ve made.   4. I will confess that it took about three sessions to get the hang of using the right water pressure from the tap, but I figured it out, and now it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I wrote this on May 13, 2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have both a Waterpik and an Redibreeze. The Waterpik does a slightly better job because it is pulsating. However, Redibreeze has many advantages: it is always ready (no need to fill it with water), it takes little space, it is quiet, and it doesn&#x27;t use electricity. Since it is always ready, I use it several times a day. I would suggest to buy this specific model, the redibreeze, as it stays on the faucet and has lever on the side. (There is another model that has to be placed each time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, I still use it about 4 times a day. On vacation, I miss it as much as I miss my dog (and yes, I love my dog). :-)</li>
    <li> I bought one for my dad a couple of years ago. He really likes it. Just recently got another one for my uncle. I gave it 4 stars because the manufacturer wrote me about a defect they discovered and my dad confirmed that it did drip a little. The company promptly sent me a replacement part with a little gift. So, overall, it is a good product, very simple, easy to use, no electrical parts that can break down, and their customer service seems to be very courteous.</li>
    <li> I just got my quickBreeze dental irrigator and i love it. It&#x27;s easy to install and really work. My teeth doesn&#x27;t have to much space between each other but i feel and see them as clean as if I had used the floss. Of course for the teeth on the back of the mouth that doesn&#x27;t have space at all you will need the floss... but the quickbreeze really do a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this product that I told all of my friends it was coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions were pretty clear, except that it came with two washers, white and black, and both need to be taken out in order for the thing to work. I had a hard time getting the valve and adaptor to click together and stay. I took the white washer out, and it worked better, though, but still water leaked out of it during operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device leaked through the top, apparently, made its way into the vanity and through to my neighbor&#x27;s ceiling and electrical outlets, which popped, sparked, and then BOOM shorted out.&lt;br /&gt;This is not necessarily a problem with the operation of the device, just a warning to those of you whose sinks may not be ready for this or have older pipes. Going to try this in my kitchen sink and see how it goes. Aye, Chihuahua!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the three minutes I got to use it, it made my gums feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The water had leaked back down the spout and through the vanity and down into the cupboard. I guess it&#x27;s not a great fit! Adjusting my ranking to 4 stars because it wasn&#x27;t the product, it was the sink that was messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AGAIN: I tried this in my kitchen (with careful monitoring of the cupboard below, of course). I believe it fits this better, but i had to remove the white washer from the valve in order to get the thing to click into place and stay, although the helpful woman (Janet?) at Oral Breeze assured me this is supposed to stay in. I just can&#x27;t get the thing to stay clicked and together (yes, I am pulling down the grip ring down)unless I remove that white washer. I put the thinner, black one in the valve, and it clicks okay as well. There is still some leaking out the top of the valve, but not too bad.</li>
    <li> I hooked this thing up to my shower nozzle and in terms of plumbing and connection it works as advertised.  How ever, there is no pressure.  I have lots of pressure at my shower head so that&#x27;s not the problem; its the irrigator tip itself.  It&#x27;s nothing like my water pick. It has so little focused pressure I doubt it would work loose much of anything.  This has a great potential to be a good water pick but the tip aperture needs to be much smaller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Quick Breeze for the last month and I really like it&#x27;s design and how it makes my teeth feel clean.  I&#x27;ve used WaterPik before and I think that this is a much better product. It&#x27;s self-cleaning, portable, and very easy to set-up and use. I like that you can adjust the strength of the stream and temperature of the water.  I&#x27;ve would definitely recommend it to people and I have bought a set for my parents, but there are some things I would want improved or studied with regard to this product.     1. The tubing is too stiff. If the only reason is for it to be it more anti-bacterial, then it&#x27;s fine. (This is a very minor point)    2. The force of the stream is impossible to set precisely. There should be an optimal stream force, which would get rid of all the food particles and not cause damage to enamel or gums. Having the stream too strong will probably cause damage to the gums over time. In addition, brushing of the teeth or using this product causes bacteria to be released into the blood stream.  Since most people brush their teeth everyday and don&#x27;t get infections in their blood it&#x27;s probably not a big deal, but if the stream is too strong and it&#x27;s over done, maybe there is an extra risk?  I don&#x27;t know if anyone has studied that question since the design of this product doesn&#x27;t currently allow precise setting of the force of the stream.     I will continue to use this product, because i think it&#x27;s one of the best on the market of it&#x27;s purpose. I&#x27;ll will not set the stream too strong.     MD.</li>
    <li> Works well. At first it was really hard to get the adapter on faucet. And it makes our water shoot out with more force when washing hands (not when using the irrigator) but the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself. Liked it so much I bought 5 more to give out as gifts. Customer support was great. Two of the items had trouble with the tubes popping off from the handle when under pressure from the faucet. The owner of the company personally contacted me and send me 5 replacement tubes even though I only needed two. The replacements were received in 3 days. The replacement tubes work great and don&#x27;t come off. I really appreciated the effort put forth by the owner to make things right.     I really like the product itself. I hate flossing but try to do it a few times a week. I feel this product allows me to skip flossing and just use the QuickBreeze instead. I originally bought it because the dental assistant told me I had deep pockets on a few of my teeth and that I needed a deep cleaning that was going to cost me $800. I could not afford it. If found this on Amazon. After using it for about 8 months I went back for a dental check up and was told I no longer needed a deep cleaning and that what ever I was doing to my teeth was working.     I will tell you that I did increase my regular flossing during this period also and used the QuickBreeze after flossing. Since I&#x27;ve had the good checkup I mostly floss about once a week and use the QuickBreeze almost every night. Sometimes it tickles my gums too much and I have to bear it. Most times it doesn&#x27;t. Just get used to it and tickling happens less and less as time goes by.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t report everyone else&#x27;s comments, but purchased this product after considering the ones with containers, and have used it for several months now.  Since this product connects directly to the tap, and temperature and water pressure can be adjusted to the desired comfort level, it was a no-brainer to purchase it. No worry about stagnant or contaminated water. It is excellent for use if you have \\&quot;caps or crowns\\&quot; as the pressure from the water will wash out any food particles, and leaves the mouth and breath feeling fresh and clean.  It is also a great stimulate for the gums. I use it in conjunction with the Oral-B electric toothbrush, and the combination is dynamite!      I do not believe it completely eliminates the need to floss, though, because although it does remove food particles, it does not necessarily remove the \\&quot;sticky goo\\&quot; beneath the gum line or between the teeth. An excellent aid towards good dental hygiene, and helps in eliminating morning cotton-mouth.  I like it so well I have ordered several and given to family.  How did I ever manage without it!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!!    No moving parts, no preposterous little pump, no leaky dribbling tank.  Engineering elegance approaching perfection!          The nearest thing I have to a criticism is that as an accommodation for elderly wet, arthritic, and slippery fingers -- there might be some sort of jimmy attached to make the machine attach and detach more easily from the faucet/bubbler,    Ward Stewart</li>
    <li> When my old Waterpik finally died, I decided to order a new one, or at least price them. Searching on Amazon, I saw the QuickBreeze Dental Oral Irrigator. At first, the price caught my eye, but then it was the reviews. 200+ reviews, avg. 4.6 stars. Hmmm. Read many of them and obviously felt I couldn&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  Couldn&#x27;t go wrong is an understatement. Out from its diminutive box comes the solid, well-made fitting and accessories. Two minutes later, it&#x27;s installed and getting its first trial.  Wow. Wow!  Experimenting with different temperatures and pressures (starting quite low), I gradually increased both. Unbelievable what a difference the increased pressure from the faucet makes. And being able to continue as long as you want/need without stopping to refill a tank? Brilliant.  Now, several weeks later, I&#x27;m happy to report that my gums have never felt better and my teeth constantly feel like I just saw the dentist for a cleaning. I&#x27;m addicted. Wish I&#x27;d had this years ago.  Overall, it seems very well built. The faucet fitting and adapter are solid. IF there are any weaknesses, it might be the tips. It seems like they could possibly be made out of a higher quality plastic than what&#x27;s used. I did have a problem with one of the two, so I called the phone number on the box. To my surprise, a real person answered the phone. A very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful person, at that. (Sad that that&#x27;s unusual these days...) A quick explanation and they mailed out a replacement right away. The replacement arrived quickly and worked perfectly.  Pros: Simplicity. Power. Convenience. Customer Service. Price. Made in America!  Cons: I didn&#x27;t invent it. ;-)  Bottom Line:  Highly recommended, especially if you&#x27;re not good at (or just don&#x27;t like) flossing. If you have any type of gum disease, I think this is an absolute must. If you don&#x27;t have any gum disease, get this and I doubt you ever will. Do it. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This is a solid product and works just as the manufacturers describe it!   It is very easy to use and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who had just gotten braces. We have a tiny bathroom with a very small counter top. My first priority was to find something that wouldn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. My second priority was to find something that would be easy to use. This Irrigator accomplishes both with an added bonus! My dad had one of those Irrigators that had a water tank. I thought to myself - gross, old water! Since this attaches directly to the faucet, you don&#x27;t have to worry about fresh water or cleaning a tank! You can easily remove the attachment for regular water flow. I ended up buying one for my dad who has since tossed his bulky tank.</li>
    <li> A very helpful product. It is a pretty good addition to your dental hygiene arsenal. However, after using the quick breeze, I probably would have rather gone with the shower breeze version of this product. When using this product at the sink, you have to be careful or it can get pretty messy. It takes some getting used to. The spray can be stronger than you think. Which is why it might be better in the shower, where it doesn&#x27;t matter as much when water sprays everywhere at a high velocity. That said, the quick breeze has the quality of being easily transportable, since it is so simple and easy to install and remove. I like the design: simple, not many parts to break, with strong enough materials used... probably very durable. I&#x27;ve been using the quick breeze, and it really does give you a very clean feeling. It&#x27;s easier to clean your gums and in between your teeth far more thoroughly. Not to mention if you had to clean around around some kind of dental hardware or something.</li>
    <li> Great device!  You&#x27;ll wonder how you lived without one. It seems like a  great complement to a toothbrush and floss.   The quick-connect fitting makes it easy to remove and install the irrigator.  The product was a bit more difficult to install initially than some of the other reviewers indicate.  The threads are extremely small and the angle of insertion has to be just right, which isn&#x27;t easy to see in a small bathroom sink.  It isn&#x27;t a fault of the product, but be prepared for some minor frustration as you fiddle with the connection.</li>
    <li> This was easy to set up, and seems to work efficiently. I initially was concerned about having the faucet control pressure/heat, but I actually prefer it now. I usually keep one hand on the faucet control and use my other hand to control the wand. This way I can regualte pressure/heat on the fly.  Two notes. After 1 week receiving it, it began spraying/leaking from somewhere around the handle area. After about 1 more week I noticed the hose going to the wand tip was coming off, if I wiggled it more water would spray out. So I pulled it off, put some super glue on it and let it dry overnight. Fixed the issue for about 2 weeks.  Then it started spraying randomly from the side and under the tip. I thought maybe this time it was borked and I would have to return it. I stopped using it for two days while I looked for the box. Didn&#x27;t find the box so I thought I&#x27;d try and fix again. This time I took the hose off, cut off about 1 inch. I mixed up some 2 part cement and put that on the adapter, then jammed the hose on. Let it dry overnight. Its been about 3 weeks now and no leaks from the side, so I think this fix worked.</li>
    <li> Like the idea of attaching it to the sink. I find it difficult to get the  right angle to flush my teeth because the tubing in not flexible enough.</li>
    <li> I have used a WaterPik daily for many years, and hesitate to travel without it, but the WaterPik is cumbersome to bring on a trip.  I was attracted to this product because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  The QuickBreeze lives up to its good reviews, and is a great alternative to the WaterPik.  The faucet adapter installs easily, and once that is installed, the QuickBreeze can be quickly snapped on when you go to use it and then snapped off and put away.  For travel, you have to bring the faucet adapter with you, but we had no problem quickly installing it at my parents&#x27; house or at a hotel, and it certainly was easier than carting a WaterPik around!    It does take some practice to get used to regulating the water pressure and temperature with the QuickBreeze, but it seems to work just as well as the WaterPik.  The QuickBreeze says the adaptor fits all standard U.S. faucets -- I wonder what I will do if we travel outside of the U.S.?    The QuickBreeze seems to be very well made -- I would guess that it will last a lot longer than my WaterPiks do!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you can&#x27;t really quite imagine how it is going to function until you hook it up and give it a try.  A small modification to the product would make it perfect but as it is I find it really difficult to use.  If the hand piece wand had a button valve built into it then it would make this product highly useful.  As it is now when you turn the water on you have a stream of water with almost no way to control it except to bend the hose tightly to restrict the flow by pinching it off.  It won&#x27;t last long doing that and it is a poor solution at best.  While they make another model which is valved it doesn&#x27;t have the quick connect feature of this one.  Too bad, close but no cigar.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my new QuickBreeze irrigator!  It is easy to install and remove from my faucet.  It works great and it is really excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I don&#x27;t have to have an appliance box sitting on my bathroom counter as I would have with the Waterpik brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that they give a LIFETIME warranty and was very impressed with all the rave reviews I read which contributed to my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...it is MADE IN AMERICA by VETRANS!  YAY!!!!!  We love our veterans!!!!</li>
    <li> Our family of four are using the OralBreeze and loving it.  I agree with the \\&quot;no muss; no fuss\\&quot; assessment but will also add \\&quot;no mess\\&quot;.  Easy to use; FB video made installation idiot proof.</li>
    <li> My husband has complained for some time about food getting stuck around a couple of his back teeth--nothing seemed to help until he tried the quick breeze oral irrigator.  He is now a believer.  It does not take up a lot of space on the counter and it attaches quickly to the faucet.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is a clever design, especially compared to a WaterPik (I tried the cordless one - cr#p) and easy to install (I did need a $5 adaptor from Home Depot).</li>
    <li> First time User and found it very easy to install, easy to use and no noisey box on the sink to fill with water. Only been using for 3 weeks and have dentist appointment 7/10.  Let you know what she says</li>
    <li> My kids hardly ever use the ones I got them, over the past several years.</li>
    <li> This product is made of high quality components and quickly slides on and off of my faucet.  Storage is simple I just use the box it came in.  It comes with a faucet spout just in case it won&#x27;t fit the one currently on your facet at home, so you may need a wrench but this is a quick switch.  Overall great product now I won&#x27;t feel guilty when I visit my dentist!</li>
    <li> Product works great, but had a bit of difficulty getting the proper connection.  It would have saved a lot of time and aggravation if I had been able to order specifying that my faucet had &amp;#34;outside threads&amp;#34; on the arbitrator.  Since that was not possible it took four phone calls and three mailings to get the proper fit.  The product is great, the ordering system needs improvement.  The company tells you to call for assistance, but their hours are seriously limited.</li>
    <li> The idea is great, but the stream that comes out of this is too thick, it&#x27;s like trying to waterpick with a firehose (you can reduce the pressure, but not make the stream more fine). It&#x27;s completely useless...</li>
    <li> I am sneeking in here very late to give a review, but that has nothing to do with the product, but rather with my busy life.    I bought 2 Quick Breezes 2 years ago and was instantly impressed with the quality of it as well as the follow-up customer service Tom gave.  I used one of the Quick Breezes almost constantly and hardly used the other at the other location I have it.  I always meant to ask Tom about the hose slipping off the diverter at times, spraying me in the process.  Time went by...two years later.    I thought Tom would tell me too much time had elapsed between my purchase and my inquiry, but again, I was most impressed.  He ended up sending me replacements for both units, at no cost.  Now the hose is longer and more flexible, and completely fused and sealed to the diverter, so there is no way it can come off anymore.  The added length and flexibily makes the rotating of the tip in the mouth even easier.    As if this wasn&#x27;t good enough, now there is a coiled hose as well, and I don&#x27;t know which one is my favorite.  Tom sent me one of each.    Before I bought the Quick Breeze, I was a 30+year user of Water Piks, which many times died a few days after the warranty ran out.  Even those which did last several years, I got very irritated with, as the pressure got weaker with time and the tips were much harder to put in as the rubber inside the holder aged.    With the Water Pik, old or new, I always wished I had more pressure, more water, new models came with smaller tanks and a higher price, less tips, the tank always looked \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; and took up counter space, and if I wanted hotter water, I was afraid it might ruin the motor.  This list of grievances moved me to start looking for an alternative, but I had little hope of finding one, as Water Pik is king.  I could not believe the simplicity and genius of the Quick Breeze design.  It stays clean, no counter real estate is sacrificed, I can rinse as long as I want, there&#x27;s no loud motor for when someone is asleep in the next room, and ahhhh....the pressure!  It&#x27;s a real joy, and I know my teeth are getting really clean without having to floss, water is at the right pressure always and the right temperature, too.    The only reason I would invest in another Water Pik would be for travelling purposes, as the diffuser has to be installed on the faucet.  I cannot say enough how much not only I but also my mother loves the Quick Breeze, and she has had gum problems, where the powerful massage of the water has helped tremendously.  Lastly, like I mentioned in the beginning, Tom and his partner Kelly stand behind their product 1000%.  It&#x27;s a real investment when you buy the Quick Breeze, and I&#x27;m sorry if I sound like a paid commercial, but it&#x27;s true :)))</li>
    <li> This is a great product, eliminating the need for a Waterpik or another electric version that clogs up, burns out or just quits working and must be replaced every two to three years at $59 a pop. This is a bargain, ultra hygenic consumer version of what they use in the dentists office to rinse the mouth. This spray will remove any particles  better than any waterpik. You have to get used to it so as not to spray everywhere, but you get the idea quickly. It&#x27;s a no&#x3D;mess clean up. Just drain the tube and hang it up and it&#x27;s ready to use again. You might wish to get the one that&#x27;s a permanent attachment, as this one you have to take off the spigot each time or you cannot turn the water on without spraying everywhere. The permanent one has a nozzle so you can do both. Love this thing and plan to take it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator]]  So glad we found this easy to use &#x27;water-pik&#x27; like mouth cleaner.  We had tried several different items from the drugstore and none were acceptable.  On one, the tips would not stay on causing the water to spray my face.  Another was too big and bulky to hold comfortably.  Another needed replacement batteries every few months.  I was skeptical about this but my husband easily connected the adapter to the faucet and it works great!  Just snap it in place - no batteries or electric cord - just the water tube and easily changed tips.  The tips hang on the wall out of the way and the water tube can be stored in a plastic cup on the counter.  Only disadvantage is we cannot take it with us when we travel.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Wow! I love it.. I&#x27;m away for the summer and it was quick and easy to hook it up here. What a great invention! Joe\\&quot;</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator]]  Works well. Nicely built. I miss the pulsation of my old water pik,but this does a good job. Nice to not have water reservoir to fill and clean.</li>
    <li> So much easier than the WaterPick.  The mess is gone. No more cleaning off the surfaces. It just hooks onto my faucet, I set the water pressure for hot and cold and then away we go!  It works well.  No troubles with this. Love it.</li>
    <li> This did not work on my bathroom sink.  I tried the adapters and read all the comments to find a fix but in the end nothing worked.  I ended up tossing it.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> We recently purchased a Waterpik Ultra, which we like and enjoy very much.  After reading all the rave reviews, I was so excited to order this product, as I thought it might be a quick clean irrigator without medicinal solutions to be used during the day.  My husband quickly installed the adaptor.  OK....a breeze...  Then the difficulties began:  1.  He tried inserting the tip into the hose, which he was not able to do until after considerable effort.  I tried inserting my tip and had the same experience.  So, since attaching the tips takes much strength and effort, it is definitely not a two person apparatus, where you can easily switch the tips around.  2.  It was very time consuming to try to adjust the water pressure and the temperature with a two-handle faucet.  3.  Because we have a two handle faucet, it is very difficult to put the tip in your mouth first and THEN adjust the temp and pressure without risking temp extremes or pressures.  4.  One tip sprayed in a fine pointed stream, while the other tip sprayed all over the place...like the hole was not cut out correctly.  I believe that this tip is defective.  The tips were of a rough texture and not smooth...which I felt was not as nice of a feeling after getting used to the smooth Waterpik tip.  5.  No shut-off valve on the connector.  That would make it more convenient for setting water pressure and temperature before inserting in mouth, especially useful for two handle faucets.  I have my doubts about contacting customer support regarding the tip...I had emailed them with pre-purchase questions and never got a response to this day, which is two weeks later.  That makes me wonder about their lifetime guarantee and support.  There is no phone number on their site.  I prefer to be able to talk to someone.  I plan to return this apparatus, as it is not fitting our needs or expectations.  We both felt that the quickbreeze was over-priced in terms of value.  We much prefer the Waterpik over the quickbreeze.  Inour case, it is much more convenient and faster to fill the reservoir with the temperature that we need and set the pressure by the numbers...much faster and more predictable.  No surprises!</li>
    <li> One of the best things I&#x27;ve bought ever, for real (I&#x27;m obsessive when it comes to oral care, efficiency, and clever design)&lt;br /&gt;Get rid of your bulky, noisy, mildew &amp; grime infested countertop Waterpik and replace with this simple sturdy ingenious little thing.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever says it&#x27;s difficult to install is an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the packaging features an image of a woman uncannily resembling Lisa Kudrow. Which is also a good thing. Lisa Kudrow being the harbinger of all things brilliant. Romi &amp; Michelle guys.</li>
    <li> This is an easy item to install and comes with assorted adapters for standard faucets.  I don&#x27;t use the device that often but it&#x27;s a life saver when a popcorn kernal shell gets lodged in my gums.  Provides great pressure.</li>
    <li> I too have used WaterPik devices for many years and each failed in time, usually because of a problem in the pump mechanism.  I like the QuickBreeze better because its pump-free design will enable it to last a very long time.  To be fair, the WaterPiks left my mouth feeling very clean, but so does the QuickBreeze.  After using it for only one week, any new tartar build up on my teeth has been reduced to about zero!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chrome plated brass adapter goes on and off the faucet very easily, but be careful not to drop it in your sink: it is solid enough to cause a chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is especially easy to use if you have a single handle faucet. To see how easy it is to use, be sure to view the video at the product site at [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July 23, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June at my regular dental checkup, my hygienist volunteered that my teeth and gums were in excellent condition: A plus.  I told her about having been using the QuickBreeze irrigator since February.  She was impressed and felt that the Oral Breeze products would probably be very effective for patients who wear braces, as they often find even daily routine dental cleaning especially challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That dental office has now made printouts on OralBreeze products avialable to its patients.</li>
    <li> Love it, put my electric waterpik in trash</li>
    <li> My 30 year old water pik died and while this doesn&#x27;t Pulse, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by far the best and simplest way to rinse your mouth. I love it !</li>
    <li> This was originally recommended by a DDS who dealt with my gum erosion.  Takes only a minute or so a day, instals easily, and my check-ups have been great ever since (several years).</li>
    <li> It does not have a pulsing feature, you can not do any flow adjustments on the handle and doesn&#x27;t work as well as a water pik.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and good design. I couldn&#x27;t use it because it tickled my mouth so much I couldn&#x27;t stand it. But if you don&#x27;t have that problem you should love this product. You can turn it up too high, so be careful of that.</li>
    <li> Just got off the phone with Kelly, who was very gracious. They&#x27;ve recently improved the product and are sending me the new version, free of charge. PLUS, this is the only water pick that you can remove, so your guests don&#x27;t have to look at it on the counter. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I would advise anyone with a gum infection to order an Oral Breeze. I had an infection in mine, I was due to have my gum cut and scrapped. While I was waiting for preapproval from my insurance company I purchased a Quick Breeze with it and advise from the seller and my dentist I was able to clear the infection and did not need to be cut. Buy one it works and is well worth the cost. Had no problems installing or using the Quick Breeze.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about my new aqua floss. I was a floss-aholic, flossing everyday. I found that my gums would get sore from pushing into them with the normal floss. So when I read about aqua floss, I had to try it. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I am so happy with the results. My teeth feel cleaner, my gums don&#x27;t hurt and above all of that, my partner who could not use normal floss, loves the aqua floss. I think it is the first time in his 36 years he has been able to floss. Yay!  Thank you so much for this awesome product. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I have had my irragator for 2 years - absolutely love it!  Get the longer hose - much easier to use. Has a very durable construction and very easy to use. I would never go back to an electrical unit.</li>
    <li> I found Quick Breeze several years ago, and will never use any other kind of water pik. Why spend 4 or 5 times as much for products that aren&#x27;t as easy or effective. My first one came apart at the hose after a lot of use, but they appear to have fixed that occurring with the newer versions. I like being able to leave it attached to the sink.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was tired of having the big water pik on my counter. Oral Breeze works just great.  The connection is easy, and storage is great.  It is nice to control water temperature and force with the faucet.  The spray is not too powerful and it tickles my mouth and gums.  That is annoying, but I will learn to deal with it.  Otherwise a really good product</li>
    <li> I have used WaterPic for years.  When my hose broke (again), I went looking for a new one.  I accidentally came across the QuickBreeze.  IT IS WONDERFUL!  The guy who invented this is a genius!  The QuickBreeze hooks onto your faucet in a second and then you can irrigate your gums WITHOUT FILLING UP ANY RESERVOIR. It is sooooo easy.  I use it more often.  I use it longer.  I love it.  I use my QuickBreeze in the powered room where other people use the sink.  I can just pop it on and off as needed.  I use my RediBreeze in my master bath where I leave it hooked up all the time.  What convenience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready for the best part? ... These are LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE of those other brands. OOoo, because this is the brainchild of the guy who runs the company, you will never get better service in your life.  He is really invested in your satisfaction with his baby. LOL!</li>
    <li> Great product! I didn&#x27;t work with my cheap-o bathroom faucet, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Nobody makes an adapter for it. So I use the laundry room&#x27;s faucet instead, which is probably better anyways.    If you have insanely high pressure water service to your home, you might want to put a hose clamp on the hose, otherwise it shoots off.    I would like to see more \\&quot;sophisticated\\&quot; tips for the irrigator.    The greatest thing about it is this is built to stand the test of time! High-quality metal parts are used for the connector. I fully expect it to last 15-20 years. The plastic will probably wear down before the connect begins to show rust.</li>
    <li> Great product: quality parts, easy to install and works great.  After my dentist complained about the tartar buildup between each 6 months visit, i decided to get an oral irrigator but was unsure what to get or which brand. Came across this product on Amazon while researching and liked it cuz of less complicated setup, made in America and good reviews.  Very happy with this product and enjoy using it every day.  On recent dental visit, dentist commented how clean my teeth are which i could&#x27;ve only attribute to this product since that was the only change in my dental cleaning routine.  American enginuity at its best with this product.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that the company is friendly and easy to work with.  However, I tried this for a few weeks and notice that my gums are back to feeling the way they were pre-Waterpik (slightly irritated). Contrary to what they say, the stream of water out of my faucet(i have good water pressure and turn it on all the way) does not produce as clean a feeling after I am done, and they don&#x27;t back up their claims with studies (why?). They should really provide scientific studies that prove the products effectiveness. When i asked for something like that, they said I should talk to my dentist???????  Anyway, this product is sturdy and seems like it will last a long time. But I think I am going back to the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> My dentist&#x27;s assistant recommended this for our 8-year old to keep her teeth clean with braces. Works great, but she needs a little assistance from me to really get the front ones clean, and I haven&#x27;t mastered the art of doing it without getting us and the bathroom wet! So it provides lots of laughs at bedtime, and really gets the gunk out from under her braces, but we do get a little wet!</li>
    <li> This was easy to install, easy to use, very quiet, and takes up very little space. I would highly recommend this to everyone! Great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have e-mailed my family and friends to tell them how well this product performs. Many of them have now ordered their own oral irrigator.  I will never go back to the water pik as my hose disintegrated when I went to use it and I then found out it could not be replaced. A complete waste of money and it took up counter space. I find that I use the Quick Breeze so much more because of the ease of connecting it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best water pick so long I have owned. No noise. No power source needed. Easy to install. Suggest you to buy if you intend to use it at home, not for travel.</li>
    <li> My orthodontist insisted that I get an oral irrigator.  Not only do I have braces, but also a device that is enlarging my palate.  So, basically I have a mouth full of metal, plastic, screws, springs and wires.  I decided to purchase this product because, after reading the reviews from a Water Pik device, I was concerned that it would not last for the length of time that I needed it.  This product is simplicity at its best!  I bought the Quick Breeze instead of the Redi Breeze, because I wanted to be able to remove it from the sink when necessary.  This irrigator is very efficient, durable, and quiet.  I like that I can control the pressure and temperature with just a simple faucet adjustment.  It was easy to install and is easy to remove and replace.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Came broken but send new part out fast!</li>
    <li> I have been so pleased with the performance of this item.  It is easy  &lt;br /&gt;to use - no tanks to fill, no batteries to charge.  It is completely  &lt;br /&gt;portable - just screw the adaptor onto any bathroom faucet and you are &lt;br /&gt;good to go.  Adjusting the pressure can be a little tricky but really &lt;br /&gt;no big deal once you get the hang of it.  I am going to recommend this &lt;br /&gt;to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This was my first water pick. The simplicity of the QuickBreeze is great. It only takes a few seconds to plug it in &amp; away you go.    I hate to floss but actually enjoy using the QuickBreeze. I use it often &amp; my teeth never felt cleaner    Hints:  1) Use luke warm water.  2) Keep water pressure relatively low. If it&#x27;s too high you can hurt your gums.</li>
    <li> The product works fine except when on high water flow the stream breaks up.  With that being said, it works great</li>
    <li> I owned a WaterPik years ago and I was looking to purchase another one, but after reading disappointing reviews I decided to give the QuickBreeze a shot. It installed quickly and easily (I didn&#x27;t need any of the included adapters) and seems to be well-made and well-designed. I was surprised at how well it works and even though it doesn&#x27;t pulse, the stream is very powerful (you can adjust it, obviously) and it cleans very well. Best of all, it snaps on and off quickly and can be put away. No counter space required and no electrical cords. Water drains out, so there is no standing water left inside. Pure simplicity. I look forward to using it, as it makes your mouth feel super clean.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product for myself.  In 3 words I can say ... I LOVE IT!  It works great.    I ended up also buying the shower irrigator.    The faucet attached irrigator is awesome, but it has a few things you will need to be aware of when you start to use it.  Don&#x27;t take the water pick out of your mouth when you are using it or you will also get yourself and your bathroom soaking wet.  With a little practice, you can stay relatively dry.  The faucet attachement is great for a quick irrigation after eating.    The shower attachment is awesome too.  I like this device better than the faucet because you can really irrigate every tooth easily.    Now for the results part... my gums are noticeably getting healthier.  Yay!    I highly recommend this product... so much so, I bought some for Christmas gifts for a couple of members of my family.    Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> EDIT: six years and four different houses later, i&#x27;m still using this and it&#x27;s still working perfectly. i ordered a replacement set of tips a few years back but haven&#x27;t needed them. this is amazing.    *      This is SO EASY to use - I use mine every day, morning and night, after brushing my teeth.  None of the parts seem worn out in the least (after a month of use).  Water pressure can be entirely controlled; the two nozzles included (a large and a small) fine-tune it even more.    Replacing and removing the attachment on the faucet takes under two seconds; it can be done one-handed.    The faucet requires a little initial surgery before the irrigator can be used - removing and replacing a washer (?), included.  I&#x27;m no plumber, but I managed easily, without tools and despite the crazy instructions.</li>
    <li> I am a long-time WaterPik user, but I wish I had known about this years ago. No cord, no space on counter, easy to snap on the faucet. I use it much more than I did the WaterPik because it is so much less hassle.  And of course much more adjustable because you adjust the temperature and pressure at the faucet.</li>
    <li> I put this in my RV.  I have the permanent one installed at home.  Love them both.  So easy and quiet.</li>
    <li> Then try this product.  It is such a complement to my regular dental hygiene program.  I use it before flossing, then follow with brushing and finally the Lysterine rinse when I wake up, then again before brushing and Lysterine before bedtime.  You can really adjust the flow to blast out the remnants from your latest feast, preventing any unnecessary calories and odor from food stowaways that may be lurking in between your teeth.  And so as a result, your breath will smell much better.    I&#x27;ve had this product for more than two months, but it took me that long to figure out that there is a difference in the two tips that that they send!  One is a finer flow for blasting out along the gumline and within tooth crevices.  The other one is for more of an overall rinse.  I started with the wider flow, and was disappointed that the Quick Breeze didn&#x27;t come with extra tips.  I even tried substituting the gingival tip from my other oral irrigator to try and achieve the same effect.  It turns out that I had everything that I needed with what was included with the unit.  I do wish that it had other tips and gadgets, but I&#x27;m more than satisfied with what is included.  Go ahead and buy this thing.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a shower floss for over a decade and I love it. We wanted to get something my daughter could use. She doesn&#x27;t take that many showers and cannot reach the shower head so I thought this sink water pick would do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I made a mistake and rushed through the order. My wife and I picked out the one we wanted on one computer and I went to my main computer to look it up and order it.... It was called \\&quot;redibreeze\\&quot; and looked very similar and had the same price. Searching redibreeze on Amazon pulls up QuickBreeze at the top for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like returning things, especially when it&#x27;s my fault but this thing went right back in the box and returned to the store the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened??&lt;br /&gt;The rubber hose is coiled and it can rotate easily at the faucet attachment... that combined with how you need to move it around in your mouth means the handle needs to rotate as you use it. The attachment is not only what you are meant to hold on to but also slides in and twist locks in place. However at least for my unit \\&quot;locks\\&quot; is a far too generous word. Within seconds of trying to use this, the mouth piece twisted and popped out of the attachment. The hose took off like a loose fire hose and sprayed water all over the bathroom sink, walls, mirror and everything else in the area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I found I did not like in the 30 seconds of actual use... I have a sink faucet much like that as pictured in the product image. It was extremely difficult to adjust the water pressure to an appropriate pressure. Too low and it will not be effective... too high and it will blast the inside of your mouth. ANy slight adjustment sent it far into one direction or the other. I can&#x27;t imagine a younger person using this thing successfully without hosing the bathroom down on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted to get... the redibreeze... has a lever on the side to divert the water flow from the sink to the irrigator. This would provide another adjustment and allow you to leave the unit in place at all times.</li>
    <li> This product is about as basic and simple as it can be; that translates to&lt;br /&gt;fewer things that can go wrong or break and a product that will give you less headaches.  I was addicted to my water pik machine but the pump broke after about 3 months - thats what you get for using it every day I guess. Not a cheap product to replace.  I saw the quickbreeze and decided to give it a try - less money, great quality parts and simple installation.  Works great too and now no pump to worry about either - love the product!  My only complaint is I wish the tips were more comfortable - minor complaint - they still work well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Oral Breeze irrigator several months ago after a suggestion from my dentist, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  I&#x27;ve tried the other brand of oral irrigator, and--forgive my vanity--I&#x27;d rather not have an enormous water receptacle sitting on my bathroom counter for all to see.  The Oral Breeze is aesthetically discreet, makes almost no noise, is very durable, and is priced less expensively than products that are not nearly as functional. My gums and teeth are healthier than ever; moreover, it&#x27;s nice to support a small company that makes such a quality product.</li>
    <li> Works well enough but gets a lot of water everywhere.  Needs some sort of on off valve on the coupling line.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve never used any irrigator, and always wanted to get one. But the idea of getting a separate device for $100+ was not appealing to me.  Since it was only 29.95, i decided to try. The installation is easy, I was concerned that the faucet might not be compatible (since I&#x27;m in Europe), but it worked perfectly.  Its easy to put on the Valve without any screwing, just by pulling down the grip, and pushing the valve in.  Get your electric brush and this irrigator and you are all set! The sensation of your clean teeth just like after a dentist&#x27;s cleaning  is the best!</li>
    <li> I had no trouble installing the QuickBreeze. I had to use a wrench to remove my old aerator and then I was able to hand install the QuickBreeze onto the spout without a problem. One word of advice though: if you happen to attach the hose and then forget you&#x27;ve attached it and leave it hanging in the sink and turn the water on, you and your bathroom will wind up covered in water. Learn from my mistake!    As far as using it goes, I&#x27;ve been really happy with how easy it is to use. I definitely like it more than the waterpik I had before. My teeth and gums feel great!</li>
    <li> I have periodontal disease and I had root planning and scaling down about 4 months ago. Since then I have used this device to irrigate my gums as brushing and flossing wasn&#x27;t enough for me. 4 months ago my pocket depts were all 4 and 5 mm, with a couple 6mm. Now after using this device for the past 4 months, my pockets are mostly 3 and 4, with no 5 or 6 mm. I even had a some 2mm pockets!     This thing is really great, I used it everyday and although I have a waterpik also, I rarely use it now, because the oral breeze is so much easier and faster. My mouth feels and smells fresher than it has in years.     The inventor should be given a noble prize or something for this invention, or at least some medical award; imagine if everyone had one of these, this could save so many people from the terrible effects of gum disease. Lucky for me I still have all my natural teeth and I plan on keeping it that way forever!    I would recommend you getting one of these for yourself like I would recommend you to keep breathing; get one of these oral breezes, you will get one of the best returns for your money like nothing else in your life.</li>
    <li> I bought this oral irrigator 4 months ago. It is of excellent quality. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and I just can&#x27;t imagine life without it. I tried several electric oral irrigators. They are not practical and always break within 3-4 months for no apparent reason.  This is also by far more effective and more practical to use. I recommended it to a friend of mine and he also loves it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> In theory, this works. In practice, it doesn&#x27;t. The opening of the tip attachment is not fine enough to direct the pressure where it&#x27;s needed, which produces a stream that fans out instead, and the water flow needs to be quite heavy for it to achieve the right pressure too - what results is a mouthful of water but not everything has been cleaned from between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed it without any tools, as instructed, and it was incredibly easy (though I think I should have protected my hands with a cloth or something because the edge of one of the pieces made a papercut-like superficial cut when I screwed it on/off - not sure if that was my own tap piece or not, because I didn&#x27;t realise I had injured myself until after I finished installing - but just a tip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t leak from the tap attachment. But I&#x27;m not certain it doesn&#x27;t leak from the business end of the tube - the thing is that with a mouthful of water, you sometimes get leakage from your mouth too, so it kinda feels like the device is leaking but the real reason is an incomplete seal by your lips around the tip 99% of the time. The way the tip attaches to the tube is at times tentative, as if you make exactly the right twisting motion, it can loosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dentist says I still need the friction of physical dental floss to get the full benefit of flossing, especially since I have some weird gaps that are hard to get to. We have all but stopped using it - however, I really like using it to clean other things in the bathroom (ie. rinsing the bathtub and shower walls) due to it&#x27;s ability to shoot quite far with lots of water and adjustable pressure. Because of that, I will keep it so I don&#x27;t have to work out how else I could rinse the tub/walls so effectively and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for use with teeth + 4 stars for use for cleaning other things &#x3D; average of 3 stars</li>
    <li> Use warm water in this for gumline water flossing and braces rinsing...clearly the highlight of my day...ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost once fell asleep at the sink with it on because it was so soothing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would use or recommend this for regular oral care-a brush and floss should do just fine-but I got this when I got braces, and it has made life so much easier.  It takes some work to figure out the right water pressure and in-the-mouth-angle (expect to get yourself and the walls wet the first few times), but otherwise it&#x27;s easy to use and removes embedded particles with no problem.  Installation was easy; I unscrewed the existing tip of my faucet and put the new tip right on, no tools and no leaks.  (You add or remove the irrigator from the new tip.)  My only complaint is that the tip is unsightly; my faucet&#x27;s original tip was sculpted and round, but this one looks like a crude bolt.  So if you have a particularly nice faucet, this might not be for you.  I decided I didn&#x27;t care because once the braces are off, this will come off too.  Aside from that, snapping the irrigator on and off is a snap and the whole device is simple to use.  Definitely an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> The concept of this is fantastic... it&#x27;s portable, easy to snap on and off, doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, it installed in minutes without any trouble. The only problem (and it&#x27;s a big one) is you can&#x27;t easily control the power of the water jet. At my sink I have to gently tap the faucet handles until it just barely comes on. Any more than that and the water jet is strong enough to peel paint. Well... I used the QuickBreeze for several weeks without any problem until the day I turned the faucet too far. Now I have a deep infected pocket in front of one tooth where the jet irritated it and probably drove some particles inside. Is it my fault or the QuickBreeze&#x27;s? I don&#x27;t know, but I can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a really easy product to attach and use. Adjust the water pressure that you are happy with and blast away.</li>
    <li> Love it but where the instructions says to &#x27;hand tighten&#x27; it caused water to flow back through my faucet and creating some water damage.  Solution, I used a wrench to tighten it and not more water flowing back.  Walla! Problem solved.</li>
    <li> The inside tread were all mangled , couldn&#x27;t  connect it. Was told that I had to reorder it. And it no longer ships to my address. It did look like it might have been good, but I guess I will never know</li>
    <li> I am totally surprised at the ease and functionality of this small product!  It is the best purchase I have made all year.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying for friends and family soon.  Great item.  I wish I purchased it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> First, i have to say that it does a great job of cleaning my teeth and preventing tartar buildup.  I really don&#x27;t have a big problem adjusting the temperature and pressure as others have said, but I have a problem with the hose being too stiff to manipulate the irrigator around my mouth, and that is very frustrating.  Also, I can&#x27;t leave it connected to the faucet because I use the faucet for other things throughout the day.  I have 2 bathrooms, but I am used to using this one, and if I leave it connected, (which I have a couple of times)I forget, and spray water all over the bathroom.  My problem here is, where and how do I store it?  There is still some water in the hose, so I can&#x27;t just put it under the sink or in a drawer.  So far, I have just put it under the sink in a plastic dish.  If anyone has a better idea, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Basically it is good idea. But the product is kind of rough, not refined. Not easy to hold, too small for hand to hold and often that the tip part can be easy loose. The product needs to refine to be a very good one. Buy the one with side switch from the same company.</li>
    <li> I bought this to have a quieter waterpik for late night use, so I wouldn&#x27;t disturb people trying to sleep.  The sellers sent me an email with helpful tips on gum care and rinsing solutions.  The product was very easy to install.  Very quiet, and easy to adjust for either hand!    Three issues with it - first is the hose, which is a tiny bit stiff and can be awkward to turn if you don&#x27;t hold it just right.  It can be a bit fiddly to adjust pressure and water temperature, as these are controlled by your faucet handles.  (if you live in a house like mine, the water slowly gets too hot, then quickly gets too cold, etc)  Last is the spray.  Possibly I&#x27;m still learning how to use it properly, but I end up with a very fine misty spray all over the place.    In all I&#x27;m pleased with it as a backup waterpik.  Note if you want to travel with it, you&#x27;ll have to do some disassembly to any faucet you plan to attach it to.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this years ago.  If it should ever break (I don&#x27;t see that happening soon, it is very well made) I would buy another to replace it.</li>
    <li> After two waterpiks died, we tried this and are happy we did.  Works really well, and since there&#x27;s no battery, we expect it to last a long time. The only downside is that you have to remember to move the lever back to the regular faucet position or the spray goes everywhere when you turn on the water.</li>
    <li> This thing greatly helps to keep your gums healthy, but bear in mind that YOU STILL NEED TO FLOSS!!!  As others have noticed the documentation wasn&#x27;t perfectly clear about that issue, but I asked my dentist and he said flossing is still required, bit of a bummer...   I&#x27;ve noticed though that I don&#x27;t need to floss for as long to get all the junk out between my teeth.  Usually just a couple of passes with the floss is enough for this thing to blow out the garbage, definitely worth it IMO.  Only problems I had with it was the short tubing and that I found only 1 of the tips worth using (the other was too restrictive so not enough water would flow through...).  Make sure to hold the tip pointed such that the stream of water is directed down/up below the gumline, and not touching your teeth, otherwise it won&#x27;t be able nearly as effective at keeping your gums/teeth healthy!!</li>
    <li> What a simple, well-made tool for dental care!  You don&#x27;t find many companies today that design and sell products that are so simple and functional.  This fits in with my Hunter fan, Kitchen aide Mixer, Kirby Vacuum and my Honda.  Thank you Quick Breeze, and good riddence to my water pic!</li>
    <li> Great product, It was recommended by my Dentist. It took 5 minutes to install. My wife uses it 2-3 times daily.</li>
    <li> Well designed and straightforward to install and use. It medicinal benefits remain to be determined. The idea of a motorized plastic box that requires servicing and replacement or a battery powered windex sized bottle to stick in my mouth seemed a dumb way to pressure floss. The obvious improvement would be to have a shut-off valve just below the spray head that would allow some additional flexibility in how this is used.</li>
    <li> First  off, i would like to comment on how amazingly fast this company had my item shipped out! They did it Pretty Darn Quick!  As for the item itself, It is very well built and looks/feels solid enough to last for a long time (Made in USA!) Had it installed in a jiff, without any issue whatsoever, and it just works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best points:&lt;br /&gt;- No batteries to replace&lt;br /&gt;- no mechanical/electronic parts to break.&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Durable materials&lt;br /&gt;- works as advertised&lt;br /&gt;- backed up by a reputable US based company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ??? - NOT FREE!</li>
    <li> Bought as a backup for one I&#x27;ve used since 2010......just in case. Prefer &amp;#34;Quick Breeze&amp;#34; over &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; any day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to buy a product once in awhile that works as advertised and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. Once you mount the adapter on your faucet it&#x27;s easy to use, only takes a couple of seconds to hook up to faucet and it really does a great job of cleaning the small food from between your teeth and sooth your gums. I don&#x27;t even get my teeth cleaned as much anymore from the dentist as long as you use this product once or twice a day.</li>
    <li> It did not fit my my Kohler K-10217 faucet, so the very nice customer service agent sent me a free adapter.&lt;br /&gt;The coupler looks OK by itself, but the adapter extends it too long and makes it unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;I like the simplicity of plugging it in for use without needing electricity or a bulky device.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, there is no good way to store it except on a towel to soak up residual water.&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure is quite strong coming out of the irrigator, and it takes a bit of adjustment of faucet handle.&lt;br /&gt;One disappointment is the lack of on/off switch on the irrigation handle. Having to reach the faucet handle while trying to aim the water jet is problematic for me, and the water can spray everywhere.</li>
    <li> We have used electric waterpics for years, then I happened to see this product a few months ago- we LOVE it.  We usually added warm water to our waterpic, so being able to mix the temperature at the faucet is great! One tip I would share is that I usually put it in my mouth before turning the water on &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make any mess ;then I start with the cold water &amp; slowly add warmer to my liking.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable battery failed on my other water-jet flosser in less than a year, so I searched for a new flosser with replaceable batteries. But I found Oral Breeze instead - NO batteries!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the QuickBreeze because I don&#x27;t like the idea of a permanently attached hose of the RediBreeze. The QuickBreeze works fantastically; so quickly; so easily; so conveniently. My water pressure is a full 80psi, so I swapped the innards of the Quickbreeze&#x27;s aerator with the innards of a flow-control aerator on my single-handle faucet, and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very small learning curve exists: remembering to put the tip in my mouth before turning the water on, turning the faucet on to the right position, and remembering to turn the water off before removing the tip from my mouth. To store the QB, I remove it, drain the water in a few seconds, and hang the unit on the supplied tip cradle, which I attached to the inside of the vanity&#x27;s door.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I can add that others haven&#x27;t said.  It was literally a 5-10 minute job to attach to my faucet, and compared to my Water-Pik type appliance, this thing is WAAY more powerful (if you want it to be).  Definitely made just for the job, and they are really out to help improve your dental health, with some extra materials provided in the package.  Also, for $25, this is a major bargain!  The material quality is top-notch.  I recognize some of the parts from my engineering days.  Well done!</li>
    <li> The hardware part is heavy and shiny, looks so sexy :) Hose is flexible and strong, like it has to be.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, solid, reliable; absolutely recommend it, A+++&lt;br /&gt;(and bonus fittings!!)</li>
    <li> i have had one of these for a couple of years now and it works perfectly. my dentist used to spend 45 minutes or so cleaning my teeth. now he does it in 5. i asked him if it is because of this oral irrigator and he said yes it is. (he did tell me to get one because of some pockets that i used to have)&lt;br /&gt;i give them as gifts to everyone i know which i&#x27;m sure they find strange until they try it.&lt;br /&gt;every other day seems to be enough to keep my teeth and gums completely free of plaque, tartar and to reduce bacteria under the gums that cause bone loss.</li>
    <li> Blew the skin away from my tooth and created a pocket and got infected.  Two spots didn&#x27;t want to heal for over a year.  Still have 2 small scars where the infection was eating though the gum on the top front tooth.  I still have tingling there also. Dentist was puzzled until I told him what it was from.  Hose is too short... don&#x27;t let anyone or any animal bump your arm while adjusting the flow....  Also, careful about your cities water pressure.. Our city did something different in my area.. Changed wells, the pressure was so bad it was blowing cartridges out of a guys faucet.  Make sure nothing/ or no one else is using water while you use this thing... I was washing clothing, the water pressure increased at my faucet after the washer filled up. It only took a split second to cause the damage...</li>
    <li> Simple, effective; quick &amp; easy (and a little fun) to use. I have a bridge and usually didn&#x27;t bother to floss under it though I knew I should.  QuickBreeze solves that problem and goes one step further than flossing and brushing for all my teeth... in 30 seconds.  My brother also uses it and no longer has bleeding gums. A great invention - highly recommended if you&#x27;re concerned with caring for your teeth.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it meets most of my expectations for flossing with water, gives me a clean feeling.  Minus include that it leaks at the connection, not majorly so, but it is not a sealed fit, so reliability is a concern over the long run.  Plus I am not sure whether that leak is the reason why my sink started leaking, or the pressure, but the leak is much worse whenever I use this device.  Will update later after I get a plumber to take a look at the sink to be sure.  The hose is also far too short so it gets in the way, I used a similar product with a longer, coiled hose, that design was the best for not getting in the way, and I would still be using that instead of this, except that one had a plastic connector (instead of metal) that eventually gave out.  The high water pressure doesn&#x27;t bother me, I actually prefer it for flossing, but it might bother other people, be careful to not use it full blast, a little goes a long way with this thing.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to keep the gums happy. I enjoy using this as it is easy to keep hooked up to a dedicated sink faucet. The only downfall is if a guest goes to use the sink and either sprays the bathroom or themself (when they get sprayed, it&#x27;s a little comical) The pressure is good and it just works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Meets the expectations. Easy to install. Easy to use. The quick release allows fast mounting and un-mounting. Let&#x27;s see how it does in the long run.</li>
    <li> So easy to attach and detach, no electricity needed.  Well worth the price and well made too! Watch out Waterpic</li>
    <li> This is very hard to use as there is no button to turn it on and off. Once you turn on the water it continues until you turn the faucet off.</li>
    <li> Now the first thing I do after eating a meal at home is to use the water floss. It flosses out all the nasty things you can&#x27;t get rid of with every day floss. Highly recommended. Fast, quick, simple design, and works extremely well.</li>
    <li> still not able to use it since it will not fit my faucet, i had wrote to them but at the day no response...</li>
    <li> this product has been a god sent.....so surprised at the particles  swept away....ordered second onee to keep at my parents home when i am there.......may order another for traveling too......great construction and easy to install and easy all around ...</li>
    <li> It works real well but the hose is short it could stand to be about 6&amp;#34; longer than it is now.</li>
    <li> I really like this device.  Have been using it for 5 months now.  No muss no fuss.  Just screw on the adapter, then the tube and nozzle, adjust the water tap for temp and pressure and your ready to go.  Great idea.</li>
    <li> Easy initial hookup, very sturdy manufacture, very easy to hook unhook (I was considering getting the style you leave attached and it has an on/off switch, but glad I went this route, totally hassle free)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super effective - one thing I notice, the amount of water I go through with this per session, I think I&#x27;d have to refill a WaterPik tank at least once to get the same cleaning time.  Can taste (eww!) when you hit a spot with some uncleanliness in your teeth, I expect this will stop happening over time as my teeth health improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> It was delivered by our mail carrier this morning.  It was not as simple as I thought from reading the instructions and watching the video.  It had two black washers and one large white one.  I tried all three individually because every time I tried a different one, it leaked.  I even tried some plumbing tape and it still leaked.  It appeared to me that water was still leaking because the washer thickness was too small.  So I inserted one of the black washers into the opening of the lavatory fixture and the white washer into the QuickBreeze aerator and it worked perfect.  Some of the reviews said it leaked, so I was not surprised.  However,  I found the solution by using the white washer in the QuickBreeze aerator and a black washer in the faucet.  When I screwed the QuickBreeze aerator in, the two washers provided the seal I needed to overcome the leakage. My wife and I then brushed our teeth and tried it out.  Works very well.  the back of my teeth already feel smoother--just like after one of my semi-annual cleanings by my dental hygienist.  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have an implant that&#x27;s a real food catcher. Even flossing and those little brushes could not get it all. The QuickBreeze was easy to install and it does a great job getting that implant area clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this primarily for cost reasons. The unit functions well. I didn&#x27;t realize that it required a replacement nozzle on my bathroom sink faucet. The nozzle attached easily enough and it works fine. My main complaint is there isn&#x27;t a button to temporarily stop the water flow. I like to set the pressure and temperature of the water by using the faucet taps rather than doing it while it is in my mouth. I had some interesting experiences trying to control the spray while putting it in my mouth. Maybe I need some instructions but it sure would be nice to have a flow interrupt button as other similar products have.</li>
    <li> I used Waterpik for a couple of years. Then the hose broke, and the pump wasn&#x27;t pumping as well. Then I switched to QuickBreeze, and also used RediBreeze. I sent one to all of my family members in Europe and they all love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I felt like the flow from QuickBreeze wasn&#x27;t as directed as the Waterpik flow, almost like it was fanning, and not as pointy. I got used to it though. QuickBreeze has made a great difference for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend RediBreeze (stationary unit) - it creates a lot of clutter around the faucet. Overall QuickBreezeI helped me a lot during the course of my orthodontic treatment, it also helps to keep deep pockets around my wisdom teeth free from food debris.</li>
    <li> Great product and so ready to install. Makes using a water pik so simple! So much better than the old fashioned ones that required tedious setup.</li>
    <li> I have an incredible amount of orthodontia appliances in my mouth. Full braces, rubber bands, metal hook implants - you name it, I drew the short stick. This irrigator has helped me keep the heard to reach places much cleaner! It was super quick and easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: if you hold the holder near the holder/tube connection it&#x27;s easy to accidentally loosen the cleaning head and start spraying water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is more just a personal comment, but I wish I had purchased the shower irrigator instead! Even sticking my head in the sink, I end up spraying water everyone. Operator error for sure, but something to think about unless you&#x27;re a skilled hygienist. :)</li>
    <li> This product  its very well built, very easy to instal and also very quite,&lt;br /&gt; I am so please with this product that I am  planning to buy another one so we can have it in every bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Goodby Water pik!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i got this for my son to clean his braces, seem to work ok. has a little learning curve to get the pressure right</li>
    <li> The QuickBreeze work great!  We really like it.  The connector seems to be made of metal, which I really appreciate.  It hooked up in less than a minute and connects really easily.  Our dentist recommended an oral irrigator because a little gum trouble.  This will work very well and we won&#x27;t have to have an appliance on our countertop.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received the Oral Breeze as gift about 4 months before my last teeth cleaning appointment, and to be honest, I&#x27;ve never been much of a flossing guy.  But as noted, I started using my QuickBreeze several months before my last appointment.  My dental hygienist actually calls me &amp;#34;Mister Plaque&amp;#34; which frankly has always seemed a bit rude, but I&#x27;m a roll-with-the-punches kind of guy, so no big deal.  Anyway, after my last cleaning, get this...she actually gave me a high five!  She said:  &amp;#34;Wow, nice work.  I can tell you&#x27;ve been flossing regularly!&amp;#34; Of course, the funny thing is, I haven&#x27;t used dental floss at all, since I got my Oral Breeze.  I probably should&#x27;ve told her the truth, but to be honest, &amp;#34;Mister Plaque&amp;#34; was eager to get out of her office as quickly as possible.  This is a great product, much easier and quicker than floss -- farewell Mr. Plaque!</li>
    <li> I have used an electric floss-er for years, along with dental floss........the floss-er just became heavy for a weak wrist.  In searching for something new, I discovered the &amp;#34;QuickBreeze&amp;#34; on Amazon...........I love it!  I have purchased four...one for each of our bath-rooms, and two as gifts.  Wherever the idea for Quickbreeze was initiated, thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this idea of water picking knowing that the water traveling through my pick is fresh. can get splashy if you don&#x27;t watch where the nozel points but hey clean your mirror along with your teeth!</li>
    <li> Attaches to the sink very nicely, however the spout disconnects from the hose anytime you turn it in your mouth, like to do a different area of your mouth. The company nicely offered me a new band to make it more secure, but I didn&#x27;t see the point, there is another issue. When I use the faucet your temperature tends to change the longer the water runs, its not very pleasant. And, even if you can maintain the temperature, I don&#x27;t feel that this item gives you the same pressure as other oral instigators do. I bought the new waterpick brand with the small tank since, (not the handheld one... to small of a tank), and its really great, has several different types of pic&#x27;s to use with it also.</li>
    <li> This is awesome than I thought it was!  It really does work inside your mouth.  Seems like giving you a good massage inside.  If you are ticklees you might need to adjust the water flow of your faucet. Comparing to some other portable ones, I really like this a lot better the fact that batteries are not necessary anymore.</li>
    <li> Apparently I have a special sink, it didnt fit. I went to Homedepot and couldnt buy anything to make it fit. I had to change my faucet in order to make it work. Ive decided I wanted to return, and custumer service was extremely rude. The person even told me I did not know how to read, and did not let me return it. Now I am stuck with something I cant even use. I am beyond upset about that.</li>
    <li> This is the second QuickBreeze I have purchased. An excellent product. I like it because it runs at the temperature I want and you don&#x27;t have to stop to refill the reservoir.</li>
    <li> Seals on this irrigator seem too small, as the tip continually comes loose and sprays water all over the bathroom.  The attachment to the faucet also leaks.</li>
    <li> We had the standard oral irrigator for years that had to be plugged in and took up too much room. This one is simple and can be easily stored when not in use. Just make to drain water out before storage.  No electricity means the kiddo can use without worry of a plug.  Great for teenagers and those with braces!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a water pick that did not require electricity, as I live in Greece (where appliances work at 220V as opposed to the 120V in the US). The QuickBreeze Dental Oral Irrigator seemed like a good, value for money alternative and I am extremely happy with it. It is very easy to use, effective, and easy to carry and use while traveling.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good value for money dental irrigator.</li>
    <li> Simple bombproof design and easy to use. Works like a water pick but no electricity, no noise and doesn&#x27;t break. The hose material is much more durable.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to put on and take off. It takes a little getting used to, so start by turning on the the faucet very slowly. And never forget to remove it from the faucet. Those are the only things that I can suggest for anyone buying it.&lt;br /&gt;If I ever needed to, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Brilliant. This simple, well-made product invites you to use it.    Looking something like a stethoscope, with a flexible tube about 18 inches long, and packaged in a deceptively small box, the QuickBreeze irrigator comes as a welcome replacement for my long-in-the-tooth electric other-name-brand model. With no plug to worry about, no mouldy water tank to clean, and no noisy pulsating motor, this gadget is a pleasure to use.    It comes with a plastic cleaning tip (the bit that goes in your mouth), and a spare of a different colour. With a twist, this locks into the working end of the tube. The chrome metal stethoscope end clamps to the outlet on the tap. You control the amount of flow (and pressure) and temperature by adjusting the tap handles.    The instruction leaflet is brief, but the installation is rather intuitive, anyway. An adaptor for the faucet is included. I did have to fiddle with this for about five minutes, trying different combinations of washers (included) to prevent the water from spurting around the connection. The stethoscope end attaches to the adaptor with a push-down ring assembly, in which is a sealing washer and ballbearings, allowing the device to pivot around the faucet head. This does not make for a perfect seal, and some back-flow escapes around the swivel head, though not enough to matter. Be aware that there&#x27;s a lot of pressure concentrated at the cleaning tip, so you should adjust the flow and temperature gradually. Think of this as a pressure washer for your mouth.    The item is, perhaps, a little on the dear side, but considering the cost of dental work, it&#x27;s still a bargain. And the hose could do with perhaps an extra 3 to 6 inches length. Other than those niggles, I&#x27;d say this is a valuable addition to your armoury of dental care. The fit and finish of the product is high and it&#x27;s a breeze to attach and unhook. Put it somewhere to dry in between uses.    I wish I&#x27;d discovered this product sooner.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Quick Breeze to replace a similar product that I purchased from my orthodontist about 15 yrs. ago.  (I loved it so much, that I continued using it until it broke last year.)  The quality of the Quick Breeze is incredible, compared to the \\&quot;all plastic\\&quot; product that it replaced.  It&#x27;s not just that the faucet components are a weighty metal; even the tubing and tips are a far superior plastic.  Coupled with a lifetime warranty, one has nothing to lose.  Installation is indeed easy, with a promise from the company to supply a different size connector, if needed.  If you&#x27;ve never used a faucet-mounted irrigator before, it might take some getting used to, but once you master the process, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever did without it.  Even though I&#x27;m a routine flosser, I&#x27;m often amazed at what brushing and flossing miss, especially after eating popcorn or other whole grains.  The Quick Breeze makes quick work of cleaning out all the nooks and crannies that even flossing sometimes misses.  Your dental and oral healths deserve the small investment of time and money that the Quick Breeze requires.</li>
    <li> I have been using QuickBreeze dental irrigator for about 14 months and it has been working great. No need to refill water as in other such devices. Takes so little space on the counter. Only way to improve this is by providing some sort of wall-holder/hook where this thing can rest when not in use. (Wall-stand for the tips is provided but it broke rather soon -- a minor issue.)</li>
    <li> I bought this product as I didnt&#x27; want another gadget on my bathroom&#x27;s vanity and as I have double sinks, it just made sense.  Also great is that YOU can control the speed of the water according to your needs.  What else can I say?  It works for me!</li>
    <li> These products are EXCELLENT!!!! I am so impressed with the Dental Oral Irrigator. It&#x27;s   so much easier to use than a waterpik. The Deep Pocket Irrigator works perfect for   cleaning a deep pocket I have under one of my back teeth. Maybe I will be able to keep my   teeth after all! THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVENTING THESE ITEMS!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement for a Water Pic or any others that sit on a counter.  I attached a Command hook above my sink to hang it on - no counter space!  Easily adjustable pressure according to how much water you turn on.  It did take some time to figure out how to use it so I didn&#x27;t drown myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, hoping to avoid having to buy a stand alone Water Pik type.  My oral hygienist said I needed this type of product.  I watched the video clip of someone using on and it didn&#x27;t look to hard, however you need to repace your faucet aerator which got me into trouble do to defects in my old faucet.  Had to buy a new faucet and install that myself, etc. Unit seems overpriced for what it is. My hose was kinked up in the shipping box and never straightened out, not like the video demo which featured a straight hose.  It is sometimes hard to get a proper temp and water pressure level.  Othewise it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> After looking at other irrigators on the market. This seems to be the best option. No clutter, simple to use, and no refilling water tanks! Snap it on, find the correct water pressure and your gums will thank you!!!</li>
    <li> WOW, This works great. Easy to attach, adjust water flow and temp and away you go. Does more than flossing. You can see stuff that you missed. So I didn&#x27;t think that I could attach it my self with out asking my son-in-law to help, but I did it. I think everyone should have a quickbreeze.</li>
    <li> I am super glad that I have purchased the QuickBreeze Oral Irrigator.  I have been in the market for an oral irrigator and have read reviews of electronic versions. I then stumbled upon QuickBreeze Oral Irrigator on Amazon.com. I read reviews for both the QuickBreeze and RediBreeze and then compared it with the electronic versions.  My intuition assisted with the reviews of the QuickBreeze Oral Irrigator helped me decide on the QuickBreeze.  I have been using the QuickBreeze for three days now.  I&#x27;m at home on holidays so I&#x27;m using it 3x a day minimally.  I actually look forward to using the QuickBreeze. I tested the QuickBreeze by using it and then flossing to see if anything is left between my teeth, so far nothing.  I&#x27;ve also tested by flossing and then using the QuickBreeze, and yes, stuff still does come out from between my teeth, this test shows that QuickBreeze does work like a charm.     Oh, I think it&#x27;s grand that you can adjust the pressure of the spray, simply turn your faucet to the desired pressure.  You can even control the water temp. by adjusting the cold/hot water.    Both metal pieces, the one that screws into the faucet and the piece that attached to it, the one with the hose, is made of quality metal.  Both pieces are solid, of quality. I am definitely going to tell my friend about the QuickBreeze Oral Irrigator on my FaceBook account.      Last but not least, shipping was fast and I even got a freebie, I got a tongue scrapper? - I&#x27;m using it as one, seems to do the trick. I&#x27;ll be surprised if it&#x27;s something else and all this time I&#x27;m using it as a tongue scrapper, lol...    Tom, you&#x27;ve got to send your invention to Oprah.      And may you all have clean teeth and healthy gums....    Simon  Vancouver, Canada</li>
    <li> For what this item does, it does it well. However, the more expensive units that use a tank and a pump give you a slight pulsing affect which is good for working stuff out from the teeth. Using nothing but water pressure is okay, but you don&#x27;t get that same pulsing affect. I miss that massaging affect of the pulse, but at the price, I can live without it.  Caution: don&#x27;t have the pressure too high as this could damage the gums. You might also push food particles, etc. deeper below the gum.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of the oral irrigator.  Really like the product but it appears that the life expectancy is around one year due to the nozzle separating from the tubing.  The one I just purchases seems to have a more flexible tubing.  Here&#x27;s hoping it last a bit longer</li>
    <li> I dreaded going to the dentist because no matter how diligently I brushed and flossed, I always had something that had to be done.  Upon asking my dentist for candid criticism of what I was doing wrong he told me that its my flossing since all the work that I&#x27;ve had done needs to be done on areas between my teeth.  He suggested I use a water pik, but upon researching them I found them problematic and over priced.  Happily I stumbled upon Quickbreeze and saw several inherit advantages along with its much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off since you&#x27;re using regular water pressure, you can dial the pressure up or down with a simple turn of the water knob, likewise you can control the temperature to your satisfaction.  Secondly, the nozzles have got a steady flow rather than a pulse which serves to dislodge stubborn or thick matter between your teeth way better than a pulser does.  Finally by dialing the pressure up or down, you can increase it for between the teeth cleaning and dial it down to provide a gentler spray against your gum line.  I&#x27;ve owned this thing for two years now, and its the first two years my dentist didn&#x27;t have work to do.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for - a quiet oral water cleaner that works well and does not build up bacteria in a reservoire.  It attached very easily to the faucet.  I use it every day.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> We love it!  Does a great job and we don&#x27;t have to bother with charging or replacing batteries.</li>
    <li> Have been using irrigators for years.  Had one attached to my shower head with a silver colored plastic toggle that broke after just a few months use.  The electronic ones don&#x27;t have enough pressure and are too noisy to use late at night when everyone is sleeping.  This QuickBreeze may be the perfect solution as it looks like it is well made and will stand up to twice daily use.  It appears to be made of a solid metal.  Also, you can adjust the pressure well above what the electronic ones will allow.  I would not allow kids or handicapped people to use it as it can be set too high.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It does the job and works good.  Simple design.  That being said, it&#x27;s expensive for what comes in the box.</li>
    <li> Anyone with basic handyman skills can assemble this product. If you feel this project is too complicated simply call a plumber or have some handy friend install it for you. In my case I ended up going over to a home improvement store to get a new faucet because the adapter fitting did not fit the faucet that I had.  After installing the faucet, I simply removed the aerator and replaced it with the quick fit adapter. I then snapped the quick fitting into place, inserted a tip, turned on the water and blasted my teeth clean with the spray tip. At first use the water jet may tickle or cause some sensitivity issues so make sure to keep the water pressure lower to reduce discomfort. As time goes on your gums will get used to this cleaning procedure and you may increase the water pressure by turning up the water pressure.  You will see that this product is very well built and should last a lifetime. I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve used a competitors electrical powered water jet type product for years and after a very short month have become a believer in this product. The Quick Breeze floods your mouth with water in a way that doesn&#x27;t allow any hidden particles to escape untouched.  I can&#x27;t believe how effective this product is. As I mentioned, consider that you might have to get a new faucet to accommodate this product because there simply are too many aerator tips and faucet styles for one adapter to fit every faucet. My conclusion is BUY IT! and get a new faucet if you have to. You will love this product.</li>
    <li> My sink won&#x27;t accept it since its not threaded.  It works well though attached to my other sink and it is fully functional.  The spray is not completely straight as the hole is not bored 100% accurately, but the constriction of the water flow increases the water pressure and works correctly with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> This is really convenient and easy to use, you can control the intensity and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews about it not fitting, I went and ordered it anyway. Did not fit any of my three bathroom faucets. It did fit in my kitchen where I will be using it for my kids braces. With new water regulations around the country the newer faucets are made with smaller aerators.Lower GPM. This co should make more than one size.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It hooks directly to the sink and I don&#x27;t have to worry about refilling the waterpik reservoir (my main reason for getting this device).&lt;br /&gt;It also includes an elegant metal aerator (not plastic) with a small profile, so when not in use it does not look ugly&lt;br /&gt;can easily be put away as it is very easy to connect to aerator and disconnect at will&lt;br /&gt;Aerator was easy to attach - for my sink at least, and actually seems to work even better than the one I previously had when not using QB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t pulsate&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seem to feel quite as strong as Waterpik (but still relatively strong - not nearly as weak as the air flosser thing)&lt;br /&gt;BIGGEST ISSUE - this needs a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button (like on the Waterpik) so you can stop the flow at the point of the device!!!  This would get 5 stars if it had this feature.  There is an &amp;#34;infinite&amp;#34; amount of water coming out of your sink when on so it will fill your mouth very quickly, and can make quite a mess without this feature.  Plus if you have a two faucet &amp;#34;hot and cold getting the right temperature can be a bit tricky as can be turning it off depending on how sensitive your plumbing is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAIN AND SIMPLE this device needs a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button!  I&#x27;m guessing that there is probably some complexities in doing this because it would need to hold your sinks water pressure back (not an easy feat), and would prob require higher quality tubing etc...but I would easily pay double for this item if it had that feature!</li>
    <li> it took some time (a few days) to break this in but the workmanship of this product is great. Our last oral irrigator was made in plastic. This is all metal. Came on time as well</li>
    <li> This irrigator is well worth what I paid it is easy to install and the adaptor is hardly noticeable  on the faucet. Hooked to the faucet the temp and pressure are a breeze  to control. I highly recommend  this product</li>
    <li> I have a serious mouth condition that leaves me with tender gums that bleed easily.  Floss and those small brushes made my gums bleed yet I needed to use them - until I bought the QuickBreeze.  My husband installed it with no problem and I use it just as easily.  I love not having a another item on the bathroom counter and not having to fiddle with cleaning another apparatus.  Most important is that this device gets out food particles easily and painlessly.</li>
    <li> This ties up your faucet and you can&#x27;t use it for anything other, than irrigating your teeth!  If you have a faucet you never use for anything, then this is ok, but I would get the ReadyBreeze that has a value for turning it off and on, allowing the water to flow through it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!  I bought this on the recommendation of 2 co-workers, and learned my lesson.  I tried and tried to get it to fit my $500 faucet, because I liked the idea of not having another appliance in my bathroom.  Worked &amp;#34;okay&#x27; if you didn&#x27;t turn on the water too high, but otherwise it sent a spray out horizontally.  I joked with my roommate did you wet yourself?  and he said &amp;#34;no, it&#x27;s that damn attachment&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it says don&#x27;t use any tools, but after two days, I thought if I use a towel and was gentle, I could make it tight enough that I&#x27;m not washing the whole bathroom when I want to get water.  I  barely tightened and turned, and heard a crunch!  Not only did the adapter break, but it attached itself to my faucet making the aerator useless as the threads were screwed up!&lt;br /&gt;So I spent $30 on this piece of crap and then had to go buy another faucet.&lt;br /&gt;Use at your own risk, but I got &amp;#34;hosed&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work but it didn&#x27;t for me...It&#x27;s such a cool concept! The water would either instantly fill my mouth or spray everywhere and make a mess if I opened it. Plus, the water pressure felt less strong than simply swishing my mouth with water. Sigh. I&#x27;m glad others have found it helpful, though! I just couldn&#x27;t master it.</li>
    <li> Its efficient and way more convenient then plug in kind.  Excellent price highly recommemd.  Wish I had known long time ago, maybe as soon as I grew teeth maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have lost one to decay.</li>
    <li> This item is AWESOME!!!!!! There should be more products like this. Simple, easy to use, does the job of squirting water around your mouth and teeth. No motors, no electricity, simmmmmple. I wish I&#x27;d found this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;WE HAVE BEEN USING THIS IRRIGATOR for FIVE YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s been that long.&lt;br /&gt;We still love it, we still use it multiple times a day and it still works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where we live now has double sinks in the master bathroom so we actually just leave it hooked up all the time to one of the sinks.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s become a permanent part of our dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it takes up so little space and has great pressure it makes it easy to use after every meal. I can&#x27;t imagine not giving my teeth a squirt after most meals now. When we eat out somewhere it feels almost weird not to go give my mouth a good rinse after eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be careful of is do NOT turn the faucet on until the end is in your mouth and do NOT take it out of your mouth until you turn the faucet off.&lt;br /&gt;There have been a couple of occasions where one of us when tired or not paying attention turned the faucet on absent mindedly before the pic was in the mouth and gave ourselves a facefull. It&#x27;s kind of funny when that happens and will give you a very very very good soaking (ahem and the ceiling, and the mirror and the wall behind you)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended the same unit to all of my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I had dental surgery a while ago and the Quick Breeze is a great way to improve the health of your gums.  My husband and I really love the Quick Breeze it is very easy to hook up and now we are in our way to better dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this to so many people! It is wonderful this most recent purchase was a gift. I hope she likes it as much as I do</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my experience with Oral Breeze. The product was delivered quickly, and it was amazingly simple to install and use. I was reluctant to buy a water pic because most of the oral irrigators on the market received mediocre reviews, and didn&#x27;t sound very effective.  However, this concept is simply brilliant and I actually enjoy cleaing my teeth and gums with the QuickBreeze! I highly recommend this product.  Great job!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as an alternative to the expensive waterpic. I had no trouble installing it and it was very quick.  The product does what is supposed to and removes debris between the teeth. I the customer service is excellent being that they sent out replacement hoses when I complained of a leak.      I have only positive experiences with this product. Before I brush I use it and if I don&#x27;t have time to floss, I will use this.  It is not to be substitute for flossing but rather a supplement to it.  I am impressed with effectiveness and quality of the item. No cleaning, no loud noise, no hassle like the water pik.</li>
    <li> I have used all types of electric water jets and this is SOOO MUCH better! It takes up VERY little space. Just hook the adapter (comes with unit) to your faucet and you&#x27;re pretty much ready to go. It takes a few days of using it to get a feel of what pressure is right but once you get used to it it&#x27;s great. I had a problem with one of the hoses after a year, I wrote the company and she sent me three extra hoses for FREE. They must have updated the way the hose attaches to the mouthpiece because, originally when I purchased this a couple of years ago, it kept popping off. The replacements the company sent were \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; to the end so there was no more popping off due to pressure. PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money on the electric waterpiks. I really can see these lasting for a LONG time and I think they are much more effective. Super healthy teeth and gums:)y&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - sometimes the hose will pop off but I will say the company is fantastic about helping you out. I had an issue where the hose would not stay on and would literally slowly come off the of the pik and water would spray everywhere. I emailed the company and within a day new updated hoses with bigger o-rings on their way for free....so they do stand behind their awesome product.</li>
    <li> 5 stars not only  for the quality but also  for service.  I have used  it  for 3 years and prompt and free replacement parts have  been provided.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, just as advertised, and more. Really helped me get my teeth and gums back in great shape, exactly as promised! Thanks!</li>
    <li> With a mouth full of metal- braces and an expander- the QuickBreeze has become a necessity. Typically, you can feel a piece of food stuck in your teeth but not stuck in your metal!?! So having the QuickBreeze is a real blessing. I never have to worry if I&#x27;m going to bed with some awful thing that has free reign to erode my teeth all night.     My orthodontist is quite impressed as well. After a month of use he said to me, \\&quot;Your hygiene is impeccable\\&quot;. I think that&#x27;s the highest complement a Doctor of Dentistry can pay!!     My only regret, and I would advise anyone looking here not to repeat it, is that I didn&#x27;t spent five more dollars for the RediBreeze. The QuickBreeze is not difficult to pull on and off but to have the convenience of the tool being attached all the time would be well worth it. Plus, I would rest easier not having to worry about the tragedy of turning the water on in the middle of the night with the QuickBreeze still attached. Watch Out!! lol</li>
    <li> I bought the QuickBreeze after reading all the positive recommendations. Unfortunately, it does not fit on new (less than 2 years)water saver Kohler faucets. Their technician is working on a possible fix to this situation, and perhaps I can eventually use it.  UPDATE- They were kind enough to send me an additional kit with diferent fittings (at NO charge!) and one did fit my faucet. The product works ok but I like a more powerfull jet so I am considering a Waterpik or other pulsating product. I gave the QuickBreeze to my daughter and they like it alot.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item before as it is simple to use and always works perfectly.  It is easy to install and does not take up alot of counter space.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite Amazon purchases! It&#x27;s a tooth saver.</li>
    <li> I expected this thing to work better, the moment i plug it in and the water starts coming out, it was like a sprinkler, I mean, I was expecting water shooting out with some force (yes there was force) but in a somewhat straight line, but that wasn&#x27;t what i have here.&lt;br /&gt;The water shoots out and spread out, it was just messy, water every where.&lt;br /&gt;Tried the second attachment to see if that might work better, but it was the same as well.</li>
    <li> Easy install and fit. Takes a few minutes to get used to how it works. Yes lots of water comes out of your mouth. Works great. My teeth and gums thank  you.</li>
    <li> my dentist told me to clean the pockets in my gums with some kind of oral irrigator so i got one of these. you can adjust the water pressure and temp to blast out bacteria in a comfortable fashion. i went and bought one for everyone i know! i&#x27;m sure they think i&#x27;m nuts.</li>
    <li> I was getting frustrated with my big name brand product.  I was on my 2nd one in less than a year.  I had the rechargeable type and after a while it simply would not recharge.  The 2nd time this happened, into the trash it went.  I thought there must be something better.  I found the Oral Breeze, read reviews and went to their website.  I would recommend this to others interested in a better product.  There are tutorials on how to install each product.  Easy as pie.  Out of the box and on the faucet in 5 minutes.  I gave it a test drive.  It is going to take some practice to maneuver about but so far, I think I am in love.  I love that when I am done it stores away out of sight, can go as long as I want it to and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> It was a bit hard to get all the attachments to make it work, but the company was super helpful and when I got all appropriate parts it works like a CHARM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who needs to use electricity of a pump? And expensive SonicCare that inevitably breaks after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it feels different, but is the same principle and this one-time purchase is more than worth it! I recommend it to ANYONE, everyone! GREAT INVESTMENT!</li>
    <li> This is the easy to use and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> It arrived with the wrong part and I couldn&#x27;t use it.  It arrived on time and in good condition but I returned it and didn&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> i love this idiot-proof irrigator. wrote to the manufacturer to enquire about the different sizes of faucets, since i travel quite a bit, and Kelly was extremely helpful in explaining. when the items arrived, it took me less than 5 min to set it up and start using. i like that the connector adapter is not plastic and cant believe how easy it was to install.    this device saves time flossing and makes flossing fun.</li>
    <li> The only negative I can come up with for this is that there is no button to stop/start the stream. I&#x27;m also sure that would add a bit to the cost, but would be a great addition as well.    -Rick    It looks like they have an updated one with a valve adjustment on the fitting that attaches to the sink now... [...]    I would still like an on/off button on the nozzle itself. My brother only has use of one hand due to a brain injury and this is unusable unfortunately for him. One step closer to perfection though...</li>
    <li> I have used a waterpik for years and was somewhat skeptical, but I liked the price of this unit and the fact that it was quiet. I decided I might as well try it, and I am glad that I did! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!    If you are a waterpik user...this unit does not pulse like the waterpik.  Seemed strange to me at first, but by the third time I used it I had forgotten all about my pulsing waterpik.  I LOVE the fact that I don&#x27;t have that bulky unit setting out on my bathroom counter. Some people reported spraying water everywhere when they used it...I did not have a problem at all.  It installed easily and fit my faucet perfectly.  Great product!</li>
    <li> After having many people recommend that I purchase a Water Pic and not being able to afford one, I decided to look for an alternative.  I came across the Quick Breeze in a search on Amazon.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  WOW!  What a great product for an affordable price!  Simple to set up and use.  My husband and I had a slight learning curve of 2 - 3 uses and then we felt like pros.  Initially, I thought that I&#x27;d only use it once a day, at night before bed.  But it is so incredibly easy to hook up and use, that I have no problem using it in the morning before work.  I have had deep cleanings performed at the dentist office utilizing their professional water pressure cleaner.  My mouth feels just as clean after using the Quick Breeze as when I would have the professional cleaning.  My teeth are very tightly spaced, so that flossing was always a huge fight, literally.  I would end up punching or hitting myself in the face when forcing the floss down and up from my gums, not to mention all the shredded floss I would go through (my teeth would shred Glide floss too).  Needless to say, because of that, I would only floss once a day, and hated doing it.  Quick Breeze is aptly named -- it is a quick breeze!  Love it, love it, love it!!!  Ps.  If you have a faucet that is not standard, just take your aerator and the Quick Breeze adapter to your local plumbing supply and they will find you connector, for less than $2.00.  UPDATE 11/14/2011:  Just visited my dentist last week.  He is one of the old-school dentists that cleans your teeth thoroughly and does not send you out for a special \\&quot;deep\\&quot; cleaning.  Anyway, usually the bib is full of blood and tarter, and the cleaning takes an hour or more.  NOT THIS TIME!  My dentist could not believe that the gum pockets had closed up, that I had no hard tarter (just soft), and that my teeth had no staining.  He was VERY impressed!  I told him I had been using the QuickBreeze (and what it was) and he said tokeep using it.  He then turned to my husband and asked if he was using the QuickBreeze too.  When my husband said no, the dentist told him he needed to start using it daily like I was.  I am so impressed with this little tool, it really is fabulous!!!  You will not go wrong in purchasing this!</li>
    <li> As you can see by the rating I am more than pleased with this product.  When I first started utilizing the unit  I experienced some of the same problems brought out by some of the lower ratings reviews.  Even at that, after being smarter than the product, I was still satisfied with its performance.  But, within a week, I received an unsolicited notification from the manufacturer addressing the hose unhooking problem (obviously, this manufacturer reads the reviews).  They immediately sent out a hose with a reenforced connection; problem solved.  I have owned and used an electric model with a resevoir (in which I was well pleased) until, after a year, it gave up the ghost.  Also, the Oral Breeze does eliminate clutter from the sinktop.  I so enjoy the product that I ordered the system that adapts to the shower.  Final words: Great product; Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the stand alone irrigators and much cheaper. A bit inconvenient as it attaches to the sink faucet.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT OF THE YEAR AWARD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best customer service I have ever had!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  have used this product for more than 1 year and you can rest assured this will change your life ( or at least your mouth)&lt;br /&gt;easy to install, easy to use and in case of anything going wrong just call their amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;they shipped me out a replacement washer within 24 hours, were extremely courteous and friendly and they stand behind their product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;A MUST FOR KIDS WITH BRACES&lt;br /&gt;thank you thank you thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent product! No more fiddling with separate water containers, finding a socket to plug the pump in, etc. Adapter screws in the standard faucet, and you can attach/remove the irrigator easily for each usage. It does take a bit of effort for the first few times, but don&#x27;t loose hope, after a week or so you&#x27;ll be able to do it momentarily. Remember, after attaching the irrigator, open the faucet slowly, and check the pressure on your hand first, you don&#x27;t want to release full water pressure on the small hose!</li>
    <li> Fantastic invention.....arrived fast and very easy to use, as well as does a good job cleaning the teeth of particles.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> great hygiene item and helps to rinse mouth in hard to get places. Tonsils stones get washed out very easy. Although it takes getting used to it. Giving 4 start because tips are plastic and kind of spray it out instead of keeping it together.</li>
    <li> This thing works very well.  I love that I can get my water temp just right and then start it.  Also can reduce or increase the pressure by raising or lowering the water pressure.  It doesn&#x27;t break, is inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space - it just sits in a drawer until we need it at night - and even can often be used when on vacation.  It doesn&#x27;t work everywhere we go, but many places it does.  We have an extra one just for travel. After years of using a battery operated or electric water flossers that seem to break and take up lots of space, this is a wonderful replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note, though, that this tickles the gums/roof of mouth more than pulsing water flossers have - at least for me.  You do get used to it for the most part, but it does seem to be slightly different in terms of how it feels when you use it.  Turning the water pressure down seems to help reduce the tickling feeling.</li>
    <li> Its everything you want in a great price..easy to install..and works great. I would definitly order &amp; try it before spending alot of money for Waterpik &amp; having it taking up space on your counter.</li>
    <li> This product is 10x more portable as a tank version irrigator. And no noise! Nice quality connectors. No tools needed.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it attaches to the faucet.  Great device!  I recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to flossing!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Pretty simple installation.  I just hooked it up to our second bathroom sink that wasn&#x27;t used much and it&#x27;s really nice not having to constantly fill up water reservoir.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted for an oral irrigator. Removes completely off sink by way of a detachable coupler. Did not need to use any of the plastic adaptors included but did need to figure out which washer to install with the aerator. After I am done using, I just detach it, place in a container and store in the bathroom cabinet. Summary: conveinient, out of the way, priced right, &#x27; Perfect &#x27;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare to find a great product at a reasonable price - from a company that is all about service. But I&#x27;ve found it in this product. The Quick Breeze is easy to use, inexpensive and it works! I&#x27;ve had nothing but good reports from my dental hygienest since I&#x27;m using it. This was not always the case. My gums are in much better condition and it even seems that the more I&#x27;ve used it, the more my teeth sensitivity has decreased. I did have the WaterPik at one time - but it was such a project to use...I hardly ever did. Within a year, it was leaking and not working effectively. This is truly a \\&quot;breeze\\&quot; to use. I could almost guarantee you&#x27;ll use it more and, thus, get better results with your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> This is my second device, replacing an older one with a failed hose.  Use has resolved some gum issues I was experiencing.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well made. The company also sends you an email with instructions on how to use it and in what order. Easy to set up and very easy to use. If you don&#x27;t irrigate your teeth, it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s hard or time consuming to do. I would definitely recommend this over standard waterpik type irrigators.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product which beats all other oral irrigators on the market. Thank you Oral Breeze for making irrigation so much less of a pain. If you buy it, guys, know that you can easily widen the hole in the spray tip with an ice pick or a tiny drill bit gently turned by hand (or even just a nail) to make for a fatter spray of water from it. Just do not overdo it, because it will be too late once the hole is too big. I have had this gadget duct for over a year and do not see what could fail on it. It is solid, simple, and it works. Do not be deterred by the negative reviews you see here. I am afraid those who submitted them had faulty faucets to start with and/or are spoiled. If your faucet is low, order the QuickBreeze, which snaps on and off. If you have a high faucet and will not mind loosing a bit of washing room under it RediBreeze will do fine on it. However, you might have to contend with the possibility of you or someone else in your househhold forgetting to change the position of the lever responsible for directing the water flow to either the irrigator or the faucet with the result of you and your bathroom taking an unwanted shower.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best option in terms of price, easiness of use, and effectiveness. It&#x27;s easy to snap on, easy to snap off, it doesn&#x27;t add to the clutter in the bathroom as it&#x27;s easy to store away. I don&#x27;t know whether a shower version exists, but some sort of the adaptor would be a plus.</li>
    <li> I made my purchase a few weeks ago and wanted to wait until I&#x27;ve used the thing awhile until I made my review. This product is VERY WELL MADE and VERY WELL SUPPORTED by the [made in USA] manufacturer. Sure I know my way around DYI things..but it could not have been easier to install. literally in less than one minute I had the bypass valve and hose installed and working perfectly. This product comes with several faucet adapters and a small DVD to help anyone get it done right. As for use of the product it&#x27;s self it takes two or three times to get used to the tingling/tickling sensation produced by the water pressure, making proper adjustments to hot a cold water, and how much pressure to use...Go with light pressure at first and work your way up if need be.</li>
    <li> I have used several \\&quot;Water Pics\\&quot; in the past, and needed to replace another one when I saw this one on Amazon.com. It looked interesting and I thought I may as well try it. It is a lot easier to use than the \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot; . There is nothing to clean up after use and no mechanical parts to wear out. I admit I miss the pulsation with the \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot; but like the \\&quot;QuickBreeze Dental Oral Irrigator\\&quot; much better. I recommend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a good product. At least my younger son is addicted to it and he wants to do it every night. My bathroom also got cleaned at the same time (the wall and mirror got sprayed every night!) Anyhow, the installation is as simple as can be even I (who cannot put nails on wall) can install it. There is a little bit of a leaking issue around the connection. I guess I will call their office and ask them where to put the white ring.  Anyhow, I am very happy with my waterpik. I hope my dentist will see the difference in my teeth on Monday when he examins my teeth.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This product meets and exceeds my expectations. I especially like the amount of water pressure you can apply to the irrigator depending on your preference. Plus, you can run it for a long time without using any power source. And the faucet connector is genuine chrome steel and not some flimsy plastic. I would recommend this product.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> NOT PLASTIC ! The metal fittings work, and the size of the hose is large enough that you can turn the volume of water on as you can tolerate. Look NO further than Quick Breeze products. I ordered others from Amazon and the fittings are plastic. When you turn on the water the fittings blow off. Not with Quick Breeze.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting a cheaper water pick from Amazon. The cheaper one had a plastic attachment to the sink instead of metal. When I would turn the faucet on it would pop off due to poor design. This one on the other hand is VERY solid. Everything feels top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually thought this product had some fake reviews before I bought it since they were too positive, but it turns out it is really just a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the water from the pick doesn&#x27;t stay in a nice stream at high pressures. The plastic tip may just need to be smoothed out though.</li>
    <li> Great product, much better than the clumsy tank that needs counter space. I would recommend this, we have one in both bathrooms.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used the Waterpik in the past and decided to purchase this for the simplicity. It was a wise decision. Not only is it easier to use, it way more effective. No more filling up the tank when the water runs out, makes life easier and my gums healthier. Great product!</li>
    <li> The person who was kind enough to make a solid reliable made to last oral irrigation, bless you! I love mine.&lt;br /&gt;I have in the past, used the counter top model. Too noisy and loud enough to wake the dead. No more of those for me. I even found a nice hand held one that takes 2 aa batteries and it is wonderful but...it eats batteries like crazy. So, I saw this and said yes,this will do the job.(after I studied &amp;#34;will it work?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits fine on my Price Pfister faucet. I just unscrewed the end of the faucet spout where the water comes out, attached the one that comes with it then, pulling down on it I popped on the end to the faucet.(I know this is not real clear,but it&#x27;s really a no brainer, just have patience, you&#x27;ll get it). and I was ready to water floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, use some common sense with this. Adjust your water temp and don&#x27;t turn the faucet on full blast, just a small stream, otherwise you&#x27;ll spray the bathroom! Get it to a comfortable warm, then test it on your hand. If it feels nice, then try it on your tongue. If it feels comfortable then it will be ok for your gums. You can increase the pressure, just don&#x27;t overdo it. Ya don&#x27;t want any damage to the gums and dental work! The best part? no noise, cleans great and your teeth will be clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Debated whether I should choose this water pic that attached to the sink or a free standing one which was the only one I knew of until I saw the QuickBreeze.  Made the right decision! I can control the pressure, water temperature, and the amount of time I want to use this. Love not having another \\&quot;thing\\&quot; on the sink to clean or be in the way.  It&#x27;s so easy to store and so easy to attach and use it. But beware!  Using this water pic is addictive!</li>
    <li> Customer service with Oral Breeze is outstanding! If you have any problems with the product, they are eager to help to get it resolved. They don&#x27;t try to put the blame on the way you are using the product, unlike so many other companies do. Plus it&#x27;s made in America and is a Veteran owned company.</li>
    <li> It was as describe and worked perfectly</li>
    <li> I got this because we have hard water, and water piks keep clogging, and I can&#x27;t fix them. This is better than a water pik, because it works just as well, takes up less space on my counter, and is easier to control. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My water pressure is not that strong, but still does a good job. I miss the pulsing of the machine which seems to put out a little bit stronger water stream but the advantages of never having to fill a water canister and having it take up counter space is so nice and convenient. It takes plague off of my teeth like the pulsing machine although it takes just a little bit longer. It is plastic but well made and I hope will work for years, unlike the machines which seem to need replacing every 6 months or less. Good product I would order again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Powerful , be careful!!!!</li>
    <li> A super easy way to irrigate your teeth/mouth with a steady stream of water at the temperature you choose. Love IT!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and use.  Cost effective.  No electricity or machinery to break down.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good, but not as good as dental floss. I use this for cleaning my gum line, but it&#x27;s not effective between my teeth. The dental floss does better job to get &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out between teeth. I like this since I can change the water pressure from the faucet, and I can use warm water instead of cold water. There are 2 heads to use, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference. It&#x27;s easy to attach and detach. However, this is not universal for any faucet. Be sure that you have the faucet that can remove the faucet &amp;#34;tip valve&amp;#34; or you can&#x27;t install the adapter into the faucet. I thought that I can replace dental floss with this, but I will use both.</li>
    <li> Does not include various adapters for various sized faucets. You have to play plumber to get the correct threaded adapters. Also I always have water spraying at sink-attachment area and have to put  a face towel over the faucet to keep from getting  sprayed. An almost-there product, but that little bit off means you don&#x27;t make it.</li>
    <li> This is my second QuickBreeze.  My wife got tired of sharing with me so I bought her one.  It went onto my faucet easily, the wand and hose attaches smoothly, and it does an EXCELLENT job cleaning our teeth.  We love it.</li>
    <li> only need more accessories to control the water pressure as waterpik does it.</li>
    <li> The QuickBreeze works much better than the previous irrigator I used. Even though there is no pulsating flow, the increased water flow volume and pressure works far better. The delivery was quick, and the setup was fast and simple. Will recommend!</li>
    <li> Every now and then someone comes up with an idea and a design that is simple, works, and is inexpensive. The Quick Breeze is one of those. Easy to install on your home lavatory faucet. Well made. Snaps on and off; I store it in the drawer of the lav cabinet. My wife likes that there is no box or equipment on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it works?&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little getting used to for setting the right pressure and temperature, and how to move around in your mouth so as not to spray water all over the counter. But with a little experimentation you pick up the technique.  For cleaning the teeth it seems to do the job. Next visit to the dentist for his inspection will tell the tale.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used QuickBreeze now for about a month, after throwing out my fourth WaterPik. My WaterPiks have lasted about three years before they break -- most often the hose starts to leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QuickBreeze is indeed simple: just a faucet adapter, hose, and a nozzle. The only moving part is the ring that clips it to the faucet. It can&#x27;t change the water flow and puts out a **lot** of water in a continuous stream. If I run the water with the QuickBreeze attached but not in my mouth, water sprays all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though they say it fits most bathroom faucets, it didn&#x27;t fit mine. But when I called them, QuickBreeze immediately sent me a set of adapter rings that worked fine. When I took it on a trip, the bathroom faucet in the hotel had a **rectangular** opening and didn&#x27;t fit. The replacement aerator that comes with the QuickBreeze is **not** flow restricted and puts out lots more water than the aerator that came with the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the QuickBreeze is really fast: 1) Run the the hot and cold water until the temperature is stable. 2) Turn off the water, clip on the QuickBreeze. 3) Put the tip in your mouth, turn on the water, and go to it. 4) Turn off the water, unclip the QuickBreeze, and you&#x27;re done. Finally, I hang it up on the towel rack so it drains and won&#x27;t grow mold. (The adapter head is so heavy it took a while to figure out how to keep it from falling on the floor.) The whole thing takes me about 50 seconds, much less time than a WaterPik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s one area in my lower middle gum where if I get the QuickBreeze stream anywhere near it, it digs a hole in the gum that&#x27;s painful for over an hour. The QuickBreeze ads claim it&#x27;s a form of dental floss. That&#x27;s silly: like a WaterPik, it does a terrific job of cleaning out food particles and massaging the gums, but it can&#x27;t remove sticky dental plaque the way floss can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very fast to use&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job cleaning out food particles&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully will last longer than a WaterPik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Digs a hole in one area of my gum&lt;br /&gt;Probably not a good travel solution&lt;br /&gt;Easy to spray water all over if you&#x27;re not carefullast longer than a WaterPik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Digs a hole in one area of my gum&lt;br /&gt;Probably not a good travel solution&lt;br /&gt;Easy to spray water all over if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
    <li> Love it with no maintenance. It just works night after night. Basics and very functional, nothing fancy, wonderful gadget.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very rugged and well-made.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist is very impressed with the improvement&lt;br /&gt;of my dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I had the earlier version with the valve on the side and decided to this. On the earlier version, I sometimes would for get to switch back to the faucet and it would shoot water all over when I turn on the water.  With the quick breeze, I only connect it to use it. It makes the sink area look nicer too.&lt;br /&gt;I remodeled my bathroom, when the quick breeze came, it wasn&#x27;t the right connector size.  I sent them an email. They were very quick in getting back to me with photos to help me identify the type of faucet I have.  And, sent me the adopter for my faucet with no additional charge.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great and the service is first rate.</li>
    <li> I really liked the convenience of the snap off device, and it gives a real good water jet pressure. I purchased the shower quickbreeze it lasted a couple of years. I&#x27;m pleased with the product&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Installed easily by my 13 yr. old grandchild. Simple to use. No batteries, or other hardware to clutter an already cramped space.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This same grandchild is using it, and is very happy with the comfort it gives her mouth after a orthodontist visit.</li>
    <li> I spent some time looking over all the oral irragators offered. This Oral Breeze seemed so simple, adjustable and reasonably priced. Ordered and received it quickly. The washer adaptors did not work well, so I called&#x27;em and in no time got the correct washers to adapt to my sink faucet. I love the feeling I have after having used the irragator. I&#x27;m inclined to use it 3Xs a day just because I feel so much fresher ! The family has not complained about the adaptor to the sink faucet. I don&#x27;t feel impeded at all when washing up at the sink. I have no more gum/tooth sensitivity to cold liquids as well!</li>
    <li> Works really great.  The best part is it doesn&#x27;t have to sit on the counter filled with water.  Just attach it to your faucet and you are ready to get to work on your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Installs easily and works well.  Makes it easy to clean under the gumline.  Good price and nice that it doesn&#x27;t take up counter space</li>
    <li> I have used this unit regularly for close to 4 years, and it is still very good / strong.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had learned about this product earlier.  I had tried the portable kind and the tank kind but was always tired of washing the tanks and holder.  This is great in that you don&#x27;t have wash anything and can clean your gums for as long as you want!!!  I love it and want to buy one for every bathroom in the house.  I have been telling everyone.  What a great product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this oral irrigator.  We though, \\&quot;great stocking stuffer\\&quot;.  Disappointed that it is out of stock.</li>
    <li> So much better that the ones with a tank, and a lot cheaper.  It&#x27;s a bit tricky to get the temperature right, though. Also sometimes the thing falls off if you&#x27;re not careful how you attach it. (Loud noise when the metal hits the porcelain)</li>
    <li> Another great product from this company.  Already own the shower breeze.  Installed this in the other bathroom.  Installation was even easier than the shower breeze.  Functions great!</li>
    <li> easy install and works well once you get used to turning water on after tip is in your mouth</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator is well-engineered, well-constructed, is quiet, easy to use, inexpensive and functions beautifully. It uses top-quality materials and is guaranteed for life. It makes all those other clunky, loud, rickety, clumsy contraptions, ah, not so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an oral irrigator as part of my dental hygienics for a long time.  I use to be a Waterpik fan for many years until recently.  My first Waterpik lasted over ten years.  Fair enough for a home appliance.  So about a year ago I bought their new model; big mistake.  The cheap brittle hose snapped after a few months.  Being a technically savvy sort I was able to get the machine apart, and reattach the hose.  Then it started breaking at the handle.  That took a little more finesse and some Super Glue.  After the third time it broke off at the handle, I had my fill with a poorly made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went in search of an alternative.  Oral Breeze&#x27;s Quikpik [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickPik - Dental Oral Irrigator]] was the answer for me. It attaches directly to your faucet where you can adjust the water pressure and temperature with you faucet.  It does require you to replace your aerator, but that is not a difficult task.  Once you&#x27;ve done that, you can simply attach and detach the unit at will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I mention it&#x27;s made like gang busters and has a life time warranty.  And talk about customer service: I had a small problem with one of the tips (it comes with two), so I called Tom at the customer service number.  No problem, he sent out two new tips at no extra cost and included a little gift of Therapics to boot. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing, no electricity , no ugly thing-a-ma-tub in the bathroom taking up space.  I&#x27;m a convert, but I guess you figured that out by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: It is now February 2012.  Yes, that&#x27;s five years since my original purchase, and I&#x27;m still using my Oral Breeze and loving it.  I recently had a problem with the connector on the hose that connects to the irrigator. True to their Lifetime Warranty, the lovely and capable customer Service agent, Kelly, was quick to send me not one, but two new hoses with new connectors. Connected one up and I&#x27;m back in business. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product orthis company. Get yours today.</li>
    <li> The design of the QuickBreeze is simple and elegant, and the product is very well made.  Instead of using electricity and reservoirs that need to be filled and cleaned, the QuickBreeze takes advantage of your home water pressure to produce excellent pressure when cleaning your teeth.  It installs easily, and the QuickBreeze pops on and off the faucet easily.    I was looking at a variety of water picks when I chose this one; now I wonder why anyone thought to make the others so complicated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Water Pik for years but hated the noise and the big \\&quot;box\\&quot; sitting on the sink.  When the plastic tubing, which can not be replaced, got a hole in it I saw the Quick Breeze on the website and decided to give it a try. First of all, it&#x27;s much cheaper, takes up no space on the sink and is quiet....all pluses. I love it. It&#x27;s a great alternative. It does not pulse like the Water Pic but I think it does a good job irrigating teeth. There was a small white piece that was not in the directions when we installed it. I was having trouble with the plastic tube coming off when there was too much water pressure. I finally discovered that if you push the tube on FIRST, as far as you can, then slide the small while plastic piece over it and push it as far toward the pic as possible it holds it on even under high water pressure. Now it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Very clear instructions for easy installation.  Product simple to use.  Only needs small space for storage while not in use.    I especially like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to haul out the electric pump version anymore.  Nice and quiet and well designed.</li>
    <li> I love the adjustable water flow on this one.  Adjustment is by water tap pressure.  It saves me from problems with popcorn kernels.  We have his and hers.</li>
    <li> great simple product that works very well</li>
    <li> I bought this at least 4 years ago and am still using it twice a day.  It is much, much better than the old Waterpik thing I had.  I think the steady spray is more powerful than the pulsating stream from the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is so simple.  I screwed on the faucet attachment and then each morning and night I snap on the hose connector and easily clean my teeth.  Even after brushing, this thing finds and removes more stuff that I didn&#x27;t know was there.  I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several times during semi-annual cleanings, the hygienist has mentioned that my gums look really good; better than expected for someone my age (51).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is very easy to install and super easy to use.  It did take me a few tries to get used to the tickling effect it has, but once I got used to it, I don&#x27;t even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this QuickBreeze.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  This is our second purchase, first one was purchased over 2 years ago.  Still works great.  Great price for the product!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. Takes up a lot less counter space, and having no moving parts is a huge appeal- but. The tip isn&#x27;t as well made as the mechanical counterpart that hogs my counter space, and the water flow is just high volume and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as targeted due to the tip design. It works, but after using it for a month I went back to the other one. I also had to work my way back up to the higher pressure level as my gums weren&#x27;t getting the same level of massaging that the mechanical one provides. Does it rinse your mouth out? Yeah. As good for those of us with gingivitis? I don&#x27;t think it is unfortunately.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install.  The pressure is not as strong as the water pike but saying that, I like how my gums feel after using it.  It really does the job, I think the water pike was a little too strong. It is nice not having that big tank on my counter.</li>
    <li> Well, I have big hands and a small mouth, so I really hate to floss.  The dentist is after me all the time about it.  So, I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;ll see what my dentist has to say in six months.    I like the fact that you can easily adjust the pressure and there is no tank or motor to fool around with.  I found the QuickBreeze when I was searching for a Waterpik.  This just seems so much easier, not to mention the cost savings!    It seems very well constructed, but I did have to knock off one star for a minor annoyance.  The tubing is just pressed onto the end that goes in your mouth.  Several times I&#x27;ve had the tube pop off, resulting in an unexpected dousing.  Each time it has popped off I snip about 1/4\\&quot; off the tube to get an unstretched section of tubing.  I&#x27;ve learned to rinse my teeth before putting a shirt on, just in case.  Maybe the water pressure is too high or the water too hot, I don&#x27;t know.    Probably the thing I like most is the way it massages the gums.  My Sonicare toothbrush really makes my teeth feel clean and the QuickBreeze makes my gums feel great.  It&#x27;s a nice combination.    --Update 7/21/2011--    After posting my review I was contacted by Tom from Oral Breeze and he has offered to send me replacement tubing for my QuickBreeze.  Hopefully, that will fix the problem of the tubing coming loose.  It&#x27;s comforting to know that the folks at Oral Breeze are actually listening to what people say and that they stand behind their products.    --Update 7/25/2011--    Today I received the new tubing for my QuickBreeze.  The tubing attachment has been redesigned.  The problem has been corrected.  Rating changed to 5 stars!</li>
    <li> For years I brushed and flossed and still had cavities and problems with my teeth. Six months ago my dentist told me I needed two root canals, and special treatment to fend off the infection in my gums: gingivitis! One dentist even told me that an oral irrigator isn&#x27;t worth the investment. WRONG! I picked up the RediBreeze, and a few months later my dentist tells me, \\&quot;You&#x27;re in good dental health. No decay, and everything looks good.\\&quot; I never had the root canals or the expensive treatment to kill the gingivitis. I use the oral irrigator once a day, in the evening after brushing and flossing. (I also brush and floss in the morning.) I also started taking Olive Leaf Extract [...]. Between the oral irrigator and the olive leaf extract, my dental health is fixed! I wish somebody had told me about this sooner, and it would have prevented the bone loss around my teeth. Why aren&#x27;t dentists pushing oral irrigators on people? I can&#x27;t believe the difference. Amazing. RediBreeze Oral Irrigator dental water jetRediBreeze Oral Irrigator dental water jet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an oral irrigator of any kind so I can&#x27;t compare my experience to other products. However this product was extremely easy to set up and learn how to use right out of the box.  I don&#x27;t like to floss. I do floss, not enough and from what my Dentist tells me - not good enough. I had a difficult area next to a capped tooth that would get sore due to impacted debris that flossing would not remove and sometimes seemed to make it worse. This irrigator cleared the problem right up. It seems so simple I can&#x27;t understand why we don&#x27;t all use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having a problem with the hose slipping off in my hand and making a mess. I emailed the company and Tom responded that night (within an hour) that he would send a replacement hose if I would send my address.  Soon my wife (she purchased this for me) got a generic email from Tom saying that customers were experiencing problems with the hose slipping of and that he wanted customers to contact him for a replacement hose. I appreciate quality products and a man who stands behind his product earns him a fifth star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new hose arrived and my QuickBreeze is perfect.  I almost cant&#x27; wait for my next Dentist visit.....almost.  ;-)</li>
    <li> My QuickBreeze come with a little problem, then I contact QuickBreeze customer service by email. I am so supprised they have a great customer service! They reply me within few hours and sent me a replacement part at the same time. Everything is quick and make me feel very comfortable. By the way, their product is easy to use and good too!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this thing worked. The water jet takes some getting used to and can actually tickle the inside of my mouth at times (as weird as that is to say). I highly recommend this product for anyone with braces. Easy to install and even easier to use.</li>
    <li> Well I have had this for over two years now.  It works great and there is no base system that has to sit on the counter and get cleaned.  Just curl it up and put it in a drawer.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is very powerful and only requires a small stream of water for excellent irrigation.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Have a WaterFlosser which was over a year old and was having to be charged each time it was used. This became a nuisance. There has to be a better way! Started searching the Web Sights and found the Oral Irrigator. No batteries, varible water pressure,and dependability as long as I pay my water bill.</li>
    <li> I like the way it cleans between my teeth, then I can just brush them-works so well I do&lt;br /&gt;it couple times a day if I can.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I wanted a unit that you didn&#x27;t need to hook up to the showerhead, so this product fits the bill.  Quick hookup to the faucet and ready to go.  Compact, easy to use.  Priced right.</li>
    <li> Even though this sprays a little more than the water pik, it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. It&#x27;s easy to install and use. I really like it.</li>
    <li> its great in theory but it turns into another gadget that gets used about once every two months for me. I have the adapter on my sink in my bathroom but rarely use it, due to the fact that it just takes a few seconds more to pull the wand out of the closet. Plus I never know what to do with it when im done, due to the fact that there is still some water in the tube when you are finished. I usually juxtaposition it over one of the bathroom towel holders till it dries out, then toss it in the closet for another month. It does seem to work well when I do use it though. NOTHING will replace floss for doing a great job of cleaning your teeth. I tried this thing, I tried those little denture brush things, they are just not as easy to use and they don&#x27;t do as good of a job as floss. I use the REACH flossing thing that looks like a toothbrush and you snap a flosser to the top of it. Its always there in my toothbrush holder and if something is within arms reach, you will tend to use it more. I recommend that.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product since sliced cheese!  So easy to install and I am a golden oldie who sometimes forgets what is what.  Easy to use - and made in the USA!  The price is great and very well made.  No cons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of worthless water Pik devices I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. Batteries die, machines clog, water starts trickling, etc. etc., I put this on the faucet and Voila! It REALLY works! Thank You! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> We ordered the Oral Irrigator dental water jet  and were so pleased to see how such a simple concept could be so effective.  There is no mess on my vanity with water tubs to fill and clean and a large container taking up what litle space is on the vanity. It is also very powerful and in a matter of 2 weeks we could see new pink gum tissue plumping up.  We are so happy with this product that we have recomended it to others. We were also so happy to see that this company is also helping our veterans with employment.  Thank You !!!  We will be Oral Irrigator Dental Water Jet users for life.</li>
    <li> I got this for me, and my husband loves it too.  lol.  We both love to use it - after each meal.  It makes cleaning our teeth fun.  The hose is so easy to put onto, and take off of, the faucet. The pressure is plenty powerful.  Is stores easily, and comes with a little (stick on the wall) rack to put the picks on.  Good deal.  :)  BTW, they have excellent customer service (Janet) - so quick, kind, thoughtful, and helpful.  :D</li>
    <li> Fabulous in every way! My gums no longer bleed! Also, doesn&#x27;t leak &amp; take up valuable counter space the way traditional style does</li>
    <li> This is my first oral irrigator. I&#x27;ve owned it for almost 2 years now, having purchased it after reading less than stellar reviews of the separate appliance oral irrigators. I just came back from my third dental checkup in a row with no problems found -- unheard of for me! And my gums are healthier also. It is so simple to use that I use it faithfully. Highly recommended! Update 11/3/14: Another year, irrigator is still in good shape, and so are my teeth. Amazing! Wish I&#x27;d started using this years ago. Update 11/29/16: Still no cavities since I started using this. I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace an electic irrigator that died. It fills the bill perfectly. Also, it takes next to no counter space. It is easy to adjust the pressure by adjusting the faucet setting. I like the fact that I can adjust the temperature easily. Perhaps my only complaint is that the aerator is quite noisy, compared to other aerators I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This thing is bombproof I think!&lt;br /&gt;It hooks up easily, and the flow is controlled with the faucet handle. You can scour away skin if not careful, but it&#x27;s much better than any of those that use a little motor and container. No problems with this and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this thinking that if it didn&#x27;t work I would send it back. Well, it works, boy howdy, the pressure is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;In the very back of my mouth the dentist cut my gum next to the last tooth and food gets trapped in there all the time and it has been so very difficult to get particles out.  Well, this wonderful little device (that I was able to put on the faucet all by  myself!) does the job I was so hoping it would!  I am thrilled!  It also &amp;#34;power washes&amp;#34; under an attached bridge!&lt;br /&gt;But, beware if it gets loose it will spray you and the walls and mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;You dial up and down the pressure by how high you have the water turned on.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is very useful and we use everyday. Only one problem is tip opening is a little bite big. If can make it smaller will be better.</li>
    <li> Great product...very easy install, no tools needed. Everyone in my family will be ordering them now that they&#x27;ve seen how well they work.</li>
    <li> Product works well - could be improved with simple slide switch to turn off water at necessary intervals.  In general a good product.</li>
    <li> Simple, great design, and great to support vets. Easy to use. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using water pick faucet irrigator for 4 years now without any issues. Recently, the plastic piece where the head attaches cracked so I emailed oral breeze asking about where can I get replacement part. Within a day, I got email from them with a tracking number. All free - arrived 2 days later. Even included an extra hose +&#x27;spouts, washers, etc. I actually feel guilty that I should pay something for such incredible service!!!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  It works great.  You can control the temperature and the force of the water.  I love it.  The best part is, there is no big apparatus sitting on your sink where there is never enough room.</li>
    <li> does not fit on my sink at all</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!  If you´ve used corded irrigators before, you won´t feel ´tingling¨ gums.  I just love it´s simplicity--no electricity, , no batteries, it´s compactness, and above all, no repairs!  I don´t miss the ¨pulsation¨ of the WaterPik.  It DOES THE JOB, even with it´s medium pressure.  The inventor of this is a genius!!</li>
    <li> A great tool. Saves my tooth and time. Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Perfect Score! This oral irrigator is beautifully designed. Oral Breeze has thought of every detail. There are two main benefits you get with the product as opposed to many other similar products. First, no batteries required. It simply uses the pressure from your faucet. My one concern about this product was that the pressure would not be enough from my sink. However, the aerator adapter washer that they have you install increased the pressure by a lot. No issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, many irrigators come with its own water reservoir (like my last one). The issue is that it gets very dirty from the food particles and the standing water. I mean really nasty dirty. While I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple days now, there is not a lot that can get dirty. Any food from your mouth really can&#x27;t get into the water pick itself, nor the attached hose. The only issue I can forsee is the small amount of water inside the adapter and hose. However, I&#x27;ve been just blowing the water out as much as possible when I&#x27;m done. And since this will be used multiple times a day, I can&#x27;t see it becoming a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been some time since I&#x27;ve come across a product so elegantly designed and yet very functional. The quality of the parts, especially the adapter is very good. My new aerator does not leak apart from a couple drops over the top of it. But it&#x27;s not bothersome or even really noticeable. I just paid attention to this because some reviewers claim it leaks. Mine does not. The pick itself is easier to clean both inside and outside of my gum line. Excellent job Oral Breeze!</li>
    <li> I wish this had an \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; button or switch and a water volume control.  I know I can turn it off by the turning off the water, but then I have to re-adjust the water volume every time I need to turn it back on.  It would be so much easier if I was able to control it with one touch of a button.</li>
    <li> This is the one to buy. The RediBreeze stays permanently on your faucet and will drive you nuts. Don&#x27;t bother. This one though, comes on and off really easy. Takes some getting use to, and adjusting the water temp is really hard, but no biggy... just go with the cold, you&#x27;ll get use to it. Works well.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to install, easy to use, and its very effective in cleaning the mouth and removing food from between the teeth.  No battery or electricity is needed.  If one has the needed faucet connection, I strongly recommend this Quick Breeze oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product, I&#x27;m not a flossing fan.  Wonderful customer service too, I called because I thought I needed an adapter.  Turns out I didn&#x27;t, and they walked me through it in less than 5 min.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to install and works like a charm. My teeth look cleaner and whiter and gums feel better. It cleans particles out even after I have flossed, brushed and used a proxy brush. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Seller. A+++++. This product does what it is advertised to do, keep your teeth and gums clean. Easy Faucet Installation- No Plumber Required Faucet Adapter easily connects to faucets by replacing the existing faucet aerator with the QuickBreeze designed diverter valve adapter. The QuickBreeze adapter will fit most faucets that have a removable aerator with male or female threads. ----Fits all standard US plumbing 15/16&amp;#34;- 27x55/64&amp;#34;-27 inside/outside thread. The new aerator you receive stays on your faucet and the QuickBreeze valve snaps on and off. Easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> The Redi Breeze is poorly designed and not up to the standard of other Amozon products. Device leaks despite all my attempts to stop them (nylon thread tape, etc.). What annoys  me the most is that the maunufacture sent me two emails AFTER it had been shipped to tell me that people were having problems with the product. Because of the low cost, I tossed it instead of going through the headache of trying to get my money back. It&#x27;s basically worthless.</li>
    <li> I suffer from tonsil stones.  If you don&#x27;t know what these are google the subject.  I was looking for something to flush my tonsils without the expense and potentially injurious pressure of a Water Pik.  This device is simple, attaches to most any tap/faucet, is completely adjustable in terms of pressure, and works great in flushing the junk out of my tonsils.  I just have to use it about once a month.  The price is right and I love it and would highly recommend it.  I may get one for my son who has inherited my issues with tonsils.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted something quieter than the other water-irrigators I&#x27;ve tried. This is so easy to use, and no machinery to wear out or break. Love it!</li>
    <li> simply awesome, it works like a charm and doesnt leak, simple to install, your gums will thank you</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t get it connected.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot better than the more expensive ones with the built in pump. This way you can get a lot better pressure and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the reservoir going dry on you while your using it. Just be careful when you first use it as the pressure can get to high.&lt;br /&gt;  Update.&lt;br /&gt; Bought a second one for my son to use, who will be getting braces. The first one is 2 years old and still working fine.</li>
    <li> Pretty much the first time I used it--probably too much water pressure--the tip holder came unglued from the tubing. I really questioned its quality, but in using it broken, I find I can rotate the head for easy use on the back-side of my teeth. So I do not intend to glue it back. Also, with the holder not being glued to the tube, I am able to gauge what is too much water pressure, because the tip holder becomes hard to keep on the tubing when I have the water on too much. Unfortunately, I had to break it to gain these features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, however, I am happy with the results, but I think the design and quality make it no better than a 3-star rating overall and possibly 2-star because it is no less messy than a Water-Pik but there is the idiot hazard for those of us who occasionally forget to rotate the ballcock back to the off position when finished and therefore spray the mirror or whatever else is within 20 feet or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to how to make this a 5-star product, put a swiveling head on the tip holder and a pressure regulator, other than a ballcock valve, i.e., a real psi limiting pressure regulator with some room for adjustment. As to the idiot factor, well you cannot design that out of this particular product I am thinking. But for a truly functional product, break the glue-bond between the tubing and tip-holder to get a custom swiveling, pressure regulating model currently NOT available from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have been used it for over 1 year. I am very happy to use it. As I have an aerator wrench, I can use it at any hotels. When I went to Japan, I could connect it to most of the faucets with a metric aerator adaptor. Now my tooth brush, floss and this quick breeze are very essential for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after a reccomendation from a co-worker. It came in about two-weeks ago and I have used it everyday since. Can&#x27;t beleive how clean my teeth feel after each use. Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks and like it a lot so far.  I had been happily using old model Water Piks for years but they were hard to clean and they took up counter space. When I was searching Amazon to replace my last Water Pik I came across this. It was appealingly simple and got good reviews so for the price it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It seems to be doing the job so far.  Very good water pressure.  It is wonderfully simple.  Easy to install, if your current aerator isn&#x27;t hard to remove. Takes up very little space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  If you aren&#x27;t familiar with faucet aerators it may take some trial and error to match up the right adaptor and washer.  It doesn&#x27;t pulse like a Water Pik so I can&#x27;t really tell whether I get as much pressure with this.  And there&#x27;s no obvious way to store it between uses other than leave it coiled next to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I think this thing is great.  Judging by my experience and the reviews of other products, this is the closest you&#x27;ll get to the power of the old corded Water Pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit on 10/5/12:  I still like this a lot but it doesn&#x27;t stimulate the gums as well as the old WaterPik.  Still, I think it&#x27;s probably the next best thing and is a whole lot simpler and more reliable.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another bulky, needlessly electric, hard to clean waterpik or similar device again.  I have had this for about a year now and I use it everyday.  So simple to use and no charging or plugs needed.  I wish I knew about it sooner</li>
    <li> easy to use, works great, great price,made in USA, any one can install it. My gums are better in just a few days</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my RediBreeze model by Oral Breeze and recently purchased this QuickBreeze and installed it with the provided adapter. Although properly installed and tightened, the unit leaked profusely out the top above the O-ring. I purchased an additional adapter to install in our second home; the QuickBreeze unit also leaks out the top when hooked up to the second adapter in our second home. The unit leaks when installed in either of two locations with 2 different adapters; however the leak is much worse on the first sink with the provided adapter.  I am unsure whether the unit itself is defective or both adapters are defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted the manufacturer for help with my issues and hope to update this review with a better review following the manufacturer&#x27;s response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Oral Breeze RediBreeze model installed for two years and have used it daily without issue. I think the permanent mount RediBreeze is the best option for durability.</li>
    <li> I just received this prroduct and installation was easy and it does the job well. I now want to get the showerbreeze for my shower.</li>
    <li> really enjoy this product, helps keep my teeth clean and hardly ever have to floss now. would highly recommend using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rate this 5 stars if not for fact that manufacturer doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;needle\\&quot; spray head that would be interchangeable with the fan-spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TONSILITHS/TONSIL \\&quot;STONES\\&quot; are the main reason I bought this device.  Previously I&#x27;d tried many methods of removing them, including types of water-pic devices.  Other irrigators either didn&#x27;t have enough water/power (various syringes) or had needle-sharp spray that was painful and made my tonsils bleed even at lower pressure levels.  This one is PERFECT: I can blast my tonsils hard enough to dislodge the stones, yet the fan tip makes it gentle enough to do so with minimal discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWIVEL ATTACHMENT:  I installed this on my kitchen sink faucet which has a swivel sprayer I wanted to keep.  Was able to do so by removing the end of the sprayer and screwing the gizmo onto it.  At very high pressure, the device leaks a little, but I don&#x27;t anticipate that being a problem at the pressures I use it at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As indicated above, I prefer the needle-sharp spray of other irrigators for irrigating my teeth. The fan tip is probably better for people who have gum disease, but with healthy gums the needle-sharp spray seems to do no harm and feels like it is doing a more thorough job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d purchased the plastic version instead of the metal one because it would be lighter and easier to hang to drain/store.</li>
    <li> I really like this item.  It is very easy to assemble and use. I am recommending this product to all my friends. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this product when my dentists recommended I do more flossing to prevent cavities.  So I decided to try this product.  It said it could attach to any faucet.  It came with adapters.  I tried them all but they all leaked.  I couldn&#x27;t use any of them.  Luckily I was able to get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy a Waterpik instead.</li>
    <li> This is an exellant product. I just got mine, but I already love it. It installed in about five minutes, and that&#x27;s including time spent reading the instructions. To be honest, the instructions were slightly confusing. They talk about inner and outer threads, and I got confused about whether they were talking about the threads on the faucet or those on the aerator included with the QuickBreeze; because the aerator has both inner and outer threads to make it compatible with several types of faucets. But the instructions aren&#x27;t bad, and if you&#x27;re even a little bit handy, you really don&#x27;t need to read them at all. It&#x27;s obvious how this thing should be installed. You just unscrew the old aerator, and screw on the new one. Just make sure you remove all the old rubber washers and such along with your old aerator, as they may tend to stick to the faucet, and will prevent the new aerator from fitting properly. Once the new aerator is installed, it&#x27;s very easy to pop the hose on and off, and I did not experience any leaking at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing my QuickBreeze, I used a [[ASIN:B00000J9DU Conair WJ7BR Interplak Water Jet]]. I like the QuickBreeze much better for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;  1) the Interpak has an AC powered pump motor that is very loud. Seriously, it would wake up people sleeping in the next room. By contrast, the QuickBreeze is whisper quiet; no louder than my faucet is without it.&lt;br /&gt;  2) The Interplak&#x27;s pump had to be primed whenever I used it to get the water to start flowing through the tubing. This didn&#x27;t always work very well, and was a pain. There is no such problem with the QuickBreeze.&lt;br /&gt;  3) The Interplak would occasionally run out of water in its tank before I was done using it. So I would have to refill the tank, and sometimes re-prime the pump to get it going again. Again, there is no such problem with the QuickBreeze, because it&#x27;s connected directly to the faucet, so its water supply is unlimited.&lt;br /&gt;  4) The QuickBreeze allowes me to use much higher water pressure than did the Interplak. I find this very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one thing I did like better about the Interplak though: It had a button valve on the handle that let you stop the flow of water while it was depressed. This made it easier to put the nozzle in and out of my mouth without spraying myself or my surroundings. The QuickBreeze doesn&#x27;t have any such valve. You can of course just turn off the faucet before you put it in your mouth, but then you have to adjust the water temperature and pressure while it&#x27;s already in your mouth. I wish that the QuickBreeze had a button like the Interplak, but for all its other benefits, it is definitely worth the trade-off. For those who are interested, OralBreeze does make another similar product which does have a valve: The [[ASIN:B0028OV2S0 RediBreeze Oral Irrigator dental water jet]]. However, the RediBreeze has to be permanently installed, and does not pop on and off like the QuickBreeze does. Another trade-off, so pick what&#x27;s more important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: All the praise about this company&#x27;s awesome customer service is well deserved. After using my QuickBreeze for about a year, the screw-on fitting on the nozzle end of the hose split, and the hose popped off. I e-mailed OralBreeze about this, and the very next day they shipped me a new one, as well as a new set of tips. There was no hassle, no long process, no questions asked. They just took care of it. Service like this is a rare find!</li>
    <li> My old faithful water pic died recently, you know the one that sounds like a truck, the one you had to fill with water, the one you had to dry out after each use, the one that took up real estate on your sink area. Yeah, that one died. At first, I was disappointed until I did some research. Off to the store I went for a new one. I found several priced in the $50.00 ranges, but only for 1 person. I did a bit more research on Amazon and found this one. For the same price as one water pic, I bought two, and extra heads, to outfit the entire family. This item is the best purchase I made for oral hygiene. I have an 11 year old, and she actually uses it every day. We had no problems installing, and once installed, it snaps on and off so easily, my kids can do it with one hand. We can set the water temperature, and we can set the water pressure. Guess what? It is silent, no roaring sound. It is so effective; I am shocked how much food it releases even after flossing. It has a wide soft spray not to damage gums. I put a tiny round glass bowl in the sink area in the corner, and each night we wrap it up, and put it in the bowl.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail today and hooking it up was a 2 minute project, it couldn&#x27;t be easier.  Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Worked great for all my kids with braces. Used it for 2 plus years.  Would buy it again if I needed it. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this 5 years ago, and IMHO it&#x27;s largely responsible for my dentist wondering why my gums are so healthy. A few recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;- when I purchased QuickBreeze, RediBreeze was not available. Unless there is a reason you don&#x27;t want a large permanent attachment on your faucet, I recommend getting RediBreeze, which I bought for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;- If the QuickBreeze attachment is difficult to get on/off the faucet, then my suggestion is to apply silicone spray or vegetable oil to the inside of the attachment. If you look inside the end of the attachment, you&#x27;ll see a black rubber seal... let the attachment dry out, then spray some silicone (or use vegetable oil) on a small piece of paper towel, and apply to the rubber to lubricate it. I don&#x27;t believe WD-40 is a good idea as it&#x27;s not made for rubber and probably destroys it.&lt;br /&gt;- when I bought the product, I had a choice of a long hose or short hose. If that choice is still available, chose the short hose as you&#x27;ll be bending over the sink, and a long hose just gets in the way.</li>
    <li> Good product, great staff</li>
    <li> Probably would have liked it if it had fit my faucet. So make sure your faucet is compatible before ordering.</li>
    <li> Cheesy and expensive for what it was.  A rubber hose that didn&#x27;t fit my facet for $30 something dollars.  Scam.</li>
    <li> Purchased this when my daughter got braces.  Had to get more tips because everyone in the family likes using it.  Even the child who tries to avoid brushing.  It is like a power washer for your gums &amp; teeth.</li>
    <li> I followed all instructions and watched the videos, but it just didn&#x27;t fit my sink. I like the look of the product. It does look just like it did in the picture.</li>
    <li> The good - cheap, no irrigator well.  The bad, no pulsing like I&#x27;m used to.  I think the shower version would be a better buy IMHO and more convenient.</li>
    <li> The QuickPik was easy to install. It takes a little getting used to adjusting the water. The hose could be a bit longer, however, it is excellent overall. Not having a reservoir to keep up with makes it worth it. I would recommend the QuickPik to anyone needing an oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> Convenient, easy to use, and certainly will last many years.  The adapter screws into the faucet and the unit simply snaps in place.  It comes off for storage just as easily.</li>
    <li> This is may be no frills, but it gets the job done! No need to spend a lot on those other irrigators. This works great! It is not something you can travel with, but overall it does an exceptional job. Take just a little time tinkering to get the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the desirable water pressure, after that it is a snap...literally snaps on and off. The only down side is once the tubing separated and water was flying everywhere....but I solved that problem by holding just at that juncture and it did not occur again. I bought extra tips just in case, but the ones that come with the product are probably made to last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I use it at home otherwise when I travel I use the Panasonic battery operated irrigator. The Quick Breeze water jet is a bit different than the Panasonic which is what I used previously. The Pany has bursts or pulses of water jets where as the QB is one continuous flow of spicket water, highly concentrated though - I guess more like the water rinse you get at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Purchased it after reading so many glowing reviews on this site.  Well, I should have listened to the more skeptical minded ones. The unit attaches to the faucet easily (using the parts provided) but it is next to impossible to control the flow of the water without having water splattered all over the place.  It could probably have used an on/off switch to help better control the water flow.  Can&#x27;t say my mouth is any better off for having purchased the unit.  A toothbrush and a cup of water is probably more effective.</li>
    <li> It works just as advertised.  The quality of plastic material is only 7/10 but everything is made in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!  If your on the fence just give their customer service number a call and you will be happy the first person to answer the phone can answer any question you have from construction quality to installation to pricing, model selection.  and really all they sell is a simple device with 1 moving part but they sell it with American pride.  Noting but the best from these guys.....they even replaced a part that I broke by not following the instructions at NO COST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++ for Oral Breeze, Inc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks guys, Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> I recently recieved the quick breeze oral irrigator. What a great&lt;br /&gt;product.  I use a waterpik and have been fine with that but needed&lt;br /&gt;something to use after dinner at work. I tried the rechargable waterpik&lt;br /&gt;but it simply does not have enough pressure to do a good job. I searched&lt;br /&gt;the internet for alternatives and  came upon the quickbreeze product.&lt;br /&gt;Sounded ideal and it is. Easy to install. I leave the adaptor on the faucet at&lt;br /&gt;work and just remove the irrigator when I am finished. I have braces and&lt;br /&gt;this is a godsend. Thanks so much. I will probably start using one at home&lt;br /&gt;and give up on the waterpik.</li>
    <li> I have broken the hose on two of the other products I have purchased and so I found this on line.&lt;br /&gt;While it does not pulsate like the others, if you open the Faust enough, you get plenty of pressure and a life time guaranty.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and give one to my son.</li>
    <li> How have I lived without this Dental Oral Irrigator  for so long ... This is as important a dental tool as the toothbrush !!!&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars To the Dental Oral Irrigator  !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously reviewed this with five starts; bought this one for my granddaughter. She likes it, too. Her boyfriend uses the spare tip, and he likes it, too.</li>
    <li> I hate to argue with my son to brush his teeth~he is six now, but he loves the dental irrigator. I&#x27;ve used electronic toothbrushes that sing, special ones that vibrate, and none of them have been accepted as quickly as this tool was for tooth health! It must be because it looks cool, so my son feel blessed to use it, but either way, my point is he is USING it wo argument.&lt;br /&gt;I love it for MANY other reasons. But here are a few of my top reasons....&lt;br /&gt;First, my gums are healthier then EVER. Seems like all these years I&#x27;ve wasted money on special brushes, with special intent, yet none of them made me feel like it even worked. This lil contraption is awesome. I have the showerbreeze too. That was my first buy to see where the family would stand on placing a spraying hose in their mouths. Who knew it would be such a hit, the whole family!&lt;br /&gt;Second, its easy to use, easy to connect to your sink in general. And lastly, my favorite thing is its MADE IN THE USA. I used to think made in china meant we were getting better deal, except in the end we all lost a lot while gaining more lost jobs &amp; unemployed folks.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much for this awesome product. I feel completely satisfied with my purchase and you will too.&lt;br /&gt;If you hate the decay under your gum line that your fancy toothbrush misses, buy an oral breeze product and save yourself the arguments with your dentist!</li>
    <li> My old boxy WaterPik died (It just stopped pulling water out of the container) and I didn&#x27;t want to replace it with another machine taking up counter space.  I spent some time looking at water flossers here on Amazon and discovered the QuickBreeze.  I had never heard of this brand but read some positive reviews so decided to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly after ordering here.  I opened the box and pulled out the parts.  There is a faucet adaptor that replaces your current aerator, a diverter valve (the adaptor and diverter valve will be already attached together), various washers in case your particular faucet needs them (mine didn&#x27;t) and two handheld spray tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to install.  I was a bit confused at first about how to use the faucet normally without the diverter until I read another review here and someone commented on that review about looking at a detailed video on QuickBreeze&#x27;s website.  After watching the video it was obvious how super easy it is to remove that part of it if you want to use your faucet normally.  I recommend you watch it.  I live alone and have double sinks in my bathroom so I just keep the diverter attached to one faucet for most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer itself works great!  QuickBreeze recommends you not turn on the water pressure too hard but if you know your own gums then I say use it with as much pressure as you want.  Obviously, though if the water flossing is painful, then you should lower the pressure and use more of a fan spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t pulse obviously like some of the machine types but I don&#x27;t miss that actually.  Pulsing really was just messier in my opinion.  You do need to keep your head down while using it to contain the spray.  For those who like to look at their mouth while water flossing why don&#x27;t you just place a small mirror in the bottom of your sink?  LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the hose is long enough and flexible enough.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that as some others have stated.  The spray tip is easy to grip.  QuickBreeze includes a sticky backed tip holder that could maybe be designed a little better to accommodate not just the tips but the diverter as well for those who don&#x27;t keep it on their faucet at all times.  Maybe they just haven&#x27;t thought of that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this product.  I will update this review if I start seeing issues with leakage in the aerator, diverter or the hose.th that as some others have stated.  The spray tip is easy to grip.  QuickBreeze includes a sticky backed tip holder that could maybe be designed a little better to accommodate not just the tips but the diverter as well for those who don&#x27;t keep it on their faucet at all times.  Maybe they just haven&#x27;t thought of that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this product.  I will update this review if I start seeing issues with leakage in the aerator, diverter or the hose.</li>
    <li> We were a bit disappointed that this irrigator did not fit the faucet at our second home!  Unfortunately, my husband had gone ahead to discover this and we did not connect back up again soon enough to return the product.  We would definitely not buy this again, since the first one hasn&#x27;t worked yet!</li>
    <li> Wish they could have created a bypass so you could use the faucet AND use the dental irrigator.  Once installed, that is all you can use the QuickBreeze for unless you remove it from the faucet.  If you try to leave it on and use it to wash your hands I guarantee you&#x27;ll get water all over.    It should have a bypass so you can keep the irrigator on and also use the faucet, either one. Works well if you don&#x27;t mind taking it off all the time to wash your hands.  And it is NOT that easy to take on and off.    Another reviewer suggested RediBreeze because you can also use the faucet.  I suggest trying that instead.  Looks like it might be made by the same company.  I ordered one and will try it.  I like the concept of both QuickBreeze and RediBreeze since it is quiet at night when others are sleeping.  Hope it lasts, I see from other reviews that some say both products break soon for one reason or another.  I am discontinuing use of QuickBreeze as soon as the RediBreeze arrives.  If RediBreeze breaks then I will try to use the parts from QuickBreeze to fix it since I see that parts cost $10 for shipping, per other reviewers.    I own the WaterPik Complete Sonic Brush and Flosser and love it, but it is too noisy to use at night when others are sleeping. That is why I am determined to make this work one way or another.  The WaterPik is a better product since it is easy to adjust the strength.  But the RediBreeze and QuickBreeze are quiet with the only sound being water.</li>
    <li> We bought a couple of them 6 months ago. We have been using them everyday and really like it. I just bought the third one for our winter home.</li>
    <li> does what it says on the box!</li>
    <li> Good product however it didn&#x27;t fit with faucet. It was returned.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I even took it on vacation with me and hooked it up to the bathroom faucet in the condo unit for easy use. You need to get used to it and remember to stick it in your mouth before you turn it on or you might be washing the mirror or get sprayed in the face. As was said the tubing is a bit stiff and a little tricky to turn around in your mouth. My gums look and feel much better and it&#x27;s easy to clean out that space where I had a tooth extracted. This is a great little product that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, nor take up bathroom counter space. The company is very focused on customer satisfaction too. Great to deal with. Thanks QuickBreeze!</li>
    <li> Purchased the Quick Breeze after my hygenist recommended a water pik for periodontal disease.  It was easy to install.  I had a little trouble trying to figure out how to keep the water from spraying around the room and staying in my mouth until I practiced for a few days.  Seems to be doing the job.  The answer will come when I see my dentist in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> easy to install, no bulking appliance sitting on the sink, i can adjust the pressure from mild to killer. My teeth feel so clean and my hygienist says my gums are looking great.</li>
    <li> cheap parts and confusing to assemble</li>
    <li> Did not pay close enough attention to the details.  It&#x27;s similar to my older version (which they still make, but re-named.)  This model doesn&#x27;t have the water valve to turn on and off.  It&#x27;s designed for single handle faucets, not double (hot AND cold.)  Awkward, but not impossible to use on a double handle faucet.  They changed the name of the model I originally bought a few years ago and thought I was buying again.</li>
    <li> Working much better than any sofisticated machine! Good job Oral Breez!</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product but I could not get it to work in either of my bathrooms. Not sure why. Will keep trying may try the kitchen sink</li>
    <li> Nice product - need to allow the water to be lukewarm before - other the gums can hurt due to cold massage</li>
    <li> It was easy to hook up and works perfectly every time.  I&#x27;ve tried another one that was less money, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Pretty useful for taking out food between your teeth.  Convenient.  Not a substitute for flossing!  But it works well for what it does.</li>
    <li> For the last several years I have used a Water Pick. In my opinion a Water Pick is unsanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased a QuickBreeze after balking at the water Pick price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My faucet has recessed threads, the screw on piece with the aerator would not screw into the faucet. So I went to Home Depot and purchased an adapter for about $6.50. If the adapter had a smaller diameter this would not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is the lack of a decent aerator with the QuickBreeze, just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were two spray pieces. The green one sprays a stream. The yellow spray piece sprays a fan shaped spray - much more effective and better for the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this is a great product and I am very happy with the functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a whole house water filter. If we did not have a filter I would be spraying Cumberland Punch into my mouth. This is what the water is called here in Nashville, TN - it is disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see myself going back to a water pick, this is much easier to use, more sanitary, and just a smart product.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;On time. As advertised. Made in America and high quality. Metal connector insures not wearing out like the ones with plastic connectors that keep popping out.  U.S.quality at it&#x27;s best.  cost more? Yes. Worth it? Definitely.</li>
    <li> I have a root canal that has always had an annoying itch and swelling to it since I got it 9 years ago. In fact whenever I floss, the floss smells like rotting meat right after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was normal for everyone who had a root canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the oral breeze I no longer have swelling or pain or the rotting meat smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little messy for the kids but they love using it too.</li>
    <li> Just started using but am very happy with product. We will see what the dentist says in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to set up. Just watched the video on Youtube for instructions.</li>
    <li> This item is very good.  Once I learned how to use it without spraying myself and the mirror.  I like the idea of being able to adjust the pressure for cleaning in between the teeth. It is easier to operate than one that runs from a resivoir.  I would like to see a ball cock put in the line to shut off the water. Otherwise it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> What did I ever do without this?  I love this so much I bought a second one for our camper.  I can&#x27;t go to bed without using it, my teeth and mouth feel so clean.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this water pic for a few years and it still works great.  I bought extra heads so that each family member could have their own.  The pressure is really strong even when we just turn it on (so be ready when you turn the water on:).  I also use it as a mini pressure washer at times to clean small items. Love that the temperature and pressure are easy to adjust.  Compared to on-the-counter types, it takes up very little room and is convenient, which means it gets used more often. I gave it 4 stars because one of the heads we got doesn&#x27;t fit easily; it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s too big.  That head/tip still works, but our daughter can&#x27;t fit it on herself.  Another plus is that our kids (youngest 6) can put the irrigator on the faucet themselves to use.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and you can control the pressure and most of all it is made in the USA!!!!! and not China.  I was also impressed by the price.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, does a great job, it&#x27;s a little messy till you get use to it and it is priced right.</li>
    <li> Had one and loved it but lost the connector in a recent bath renovation, and it won&#x27;t fit on the new bathroom faucet head anyway.  Got a battery operated one, but just not strong enough, kind of bulky, etc.  So I got another Oralbreeze to put in my other bathroom, and when I renovate that bathroom, I will be sure to get a standard faucet size so that I can continue to use the Oralbreeze.  I love that I can run it for several minutes if I want to.  Great product, simple to use.</li>
    <li> This is the best Oral Breeze option because it is detachable, so you can put it in a drawer, out of sight.  The fact that it goes on a sink instead of in the shower makes it much more convenient to clean your teeth after brushing as well.</li>
    <li> Also used to use a water pik but this irrigation system is superior in every way.  The water piks produced inadequate pressure and with attempts to use the higher pressure settings, the devices repeatedly broke. The Oral Breeze device allows you to finely adjust the pressure enabling better cleaning and massage of the gums.  Water in the old water pik reservoir would get intolerably cold by the time you got to the bottom, while this system allows finely tuned water temperature.  The water pik took up too much space on the counter and took up 1/4 of a carryon bag.  I travel everywhere with my irrigation system in a sandwich bag and a small pair of pliers.  The water pik made an obnoxious noise; now I hear only running water.  I am a 66 year old physician, I have overgrown gum tissue due to needed blood pressure medicine, and I spent decades fighting periodontal disease and a lousy taste in my mouth with frequent professional cleanings, systemic antibiotics, antibiotic oral rinses, implants, and apparently ineffectual irrigation, in addition to brushing, flossing, and trying to mask the taste and smell with breath mints.  I have now been using this irrigation system (the same one) for 5-6 years with out any antibiotics and my smells and tastes clean.  It is so easy to use that I use it several times a day and get complimented on my gum health every time I see a dentist.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years….you&#x27;ve never had your gums and teeth so clean!</li>
    <li> I just received this product today and I tried it. Let me tell you this this is a great product to have because it works very well and takes no space in your bathroom. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It was simple to install and an effective form of cleaning between the teeth and making your gums feel good.  I recommend it to everyone who desires a healthy mouth!!!  Not to mention that it is American made - in my book, it does not get any better than that.</li>
    <li> The oral breeze helped turn my oral health around. My dentist was complaining about my deep pockets and telling me a would end up at an oral surgeons office. I knew from my reading and other people&#x27;s experience that pretty teeth are nice but not when they&#x27;re falling out of your mouth. I now floss with no bleeding and the dentist just tells me to keep up the good work. The oral breeze is much more powerful then a waterpik, so it takes awhile to get used to it. I keep one hand on the faucet handle to regulate the temperature.  I use this 2 or 3 times a week, but you can use it every day. If you&#x27;re having gum problems you need to try something different. I also recommend the reach flosser and Doctor&#x27;s brush-picks. A good electric toothbrush (sonic care or Oral-B) will also help. At my last appointment the dentist was telling his assistant how great my gums are and comparing my gums to his prior patient. At about a 1/3 of the price of a cleaning this product is well worth the money</li>
    <li> I researched everything out there before buying this because I got braces. I also already had a Waterpik, but it took up so much space on the counter, made a mess, and I was uneasy that I couldn&#x27;t clean the inside after it sit for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome:  even more versatile than waterpik - VERY affordable, and hangs up inside my bathroom cabinet! It takes me all of 1 minute to use.&lt;br /&gt;And - my orthodontist couldn&#x27;t believe how clean healthy everything was with my new braces at my 1-month checkup!</li>
    <li> I have used similar oral irrigators in the past, but this product seems to be superior and costs less.  Once you install the adaptor, which is super easy, plugging and unplugging of the Oral Breeze to the faucet is a breeze.  You don&#x27;t have to deal with the mess you usually have with the waterpik container, which alos takes up more space.  The QuickBreeze works wonderful and is easy to use.  I also told my dentist about it.</li>
    <li> This is the very best, of the Dental Oral Irrigators, that I have ever used. The instructions for installion are fool proof, if you need them. Looking the instruction over is quick and painless and answers any questions one might have. The fauct adapter will fit 99% of the sink faucts. If it doesn&#x27;t fit you&#x27;re doing something wrong or you need to get a name brand fauct, cause nothing you can buy will work with that fauct. Endless flow of water for and good clean rinse. Single handle faucts will also allow you to adjust water temps. as will as waterpressure. And no power required.garylr</li>
    <li> This device works wonders cleaning debris from your teeth! It is easier, faster, quieter and more powerful than &amp;#34;Water Pick&amp;#34;. It is available to use within a couple of seconds (just snap the hose onto the faucet, turn the water on low) and power wash your teeth. You will be surprised to see how effective and fast it is to remove all food particles from the spaces between your teeth. It also cleans the gum line next to your teeth. I just had my hygienist inspect my gums and clean my teeth and she said they were much better than my last visit. These results were after using the Oral Irrigator for just a few weeks. Also, with this unit, there is an unlimited water supply to enable longer cleaning if required, (There is no water container to fill/refill prior to using).   04/2015 update: I have stopped using this device. I have been using to much water pressure and have damaged my gums. I have inflamed gums and my dentist was concerned about it. I went back to flossing and using salt water mouth wash and my gums came slowly back to  health. Since it is very difficult to adjust the pressure of the faucet, over pressure can easily damage your gums and cause serious problems. Using moderate pressure would not blow the food from between my teeth. I have wide spaces between several teeth and must use a small pointy brush and floss to remove the food wedged there.</li>
    <li> I have had two different Waterpiks over the past 13 years. The firast one allowed me to control the pressure and worked great until it died after 13 years or so. The second Waterpik would be fine if I used it only to clean my teeth. I use it to clean out \\&quot;debris\\&quot; as my doctor calls it from a hole left over from oral surgery 20 years ago. This waterpik had too much pressure and would cut make the tissue bleed. I like the Oral Breeze as it allows me to control the pressure. It has done a great job and I would certainly recommend it. It was easy to set up although it did not fit on one of my bathroom&#x27;s faucets. It fits on another one, so I am pleased. The customer support (which I did not need) was excellent. I received two emails inquiring if I needed any help setting it up and it came with paper and a CD-rom with installation instructions. As I am 6&#x27;5\\&quot;, I wish the hose was longer as I really have to stoop over the sink to use it - this does keep water from going all over the place though. I have given it four stars as it didn&#x27;t fit on my initial sink and for the short hose. Great product though.</li>
    <li> I got this a few months ago and use it off and on. I went to the dentist and they had this awesome water pic type tool they used in my mouth which is why I started looking for one. I also started using this after I had a good cleaning done from the dentist so I think it is helpful to keep the built up stuff down until my next dental visit. It is easy to use, my 10 year old daughter uses it and says it tickles. Also good for my son when he had braces on and now with his glued on bottom retainer to keep it clean and food particles from getting stuck in it. Can be messy with kids using it if they don&#x27;t hold it in their mouth properly and it will spray out everywhere. I still use string floss on and off too. My sister works for a dental clinic and she doesn&#x27;t feel water pics can get in between the teeth/gum as well as regular string.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but it is not very convenient to use it. I spray all over the bathroom. With too much pressure, it can hurt the gums.</li>
    <li> I have to say that since I used the Quick Breeze, I have removed a decent amount of food particles from my teeth and gums that I couldn&#x27;t have done with just flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, over the years, I have lost a lot of bone from my teeth, leaving pockets between the teeth and gums. Flossing really can&#x27;t remove that. Only a water pick or irrigator can since they flush out stuff in between while flossing is normally a thin string that tends to just get a little bit of the  food particles but certainly not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to point out that you can&#x27;t really floss your gums. I have a few areas that are more like pockets in the gums from extracted teeth. Food accumulates there as well and you can&#x27;t really floss those areas. A water irrigator is excellent for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that I don&#x27;t have a water container on the device as it attaches very easily to the faucet. I know the water is not stale or moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this particular Irrigator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product. It actually works. My mom was skeptical. She wanted to buy the WaterPik product that took up too much space in the bathroom. Once you attach the fixture to the faucet, you then can connect the Irrigatior quickly with the quick connect adapter. I wish the QuickBreeze offered an accessory that held the device on the wall when not in use.</li>
    <li> We chose QuickBreeze because our water has calcium &amp; our experience with the type of directional valve with RediBreeze has been that it loads up with deposits and becomes difficult to turn. The QuickBreeze aerator is of better quality than our facet&#x27;s original. It connects so easily &amp; is so simple to use that we find ourselves using it daily.</li>
    <li> Used my Quickbreeze last night for the first time and love it!  I have owned a Water Pik forever but it was a hassle to take out of the cabinet and then let it dry out before putting it back in the cabinet.  Always felt like you couldn&#x27;t get all of the moisture out of it&lt;br /&gt;and wondered if inside the unit bacteria was building up.  The Quickbreeze snaps on and off very easily and you can control the temperature of the water and the flow of the water.  It is a steady stream of water rather than pulsating like a Water Pik.  I prefer the steady stream - seems milder to the gums.  Mouth felt wonderful after using!  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how easy this was to install, maybe 2 minutes and I didn&#x27;t read the instructions.  It works perfectly and with no pump to worry about, it should last a long time.  Quick disconnect allows you to remove it in seconds so you can store it out of the way and snap it back on again when you need it.  You can also unscrew the faucet adapter and take it on trips with you, taking up very little room.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have had numerous water picks, the big bulky reservoir type, the 110 volt plug ins and the terrible rechargeable types.  This is without a doubt, the best solution for oral irrigation. It is very easy to install (if somewhat mechanically inclined), is very high quality, and you can adjust both the strength of the water and the temperature.  The one caution is that it is very easy to get a lot of pressure so when you turn on the water the first time do it slowly otherwise the thing will take off like a loose garden hose and spray everything in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering buying another one, the shower model, so that I can irrigate while I shower.</li>
    <li> Good product that does a great job. I&#x27;ve previously had two of the units that attach to the shower and they did a good job. However, I recently experienced problems with the second unit causing the pipes to hammer. Giving this unit a try since it isn&#x27;t permanently attached.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> For the record I bought this item on Feb 26, delivered March 1 and am just getting it to work.  It did not work right out of the box because all of my bathroom faucets are modern and skinny.  As soon as I realized the packaged aerator adapter was not going to fit, I contacted the company via email.  Someone replied in 24 hours and had emailed an attachment to be used for sizing so that they could send the proper size adapter.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how to measure the aerator using the sheet so I found a phone number online and called.  I got Janet, who had also answered the email. She explained how to measure everything then sent another adapter. Something must have been off, because the first adapter did not work.  I then did some independent research (this was no easy task) and learned that I had pfister contempra faucests which have a faucet diameter of 3/8&amp;#34;.  I emailed Janet again, this time specifying the exact size adapter I needed. Within 2 days, I had the smaller adapter.  It fit but not perfectly.  Unlike their advice on their website, I found I needed plumbers tape and had to use tools (wrench) in order to get a good enough fit so that there was not overflow spray from the adapter. But now all is well. It works perfectly! My faucet is no longer pretty and contemporary looking but I&#x27;d rather have a pretty smile than a pretty faucet.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Waterpik too.&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that makes the Waterpik better:&lt;br /&gt;1. Glass tip, which creates a smoother, more symmetrical cone so the spray is even. The Oral Breeze uses a plastic tip that creates a splatter type of spray.&lt;br /&gt;2. The Waterpik machine pump creates a pulsating action that some might prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral Breeze is better in that it takes up no counter space, does not need an electric socket, and it is not crazy loud like the Waterpik and other machines. It is also a simple device so it will not break like the machines. (I&#x27;ve gone through two Waterpiks already.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I think this would be a perfect product if they created glass tips, instead of the currently imperfectly-molded or imperfectly-machined plastic tips currently used. As I said before, the plastic tips make a kind of splatter spray. While that covers more area, it doesn&#x27;t quite get the concentrated pressure to really get between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Had a WaterPik the died after a few years last week. Planned to order another, and somehow came across this thing. Wow. I LOVE it. So much nicer without the pulsing. I also spend more time using it because it never runs out of water. Wish I&#x27;d known about this thing years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much better than an electric one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No moving parts.&lt;br /&gt;No power required.&lt;br /&gt;No noise.&lt;br /&gt;Dead simple.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I received this item quickly and attempted hook up. I was unable to make it work in my bathroom but the kitchen faucet was easy. And I loved everything about it but... I really want it in my bathroom. I contacted customer service and they sent the adapter I needed immediately. As of this morning I am breezing in my bathroom. So far I think this thing is magic. I control the pressure and I am being very gentle. This was inexpensive, does exactly what I hoped it would, made in America and wonderful customer service. Everyone should add this to their arsenal of happy teeth products. I may start giving these as gifts. I am so pleased to have the QuickBreeze installed. Thanks so much to Oral Breeze, Inc.!! Hoping my hygienist will be as pleased as I am.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went with a product that attaches to the faucet rather than one of the standalone types that you have to keep filling. Also glad I got the quickbreeze rather than the redibreeze. Very easy to attach and disattach to faucet when needed, and out of sight and not in the way when not. I also find it easy to regulate the amount of force and water temperature, and to keep it from spraying everywhere just don&#x27;t open your mouth wide, or aim it towards the sink when not in your mouth, duh! I actually enjoy using it. The only downside is very minor - the mechanism for the tips to attach to the hose is inadequate, but a piece of tape solved it easily. They also get high marks for customer service... sent me new tips without even asking. Overall I highly recommend the quickbreeze as a supplement to regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Good idea , but does not work well. Will not fit without leaking . Way to costly for what you get.Save your money buy a real water pic .</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant after reading some of the one and two star reviews about whether or not this unit would fit my faucet.  After contacting the company directly and getting a reply I decided it would just be quicker and easier to order the product and hope it would fit than trying to figure out what all the numbers meant and how they applied to my faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the product arrived must quicker than expected.  Apparently I live close enough to a distribution center that it went right into the regular mail and still arrived a day quicker than it said to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived, I immediately had to try it out on my faucet.  I noticed that there was a small bag with some small plastic adapters in case the main metal piece didn&#x27;t fit, however I was pleased to discovered that the metal piece fits perfecly.  The only problem was I found the directions a bit confusing.  Specifically, it says &amp;#34;If your faucet has inside threads... [but] If your faucet has outside thread...&amp;#34;  I do not know what &amp;#34;inside&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34; are relative to, so I just tried installing as it came (with the smaller washer already in the metal piece) but turning the faucet on slowly I noticed it starting to leak so I replaced it with the large washer and it sealed perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one for reading the directions, but in this case it was actually easier to just figure out myself, it was really pretty simple and I had it all done in under five minutes.  (I had already removed the aerator and put it back on in trying to determine dimensions.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit works very well.  My faucet has a handle you turn clockwise or counterclockwise to get a very fine-grained control over how much water comes out, and I find that this works perfectly with the irrigator: I can start off soft and increase or decrease as needed.  The two foot cable is quite ample for irrigating my tonsils as well, and I have more control than I had with my old electric irrigator.  I feel like I need to be somewhat careful in attaching and detaching the diverter value as it is not very smooth due to my fumbly fingers, but it is quite manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is with the instructions on adjusting water temperature or using warm water is.  I have never used anything other cold water in my previous irrigator and it doesn&#x27;t seem useful to wait a couple minutes running hot for hot water to get to the tap.  Cold water isn&#x27;t that cold anyway, it&#x27;s room temperature really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight downside is that the tip doesn&#x27;t seem to lock in place.  It turns and stays snug most of the time, but I don&#x27;t see any physical catch.  At one point it did start to come off, but I found that if I held it in the right spot (so my fingers were both on the tip and the connector to provide a bit of extra friction) that it stayed in place with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly happily by how quiet the unit is, and the fact that I no longer have to worry about a motor failing or not providing adequate power.</li>
    <li> Works good and a lot easer than the one with a pump that you have to plug in or charge up.</li>
    <li> I was going through the &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; type of flossers so this seemed to be something that will last longer in that there are no moving parts to stop working. It&#x27;s pretty low tech which is good, hook up was simple and easy. Good quality and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> GREAT PURCHASE!!!!!! We have one in each of the showers in my house but I love the idea of being able to use this more frequently. My 2 boys and myself now can do it after every time we eat. PERFECT for my son&#x27;s braces too!</li>
    <li> This product is a quality work, and is a fixture that matches the quality of the other bathroom fixtures. It looks like it belongs.  It performs its purpose very well.  It is easy to install on the bathroom sink in a few minutes, and there is lots of product support on line including an installation video.</li>
    <li> Amazing and brilliant product!  Absolutely no tools required, it took me only 1 minute to put it together, and I&#x27;m not savvy when it comes to any sort of assembling.  Real easy to adjust water pressure and temperature to your liking, super clean feel after using this.</li>
    <li> BE VERY CAREFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two, entirely different, Oral Breeze products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One has a lever which can allow you to use your sink for other things, and one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get the one that does not, you&#x27;re in deep s....t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This advertisement does not explain the difference or give you a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call or email the company and find out the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked over two hours installing the contraption, and now I cannot use my sink!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and very refreshing.  This is the first of this type of item we have used.  My one negative is that I wish it had an on and off button.  You have to have it in your mouth before you turn on the water.  After you get used to that it is very nice.</li>
    <li> Item made in USA by your neighbors.  Plumbing components included with their items are high quality and should last a long time.  Easy to connect and disconnect from faucet and change tips for different users.  Was having problem with debris getting lodged in between 2 molars, even floss wouldn&#x27;t help, dentist suggested a Waterpik.  I read Waterpik reviews about the clumsiness of the item and loud noise from the pump.  So glad I went with this.  The QuickBreeze has eliminated any problems caused by food debris in the gums. Can simply adjust water flow (volume) as needed with your faucet handle. Simpler is always better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been regularly using WaterPik for years. They don&#x27;t last long, so after my fifth one, I decided to try this as an alternative. This is waaay better! Easier to store. Only minutes to install the first time and literally only one second to install or remove after that. Waaay better flow rate control so you can get exactly the amount and intensity of spray that you want. Waaay better temperature control. Looks waaay better.  I&#x27;m going to guess that it will last waaaay longer because it has zero moving parts. It is waaaay cheaper! It is easier to use - which means I will use it more often. Why didn&#x27;t I try this years ago! Go buy one now! You will be waaay happier than you were or will be with WaterPik.</li>
    <li> Does not fit 2 out of the 3 sinks and I cant find an adapter for it. They should tell you that before you buy it.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. Because I&#x27;m lazy...&lt;br /&gt;When I got braces I knew there&#x27;s no way around flossing unless I want to spend a lot of money at the dentist&#x27;s. Luckily, I heard about the existence of water flossers which are perfect for lazy ones like me. This one was the cheapest and with one of the highest reviews. So I got it and I love it! so easy to operate and my gum feel healthier. Then I got another one for my dad because I was such a huge fan :)</li>
    <li> This is impressive!  W/o the wand, can&#x27;t tell anything is different about the sink. Sink works as normal. The wand is easy to put on and off constantly and you not only have an endless water supply, you can also adjust the pressure with how much you have the faucet turned on!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wish I could get more pressure out of the nozzle, but it does pretty well for what it is.  Don&#x27;t expect the cleaning power of a powered water pik.</li>
    <li> Loved the way this pic works to hook up conveniently to faucet. My daughters both have braces and needed something to&lt;br /&gt;help keep all their teeth clean!</li>
    <li> A simple and effective tool for oral hygiene, affordable, durable, backed by life time warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every family with a standard faucet in their bathroom should get one.</li>
    <li> Awesome - mouth feels so clean afterwards and was very easy to install.  Having teenage boys with braces and getting them to properly floss has been a problem - this little bad boy to the rescue. What is great about this is that there is no water storage tank, so no concerns about bacteria in the water tank.  Also, no batteries to charge, and no devices hanging out on the sink.  My wife is a dental hygienist and was skeptical at first, but is a firm believe that this is a great product.  She did however have concerns that the flushed out mouth water does go back on top of the white tube in the sink, but that seems to be pretty minor.  Only drawback is trying to prevent two teenage boys from using the device as a squirt gun towards each other!</li>
    <li> Cleans mouth and tonsils. Definitely worth the money. Only item that gets me that clean feeling. Recommend 100%!!! Only product that you can gradually increase the water amount, I have tried water piks and they are too rough and generally only have a few settings.</li>
    <li> I cannot say anything negative about the quality of this product. It does exactly what it is intended to do and does it well. Having said that, I will elaborate on my experience. I bought the QuickBreeze to replace my old rechargeable WaterPik that had died. While the QuickBreeze does not require charging and does the job well, I must say that for me, I liked the WaterPik better. It all boils down to personal preference. The tips of the QuickBreeze are flared and tickle my gums to distraction while I use it. The WaterPik did not do that. I think both clean equally well, but the QuickBreeze does cause more mess.  The rechargeable battery runs down too quickly and did not last as long as I had hoped. So it&#x27;s a trade-out. I&#x27;m not sure at this point which one I will stick with, but I do know that both are better than regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;******************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have been using this for a while now and I am getting the hang of it better. I can use it quickly and floss in no time but it still has the potential to make a mess. I like it better, just wish it did not make a mess :)</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Works like a charm.  You can regulate the flow and temperature of the water.  Takes no counter space.  Is making it VERY EASY to use after every meal.  Best &#x27;waterpik&#x27; I have ever had (and I&#x27;ve used them continually since the 60&#x27;s).  My dentist recently recommended that I abandon flossing and use this method to get food out from in between my teeth EXCLUSIVELY.  Continue to brush and use mouthwash, of course. His belief is that my receding gums might have a chance of regenerating. Regarding installation - when you remove the aerator from your faucet...it unscrews the opposite way you would think it does. You screw in the adaptor and then the unit....NO TOOLS!  If I can do it, you can too...</li>
    <li> When I first using Quickbreeze, my was not believe in this product. She think it&#x27;s look funny and just refuse to use it. After many time of using it, she wants to try it. Guess what, now she is using everyday even my 5 years old. We all love it and it is one of the best investment that I did. You all have to try it. Little tricky to install but after that you all done and very easy to use. Thanks Quickbreeze</li>
    <li> this is the second  oral breeze water flosser i purchased, it&#x27;s for my wife and she loves it. mine is still working perfectly after many years. a well constructed,durable and easy to operate product.thank you oral breeze.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a compact snap-on/snap-off waterpik-type cleaner. This is so, so much easier than trying to set up a waterpik on the counter, plug it in, fill the water tank and adjust the stream. With the QuickBreeze, just snap it onto the faucet and you&#x27;re good to go. A little water gives a nice stream or you can turn the faucet up for a more vigorous stream. No worries about the water tank running out. If your teeth are sensitive to hot or cold, you can easily adjust the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was with installation. All the pictures and videos only show installation when the faucet threads are on the inside of the faucet. There was nothing to show how to install if the threads are on the outside. Even a call to the office didn&#x27;t help. The person was very nice and tried to help but couldn&#x27;t understand what I was trying to explain. While I was taking a picture to send to him to illustrate the problem, it occurred to me to remove the plastic adapter washer and lo! and behold! There were threads on the inside as well as the outside. 30 seconds later I had the thing installed and in use.</li>
    <li> Excellent way to fluss and keep your gums healthy. My original one broke after a month of use but the company replaced it quickly no questions asked.</li>
    <li> Looks cheap, BUT very surprised. Works great, and is not cheap. Very well built...</li>
    <li> I loved this item when I first purchased it.  After having dental surgery for a permanent bridge, I knew that a water pic would now be a must-have.  The bathroom directly off my bedroom is very small with limited shelf space.  A traditional oral irrigator with a water reservoir would have been impossible.  Hooking directly to the sink was a perfect solution.  And as one reviewer mentioned, you could miss the pulsing action of a water pic, but you get the same sensation by simply going back and forth over your teeth. I really love it.  But THEN I upgraded my faucets to newer Delta faucets with recessed-aerators.  None of the adapters supplied fit the new faucets.  The new recessed aerator is the exact same diameter and threading as the Oral breeze. Sadly, none of the supplied adapters are the same diameter and threading on both ends.  Home Depot couldn&#x27;t help.  Next stop - Lowes, I guess.  Should I find an adapter, I will update this review.  Until then, it was a good run for 7 months...&lt;br /&gt;To the makers of Oral Breeze, I don&#x27;t expect you to have every adapter in the world and I do understand that manufacturers now often outsource parts, but wherever you get your adapters from, surely they can acquire one to fit newer Delta faucets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Pops on and off of your existing faucet easily&lt;br /&gt;- Ability to adjust the power of the stream by adjusting pressure at the faucet&lt;br /&gt;- Absolutely cleans incredibly between teeth, practically eliminates flossing.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent for those with bridgework or dental implants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The hose did begin to pop off after several months if too much water pressure was used.  Another reviewer mentioned that  Oral Breeze customer service issued a new hose.  I haven&#x27;t tried to call just yet.  No reason to call when you read the next line.&lt;br /&gt;- Adapters fit my older faucets, but not compatible at all with my new Delta recessed-aerator faucets.</li>
    <li> this is so simple, yet so great!  Love the whole idea.  Would have given it 5 stars, but originally the tip would not stay on the tubing.  The company very quickly sent me a larger o-ring so it would lock in place better, but I have to wonder why it wasn&#x27;t included in the first place.  I love the ease of use &amp; the simplicity of something that snaps on &amp; off and can be tucked away in a drawer instead of a big unit that sits out gathering dust.  I guess I&#x27;d say if they work on the union between the tip &amp; hose and make it swivel like the water-pik design, they&#x27;ll have a perfect product.</li>
    <li> This has been a great investment. I originally purchased this item when my oldest son was fitted with braces. I was looking for an affordable product to assist him with cleaning under and around his brackets. It was easy to setup and easy for a 13 year old to use. I now have two children in braces and they still use it. It has never leaked or failed. We are going on nearly two years of continuous use. Also, his dentist says he has the cleanest teeth that he has ever seen in a teen with braces!</li>
    <li> ... at least! Easy on, easy off. Doesn&#x27;t take up counter space or an outlet. Got another as a gift.</li>
    <li> It does do the job but it has a habit of leaking around where the tube and the connector that connects the flosser, but nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t handle lol.</li>
    <li> As one who has never used an irrigator/WaterPik/etc before, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as effectiveness in cleaning between teeth, for which I&#x27;ve used floss and tiny brushes before.  This product is quality-made and simple to attach and detach from your faucet.  After experimenting for about a week with differing pressures and angles of application (sometimes resulting in water going around the room and/or making my gums sore), I think I have mastered the knack of effective cleaning with little effort, time and damage.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the QuickBreeze not only works great in getting between teeth and crowns and under bridges, but I believe I will make the statement that it actually can REPLACE floss!  And that&#x27;s really saying something, because the message I usually hear is that irrigators act as a good supplement, but not replacement.  Kudos to the Oral Breeze company for their invention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  I was really conflicted about which of the two very similar products for sink faucets that the company makes that I should buy.  This one has to be attached and removed (with a little snap ring) and can only be turned on or off with the faucets.  That looked like a disadvantage.  But the other one, most of which stays attached and is controlled by an on/off lever, seemed that it could suffer from lever lockup from calcium buildup.  Or possibly leakage over time.  I&#x27;m not sorry I chose the one I did.</li>
    <li> Designed well,  performs well, easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> If your adapter doesn&#x27;t work, send them an email and they will help you out with an adapter guide and a free adapter. I have Kohler faucets and they fall under the 10% that won&#x27;t match up to the shipped adapters. But their customer service was superb.&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer itself is super simple and a bit tough to regulate the exact pressure I want, and the adapter piece is a bit long for my fancy matching faucets and looks a little odd. But it works as advertised and I use it.</li>
    <li> Got this on orders from my wife and her friend (a hygienist) that I floss. After explaining to them under no circumstances would I floss I decided to give this route a try.  I ordered the product and shipping was great and everything showed up in good shape.  I did have a problem with the heads coming lose and the great customer service rep gladly shipped me out some replacements.  Although after using it for a few days I suspect it was the way I was holding it.  I was holding the colored portion at first but then switched to holding the top part of the tube where the connector is.  This has worked out much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a great product and was very easy to install.  Switching between the faucet and the flosser is very easy</li>
    <li> I purchase my Quickbreeze oral irrigator over a month ago and it is virtually impossible to install.  I migh as well have flushed the $29.95 down the toilet.  I am very deligent about oral irrigation as part of my dental hygiene, that i had to purchase a new waterpik even though I have this quickbreeze irrigator.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I have had a different version of this device for many years.  The old one started leaking and we could not see an easy way to fix it.  I wasn&#x27;t complaining though - after 30 years of buying the electric &amp;#34;piks&amp;#34;, this one seemed like it lasted much longer and had consistently good results - it just sometimes would not shut all of the way off and even though my husband disassembled it and tightened things up, the old one still leaks a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really wanted was a new one just like the old one.  I did not see it, when I ordered this one, but here it is.&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/Oral-Breeze-Inc-RB-RediBreeze/dp/B000ODVGOM/ref&#x3D;aag_m_pw_dp?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;m&#x3D;A1F5HE1WE996F2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this model requires that you pop the hose and nozzle off by the sink each time that you use it.  As a result, this one seems less practical to me.  I like the ability that the old one had of adjusting the flow using the lever; and, I liked leaving the nozzle attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;d choose this model or the one mentioned above before I&#x27;d try one of those electric devices.</li>
    <li> Works better than any corded or cordless model I have ever used. Simple and well made.</li>
    <li> I had trouble getting the pressure right and pretty much gave myself a shower every time I tried to use it. Ended up giving it to my son in law to use. I would prefer something that had a switch on the handle to help control the spray. Other than that is was a good product, fit nicely on the faucet and did not leak.</li>
    <li> Great item very easy to use and relatively easy to install.  Hopefully no more cavities.....</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.  Fast delivery, easy installation.  Nothing cluttering up my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> the water pic thing comes loose easily.the water pic thing comes loose easily. the water pic thing comes loose easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dental irrigator for only 2 weeks and I can already feel the difference in my mouth - my gums look better and when I irrigate, I can see small pieces of food left behind, even after I&#x27;ve brushed.  Excellent product, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I just ordered our second one of these.  We have used our first one for well over 3 years, 2 or more times a day, and it is simply the best. It&#x27;s easy to use, and to adjust.  I recently had oral surgery and I was able to keep using this during the healing period because I could adjust the water temperature and the water pressure . When we used the Water Pik brand, they broke in less than a year and we were continually replacing them and the price kept going up and up.  This was a great find and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> When we used a WaterPik to clean off electrodes in my lab, we always ran out of water before all the electrodes were clean. I thought we needed an upgrade to make things easier on my RAs. The QuickBreeze fits the bill wonderfully. The adapter replaces the aerator on the sink, and the QuickBreeze itself attaches with bearings that can be loosened by pulling down on the external ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it was installed, we could pop it off to fill the sink with water, then pop it right back on to use the pick - no screwing of the attachment needed! Thus, the faucet can be used as a normal faucet or as a pick within one second. Best of all, there&#x27;s nothing to plug into the wall and inject 60 Hz noise into our data, so I have no concerns about using this in our lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that this company&#x27;s customer service is *top notch*. Our faucets have perhaps the strangest sized aerators known to man. None of the included adapters fit, so Oral Breeze worked with us and sent us the ones we needed with no fuss, no muss, and first-class shipping at no extra charge. It&#x27;s customer service like this that will ensure we come back to this company for any other cleaning needs we have, and I&#x27;ll likely order one of these for home, now that I&#x27;ve seen how easily this can be removed and attached from the adapters.</li>
    <li> I am blown away by how GREAT this product is and could not wait to write a review. I can now throw my big butt water pik away. We moved into a smaller home from the 20&#x27;s, I have no bathroom counter space so my waterpik has been living in my kitchen ECK! it is a dirty machine that needs regular cleanings, just a pain. My travel water pik smells like mold if I don&#x27;t unpack it immediately and let it air out between trips, just a pain in the butt. I was ordering a new travel pik when I saw this. I though I would take a chance. After a few minutes installing the new aerator I was off and going. This is just wonderful. Takes a few times to get use to the pressure but after that it is pure LOVE. This will be next years Xmas gifts to friends...this is the gift your teeth cannot live without! I cannot say enough fantastic things about this amazing and truly wonderful Irrigator. I am editing this because I forgot to write that I have 2 implants and full veneers in my mouth. My mouth is my new car so I need to be able to easily use this, and have it preform to perfection, something the old bulky waterpik  was not doing....loving it more and more everyday! I need to invest in a second one for travel.</li>
    <li> It was relatively easy to install.  Removing the original &amp;#34;aerator&amp;#34; was the only step that took me a moment.&lt;br /&gt;You have to sort of feel your way through it and then you see how it attaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer this system over the one where you plug in a motor and have to fill a water tank.  You need to get use to&lt;br /&gt;the adjusting of the temperature and intensity but a few mis-steps and you figure it out.  I did get a bit of water up the nose.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the motor running making a lot of racket and you don&#x27;t run out of water, and you can adjust the temperature at will.&lt;br /&gt;I got lots of results using this product.</li>
    <li> the design is terrible.. the idea is great.. ended up throwing it away. it was cheaper to throw it away than return it.. especially since i threw the box away when I installed it.  the hook up just quit connecting... I do not recoommend it.</li>
    <li> This irrigator is always ready to go. I originally had a WaterPic - 2 of them actually - the first had a hose split and the second was a portable one that I never liked. QuickBreeze was simple to install and it&#x27;s always ready to go....just turn the water on - and since it is so simple to use - I find I use it a lot more. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> It was harder to install right than competing products. But they have the most amazing customer support, which straighten me out.</li>
    <li> Very good Dental Oral Irrigator</li>
    <li> This is an absolute MUST for every family.  Even with no obvious dental problems, like bridges and gaps in teeth -- which makes this product essential -- everybody benefits from using it.  After brushing and flossing, this amazing little spray finds food that is missed.  GREAT PRODUCT.  I gave my daughter one for her birthday and she is endlessly pleased.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use - either the water is too hot/cold, or there is too much/little pressure.  Very hard to get right.  Then there is just too much over spray around the sink.</li>
    <li> I really love this device.  The unit attached to my faucet easily without tools.  I have an American Standard, with a separate valve for hot and cold water.  It works extremely well.  It has more water volume than a water pik, and it cleans better.  I only turn the faucet on a little bit.  I could easily increase the pressure by 20 times if I ran both valves open.  The hose is very flexible and the nozzle is larger and easier to hold.  I love the quick set up, and the silent operation.  It seems like it is durably-made and will last longer than the water piks.  So all-in-all, this product is a winner.    The only drawback is that you can&#x27;t put mouthwash in the reservoir.  This is not a problem for me, since I don&#x27;t do that anymore and I don&#x27;t think it is efficient.  It is better to use the mouthwash straight up at the end.  The manufacturer recommends that you water floss first, then brush with an electric toothbrush and then rinse with a mouthwash.  That order makes a lot of sense.    Also, when I am done using the Quick Breeze, I pop off the connector and then I blow the water out of the hose with the plastic nozzle still in my mouth.  I don&#x27;t have water drips on the sink counter anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used a Water Pik for several years and I found it to be much more effective than flossing. When my Water Pik died, I was going to buy another, but before I did I came across an advertisement for the  Quick Breeze / Rapid Breeze Oral Irrigators. I decided to try the Quick Breeze as there are small children here and I didn&#x27;t want a permanently attached hose. I have been using the Quick Breeze unit for about a month now and I am very pleased. I like it better than the Water Pik: Setup is easier - it just snaps on the new aerator on the faucet, no power cord or battery is required, you never run out of water, temperature adjustment is easy (I have a single control faucet) and I like the \\&quot;flooding stream\\&quot; of water better than the pulsating jet of water from the Water Pik. I plan to buy more to give to other members of my family.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be that great of a solution. Its messy, and not easy to use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful device to add to my oral care.</li>
    <li> Much better for me than the electronic contraptions which have to be cleaned and clutter up the counter. The first Oral Breeze I bought lasted for eight or nine years. The hose attachment is easy to attach and remove from the faucet, and it is easy to get a strong but not too strong flow of water. Since using it my dentist has complimented me on by oral hygiene (and I don&#x27;t regularly floss).</li>
    <li> I can feel my gums tingle when I use it.  I hope that I am repairing my gums so my dentist will be proud, and I am tired of being threatened with more deep cleanings!</li>
    <li> Very cool system.  I love that you can adjust the pressure and minimal clutter in the bathroom.  Really, who needs or has room for an entire &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; setting on their shelf.  This nifty little contraption is just a hose and fitting that will coil up neatly and fit in a drawer. It&#x27;s inexpensive, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and takes up a minimal amount of room.  That a winning combination any way you look at it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those inventions that you ask yourself &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I think of that&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> What an absolutely great device this is.  Makes a standard waterpik look like a toy.  Easily attached and detached.  Blowing on the end when done and detached clears any water out of the hose, then just lay it on the counter next to the sink.  I haven&#x27;t missed a day of flossing in 36 years but it is amazing with this device how much stuff is left between the teeth that flossing misses.  Also is great for rinsing out the sink with a high power stream and is good for cleaning things when a high powered stream of water is necessary, but when doing that, there will be spatter all over the place.  But when it is in your mouth, your lips keep the stream inside your mouth so there is no splatter.  If you want really healthy gums, this is a must.</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product..Quaility is excellent  Price is awesome&lt;br /&gt;Fits right on to my sink with no problem. It also has awesome pressure&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up on this one!</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, this is a great device:  easy to install, easy to use, easy to store between uses and takes up very little space.  I&#x27;ve used an oral irrigator for the last 20 years but when my Waterpik broke a couple of months ago, I did some research and found the QuickBreeze.  I was a little hesitant to try something new but so glad that I did.  It is a little leaky as I have an older faucet that doesn&#x27;t match the standard size diameters but I don&#x27;t mind as anything that leaks just goes down the drain and doesn&#x27;t affect the pressure needed to clean your teeth and gums.  Even with a small leak, the pressure is still much stronger than anything a Waterpik produces.  By using water directly from the faucet, you can adjust the temperature to suit your needs.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> NO batteries... oh and then there&#x27;s the easy installation...oh and then there&#x27;s the quality of the product...oh and best of all?  made in the USA!! to say the least, i&#x27;m very pleased !</li>
    <li> to install and use this product.  I have been using this multiple times daily for more than a month now.  It is very easy to adjust the temperature and rate of water flow.  A time or two, I did manage to spray myself by forgetting to turn off the water before removing the nozzle from my mouth... definitely attributable to \\&quot;user error\\&quot;.  No fault of the product.  Functionally, I use this with water as close to body temp as I can and at a fairly strong flow rate.  It is a snap to move the spray from tooth to tooth and it&#x27;s efficiency can be seen quite readily as I see the remnants of my last meal flowing into the drain.  With out Oral Breeze, I would have been flossing and using between brushes (perhaps) and although I brush aftter each meal, I now precede the brushing with an electric toothbrush with an thorough irrigation.  Very easy compared to flossing!  Since oral breeze, I find almost nothing to remove by flossing or between teeth brushes.  Still, I do some manual flossing once a day just to gloat that I find nothing on the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral breeze actually has me actually looking forward to my next dental hygienist appointment!</li>
    <li> Great unit... until the removable adaptor treadings quickly broke into pieces. After a few emails explaining the situation, they finally shipped a similar fragile adaptor, while I was insisting to get a fixed one. Ultimately, I had to buy a whole new unit, with the fixed adaptor, to get a decent and functional version. Great device but a very poor attitude concerning the client satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator.  It was very easy to attached to the bathroom faucet and it works great.  It does not pulse like a waterpik but you can control the temperature and pressure by adjusting the hot and cold water. When finished, you detach the small hose connection and place the irrigation pick in the holder (provided) then you have your normal faucet back.  No water tank to clean and no appliance to store.  I have already recommended this product to several friends.</li>
    <li> It works good. I use it every night after flossing. Good American made product.</li>
    <li> This is so much easier to use than the Waterpic with a reservoir you have to keep filling. I know that I do a more complete job with this. It&#x27;s very easy to hook up to my faucet and unhook, which helps because I must first run the water with the irrigator unhooked or else it&#x27;s icy cold!</li>
    <li> I had always thought these things were a joke. Then my dentist (a guy I trust) suggested I try one. So I bought this and put it to a test: I brushed thoroughly (as always) and then flossed really well (as always). Then I irrigated with the QuickBreeze. As I was irrigating the third tooth, I saw a big chunk of food drop into the sink! Holy dental hygiene, Batman! It really does get food particles I miss, and I had genuinely thought I wasn&#x27;t missing anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that I can adjust the force of the water jet to whatever I want it to be - I don&#x27;t think any other irrigating solution gives you that. And you gotta love the price...</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who has been told to get a water pic by his dentist. He attached the connector to our sink and plugs the waterpic in when he uses it.  We have limited space in the bathroom so we have no room for another appliance. This takes up barely any space, requires no additional power and works well.</li>
    <li> Easy installation.  Need to be careful with the water pressure and temperature.  I miss the pulsating feel of a water pik, and rotating head, but this does the job.</li>
    <li> This is not all that easy to hook up and take off. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this much work.</li>
    <li> Hook-up was just too easy! You need to be careful when using this because you can cause discomfort if you have your water pressure up too high and you spray in the wrong direction. Although you can disconnect unit fairly easy I wish I had purchase the unit with the cut-off lever on it. When you forget, and you will, that the unit is still hooked-up, you will get a refreshing spray everywhere.</li>
    <li> This item is easy to use just make sure it will fit your faucet end. Other than that it is very convenient and easily storable.</li>
    <li> it was easy to install and so far works well. its a little messy at first trying to figure out how much flow you want from the faucet but once i got the hang of it i wasnt spraying water everywhere. i really like it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, and I gave this product a 5 star because what it has done for me.  My gums look heather and fell better since I started using it.  I like to use it at least twice a day.  It only takes a couple of minutes.  Flossing may be good for getting plaque out between teeth but it does not help with cleaning out the crud that builds up around the tooth at the gum line. I am a satisfied customer and I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator (fancy waterpik) really works well at getting the food particles from between your teeth.  I especially like that fact that it hooks up to your faucet so that you can control the temperature of the water and also the strength of the spray.  My dentist recommended this to me and I am very glad he did.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one.  It makes a mess and everytime I used it I had a hard time screwing it into the sink.  I used it a couple of times then I put it back in the box and eventually threw it out.. It really didn&#x27;t clean my teeth as I was expecting and my face also got a bath from the water.  Water was everywhere including all over the Bathroom mirror.  I will stick to a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love it good . very good</li>
