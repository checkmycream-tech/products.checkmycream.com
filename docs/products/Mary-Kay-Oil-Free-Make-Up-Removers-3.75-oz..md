    <li> Best eye makeup remover. Gentle on your eyes but completely removes even the toughest eyeliner or mascara. I LOVE THIS !!!</li>
    <li> I put this on a cotton ball and leave on my eye for 10 to 20 seconds.  That&#x27;s it.  When I wipe away and all of the makeup is removed.  I was so shocked because it removed some of the hard mascara that I use and have a hard time getting rid of in one or two swipes.  In my book, this is the best makeup remover around.  I will purchase this one over and over.  Plus, it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>

    <li> The best make up remover. Very gentle on my eyes and completely removes makeup.</li>
    <li> One of the make up removers came open so I lost some of the product but they seem to be willing to fix that for you. I just didn&#x27;t have time to send it back and wait for a new one because I was flying back home soon.</li>

    <li> I use plenty of Make up Remover.  Mary Kay has the best in the business.&lt;br /&gt;Love the squeeze bottlel, no waste.  Removes ALL traces of makeup!!</li>
    <li> this eye make-up remover works quite well, but the bottle can be leaky.  When the lid is on and I go to shake to mix is up (as that&#x27;s needed), it usually drips a little.</li>
    <li> I will be buying more of this item</li>
    <li> Great deal &amp; service!</li>
    <li> Great!  Best make up remover!</li>

    <li> love it!!!! best stuff on the market, hands down, I&#x27;ve been using it for decades!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a make up remover that didn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  Some of them would actually leave an oil residue in my eyes and make it difficult to read afterwards.  I have also tried the ones that are premoistened and they tended to irritate my skin after using them a few days.  This make up remover is the first one that works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave any extra oil behind.  So glad my search is over, I hope I will be able to find these in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I still love it.  When I wore contacts, it was the only eye makeup remover I could use that didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or cause irritation and it won me over.  Now that I have lasik and the contacts are no longer an issue, I still use this product because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I really love it, mary kay is awesome not only in eye make up remover, all products are very nice</li>
    <li> The only eye makeup remover that does not hurt my eyes.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
