### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The scent was wonderful and upon purchasing, I contemplated buying the matching conditioner.</li>
      <li>It smells great too!</li>
      <li>However, Burt&#x27;s Bees Avocado Butter Hair Treatment, just the best you can find.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful SLS-free shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant scent and is quite fragrant.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a great shampoo.</li>
      <li>* goes to the scent, which is pleasant.</li>
      <li>Time for a good shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo because I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and loved the scent.  </li>
      <li>Burts Bees Pomegranate and Soy Shampoo arrived in good order.</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked this good before.</li>
      <li>(Almost beats tell me \\&quot;Yes babe, your butt does look good in those jeans</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>I really love this!</li>
      <li>However it does smell nice.</li>
      <li>I have naturally fine-medium hair and this works wonderfully for me!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and can&#x27;t get volume from anything.  </li>
      <li>I will be sure to update this if I do because I do not want to ruin their reputation if this was just a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; The reason I ordered this shampoo (besides the fact that I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees) is because it claims to come in \\&quot;pack of two.\\</li>
      <li>but I immediately fell in love with this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can find so many split</li>
      <li>And for the longest time, I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was losing more hair or if it just seemed like it because my hair is a lot longer.  </li>
      <li>also love the smell.</li>
      <li>I have since use it many times, still no improvement.  </li>
      <li>I mistakenly bought this product along with its conditioner thinking that the more organic ingredients would have a healthier effect on my hair.</li>
      <li>The trick is not to use more shampoo - it&#x27;s to use more water.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of my hand soap too, but I&#x27;m not washing my hair with hand soap.  </li>
      <li>and you add water to make the most of it?</li>
      <li>I also love the smell.</li>
      <li>I have a normal hair, and it works beautifully.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is awesome stuff.</li>
      <li>I have heard a lot of people have problems with their hair becoming too greasy, but I am telling you if you find the amount that works for you your hair will not be greasy...</li>
      <li>I loved him being able to run his fingers through my hair, it was such an amazing feeling.    </li>

      <li>My hairstylist calls it &#x27;easy&#x27; hair.</li>
      <li>I was ok with this, but figured the bottle would go quick if I had to use twice the amount.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo has a strong, rich scent.</li>
      <li>I do use it in combination with the volumizing conditioner, because while the shampoo is a great product, if used by itself only it does leave a drying and frizzy affect.     </li>
      <li>Ive used this a few times and beside the wonderful cranberry/pomegranet fragrence, (which lasts for days)</li>
      <li>/&gt;-Sulfate free</li>
      <li>So I decided to only use healthy hair products, and this was by far the best product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching forever for a truly sulfate free shampoo</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s deep cleaning, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling clean and gunk-free.  </li>
      <li>My hair definatly has volume as promised and stays feeling clean even after a stress filled day at work.  </li>
      <li>As the fragrant lather began to build (I had used more shampoo than I normally would), I was entirely satisfied with my purchase and my hair felt squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It feels more oily, and when I first started using it</li>
      <li>After two months of using this product I also noticed a significant decrease in hair loss.</li>
      <li>It feels more oily, and when I first started using it</li>
      <li>When I bought this shampoo, I was really excited to use it</li>
      <li>Within 2 days I noticed a significant change in the look and feel of my hair.</li>
      <li>Although the smell was amazing and it was made from all-natural ingredients (which I enjoyed), the shampoo left a wax build-up in my hair.</li>
      <li>It rinses clean, but without stripping the hair of moisture.  </li>
      <li>Hair and scalp felt clean.</li>
      <li>my hair definatly feels clean.</li>
      <li>It took me about twice the amount of a sulfate shampoo to fully clean my hair.</li>
      <li>But when one of those people told me it made her lose a lot of hair, it spurred me to look at my own hair pool in the shower more critically.  </li>
      <li>As some reviewers have written, it is much thinner than most shampoos, and it doesn&#x27;t foam up as well.  </li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I really wanted to like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Normally, I would not spend a lot of money on a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure about, but this one didn&#x27;t have any of those ingredients in it.  </li>
      <li>I love that this stuff has mostly natural ingredients and no SLS.  </li>
      <li>I love how natural the product is.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be so much better because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>Other comments are correct that doesn&#x27;t have much of a lather, but it cleans thoroughly and rinses out easily, which is nice if you&#x27;re like me and always in a hurry in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner is a creamy consistancy, and I leave it on the lower length of my hair for a few mintues before rinsing, and afterwards, my hair feels nice and smooth.      </li>
      <li>The consitancy of the shampoo is a bit more runny than the &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoos, but if you gently massage it into your scalp, it lathers up well.  </li>
      <li>I normally love this brand (their anti-aging creams are great), but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying this shampoo again!</li>
      <li>I liked this shampoo and conditioner so much that I used it for a couple of years and recommended it to other people.</li>
      <li>Adds just enough volume in my hair, and makes styling easy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip the color from my hair, but is strong enough to wash out hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Typically, volumizing shampoo is great for fine, limp hair like mine.</li>
      <li>Easy to rinse out and usually one soaping cleans my medium length, fine hair.</li>
      <li>haha..</li>
      <li>VERY Diluted.</li>
      <li>If you have had hair like mine your whole life and never found anything that helped, this was the BIGGEST compliment he could&#x27;ve given me..</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo because my hair tends to become very oily throughout the day</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t really tell if it did anything for my hair volume,</li>
      <li>..\\&quot; haha..)</li>
      <li>My hairdresser just commented on how much waxy build-up there was in my hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have much going on</li>
      <li>it makes my hair really shiny.      </li>
      <li>I dried my hair like normal and LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>I have long, fine, straight, caucasian, wash &amp; wear hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers up nicely, but it is a different-feeling lather, not bad at all, just different from the usual SLS generated lather.</li>
      <li>It was the kind that resulted from an immensely dry scalp, more like dry skin flaking up due to lack of moisture.</li>
      <li>I double checked to make sure it was from the same Amazon order that I made.</li>
      <li>I was so used to having my shampoo be completely foamy, so this was unusual to me.good in those jeans..</li>
      <li>I was so used to having my shampoo be completely foamy, so this was unusual to me.</li>
      <li>It has a thinner consistency and doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a natural product that doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I had to use more conditioner than usual to try to moisture my hair, but this does not work well.</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY shampoos in the past and never found one that works for hair.</li>
      <li>smell of this product is fantastic and it last a long time.</li>
      <li>have lots of fine hair and this product was way too heavy for my hair.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my fine hair fluffy and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The cynic in me believes that this is to maintain the 97.2% natural claim.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel like straw, not at all soft.  </li>
      <li>week after I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees my fiance was playing with my hair and asked me what I had changed because it was so soft.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin like myself and/or contact dermatitis or allergies to soaps/detergents etc, I would not recommend purchasing this shampoo.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a natural, volumizing shampoo. It was so watery and when I massaged it into my scalp, it caused my fingers to tangle up in my hair. My hair felt dry and sticky.</li>
    <li> I am seriously allergic to their products. 4 days later and I am still suffering. I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but I will never touch Burts bees again.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I really wanted to like this shampoo. Typically, volumizing shampoo is great for fine, limp hair like mine. That was not the case with this shampoo! I used this with the conditioner as well. I found it very hard to completely wash it out of my hair, and it made styling my hair difficult. My hair *looks* clean, but it feels horrible. It definitely has a gunky, waxy build-up. I plan on trying the Yes To Tomatoes hair care products next time.</li>
    <li> I started buying this product after I was diagnosed with sub-clinical hypothyroid. Whether it was/is the hypothyroid or the stressful life I often lead- either way I started experiencing hair loss, and an overall unhealthy look and feel to my hair - which only added additional stress. So I decided to only use healthy hair products, and this was by far the best product! Within 2 days I noticed a significant change in the look and feel of my hair. It is thicker (that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do) but also shinier and stronger. After two months of using this product I also noticed a significant decrease in hair loss. It still happens, but much much less often.     I do use it in combination with the volumizing conditioner, because while the shampoo is a great product, if used by itself only it does leave a drying and frizzy affect.     I do wish it was a bit cheaper, or at least in a larger bottle though! :0(</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I was told that I had a sensitivity or an allergy to sodium lauryl sulfate.  Since then, I have noticed very similar product names such as sodium laureth sulfate, sodium myreth sulfate, and a few others that I have wondered about.  Normally, I would not spend a lot of money on a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure about, but this one didn&#x27;t have any of those ingredients in it.  I read a few reviews on the other &#x27;flavors&#x27; of this product, but when I went to the store, I bought this one on smell alone.  I WILL be buying it again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I thought that I&#x27;d give it a true test and not wash my hair for a few days.  I didn&#x27;t have much going on and I can usually skip a day if I use a regular shampoo, so the second day was fine.  The third day I pushed it working hard and going to the dump on a windy day.  By the end of the trip, my hair was disgusting!  Time for a good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Well, I noticed that the shampoo didn&#x27;t lather well, but I expected this since the SLS is what makes a shampoo bubble up.  I also noticed that it was super thin coming out of the bottle, but I couldn&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; it in my hair.  I was ok with this, but figured the bottle would go quick if I had to use twice the amount.  Then I started to notice how stripped my hair felt.  Already, in the shower I could tell the shampoo had done it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I already use a super thick hair mask instead of conditioner, so I grabbed this.  I hadn&#x27;t purchased the matching conditioner because, well, one product test at a time.  I dried my hair like normal and LOVE it!  My hair definatly has volume as promised and stays feeling clean even after a stress filled day at work.  I know that I definatly need a thick conditioner with this shampoo, but I love the fact that I won&#x27;t have blisters in my hairline from the product and my hair definatly feels clean.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few shampoos that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t fry my scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t strip the color from my hair, but is strong enough to wash out hairspray.  Other comments are correct that doesn&#x27;t have much of a lather, but it cleans thoroughly and rinses out easily, which is nice if you&#x27;re like me and always in a hurry in the mornings.  It leaves my fine hair fluffy and shiny.  I really love this!</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo, my hair is totally cleaned but also became pretty dry. I had to use more conditioner than usual to try to moisture my hair, but this does not work well. I will not recommend this shampoo to people who have damaged or dry hair as mine. Not going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Ive used this a few times and beside the wonderful cranberry/pomegranet fragrence, (which lasts for days) it makes my hair really shiny.      I have fine hair, so I only use the shampoo on my roots and the conditioner on my ends, and I have found that my hair isnt as flat as it was when I was using other shampoos.      The consitancy of the shampoo is a bit more runny than the &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoos, but if you gently massage it into your scalp, it lathers up well.  It rinses clean, but without stripping the hair of moisture.  The conditioner is a creamy consistancy, and I leave it on the lower length of my hair for a few mintues before rinsing, and afterwards, my hair feels nice and smooth.      I love that this stuff has mostly natural ingredients and no SLS.  The other ingredients I couldent identify, i simply looked up online and found what their purpose was and why it was used.  Overall, this is awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> I am an enthusiast of Burt and his bees, but this shampoo disappoints me so. I have long, fine, straight, caucasian, wash &amp; wear hair. My hairstylist calls it &#x27;easy&#x27; hair. I used this shampoo (in combination with the matching conditioner) for about a month in my rotation before giving up.  1* goes to the scent, which is pleasant. I love the smell of my hand soap too, but I&#x27;m not washing my hair with hand soap.  Where do I begin?  1. VERY Diluted. You know when you get to the end of your shampoo bottle and you add water to make the most of it? This is the same idea. It is so diluted you need to use quite a bit to get any effect. The cynic in me believes that this is to maintain the 97.2% natural claim.  2. Filmy. You can never seem to rinse it out completely, which just means more water wasted, and a film left on your hair.  3. Rat&#x27;s Nest Formation. If you have even remotely long or fine hair, you cannot lather gently enough not to create a mess of knots. There&#x27;s no way to brush it out without copious quantities of argan oil.  4. Dull, Lifeless, Flat. To even claim that this is volumizing is really baffling and kind of insulting. It is the complete opposite.  I&#x27;m saddened to leave such a negative review, but if Burt&#x27;s Bees is the organization I think it is, then they would want to know when one of their products is so far below par. Unless they drastically change the formula, I will not be using Burt&#x27;s hair products anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I liked this shampoo and conditioner so much that I used it for a couple of years and recommended it to other people. But when one of those people told me it made her lose a lot of hair, it spurred me to look at my own hair pool in the shower more critically.  And for the longest time, I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was losing more hair or if it just seemed like it because my hair is a lot longer.  But now I can no longer be in denial.  I&#x27;m losing an inordinate amount of hair with these products.  And not just in the shower, but outside it as well.  Hair just falls off my head everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess for the longest time I didn&#x27;t want it to be so because I like using a natural shampoo and conditioner, and I do like the way they make my hair look.  But it is what it is and this shampoo and conditioner are just not good for me.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel like straw, not at all soft.  I thought it would be so much better because it&#x27;s all natural. However it does smell nice. But  won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> *Please read before you order this \\&quot;pack of two.\\&quot; The reason I ordered this shampoo (besides the fact that I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees) is because it claims to come in \\&quot;pack of two.\\&quot; This makes it easier for me, and also saves me a few bucks. I must admit that I was a bit infuriated when I get a box with one shampoo. I double checked to make sure it was from the same Amazon order that I made. I also noticed that on the bottle it states $7.99 for the one shampoo, so if I SOMEHOW misread the product description I seriously got ripped off with the price. I wrote to the individuals that shipped this item, and haven&#x27;t gotten a response back. I will be sure to update this if I do because I do not want to ruin their reputation if this was just a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: If you have the same problem from this company, it&#x27;s Varney&#x27;s Bookstore, they are very helpful and notified me two days after sending me a message that they were sorry for the misunderstanding, and will be sending me another shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on the product. I have seriously, seriously damaged hair. To make matters worse I cannot get hair cuts, so I really have to rely on my shampoo/hair conditioner to give me the moisture my hair was craving. I have been using Herbal Essences Long Term Relationship Shampoo/Conditioner for Long Hair since I have been over here, and am severely disappointed in how my hair is still dry and I can find so many split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I came across the Burt&#x27;s Bees collection... what a lifesaver for me. I use to be SO insecure of my hair. I got so jealous when I looked at other girls hair that was always silky and not frizzy... I LOATHED having my fiance touch my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week after I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees my fiance was playing with my hair and asked me what I had changed because it was so soft. If you have had hair like mine your whole life and never found anything that helped, this was the BIGGEST compliment he could&#x27;ve given me.. (Almost beats tell me \\&quot;Yes babe, your butt does look good in those jeans..\\&quot; haha..) I loved him being able to run his fingers through my hair, it was such an amazing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell. It is very subtle, but just smells clean. It almost reminds me of when I go to the salon and get my hair dyed, but not nearly as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things that you may have to get use to when using this product if this is your first organic product: First, the consistency is MUCH different than any other shampoo I have ever used. It feels more oily, and when I first started using it I thought I had to use a lot to cover my hair. I have heard a lot of people have problems with their hair becoming too greasy, but I am telling you if you find the amount that works for you your hair will not be greasy... at least if you have thick, curly hair like mine. I could completely understand if people with fine and thin hair would have this problem. And second the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like all the shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. This is NOT a bad thing, as I have read that the lather is actually the reason your hair was getting dried out. I was so used to having my shampoo be completely foamy, so this was unusual to me.good in those jeans..\\&quot; haha..)

    <li> The shampoo and conditioner both smell fantastic, but are both way too heavy. I have thick, wavy hair that is normally very dry and needs a lot of moisture, but this is too much even for my hair. Hair becomes greasy within 12 hours when it used to take 3 or 4 days for me. I waited about 2 months to see if this was something that my hair would adapt to, but it didn&#x27;t. My hairdresser just commented on how much waxy build-up there was in my hair. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Although the smell was amazing and it was made from all-natural ingredients (which I enjoyed), the shampoo left a wax build-up in my hair. Unfortunately I had to stop using it and I am still searching for a shampoo that does not harm the environment and still cleans my hair.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I&#x27;m really disappointed in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of fine hair and this product was way too heavy for my hair.  It makes it limp and dull.  It also seemed to build up on my hair, which I had to get rid of by washing it in vinegar to strip the residue off.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have naturally fine-medium hair and this works wonderfully for me! Adds just enough volume in my hair, and makes styling easy. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a strong, rich scent. It says soy, but to me, it doesn&#x27;t have any soy scent though. I have a normal hair, and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful SLS-free shampoo.  As some reviewers have written, it is much thinner than most shampoos, and it doesn&#x27;t foam up as well.  The trick is not to use more shampoo - it&#x27;s to use more water.  That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re getting the heavy feeling on your hair - because you&#x27;re using too much shampoo.  I have very fine hair and can&#x27;t get volume from anything.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from drugstore items to Kevin Murphy products with no success.  This shampoo/conditioner combo the only in-shower products I&#x27;ve used on my hair for almost a year now!</li>
    <li> I have skin sensitivities which is aggravated by sodium laurel sulfate and/or any of its alternate forms. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are SLS-free and I noticed the improvement in my skin immediately after changing over to this line of products. The shampoo lathers up nicely, but it is a different-feeling lather, not bad at all, just different from the usual SLS generated lather. Easy to rinse out and usually one soaping cleans my medium length, fine hair. This was the Voluminizing shampoo and I can&#x27;t really tell if it did anything for my hair volume, but it&#x27;s still a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am another one of Burt&#x27;s Bees royal customer.  When I see the shampoo and conditioner came out, I picked up several different combination of them at the same time. (Pomegranate &amp; Soy /Grapefruit &amp; Sugar Beet /Green Tea &amp; Fennel Seed) I review the Ingredients and like it very much, but after using them first time, I already disappointed.  Not only the shampoo did not lather up, my hair got dry and tangle up.  Maybe it&#x27;s really deep cleaning the hair, but even after using the conditioner, my hair still having problem to comb.  I have since use it many times, still no improvement.  I still have many bottles I do not want to waste them, just have to use some other brands on different days.  I trusted the brand, but this just not for me.  However, Burt&#x27;s Bees Avocado Butter Hair Treatment, just the best you can find.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and loved the scent.  It is thin and doesn&#x27;t lather well but I didn&#x27;t mind that.  However, after a few weeks of using it, I felt like my hair was never clean enough.  I started washing more frequently in an attempt to give my hair a lighter feel, but it just kept getting worse.  I thought maybe the heavy feeling was due to an overdue haircut so I went to the salon and was questioned by my stylist about the waxy build-up in my hair.  I use no styling products in my hair so the only culprit could be this new shampoo.  I am now using a clarifying shampoo to revere the impact.</li>
    <li> When I bought this shampoo, I was really excited to use it and I believe I showered moments after getting home to give it a go. The scent was wonderful and upon purchasing, I contemplated buying the matching conditioner. As the fragrant lather began to build (I had used more shampoo than I normally would), I was entirely satisfied with my purchase and my hair felt squeaky clean. I did not use any conditioner and instead opted to just rinse out the shampoo and resume showering. One I got out, my scalp felt a little odd but I just combed out my hair and let it air-dry. The madness began when my head started to feel a bit itchy. I thought it was just an ordinary itch, and scratched so it would go away. The itch increased dramatically over the next two hours and I was literally scratching my head almost in tears from the reaction I was having. My scalp felt as if it was on fire and I could not sit still without scratching. The reaction lasted about three days and I was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. I have very sensitive skin but I have never had a reaction to shampoo before. There must be an ingredient in this shampoo that irritated my skin, although I am not sure which. I was disappointed but at least I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner. If you have sensitive skin like myself and/or contact dermatitis or allergies to soaps/detergents etc, I would not recommend purchasing this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I hate writing negative reviews, but felt the need to warn others about this product.  My hair feels dirtier after washing with this shampoo than before I shower! I have thick, but short hair and even after shampooing multiple times I can&#x27;t seem to get my hair clean.  I normally love this brand (their anti-aging creams are great), but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying this shampoo again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching forever for a truly sulfate free shampoo and I believe I have found the one. I have tried MANY shampoos in the past and never found one that works for hair. When I switched to this shampoo, I was not sure about trying a product that was unknown but I immediately fell in love with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is fantastic and it last a long time. Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate &amp; Soy Shampoo has made a difference in the volume of my hair. My hair has never looked this good before. I love how natural the product is. The shampoo foams a little, but it takes a little work to get it throughout the hair. It took me about twice the amount of a sulfate shampoo to fully clean my hair. My hair feels soft and shiny. It has a very pleasant scent and is quite fragrant. This can be a positive or negative, depending on if you like to wear perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The shampoo and conditioner both smell fantastic&lt;br /&gt;-Sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;-Soft &amp; Shiny hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It can make your hair heavy and dirty looking.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell can be horrible for some people.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this shampoo does WONDERS on my hair, but it may not be for everyone. It does strip your hair of ALL dirt and oils. I would definatly suggest using a conditioner and I also use a serum one my hair. I like this shampoo because my hair tends to become very oily throughout the day, I would never recommend this to someone with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!  It&#x27;s deep cleaning, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling clean and gunk-free.  It has a thinner consistency and doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a natural product that doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am African American with a kinky unrelaxed hair texture. I mistakenly bought this product along with its conditioner thinking that the more organic ingredients would have a healthier effect on my hair. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. The shampoo and conditioner left my hair very stripped, straw-like, and rough. What appalled me even more was that not only was my hair in bad shape, but my scalp itself looked damaged. Everytime I dried my hair I would notice dandruff. It was not the type of dandruff that appears when hair is dirty either. It was the kind that resulted from an immensely dry scalp, more like dry skin flaking up due to lack of moisture. After repeated usage, and no improvement, I quit using this shampoo and conditioner. It simply is not designed for tightly coiled hair, and it certaintly does not moisturize.</li>
    <li> Burts Bees Pomegranate and Soy Shampoo arrived in good order. It is definitely &amp;#34;Volumizing&amp;#34; to the point of drying the scalp a bit much. Hair and scalp felt clean. Need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery</li>
