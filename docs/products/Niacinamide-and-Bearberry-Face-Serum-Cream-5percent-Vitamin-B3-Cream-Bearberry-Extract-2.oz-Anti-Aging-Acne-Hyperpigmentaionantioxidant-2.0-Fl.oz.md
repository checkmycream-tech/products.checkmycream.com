      <li>it&#x27;s an instant and amazing rejuvenation that occurs over night.</li>
      <li>That makes it worth  liking.</li>
      <li>But worth the wait</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3 months (just about to use up my first bottle),</li>
      <li>Within 2 weeks my skin was totally clear from breakouts, and most of the time it still is, so long as I&#x27;m good and use this daily.</li>

      <li>the color of the cream is kind of yellowish , this new bottle is a white creme</li>

      <li>At least now I&#x27;m making my own C &amp; E serum for pennies a bottle while I wait for significant results.</li>
      <li>I discovered how very inexpensive niacinamide serum is to make at home (and quite easy, too, although there are several steps to follow).</li>

      <li>Seems to be helping with dark spots and fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Nice product, would recommend for people serious about skin care.  </li>

      <li>I think it helped some to lighten age spots but as far as wrinkles I saw no differance</li>
      <li>,is this one gonna work or is a completely joke .</li>
      <li>It really does brighten the skin/ clear dark marks.</li>
      <li>So far, I can say, that it has &amp;#34;helped&amp;#34; to lighten some of my recent hyper-pigmentation .</li>
      <li>complete different , so my question is , what&#x27;s up with that? ,</li>
      <li>After 4 weeks I have noticed a marked improvement on several spots that I have had for decades and will keep using</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this face serum. My skin is great because of it. I most likely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel very soft, I plan on buying more...Applies easily and is not greasy</li>
    <li> It smelled rancid after only a couple of weeks. I liked the other brand I used, but couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product three times because I love  the results, ever since the very first application. it&#x27;s an instant and amazing rejuvenation that occurs over night. My acne under my chin has been under control as long as I use it daily. My fine lines have disappeared and age spots have almost faded. this product is amazing, balancing your natural skin oils and adding plumpness to your skin. I have received many complements and it&#x27;s great for every season specially under your moisturizer. I look ten years younger, because of this product.</li>
    <li> Loved the first three bottles, then noticed a beer-like fermented smell on the 4th and 5th. No freshness date on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m stating to use it, to early to tell.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second bottle. I&#x27;ve had good results as far as improved skin tone and firmness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using all three of the products suggested for best results, for almost 6 weeks. I have not seen a visible change.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is my third bottle, I love the texture of it and this is perfect for my combination sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3 months (just about to use up my first bottle), once a day under my moisturizer. I was a little dubious at first about this niacinamide&#x27;s acne fighting abilities, but it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my skin. Within 2 weeks my skin was totally clear from breakouts, and most of the time it still is, so long as I&#x27;m good and use this daily. I do still get hormonal breakouts monthly, but they&#x27;re not nearly as bad as they used to be, and they go away a lot quicker. Honestly I find it much more hydrating than hyaluronic acid serums It really does brighten the skin/ clear dark marks. I haven&#x27;t found it to break me out or cause rashes . I seen an immediate improvement in my skin just after one use! I put it on morning and night, and no more dry patches for me! I don&#x27;t know how good it will be for winter weather though. So far, I can say, that it has &amp;#34;helped&amp;#34; to lighten some of my recent hyper-pigmentation . Note that the spots haven&#x27;t disappeared completely, but it did a pretty good of fading them. My fine lines are diminishing my pores are smaller and my skin has a glow to it that I have not seen in years. I will definitely buy this over and over again! Dr Oz is right!  Niacinamide is something I will continue to use in my skin routine from now on.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping with dark spots and fine lines.  Just bought my second bottle.  Goes on smoothly and don &#x27;t need a lot to cover face and neck.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2.5 weeks now.  I have some age spots, freckles, and slight acne scarring, which are now showing some signs of lightening after once daily use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love! Love this lotion and would definitely, definitely recommend it. My skin is a mix between oily and dry, and I do have blemishes. This lotion works wonders on making my skin soft and even more clear than it has been. My skin is brighter and has a nice glow to it. Helps control oil, shine and acne, minimizes pores, manages redness and balances skin. Really great product. I apply it under my makeup in the morning or just by itself on my face after I take my makeup off at night. It is lightweight not greasy and absorbs very quickly. Even lasts a long time with twice a day use.</li>
    <li> After 4 weeks I have noticed a marked improvement on several spots that I have had for decades and will keep using</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way. Starting to notice pores getting smaller. Haven&#x27;t used for too long.</li>
    <li> Feels good on sensitive skin.  Hoping it makes my skin more sun resistant.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very good, for those who are ageing. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Product works good. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> In a word or perhaps several words  after 3 to 4 weeks of using this product people tell me I look different. So I asked different bad or different good. It was the latter. I can only attribute that the product has rejuvenated my skin. I have even had comments that I look younger. I had my doubts about such products but it really works. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> No odor which is good.  A little goes a long way.  Have not been using&lt;br /&gt;long enough to see great changes but it has had an effect on the lines&lt;br /&gt;above my lips.  That makes it worth  liking.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 4 months and am happy with the results.  Maybe I will up my rating after 6 months.</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels on my face.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any of my dark spots being removed by this product, but it does moisturize my face well and helps keep breakouts at bay.</li>
    <li> Meets Expectations.  Excellent Product. Use this on my face everyday. My face has not looked better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m through with my second bottle and will buy a third.  There is a definite difference.</li>
    <li> I think it helped some to lighten age spots but as far as wrinkles I saw no differance</li>
    <li> AS LONG AS YOU US IT CONSISTANTLY IT DOES HELP YOUR FACE AND NECK LOOK YOUNGER.  SO DO NOT STOP USING IT EVEN ON A BAD DAY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for a few months.  I love the way it feels after applying. Not sticky, but smooth.</li>
    <li> went through 2 bottles and no result. wouldn&#x27;t reccomend</li>
    <li> i recieved it..happy with that for sure but after i try it for at least 3 months i can put my feedback on it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 months.  It took awhile to start&lt;br /&gt;seeing a difference.  But worth the wait....it&#x27;s working!  Work it into the skin&lt;br /&gt;and don&#x27;t expect to see any difference for at least 4 months....but one day&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll wake up and.... presto.  Also, bearberry is the ingredient that fades the&lt;br /&gt;dark spots...but it has to be diluted....so this takes the guess work out of&lt;br /&gt;what to what ratio.  But maybe too diluted...I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d reordered several bottles of this over the past 6 months, but I&#x27;ve since discontinued it&#x27;s use. I discovered how very inexpensive niacinamide serum is to make at home (and quite easy, too, although there are several steps to follow). I later found that my skin often has a reaction to niacinamide, causing red rashes to appear and stick around for days/weeks. I&#x27;ve since switched over to a DIY C and E serum instead. I&#x27;m not sure I ever saw any results with this (Niacinamide &amp; Bearberry Face Serum), but I am seeing improved texture results with the DIY C &amp; E serum. Both niacinamide and C serums can take months to show major results as they both promote collagen formation, which happens very slowly. This product wasn&#x27;t bad, but I got tired of waiting for results, shelling out money month after month, hence the reason for learning to make my own serums. At least now I&#x27;m making my own C &amp; E serum for pennies a bottle while I wait for significant results.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for about 1 month and I do feel that it works.  My skin is tighter and my old scars are slowly fading.  My skin is also smoother.  I believe this serum has helped with my hormonal skin as well.  It takes time to get results but nothing works overnight.  Be patient and you will see the difference.  I use it under my day/night moisturizer.  The reason why I know it works is that my skin is nice and rosy when I apply sunscreen in the mornings.  If I am not lazy and take the extra step to apply a CC cream, my skin looks even more polished.</li>
    <li> I honestly have seen no change, pretty disappointed</li>
    <li> This serum works, but very slowly.  There is a definite lightening of dark spots although it took months to see any results.  I decided to give it time to see if there will be any further progress so ordered my second bottle recently.</li>
    <li> This feels really good on my skin.  I use it as a serum before moisturizing.  I&#x27;m hoping, over time, to see a difference in my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great product! Mix with a potent 20% vitamin c serum and apply under your moisturizer- you won&#x27;t believe the difference</li>
    <li> I feel it has helped with fine lines and wrinkles, I don&#x27;t expect them all to go away at my age.</li>
    <li> Gives my skin a smooth and silky appearance.  I will most likely order again.  Order was promptly filled.  Thank you..</li>
    <li> Nice product, would recommend for people serious about skin care.  I&#x27;m an Esti, and pretty fussy about goes on the old canvas.  If you have very lined skin, it will soften them, not eradicate them.  You will look refreshed.</li>
    <li> My skin is awesome, I use it for fine lines and uneven tone.  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and I love it. Don&#x27;t expect instant results, but this absorbs quickly and has removed age and sun spots from my skin, plus many of the fine lines. My face looks plumper...I&#x27;ve found the face product that I will use for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This was ordered after watching a Dr. Oz episode.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any reslults.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 6 month or so , and I order the second bottle and I&#x27;m a little concern because the first bottle the color of the cream is kind of yellowish , this new bottle is a white creme complete different , so my question is , what&#x27;s up with that? , are they making the same product or they saving money  not putting the same ingredients ,so I&#x27;m very concern I strongly wish that somebody answer to me ,about this situation , because I love the first bottle I used and I see results ,is this one gonna work or is a completely joke .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a good 4 weeks now.  There is absolutely no difference.  Age spots still there, pores didn&#x27;t shrink, skin still looks same.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels firmer and some dark spots are getting lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I 100% honestly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Good!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Dr Oz show. It&#x27;s supposed to plump the skin. I use it day and night. It has been about two weeks. I am an African American medium tone. I am 49, I have a few sun spots on my check, a few fine lines around eyes .. No aging wrinkles yet. After the product , My skin feels so soft . Now I&#x27;m told that I am glowing. I use this product with vitamin c - liquid, Clinique moisturizer ,daily dose of  biosil -- liquid, and miracle eye cream .</li>
    <li> After completing the bottle, I saw no noticeably difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Vitamin B3 and Bearberry is good. I&#x27;m sampling several brands, using each for one week. This is not as effective as the Argireline Serum Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
    <li> my face feels great after using this.  i will probably buy it again</li>
    <li> Not worked on me and won&#x27;t buy it again nor recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks now and can see brown spots lightening  So Yeah!!</li>
    <li> I have seen no change and my face broke out.</li>
