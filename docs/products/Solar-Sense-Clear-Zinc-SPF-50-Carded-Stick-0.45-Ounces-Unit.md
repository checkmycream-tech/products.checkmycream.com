      <li>Get sun blisters on lip, this has been effective so far.  </li>
      <li>It is super for applying to faces.  </li>
      <li>Clear Zinc products are great for our family with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>OK for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>You can sunscreen your kids face right up to their eyes.</li>
      <li>The stick is long-lasting as well, coverage is easy to apply, and it really is clear in its application.  </li>
      <li>Not only do I love it</li>
      <li>The zinc is white, but I can blend it in so it&#x27;s not hideous :-).</li>
      <li>You can rub it in pretty well too the point that I shouldn&#x27;t even bring it up...</li>
      <li>We have used this sunstick before and it works much better than the namebrand sunsticks we purchased locally.  </li>
      <li>To my surprise, my lips, which were always cracked and open, are for the most part healed, unless I get too stressed.</li>
      <li>Too many times I&#x27;ve been caught outside - no one I&#x27;m with has sunblock and sure enough, the next day my nose is bright red.     </li>
      <li>My son has fair skin and red hair, so we have to constantly use sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I pretty much ordered them to ensure that regardless of what bag I grab (swim bag, one of my backpacks, work bag, etc.)</li>
      <li>Large tube lasts quite awhile.</li>
      <li>so I went searching for a product that really protects my lips.  </li>
      <li>there&#x27;s definitely a light white residue when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>It is very waterproof.</li>
      <li>Works very well and does not irritate.  </li>
      <li>An authority I respect suggested that zinc is the only true skin protection against harmful UV rays.</li>
      <li>It says clear and to be honest, when you first put it on it is a little white</li>
      <li>but my kids don&#x27;t mind it which is a huge improvement over every other sun block I have tried on them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to the sun and this product works well around the eyes and ears.  </li>
      <li>Clear Zinc is right, this is not the white, reflective cream product we all think of when we hear ZINC BLOCK.</li>
      <li>I live in a subtropical climate &amp; getting caught unexpectedly in the summer sun can be problematic for my skin, so I keep this in my purse.</li>
      <li>This is one of the few products that goes on fairly easy and has staying power through sports and summer camp.</li>
      <li>Propylparaben is clearly labelled in the inactive ingredients.</li>
      <li>While it says it&#x27;s clear zinc</li>
      <li>Clear.  </li>
      <li>It does say that its clear</li>
      <li>I also use this convenient stick to re-apply sunscreen on my nose, ears, face and wrists throughout the day to ensure complete protection.  </li>
      <li>Then I apply the clear zinc and within the week, they are soft and the cracks are healed.  </li>
      <li>It takes a lot of rubbing to get the white haze to go away, but it does work in intense sunshine and swimming activities.</li>
      <li>This is the 3rd summer of using it and have not found another product equal to it in how easy it is to apply, how long it lasts and how well it works.</li>
      <li>Understand, it&#x27;s a smaller sized stick (not an 8 oz bottle of liquid one may be accustomed to using), so be realistic in expectations.</li>
      <li>I lost half the contents of my first tube (and had quite a mess to clean up).</li>
      <li>I bought this for my family who keep getting new tattoos and are outside a lot.</li>
      <li>My kids put this on themselves every morning, and it&#x27;s the only one they don&#x27;t complain about because it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t&#x27; make their faces look chalk</li>
      <li>only problem with this product so far is the container it comes in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for a natural zinc sunscreen that I can use daily on my face.</li>
      <li>The only sunscreen I trust for my face, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I keep it near the door and use it religiously before I step out.</li>
      <li>The container looks the same, but they must have changed something since it used to go on clear and now it goes on very white.</li>
      <li>My hands look younthful and even-toned thanks to this little gem.</li>

<li> On the down side I think that it clogs my pores and is causing blockages in my skin.</li>
<li> I use traditional absorbed sunscreen like Water Babies or Neutrogena to create a base and re-apply a couple times a day.  </li>

<li> This stick can be stored in a pocket or purse without mess.</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re an active person and tend to find yourself outside (whether planned or on the random)</li>
<li> The small size allows me to carry it in my pocket along with snacks and SPF lip protection.</li>
<li> Overall, I&#x27;m afraid that it is too waxy for everyday use on my face and arms.  </li>
<li> I had a hard time finding anything  specifically for the face in the Zinc liine of products.</li>
<li> Was disappointed it was not 100% clear zinc</li>
<li> I casually tossed it into my carry on bag and it opened up during travel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My kids don&#x27;t like cream sunscreen on their faces so I was looking for a stick sunscreen and this is a great product. It is zinc based which is recommended in terms of sun protection. It says clear and to be honest, when you first put it on it is a little white but if you rub it just a little after it goes on, it does rub in to be clear.</li>
    <li> Not only do I love it but my kids don&#x27;t mind it which is a huge improvement over every other sun block I have tried on them. This is the 3rd summer of using it and have not found another product equal to it in how easy it is to apply, how long it lasts and how well it works.</li>
    <li> If you end up in the sun without your sunblock, or you need even more protection, this is great for noses, ears, and hands.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re an active person and tend to find yourself outside (whether planned or on the random) these are you for. I pretty much ordered them to ensure that regardless of what bag I grab (swim bag, one of my backpacks, work bag, etc.) that I have some sunblock that&#x27;ll save my face (namely my nose) from getting burned. Too many times I&#x27;ve been caught outside - no one I&#x27;m with has sunblock and sure enough, the next day my nose is bright red.     While it says it&#x27;s clear zinc there&#x27;s definitely a light white residue when it&#x27;s applied. You can rub it in pretty well too the point that I shouldn&#x27;t even bring it up...Anyway, the stuff is great and provides robust protection. I&#x27;ve used it for long swim workouts and during a few triathlon races. It&#x27;ll last for hours regardless of the activity and you don&#x27;t need to worry about reapplication.</li>
    <li> I use this mostly for my lips and surrounding lip area.  Works very well and does not irritate.  Clear.  Lasts long enough but I reapply quite often if in bright sun.  Will work even inside the lips to alleviate sunburn.  Large tube lasts quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it claimed to be \\&quot;paraben and oxybenzone free\\&quot;...this is not the case. Propylparaben is clearly labelled in the inactive ingredients. Very irritated by the false advertising.</li>
    <li> so easy to apply while kayaking or hiking and compact, and does not spill</li>
    <li> Clear Zinc products are great for our family with sensitive skin.  They are non-irritating and block well.  We are sailors &amp; swimmers which puts any sunblock to the test for running/streaking.  These hold up well &amp; don&#x27;t run into the kids eyes.  Great for hair parts as well..</li>
    <li> Need to carry with it!</li>
    <li> I use this product for my split lips.  Nothing has healed my lips over the last 15 years until I thought about trying this product with no expectations.  To my surprise, my lips, which were always cracked and open, are for the most part healed, unless I get too stressed. Then I apply the clear zinc and within the week, they are soft and the cracks are healed.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> So easy to glide this stick over the backs of my hands. I keep it near the door and use it religiously before I step out. It&#x27;s non-greasy and has no offensive scent. My hands look younthful and even-toned thanks to this little gem. Very nice product. Costs $2.99 at drug stores. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> my son&#x27;s face gets burned every time he uses this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to the sun and this product works well around the eyes and ears.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my family who keep getting new tattoos and are outside a lot. They use it on each tattoo and the skin around them is untanned and not sunburned, so it must work on the tattoo as well.</li>
    <li> I recommend these sticks to everyone I know. You can sunscreen your kids face right up to their eyes. Doesn&#x27;t sting or run into eyes. It is very waterproof. No real scent either.</li>
    <li> So far so good, going to  Caribbean  will know for sure then.  Get sun blisters on lip, this has been effective so far.  Was disappointed it was not 100% clear zinc but as I said it&#x27;s working,</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly, feels good on, but it is not clear.  Not white-white, but does leave white on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product in our household. My son has fair skin and red hair, so we have to constantly use sunscreen. This is one of the few products that goes on fairly easy and has staying power through sports and summer camp.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  My kids have never burned, even after a long day at the waterpark, with this on.</li>
    <li> Used this sun block on a recent trip to SE Asia and had no sunburn at all. I&#x27;ll definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> limited what I can use on face, due to break outs of acne. Does not stay on well sweat has my eyewear sliding down nose and getting on glasses causing smears and smudges to eyewear can&#x27;t see without cleaning glasses every 5 minutes on the job. i don&#x27;t expect to find anything better as I have used them all.</li>
    <li> The zinc is invisible once it is on/in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly odorless and I haven&#x27;t noticed any clothing stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giant chap stick form factor is perfect for rolling touch ups to nose and neck while riding a bicycle.</li>
    <li> I have used this for daily use as well as on big, sunny days at the beach or lake.  The stick is convenient to keep in the car, purse, and beach bag.  It is super for applying to faces.  My son as a little one didn&#x27;t mind my applying the stick since there is no spraying (or overspray) nor fragrance involved.  It is quite effective with keeping our sensitive faces from burning.  The stick is long-lasting as well, coverage is easy to apply, and it really is clear in its application.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> We have been buying this sunblock for a few years and just got a new batch.  My kids put it on and look like white ghosts.  The container looks the same, but they must have changed something since it used to go on clear and now it goes on very white.</li>
    <li> I live in a subtropical climate &amp; getting caught unexpectedly in the summer sun can be problematic for my skin, so I keep this in my purse. An authority I respect suggested that zinc is the only true skin protection against harmful UV rays. The zinc is white, but I can blend it in so it&#x27;s not hideous :-). I will repurchase this product when my supply is depleted. Understand, it&#x27;s a smaller sized stick (not an 8 oz bottle of liquid one may be accustomed to using), so be realistic in expectations. It works great! It&#x27;s portable &amp; I find no problem blending it into my skin.</li>
    <li> It takes a lot of rubbing to get the white haze to go away, but it does work in intense sunshine and swimming activities. The areas I couldnt reach on my back were scarlet red after about four hours and the treated areas looked as though I&#x27;d not been in the sun at all until the following day, I had the slightest hint of a tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this product so far is the container it comes in. I casually tossed it into my carry on bag and it opened up during travel. I lost half the contents of my first tube (and had quite a mess to clean up). I reccomend keeping the tube inside a solid case container or at least a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I like that it does not smell and that it blocks the sun, prevents burns and does not contain oxybenzone. On the down side I think that it clogs my pores and is causing blockages in my skin. Overall, I&#x27;m afraid that it is too waxy for everyday use on my face and arms.  I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for a natural zinc sunscreen that I can use daily on my face.</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen I trust for my face, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding anything  specifically for the face in the Zinc liine of products. You found this, and I love it!</li>
    <li> My kids put this on themselves every morning, and it&#x27;s the only one they don&#x27;t complain about because it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t&#x27; make their faces look chalk white.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> can say i love the idea of having the stick with me and its does not get all over , it protect great and sure may show alittle sheen on youir face when u put it on but is prefectly ok to go out :) love it</li>
    <li> When in very bright environments such as summer hiking and mountaineering, there is no one size fits all solution to sun protection.  I use traditional absorbed sunscreen like Water Babies or Neutrogena to create a base and re-apply a couple times a day.  I also use this convenient stick to re-apply sunscreen on my nose, ears, face and wrists throughout the day to ensure complete protection.  The small size allows me to carry it in my pocket along with snacks and SPF lip protection.</li>
    <li> A great way to apply sun screen for the traveler. This stick can be stored in a pocket or purse without mess. It is easy to apply and it does a good job. Clear Zinc is right, this is not the white, reflective cream product we all think of when we hear ZINC BLOCK. Very nice to wear alone or even under makeup.</li>
    <li> my kids all keep these in their backpacks and I keep one in my purse. good value, doesn&#x27;t stink, even works on lips.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great in the water and out.  Truly clear once you rub it in a little.  OK for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> We have used this sunstick before and it works much better than the namebrand sunsticks we purchased locally.  We can stay out all day and not get sunburned.</li>
    <li> I always have problems with getting fever blisters/cold sore after being out in the sun so I went searching for a product that really protects my lips.  I am happy to report after being out in the sun for 10 hours yesterday, my lips survived!  It does say that its clear but you will actually have a faint white tint on your lips at the end of the day.  Make sure to reapply every hour or after you have eaten or drank anything.  I will continue to use this product and recommend it to friends!</li>
