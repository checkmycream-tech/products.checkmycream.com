      <li>Compared to petroleum based pomades, the hold is not as stiff, but it washes out easily which is a nice trade-off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great smell, easily applied to hair, I have thick wavy Latino hair and this stuff holds nicely! Easily washes out in the shower. This is my go-to water-based/heavy hold pomade.</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade for my hair. I am the owner of a very thick and wavy head of latino hair, and I have tried the many brands for the past 10+ years (like Suavecito, Suavecito extra hold, Murray&#x27;s, Crew, Brylcreem, etc). Shiner Gold&#x27;s holds up. Keeps my hair straight and slicked back the entire day (unless it&#x27;s summer, then I will loose the hold to the heat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s not petroleum based so it washes out easily every night. Love this product. The best!</li>
    <li> Goes in nice and smooth. Easy to style, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, dries to a nice firm hold.</li>
    <li> If you want a pomade with a strong hold, this is it.  I prefer the ones with high shine and and natural hold.  The shine is not as high as I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent pomade. Works great for holding up a pomp all night.</li>
    <li> My barber got me started on shinier gold now I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
    <li> use this pomade all the time and its great for styling. I have course thick hair so when I blow dry, it makes it easier to style with a quarter size amount. its good for long and short hair so I would recommend getting if you are looking for something good. If you are trying to hold your hair up though, if it is a lot of hair and it is to humid outside it could tend to drop since its not an ultra hold or anything.</li>
    <li> Nice pi&amp;ntilde;a colada / coconut scent. Smells good in hair and hands. Scoops out nice and thick and is easy to work with. Holds well with a natural shine. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> This pomade was pretty good because I needed something that would last throughout the day and it did. But when I first opened it the smell was strong but I tried it again and it did not smell as strong. Now I like the smell. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Great hold, smell, and price. Washes right off in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade, one of my favorite and was excited to receive it today but assuming it may be the heat but I opened it to sadly see half of the can was melted, I barley have any product in the can, also I thought it came with a free comb as we&#x27;ll I didn&#x27;t get. Needless to say I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best water soluble pomade on the market. I use this as an undercoat and top it off with Shiner Gold Psycho hold, to keep my hair a little extra stiff, and hold it in place.</li>
    <li> Great hold, great feel, great product!</li>
    <li> This one has so many chemicals in it, plus, Methylparaben, which is poison</li>
    <li> Strong hold pomade. One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> its good for the price but its better stuff after, little more for youre money , but i guess i buy this again ?</li>
    <li> Works great. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to my other (more expensive) favorite pomade. Sort of smells like surf wax but loses the smell when it dries.</li>
    <li> I have been using shiner gold for more than a year, and I love it. It does well at holding my hair all day. I style a greaser Pompadour when it drys it leaves a matte finish, It&#x27;s not really shiny. The product being water based is easy to wash out of your hair and off your hands. The only one real draw back would be if your head sweats quite a bit it does start to loose its hold. Being that I live in hot Arizona this happens offten. But the way I counter is to add a bit of gel to my hair and my hair stays in place all Summer.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best pomade! I used layrite, suavecito and slick devil but something about this pomade is different. Its so easy to style and just slick back! Its a definitely  a pomade you have to have in your collection!</li>
    <li> Smells great, awesome texture and hold! Definitely a product I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Look no further, shiner gold is my go-to pomade. This stuff smells awesome and you don&#x27;t have to cake it on for it to give you a good hold.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product! It&#x27;s a water-based pomade; easy to apply and style quickly. My hair is short around the sides and longer at the top, so I use a dime sized amount. Hair feels soft. Easy to wash off. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> for short hair, this is as good as it gets. good smell and strong hold. for long hair, i think it&#x27;s a bit too strong of a hold, and i prefer those regular &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; gels with glycerin / glycol because they tend to soften my hair. shiner gold tends to roughen my hair and i think you should get your hair damp beforehand</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the rage amongst the surfer teens. Teen has dry, ocean-damaged hair so we needed something that could hold it all in place without being greasy. Good hold but still soft and not too sticky. Container tightens good.</li>
    <li> I have short (fade w/ #8 on top) thick hair that goes naturally forward and can get the style i want (comb backward) in front of the mirror with Shiner Gold, definitely have to use more than other products though (Layrite)!!! Ive used 3 quarter size amounts . as I go about my day and check on my hair I see that it has popped up in a few places from the desired &amp;#34;slick back&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a clear golden appearance in the can.  Very soft and smooth, washes out easy, and has a great shine to it. I wish it would hold better, and smell would last longer. I got it at a local barber shop for $20.00 so this is a good price. I had to use more of it, so it didnt last long, and im going back to Layrite. I would recommend Shiner Gold for people with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I have medium thick Caucasian hair. Compared to petroleum based pomades, the hold is not as stiff, but it washes out easily which is a nice trade-off. The smell of this product reminds me of a Polynesian rum drink, or a mix of pineapple and coconut. The smell is not overpowering like some other pomades out there like Suavecito. I appreciate that it does not smell like cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an old school greaser, this wont give you the shiny dripping wet look like Royal Crown does, but it will still give you some height if you use enough. I need slightly more of this product to achieve the same effect as some other products.</li>
    <li> my man loved it.. he has very thick straight hair. so it&#x27;s hard to find a hair product that can shape it with out flaking at the end of the day. the best thing about this product is that a little bit goes along way. he said&amp;#34; 5 stars from him.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It comes in a silver tin and within the tin is a lightly golden gel with a fruity fragrance to it. I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a heavy hold but rather, more like a medium-heavy hold gel. I&#x27;ve been using this product for only a couple months now but, it does the job. Some people may end up using more than others. It is important to note that this product works best on dry hair so, if you are not getting the hold that you like, it may be due to the wetness of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I just wanted to let everyone know that they have released a new gel called Shiner Gold Psycho Hold Pomade. This one actually has a fairly heavy hold.</li>
    <li> Good for quality and small.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade. After my last pomade went off the market (Alterna Hemp Pomade) I went through  a ton of product, and a lot of money. Then I found a review of this pomade online.  Its water based, has a moderate amount of hold, and mild sheen. I have wavy hair short hair, it works great for me.  It washes out easily. It looks cool  and smells great, kind of sweet. Comes in a metallic tin. Its made in Arizona, not far from where I live. Reasonably priced too. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy/curly hair that I keep medium-length. I part my hair on one side, comb over, with a bit of pomp in front - a very standard haircut. I waffled between Shiner and LayRite for about a year, but finally settled on Shiner Gold. The hold is just better, and it feels more robust in my hair, while washing out just as easily as LayRite. With LayRite, I feel like my hair would still curl a bit, as if I were using a gel. With Shiner, it holds. Exactly how I want. I will say, my next tin of product is the Shiner Psycho Hold, and I will be interested to see how it stacks up against this product, which I genuinely love and couldn&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;nuff said</li>
    <li> This is a great hair pomade for men. I like it because it will hold in place all day long and it&#x27;s easy to wash at the end of day.</li>
    <li> Maybe this product works in certain types of hair, but after about 30 minutes it dried up and vanished leaving my hair with no hold at all.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and in perfect condition. instructions say to apply to dry hair and style, I have found applying to dry hair and styling with a wet comb works best for me.</li>
    <li> Good product that is made in the USA and smells good and don&#x27;t flake or look oily...worth checking out...I can&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
    <li> Great product hold well and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
    <li> love this stuff and will order more</li>
    <li> Good hair product but it says the order includes a free comb but I didn&#x27;t get one.</li>
    <li> This is by far my most used and favorite pomade I have. My hair is thick, coarse, and slightly wavy when it gets around 3-4 inches in length and this stuff can control my beastly hair with no problem whatsoever. I personally don&#x27;t buy single cans because you can save plenty more when you buy a 3 pack from their website(I got a free comb and koozie w/ the 3 pck), if you use it as frequently as I do...which is every week day. I get complements on my hair at least every week thanks to this pomade. I highly recommend trying this stuff out it will be worth your hard earned money if you appreciate a GOOD pomade.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it has any hold. I put it in my hair and it continues to fall out of place.</li>
    <li> Best pomade!!! Great price, great hold, water based, and no greasy hair. Will be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> Great pomade that smells great too. 4 stars because of price and I thought it takes too much to get the hold I want so the tin doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great, I like how it washes out super easily. I just wish it had a stronger hold cause i have naturally thick hair. But for a water soluble pomade you can&#x27;t really complain</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different pomades and I love this product, especially suited for people with thin straight hair</li>
    <li> Good medium weight water-based pomade. Smells good and has a light consistency in hands. If you rock a loose pomade make sure you wet your hair mid day to keep it looking good. Similar hold to Layrite Superhold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of pomades and this is the best I won&#x27;t switch to anything else, it&#x27;s not greasy or slimy and not hard to wash off your hands or hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best water Pomades on the market. Super easy to go through the 4 oz. though. I hope they bring some bulk deals to amazon because it is a nice product.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic water soluable pomade that washes out well with just shampoo &amp; water.  The hold is excellent.  Restyling is a piece of cake - if your hair is dry just run a comb through it and restyle as desired.  If you like the wet look, put this stuff in while your hair is still wet.  Restyling is simple as well - just re-wet and restyle.  It&#x27;s that simple.  The stuff goes in very smooth and even.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other water based pomaded including Lay-Rite.  I found that they either didn&#x27;t hold well or they were too stiff (like using gel).  That&#x27;s not the case with Shiner Gold.  It holds extremely well without becoming stiff and crunchy like a gel would.</li>
    <li> I have some serious cowlicks and unruly fine hair... this stuff let&#x27;s me comb it any way that I want. Great product, lasts all day, lasts wearing a hat, lasts jumping in the ocean, lasts getting hammered and sleeping on a couch. Smell is acquired, not the best I&#x27;ve used, kind of waxy. But that&#x27;s never been a make or break for me.</li>
    <li> I liked this pomade. I tried it and the Psycho Hold in the same week. This one has a high shine and a medium to high hold. I liked it. It smelled a lot sweeter than I prefer but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so it&#x27;s not a big problem. I do prefer Psycho Hold to this because I prefer a medium or matte shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> Good product and smells like sun tan lotion or a Pi&amp;ntilde;a colada. A bit thinner than I like and the hold is mediocre at best.  Provides decent shine but the hold will come apart fairly easily in heat/humidity.  Great shine and scent. This is for people looking for a light hold with a good shine. Water soluble so washes out of hair really fast.</li>
    <li> The description didn&#x27;t say anything about being water soluble.  No thanks, that isn&#x27;t pomade.</li>
    <li> My barber used this in my hair once and I bought some on the spot! It last all day, if you want it slick it looks slick if you want it to hold dry just mess it up a little and comb it back. Killer product!</li>
    <li> I love my Shiner.  It&#x27;s got a good smell....what is it pina-colota?  Whatever it is, it&#x27;s like a tropical coconut citrus smell.  The water soluble formula is right up there with the rest of them. Don&#x27;t waste your time with those wax or petroleum based pomades.  I&#x27;ve heard some people gripe about the fact that the water based pomades &amp;#34;aren&#x27;t natural&amp;#34; and can &amp;#34;damage your hair/scalp&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve never experienced any of that from Shiner Gold or any of the others.  Just because you can&#x27;t pronounce some of the ingredients in the water based formulas doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re bad or unhealthy.  If you have problems, I just suggest you wash your hair more often. ;)  My only complaint is that the price is a little higher than what seems necessary when compared to other brands with the same ingredients/quality.</li>
    <li> This has been the best pomade I have come across. Its very easy to clean out at the end of the day. Also if you ever run your fingers through it doesn&#x27;t feel all greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the look, the texture and the &amp;#34;fragarance&amp;#34; . Smells like a pina colada. Nice hold, keeps shape and creates a high shine if you apply on wet hair but less hold. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
    <li> Works well, holds my hair through a busy service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a ton of hair products recently and I finally found the one for me. It smells great, isn&#x27;t as greasy as other pomades, and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Also, I can throw water in my hair and restyle. Amazing stuff!</li>
