<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A hairdresser recommended this product for my curly haired daughter. It is on the pricey side, but we now swear by this spray! It has been the only thing that has made her curls manageable so that she can really take care of her hair herself. I have wavy hair and use it as well. Excellent leave-in conditioning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have colored hair and put this on right after my daily shampoo.  My color last longer and my hair shines and is super soft.</li>
    <li> I only use Purelogy and love all their products. This one is great right out of the shower or even dry if I&#x27;m processing like flatten or curling.</li>
    <li> Nice leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I did not use it because the shampoo and conditioner I received were not really Pureology products. They were fakes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and I really like it.  It is pricey but I can get it for a cheaper price on Amazon than I can get from my stylist and I just haven&#x27;t found anything else that I like better.</li>
    <li> I use this as a heat protectant... also helps &#x27;revive&#x27; my hair... makes it look healthier somehow! More lustrous? Maybe it&#x27;s just in my head, haha, but I will definitely be repurchasing when it runs out unless I run across another heat protectant that I want to try... I liked that this one had safe ingredients... I&#x27;m trying to get away from silicones and sulphates and all that junk. This fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time on my color treated hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Best product I ever use.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using it for 2 years now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it for detangling and heat protection when using the hair dryer. It smells really good, which was my deciding factor to keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I have been using for over a year now. It has really helped with the fizziness and dryness of my hair. I always bought it at a beauty salon but I decided to give it a try buying it from a seller online. And now I can say I will never do it again. They changed the content or maybe added water to it because my hair is again out of control with my frizziness. Do not buy products from this seller!!</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner ever. Keeps my curly hair straight, hair is soft and manageable. Very happy with it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and the way it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this product and so look forward to washing my hair so that I can use it. It really makes your hair soft and silky. Plus it has 21 benefits... You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My hair stylist used it on me, so I decided to purchase it online.  I do find that it makes my hair greasy if I use too much.  It is a very fine line between the right amount and too much!  I try to just spray it on the ends of my hair and brush it out.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  No tangles with my long hair and smooth and shiny result!  Definitely buy this product again!  5 stars plus!</li>
    <li> A must along side the shampoo. Keeps the color in your hair as it was the day you dyed it. Very good for your hair too. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> 2nd purchase. Great for medium to thick with tangley hair. Thin hair?  Spray in hands and use sparingly. Gets my knots manageable, nice smell. It actually sprays which is great because some kind of spit spray which is annoying. I use this mostly in the winter. Howeverrrrr, works on fuzzies when it&#x27;s humid out and so ok, 20% use in summer and 70% in the winter. I really don&#x27;t even care what is in it at this point. My hair feels great use after use so if there is protein it can&#x27;t be too high because I can&#x27;t use protein consistently. Well no one should but anyway that&#x27;s my review.</li>
    <li> Diluted product.  This product did not smell right (smells more like perfume) and did not give me same results as spray I&#x27;ve bought at ulta in past. So prior to reviewing I purchased a small bottle at ulta to compare, and sure as anything- they were not the same in smell, consistency or results! Had to throw away.  Very unhappy...&lt;br /&gt;update- I contacted seller &amp; was refunded. Was told that the product was flawed through manufacturer.  I increased star to 3 due to refund.  But cannot say I will buy again because,I&#x27;m now worried about what I could be putting on my gair.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my salon on the recommendation of my stylist, who used it on me that day.  I liked how my hair felt when I left the salon.  Next morning, different story!  My hair felt tacky/sticky and looked limp and dull.  I tried it at home 3 different times.  First time I used 1 pump, second time I used 3 pumps and third time I used 5 pumps on my shoulder-length hair.  The amount didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  My hair still felt good that day, but then the same negative results noted above the second day.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I&#x27;ve noticed about this product in this very dry winter air is that it seems to cause more static.  My first hint should have been my stylist shocking me repeatedly after she dried and styled my hair.  Waste of money, IMO!</li>
    <li> Arrived leak free and as indicated.  Will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> Seriously the most important product I own I looooooove it!</li>
    <li> I have really dry over processed hair.  Tried because my hair stylisti suggested it.  It does help with the frizziness but it seems to leave a sticky residue.  I may be using too much though.  Flat iron really seems to be the only thing that smooths and shines and I can use just about any product and make that work.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling weighed dow, dirty and greasy. I would never buy agian. It was expensive too. don;t bother</li>
    <li> does everything it says on the bottle, has made my hair more managable and softer less breakage and helped with color fade, so glad i got it</li>
    <li> Ordering and shipping process very good. The actual product was less to be desired. I had ready stunning reviews on it and how soft, supple and workable it made hair, especially difficult hair (like mine) to work with. I have coarse, brittle, wiry hair that I do color regularly and was hoping I had found a product that would take the place of the mulitple ones I use (serum, conditioner, gloss, shine and finishing spray.) This product however left my strands very sticky, stiff, and hard to work with. It felt I needed to wash my hair again and made my hair very difficult to style.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, money wasted for me. :(</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my hair shine, Comb through is easy. It just does wonders and I love it.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about a year.  It keeps your hair color looking fresh.</li>
    <li> The product works well for untangling your hair and protecting your hair if you blow dry it.  Going on my second bottle.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I looooove this stuff!!! i&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months to get the health of my hair back and it&#x27;s been working wonders. It has some benefits that are like leav-in conditioner which is great for heat styling and protecting your hair. SMELLS AMAZING</li>
    <li> My salon actually recommended this for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has split ends, dull and she uses heat on it. They explained that it does all kinds of things. And, they have tried it an love it. They said it is not just for color treated hair. So, I bought it....and found that it really made a difference in her hair. It detangles, makes her soft, shiny and smells wonderful. So, I gave it a try and I am sold on it! My hair is so shiny, soft and manageable now. I don&#x27;t have to use anything else. I just spray it on after I shower and style. I have not had anymore frizz and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down either. The results are wonderful even though my hair is not colored. I have only used it for a week, but I am loving it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and I ordered a new bottle from amazon. The product is vegan and therefore does go bad. I opened my bottle two nights ago (received a week or so ago) and it smells like vinegar, also doesn&#x27;t soften my hair like my original bottle did. I feel like for 22.00 I shouldn&#x27;t be at all unhappy and I am very unhappy right now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> The best leave in treatment I have tried and I have tried alot of them. Great for color lasting and detangleing</li>
    <li> I just have to say, I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews on this product, and my one tip is for people to use this very sparingly. I have short hair and I used 3 pumps the first time I tried this, and my hair was very dull and stiff. I tried it again today using only one pump, and it made a complete difference. My hair was SUPER shiny and soft today. Also, I haven&#x27;t been spraying it directly on my hair....I spray it on my palm, rub my hands together, then apply to the ends of my hair first and towards the roots last. Hopefully that will help anyone who is having problems with this making their hair too greasy or a weird texture. My only two issues with this product are: 1) The smell....it&#x27;s SUPER strong and quite floral-y, and I wish it smelled like the Hydrate shampoo instead, which is the best scent ever. 2)  I live in Minnesota and we are in the middle of a very dry winter, and my and my daughter&#x27;s hair (I used it on her as well) were both static-y today. I&#x27;ve never had that problem before (neither has she), and this could be the only difference I can attribute it to. Oh well; I&#x27;m willing to put up with those complaints in exchange for shiny hair.  :)</li>
    <li> Love this item. Pureology was always the best with products that are great for your hair without a lot of harmful ingredients. You don&#x27;t need to very much just a few squirts all over. In the beginning I was using way too much.</li>
    <li> Your hair will smell great and look incredible with this product. Specially if you use the blow dry, this is a must have!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! it makes it easier to brush your hair, smells great, and protects your locks!</li>
    <li> Prefer Pureology&#x27;s Perfect for Platinum Miracle Filler over this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is looking much better since switching to Pureology. It is healthier and has more shine than ever before since coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> My Hairdresser suggested  to use this for my hair breakage issues and it works great even on my 4 year olds tangled hair. My hair looks healthy and shinning now :)</li>
    <li> Great product...really helps maintain hair color. You can truly see the difference in your color when you use it.  It really helps with fading.  You will love this product if you color your hair...</li>
    <li> I have had problems for years with my hair looking limp and dull. I recently tried a whole new hairstyle and needed my hair to look slick, soft and shiny. I remembered I had a small sample bottle of Pureology Colour Fanatic that a friend gave me about 6 months ago and I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; - I&#x27;ll try anything at this point. I AM HOOKED!!! My hair is luscious with this product! I have been out of the sample for days and can&#x27;t wait to get my order in the mail! I 100% recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for a week to give this a go and here is my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;No frizz&lt;br /&gt;detangles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;It smells really bad (really really dirty towel bad)&lt;br /&gt;leaves a lot of build up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So never ever gonna buy this again. It just smells so so bad.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time yesterday, and the 2 things that drew me to it were 1) The smell. It smells very botanical and clean, and 2) the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use any other products on my hair. I read the previous review that it smells bad. I got the complete opposite from this product, which makes me believe you got a bad batch. I would try to return it for a refund, then purchase it from a local salon. This should be a good test to determine if what you got was poor quality. Good luck!</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVEEEEE this product. Smells AMAZING and feels like it makes my hair stronger and thicker! Even if it didn&#x27;t do that, I love the smell :)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it makes my hair shiny and healthier looking.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and for half what my stylist was going to charge me. I like using this on wet hair then styling, it&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner I have tried</li>
    <li> The best of the best!</li>
    <li> This product really work in helping to prevent your hair from getting damage from the harsh heat of styling devices and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair lifeless .!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter (14) has totally frizzy and dry hair.  Her hair was like a rats nest every morning and was near to impossible to comb out.  The hair stylist recommended this and I decided to give it a try.  Not only is it an awesome detangler, but her hair is also changing.  It is way less frizzy, is softer, and just looks so much healthier.  All this after barely a week of using it.  This is like liquid gold for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it, but my results are not as drastic...I think that is because I have more naturally soft and shiny hair to begin with. My hair is not dry or frizzy.  I do like that my hair is easier to comb out after my shower.  I was using Enjoy leave in conditioner, but this is a much better detangler for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shiny and prevents damage</li>
    <li> Amazing wonder product!!!</li>
    <li> BEST leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Makes my hair feel awesome and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the new formula, works fantastic!</li>
    <li> I really love how the product makes your hair so soft and iisn&#x27;t too heavy. Easier to style and less frizz. Smells good too. You only have 2 spray a couple of squirts on your hands and rub it in your hair gently.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this after I had dyed my hair. It has a ton of benefits listed on the bottle. I have fine, wavy hair so I can&#x27;t use anything but sprays as leave in conditioner. I can say Pureology has outdone any previous hair routine I had. Some of my hair has actually went from being wavy to semi straight, but that was in combination with Pureologys reviving red shampoo and conditioner. As a leave in conditoner, color fanatic is fantastic at leaving my hair feeling awesome. A few sprays goes a long way too! I&#x27;m still on my first bottle (purchased it in august of 2014) and its still half full! Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I had a small sample bottle that I tried by chance because I couldn&#x27;t find the anti-frizz product I usually use in my hair. I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was pleasantly surprised when, after blow drying, my hair looked wonderful! No frizz, and it did not weigh my hair down like other products. I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in a while so as far as it protecting color-dyed hair, I have no idea. I have fine, frizzy/wavy hair and this worked wonders. I bought the full-size because it is the first and only product that works with my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.... It&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this in our hair when it is either wet or dry. The spray smells very nice and it&#x27;s helpful when we have tangles in our hair. We will keep purchasing this product. I recommend it!.😄</li>
    <li> This was a bit more expensive than the Aussie I normally use, but I did notice a little more softness.  I really need to test it see if my red stays redder, before I bow to the color saver past.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, dry hair. We live in the desert, and it&#x27;s just a fact of life. I dye my hair regularly, and that doesn&#x27;t make things any better. This stuff came in my GlossyBox, and I LOVE IT!!!! It smells great, and it works even better. It helps detangle, smooths, and makes my hair super shiny and soft. I will definitely be buying this over and over again!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hair products. It smells amazing &amp; I have no tangles when I use this and my hair feels very soft. My hair dresser calls this her hair crack. One bottle using it every day, lasts a few months. You wont be sorry you ordered this one!</li>
    <li> GREAT product!  Helps tame frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this three months ago and I just love it leaves your hair shinny and soft without that heavy conditioner feeling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for years and thought I&#x27;d try this. It was very expensive and left my hair feeling stiff. Would&amp;#34;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Twice as much for half the price my beautician charges me.  :)</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the coconut scent. But it is supposed to soften the hair. I have curly hair, so it&#x27;s pretty hard to tell if it actually does the job. I was recommended this product by my hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Softens and seems to seal in moisture the hair before drying. Sort like hair perfume but not over kill with the scent level.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference before and after using this product, it is mostly like any other conditioner. I expected to make my hair more bouncy and shiny but it didnt meet my expectation</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell amazing but it works SO WELL. If you want one product that does everything, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I keep trying to switch to something cheaper because Pureology is so expensive but I am always drawn back to it because it is such a fantastic product. This is a relatively new product that my stylist recommended and I love it. It moisturizes and detangles without weighing my hair down. It smells wonderful too. I love that it is a leave-in conditioner. De-frizzes and makes my hair shiny. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not nutty about the smell and it is strong. I never understand why manufacturers have to put oodles of fragrance in hair styling products. That is what actual perfume/cologne is for. Giving it away to someone who likes how this smells.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a year now and never going back! Nourishes hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. Just shiny, smooth, detangled hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Makes your hair manageable and protects your color.  Great fragrances.  Love it</li>
    <li> love this stuff! great detangler and makes my hair smell great!</li>
    <li> I was losing hope for my thin, dry, color-treated, fine, uncontrollable hair until I decided to try this spray.  I spray this product on my hair after shampooing and towel drying, gently comb it through, then let my hair air dry until barely damp.  When I blow it dry, my hair has a lot of shine and bounce to it, and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy and flyaway.  It feels very soft, and amazingly, I don&#x27;t always need to wash and re-style every day because it holds it&#x27;s shape pretty well (I&#x27;ve been washing my hair almost every day for years because if I don&#x27;t it just mats down on my head and the ends look wild).&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I like Pureology is that I am allerigic/sensitive to certain ingredients commonly found in hair products (mostly sprays), and this product doesn&#x27;t make me sniffle and cough.  I received this order very quickly and it was very well packaged.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell. Leave in conditioner that is not greasy. Worked well to control my frizzes. Does flatten hair if you use too much so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My favorite leave-in by far. Firstly, about my hair type: My hair has a fine texture, but it is naturally wavy, there is a lot of it, and it&#x27;s long. My hair is also color treated. Because of its texture, my hair is prone to breakage. Since I began using this product last month, I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the overall health of my hair. It&#x27;s shinier, softer, and definitely stronger. It also looks fuller. The product itself smells great, a little goes a long way, its a great detangler, and my hair seems to be holding the color for longer. Based on how well this has worked for me, I would strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the ONLY leave in conditioner that I&#x27;ve used on my hair that instantly gives me so much slip as SOON as I apply it. I am African American. I have natural sandy brown highlighted hair... and when I tell you I have dry, dry, DRY Sahara Desert hair... honey... It gets no dryer than my hair. I am transitioning from relaxer to natural... (which I am debating on whether or not I can really handle my natural hair texture) but it does not matter what shampoo and conditioner I use, this product delivers EVERY TIME! I can use any other shampoo and conditioner line, then use this as my leave-in ... and every single time, my hair instantly turns soft and instantly detangles... with little to no shedding. I have tried so many other products (I have a sink full... that I need to throw away) but none of them compare to this one. This product smells amazing (can&#x27;t really describe it, but it certainly smells like you just came out of the salon). The spray bottle is very helpful as it allows you to control how much product you put in your hair. I usually always spray it in my hand first, rub my hands together, then saturate it all throughout my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note  that I only buy this product from Ulta or Beauty Brands ... I do not buy my hair products from Amazon anymore due to several past bad experiences with sellers sending me fake \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; products! Because of that, I only buy this product from a licensed salon. I will also note, if the retail price scares you... start off with the travel size! That&#x27;s what I did when I first tried out the product. The travel size retails at Ulta ($12.98) and Beauty Brands for $6.98... and I will also note both places allow you to try the product out and if you are not satisfied with it, you can BRING IT BACK. And if you are anything like me and have to try out products through trial and error, that&#x27;s a pretty awesome return policy. 5 stars, heck yea! I give this product 10 stars. Why, you might ask. Because it DELIVERS every single time. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I use Pureology shampoo and conditioner, Biolage or the Moroccan Oil line, every time I use this as a leave-in (on towel dried hair) this product consistently gives me the same slip every time! I&#x27;ve tried It&#x27;s A Ten leave in conditioner.. and while I like that product... I LOVE this one. ;)it DELIVERS every single time.

    <li> This works okay. I got it for my daughter after a summer of pools and ocean water and it hasn&#x27;t made much difference. I have to be really careful not to use too much or my hair comes out looking greasy. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> The pump broke... this is the second time something has happened like that. I don&#x27;t plan on ordering it again.</li>
    <li> So many times after color is applied is seems to fade even when using the Pureology shampoos. This product is great and will order more.</li>
    <li> Only use 3 or 4 sprays when you hair is wet and comb through. Really, dont use more than that. If you use too much, it makes your hair texture very weird. Its really strong and the only thing that works on my damaged hair. Its super tangly after showering and this is like magic.</li>
    <li> I have been a regular user of Pureology products for a little over 2 years now.  My stylist recommended the line to me, and it has worked wonders for my hair.  Brought it  back to life and is healthier than ever.  I purchased Color Fanatic this past weekend and have used it twice.  In three words.....It. Is. Amazing.  My hair feels incredibly soft and healthy!  It is a great detangler and makes your hair smell fantastic!  When they say it has 21 benefits, they aren&#x27;t kidding.  Even after washing my hair this morning, I could tell how much better it felt!  I will recommend this product to anyone and everyone.  I have very fine, limp hair and this makes it so silky, shiny, and less dry.  My only concern is that they keep selling this forever and not discontinue it like they have done with other products.  I&#x27;ve seriously considered buying this in bulk just so I have it for life.  Thank you, Pureology!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, which tends to dry quickly, especially in the winter.  This product was recommended by my hair dresser and I just love it.  Instantly detangles my hair and without any residue, stickiness or gunk that has to be rinsed from your hands.  It doesnt weigh my hair down and keeps it soft and manageable throughout the day.  At the salon, this product is $25.99 so finding it on Amazon for $3 cheaper is a deal in my view.  The first time I purchased, it was only $19 on Amazon but not sure if its the same Seller.  Regardless, I am saving money purchasing online and the gas/time to drive to the salon.  Thats a win/win.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Great multi-use product.  I use it on wet hair before drying.  Do be careful not to use too much, as it will make your hair feel dirty and sticky.  After my hair is dry, I follow with a dry oil to help smooth the hair.  Also look for the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this product - makes my hair very soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  Makes my hair smooth and definitely helps protect against heat damage.  I also notice a considerable difference in the amount of time it takes to dry my hair when I use this.  Use it sparingly - a couple of sprays goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks...my hair is very damaged from bleaching. This really conditions it.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastically unique!  Keeps hair color from fading. Detangles not only your natural hair, but also hair extensions as well, blending your natural hair with the extensions in an even, shiny, natural look. The scent is so clean and fresh. This product produces such soft, natural, shiny and smooth hair even with the use of any and all heat products.  Also very little goes a long way.  No need to over spray 21 Benefits on your clean, damp hair, to see these wonderful results.</li>
    <li> Great Product, my stylist used it on my hair and recommended it, got it on amazon for about 5 dollars cheaper with shipping.  I have color treated long fine hair and this is the only product I now use to detangle and smooth before styling.  Love that it is a heat protectant as well!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair so soft, and my hair feel fantastic!  A definite must have!</li>
    <li> Sent me 7 one ounce bottles instead of 1 6.7 ounce bottle.  Good grief.  The pic is deceiving.  That&#x27;s just wrong.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday before I blow-dry.  It really does prevent frizziness and keeps my hair looking good all day long.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for color treated hair that keeps your hair smooth &amp; shiny after blow drying &amp; using a flat Iron!</li>
    <li> I have never encountered something as amazing as this product is for your hair. only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell, its definitely not a bad smell just a bit intense and smells like a salon. I use this product daily and im totally hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair, and I prefer this to the other detanglers.  Enjoy and 12 Benefits are also good.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and when I read all the raves about this product, no one mentioned how it worked for air dried curly hair. I submitted a &amp;#34;question&amp;#34; to ask if any one knew. I received a few replies and decided to order, I love it! No wet look or crunchy curls</li>
    <li> Great leave in conditioner for dry color treated hair, and as a detangler for my grand daughters hair.  And it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can use it as a leave in treatment which works well for me as if I was using hairspray when I put my hair up in a bun it actually keep my baby hairs in place and it smells so good and you don&#x27;t get that dry or flaky or stiff hair. I also spray this on after I shower on my hair when it&#x27;s damp and then I blow dry my hair and it works perfect. It definitely is an everyday use for me.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that I air dry. If i don&#x27;t use to much I get perfect curls with no stiff or sticky feel</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing, just read the description about it&#x27;s many uses. It smells great. I live in AZ so the weather is hot and dry here, and the water very, very hard. I have long thick hair. It makes my hair manageable, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> i ran out of this &amp; tried it&#x27;s a 10 instead....i want to go back to using this product. it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> total crap! Does not work!! plus they automatically deduct $90 from your pymts method monthly from another country!!</li>
    <li> This product is really fantastic for my straight, fine, color-treated hair.  I spray it on lightly after washing and towel drying but before blow drying.  As I wash my hair everyday due to an oily scalp, I LOVE that it never leaves my hair feeling greasy, heavy, or sticky even though I use it as a leave-in.  The smell is AMAZING, but not so strong that it clashes with perfume or is noticeable after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my young daughter&#x27;s long, fine, curly hair to detangle after washing and to help with fly-aways when styling.  She loves the smell of the product, and it makes a big difference when combing through her long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this product on my hair.  Some people say the smell is strong, but I don&#x27;t think so at all.  I loved the smell of this product.  It did seem to help my color treated hair.  Color lasted longer and it conditioned my hair as well.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is pretty expensive in the salon, but Amazon has a better price.  I think it smells nice.  The best part is that it helps me with split ends and tangles.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product, but it does work.  I can use quite a bit without it weighing my hair down.  Not sticky or heavy.  I&#x27;ve already bought several bottles.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes it so easy to brush my hair out!</li>
    <li> Did not find this product as great as it&#x27;s reviews. Have sooo many other products that I find are equally as good.</li>
    <li> Detangles my hair and makes it so incredibly soft and as an African American woman, I can say that this is very amazing.</li>
    <li> Like all their products, this works really well on fine, frizzy, curly, and colored hair.</li>
    <li> Seems to make my hair feel dry.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my hair feel. I definitely notice when I don&#x27;t use this product! I have bleached, straight hair. This product helps detangled, shine, moisturize and minimize frizz. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. It adds strength and softness without ever being heavy on my hair. It also helps to detangle my hair after a shower and seems to help with a shorter drying time with the hair dryer.  There isn&#x27;t anything not to like about Pureology 21!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Keeps my hair shiny and well protected from heat styling damage.  Quite a noticeable difference when I occasionally forget to use it.  My stylist turned me onto this about 9 months ago, and I&#x27;m just now having to buy a new bottle of product.  A few spritzes go a long way.</li>
