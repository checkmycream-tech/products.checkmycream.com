      <li>I really love this eye liner, but it does stain your eye lids for a day or two after applying.</li>
      <li>I love this make up everyone always gives me compliments makes my eyes.</li>
      <li>and I love the colors.</li>
      <li>and I do not see how they got such wonderful results.</li>
      <li>used it on top and lower lids.</li>
      <li>Omg love</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that the quality would be ok-</li>
      <li>Under water the colors did fantastic!</li>
      <li>I Love Them 😍</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I absolutely love these.</li>
      <li>I really love all the colors, and the liquid is not lumpy.</li>
      <li>These eyeliners are perfect, I&#x27;m totally buying more.</li>
      <li>I love these...</li>
      <li>I tried them all out on the back of my hand (the colors are awesome, btw!)</li>
      <li>I love these...</li>
      <li>This is the best eyeliner ever i go to sleep with it and wake up with it on and it last me all day literally and doesnt crack or smear even with my sweat and its easy to put on ,and i love the variety of colors</li>
      <li>I ordered this exact set and absolutely love them!</li>
      <li>Also colors are too liquidy and easily drip from the eye.</li>
      <li>The brush for it doesn&#x27;t collect the mascara well, but that&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>Nothing about this product what accurate.</li>
      <li>cuz I apply it light anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Not as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but they work well</li>
      <li>These were so cheap-</li>
      <li>And two, I really want more colors with out having to buy mascara. :)</li>
      <li>These eye liners go on nice and smoothly; the colors are vibrant.  </li>
      <li>and i love it so much i have ordered this 2 more times as a gift for my mom and a friend because i love it that much</li>
      <li>The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
      <li>so good, doesn&#x27;t smudge, last for long, looks great on eyes,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>The package arrived fairly quickly also.</li>
      <li>The color is very vibrant and glides on easily.</li>
      <li>The brushes are pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>The purple was a bit clumpy however which gives me the impression it&#x27;s not as fresh and new as the others, but I&#x27;m not terribly heartbroken about it.</li>
      <li>However, the brush is flexible and doesn&#x27;t hold too much liner, so it applies it in a really smooth line.  </li>
      <li>Colors were lighter than I thought - but fun to experiment with them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had so much fun using it.</li>
      <li>the colors are all very vibrant and true to te what</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to put on but the colors are beautiful</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I liked this colors in picture but out of 8 , I am only happy with 3 colors - black, blue , brown</li>
      <li>the brush is a very nice, gentle brush that makes it very easy to put on unlike other liquid eye liners that have stiff brushes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have worn them on the beach in Hawaii and pretty much everywhere else.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is to have more than one black in the set, since it&#x27;s the color I use the most.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t, then maybe stick with another eyeliner since these are pretty vibrant.</li>
      <li>Despite the complaints, I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent brand for its price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky</li>
      <li>The light blue stained a bit I needed disappearing cream.</li>
      <li>the shipping was fast and the packageing was good.-XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
      <li>These are fantastic for the price and the white!</li>
      <li>The delivery is fast and prompt, plus it keep the delivery as dated.</li>
      <li>THE COLOR OF ALL ARE REALLY.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Other then a little fading of a couple colors, most of the colors looked great still the next morning.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s primarily the one I will use, but the other colors also look fantastic for a cute party look or to spice up your everyday makeup.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and stays for a long time.</li>
      <li>let me down much more.</li>
      <li>I do wish they had more of the black b/c</li>
      <li>It arrived in a decent amount of time, but not in a box.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and truly pigmented but they do not stay on.  </li>
      <li>eyeliner is decent quality.</li>
      <li>I AM OLDER</li>
      <li>The blue is my favorite and these really do last me all day!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, not stiff, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
      <li>Especially for someone who puts make up rarely.</li>

    <li> It arrived in a decent amount of time, but not in a box. Instead, in a bad covered in bubble wrap inside an envelope.&lt;br /&gt;Did not get all of the colors I wanted. I have white, gold, cappucino, blue, brown, walnut, terra cotta, and a tube of mascara. That&#x27;s four shades of brown, by the way. I was looking forward to the green and light blue, so anyone wanna trade? lol&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is decent quality. I would put on primer first if you have wrinkles around your eyes, but it&#x27;s not really that noticable. Gold, blue, and white take multiple layers to show well.&lt;br /&gt;The browns, all four of them, are very solid. None of them need multiple paints. The actual &amp;#34;Brown&amp;#34; tube shows up really, really dark.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are a little wide, wish they were as precise as Maybelline Eye Studio.&lt;br /&gt;Mascara smells weird, but I like the tube. The brush for it doesn&#x27;t collect the mascara well, but that&#x27;s fine cuz I apply it light anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be buying online again, but would pick some of the colors up in a store. Despite the complaints, I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent brand for its price.</li>
    <li> I got these originally for the white &amp; I actually like these. I got them because I needed more eyeliners as I do a lot of makeup looks &amp; they work fine! I do have pigment issues w gold but two-three coats &amp; your ok!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous. I bought these before I went sailing, and even after capsizing a rather large boat, my cat-eye was perfectly intact. I also run while wearing it, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all.  However, unlike Milani, you can actually remove it without going through 10 makeup remover towels. It comes off easily with face wash and a towel and doesn&#x27;t stain!  The applicator is easy to use -- it&#x27;s a brush, which I was rather wary of at first. However, the brush is flexible and doesn&#x27;t hold too much liner, so it applies it in a really smooth line.  My only complaint (and it&#x27;s not even  legitimate complaint) is that I never used half of them and used three of them to death, so I&#x27;ll be ordering another one... gonna have two sets of all the colors I never use. Ah well, it&#x27;s pretty great anyway.  I recommend the dark blue.    Also, here&#x27;s a cat-eye tutorial for anyone who&#x27;s unsure: [...]    TL;DR: no smudge, paints nice, comes off, dark blue.</li>
    <li> I love these...the colors are all very vibrant and true to te what</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner ever i go to sleep with it and wake up with it on and it last me all day literally and doesnt crack or smear even with my sweat and its easy to put on ,and i love the variety of colors my favorite is the royal blue and the black and white and i use this daily atleast the black one and i love it so much i have ordered this 2 more times as a gift for my mom and a friend because i love it that much the blue one gives me alot of compliments at work and i have given the name of this eyeliner to a few of my customers that have asked me about it the blue one definetely gets alot of attention..im happy i got this..its the best eyeliner ive used and ive been wearing liquid eyeliner for 17 years. i love this product</li>
    <li> These eyeliners made me so hopeful that they would be waterproof because the colors were so beautiful...but sadly, they were NOT.  So dont believe what the advertisers say that it will be waterproof.</li>
    <li> The blue is my favorite and these really do last me all day! happy with this buy</li>
    <li> My sisters use nothing but this brand, for years and they get compliments on them every time. I have used it a few times and eaI find it eas.  Especially for someone who puts make up rarely. It&#x27;s smooth, not stiff, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a nice variety from the bundle, which I&#x27;ll admit I got. Pink, gold, white, silver, dark blue, green, purple, and a black mascara. The purple was a bit clumpy however which gives me the impression it&#x27;s not as fresh and new as the others, but I&#x27;m not terribly heartbroken about it. The mascara hasn&#x27;t won my heart over either. I was a little disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with a dark brown eyeliner shade, but overall I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These were so cheap- I wasn&#x27;t sure that the quality would be ok- but I took a chance anyway and am so glad that I did! I also usually like a felt tip, but decided to give these with the brush a try, again, because they were so cheap. The size and shape of the brush makes application just as easy as a felt-tip, if not even smoother! I put this eyeliner on at 5 AM and it lasts all day long- no flaking, no smearing, it stays right where I put it. The colors are great too, very pretty shades. If you are thinking about trying these, but are worried that they may be &amp;#34;too cheap&amp;#34; like I was, BUY THEM! I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
    <li> item was not as expected and received different colors than described and some were dried out and I contacted them and they won&#x27;t do anything about it. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TERRIBLE PRODUCTS. BUYER BEWARE !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got my eye liners in the mail yesterday. I tried them all out on the back of my hand (the colors are awesome, btw!) by drawing a small line of each color. I let them dry and then proceeded to take a shower. Under water the colors did fantastic! It was only when I proceeded to use a loofa and scrub that they started to wash off. Then I drew a new line of each in the same spot and went to bed. Other then a little fading of a couple colors, most of the colors looked great still the next morning. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this eye liner, but it does stain your eye lids for a day or two after applying. It is very pretty though and it seems to be very good quality.</li>
    <li> I just reordered these.  I have worn them on the beach in Hawaii and pretty much everywhere else.  If you give them a little time to dry they will last all day (and I don&#x27;t use primer).  The colors are vivid and highly pigmented.  They glide across the top lid and make a perfect line in seconds.  I hope I will always be able to find these as they are my favorite!  The only thing I would change is to have more than one black in the set, since it&#x27;s the color I use the most.  Another plus is these have vitamin E in them so perhaps they are actually beneficial to wear in some senses.  Anyway, get these, they are awesome and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  They might take a little practice on the lower lash line, but once you get the hang of them...wonderful.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bold colors. Not sheer or watered down like I expected. The dark blue doesn&#x27;t wear well sadly. It flaked and it laid on goopy. The light blue stained a bit I needed disappearing cream. I am not complaining though I&#x27;ve had much more expensive products let me down much more. These are fantastic for the price and the white! Omg love</li>
    <li> my favorite color is the dark blue one. they dry quickly and the color are vivid. there was maybe one watery one but i definitely recommend this product. the shipping was fast and the packageing was good.-XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Colors were lighter than I thought - but fun to experiment with them</li>
    <li> I gave them to my daughter.  She hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner, but I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with the light blue color. I probably didn&#x27;t read something carefully enough.</li>
    <li> I needed my eyeliner to be matte and not look wet or tacky. They are indeed matte and stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Must haves.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE VERY NICE EYELINER. THE COLOR OF ALL ARE REALLY.  THEY GO ON VERY EASILY, WITH NO PULLING OR TUGGING.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve had so much fun using it. basically waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on top and lower lids. lower smudged very little and top stayed in place&lt;br /&gt;for 16 hours. I will order this again, extremely good value and extremely good product.</li>
    <li> the description says 8 eyeliners. that&#x27;s what i thought i&#x27;d be getting,it was not what i received. what i received was 7 eyeliners and a black mascara. Its not really a complaint but i did take a stair away for that. I didn&#x27;t need mascara that&#x27;s why i ordered eyeliner it is what i needed. If they were out of stock of any of the colors then they should email the buyer and give us the option to receive either multiple of one color or a mascara. But I have no other complaints, shipping was excellent and the packaging was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try any of the eyeliners out yet but i will leave a review when I do.</li>
    <li> Product came but there was nothing in the white can.. Also colors are too liquidy and easily drip from the eye.</li>
    <li> Liner is very thick.  When dry, it tended to flake and get into my eyes.  Irritated eyes.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted. The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
    <li> not very good. No very even and hard to use.</li>
    <li> I was unsure at first if I made a worthwhile purchase with these eyeliners, but now having tried them, I know they&#x27;ll come in handy! The color is very vibrant and glides on easily. Just be careful that too much can come off at one time leaving you a little bubble of eyeliner. I do wish they had more of the black b/c that&#x27;s primarily the one I will use, but the other colors also look fantastic for a cute party look or to spice up your everyday makeup. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for someone who is into using just a hint of color in their daily make up routine. If you don&#x27;t, then maybe stick with another eyeliner since these are pretty vibrant.</li>
    <li> I liked this colors in picture but out of 8 , I am only happy with 3 colors - black, blue , brown</li>
    <li> These seem to hold up well.</li>
    <li> I love these... I bought another set for a gift... Amazing liquid eye liner!!:-)</li>
    <li> These eyeliners are perfect, I&#x27;m totally buying more.I&#x27;m very picky and I&#x27;ve never loved an eyeliner before but I absolutely love these.Seller was awesome too!</li>
    <li> I purchased these thinking how could this actually be so cheap - Would they be liquid dried up or once I apply it to my eyes the liquid dries and cracks off. I have been pleasantly surprised so far. There has been no cracking, smearing or peeling off  eyelids. The liquid stayed where it is supposed to all day long. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because I did have one of the ends of the brush looked as though it had been squashed like on a counter(each hair went a different way); otherwise, no allergies have arisen. The package arrived fairly quickly also.</li>
    <li> These are nice eyeliners but a little difficult to put on without getting on eyelashes. Not as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but they work well and I love the colors. Stay on all day and night.</li>
    <li> I love this make up everyone always gives me compliments makes my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliners. It stays put even in extreme times!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on but the colors are beautiful</li>
    <li> These eye liners go on nice and smoothly; the colors are vibrant.  However, I bought the set for the gold and green - the green tube looks like a nice pale green, but comes out as Turquoise - lots of blue undertones, which is too bad, since there are two other blues already in the set.</li>
    <li> I really love all the colors, and the liquid is not lumpy. It goes on smoothly on my eyelids and I have wore the black and dark brown so far, they do stay on all day plus I have rubbed my eyes at the end of the day. It didn&#x27;t even smug at all, I forgot I was wearing eyeliner. The delivery is fast and prompt, plus it keep the delivery as dated. The package is awesome, all the eyeliners were protected with a lot of bubble wrap and the box package.</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL. GOES ON GREAT GREAT COLORS BUT IT IS NOT WATER PROOF. I AM OLDER (66) AND MY EYES WATER AND THIS FORMULA BURNS MY EYES. DISSAPOINTED.</li>
    <li> so good, doesn&#x27;t smudge, last for long, looks great on eyes,&lt;br /&gt;and you can remove it simply by washing face</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and stays for a long time. The color selection is great.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner ever, it stays where you put it and stays on all day, in fact I purchased two more sets....</li>
    <li> I did not receive 8 liners but instead 2 mascaras and 6 liners. Also the the colors were different. When I contacted the seller I was completely ignored.</li>
    <li> Nothing about this product what accurate.</li>
    <li> While the colors are vivid and seem to be waterproof, these are not the colors in the package I received. The pack I received had neither brown or walnut (the one color I really wanted), instead a very vivid purple and a hot pink.  Very disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The variety is great.  The brushes are pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> I Love Them 😍 They are so Perfect 👍</li>
    <li> I ordered this exact set and absolutely love them! I have always struggles with eyeliners due to sensitive eyes. Not only does the formula not irritate my eyes the brush is a very nice, gentle brush that makes it very easy to put on unlike other liquid eye liners that have stiff brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving this four stars is because one, it is a pain to get off but when they put down waterproof they meant it! And two, I really want more colors with out having to buy mascara. :)</li>
    <li> I wanted something that truly was waterproof, they are not... the colors fade and smear off. The colors are vibrant and truly pigmented but they do not stay on.  I read the reviews and I do not see how they got such wonderful results. I always read the comments and make my decision based on the reviews.  I do not feel I got what was advertised with this product. I like the colors and will continue to use them and continue to reapply the product throughout the day like I have been doing with other eyeliners. That is what I was trying to avoid.  Unfortunately once again I go on another search for eyeliners that will stay on and not smear. This was an honest review of this product.</li>
