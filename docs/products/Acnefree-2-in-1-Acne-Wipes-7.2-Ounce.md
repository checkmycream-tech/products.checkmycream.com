      <li>I love these wipes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a  very effective  and much cheaper alternative  to the acne wipes the vet  sells.</li>
      <li>(Yes, my dr said this product is approved for use while pregnant!)</li>
      <li>Gets skin clean.</li>
      <li>This product is not as good as the actual soaps and lotions.</li>
      <li>I found that my oil absorbing sheets worked better, so I got rid of these towelettes.</li>
      <li>They work great and don&#x27;t clog my pores like a lot of other products do.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pregnant &amp; the hormones&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>Son said these were nice to have for quick face cleans after working out...but left him feeling like there was some residue.</li>
      <li>My son uses these on a pretty steady basis, although I believe if they were used exactly as intended they would perform much better.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, very reasonably priced and he likes using them after gym.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m in a rush first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t have a minute to wash my face, I&#x27;ll use one of these just to freshen up.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping that this controlled oil during the day, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>makes me feel like i should wash it off, unlike some other wipes out there that are more liquidy</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and this product works without too much irritation.</li>
      <li>i normally use two, one for the makeup and cleansing, and the second to juat make sure i got it all off, and there big not like tiny baby wipes!!!</li>
      <li>Gross smell, way too much product one each wipe that left a sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>Their products seem to be the only ones that my adult acne responds to.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little over a week however Im in love! I&#x27;m pregnant &amp; the hormones&lt;br /&gt;Have caused me severe acne...flash back to teenage years! (Yes, my dr said this product is approved for use while pregnant!) After only 3 days of using this product I began to see an improvement. The redness was dying down and you could see that the acne spots were drying out...but not the gross peeling skins like a snake drying out.</li>
    <li> My son uses these on a pretty steady basis, although I believe if they were used exactly as intended they would perform much better.  Can&#x27;t compare them to Proactiv or anything as I&#x27;ve never purchased them but I believe that these would probably be just as effective at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this product works without too much irritation.</li>
    <li> This is too soapy for my preferences.  makes me feel like i should wash it off, unlike some other wipes out there that are more liquidy (probably due to alcohol.......)</li>
    <li> I love these wipes.  If I&#x27;m in a rush first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t have a minute to wash my face, I&#x27;ll use one of these just to freshen up.  They work great and don&#x27;t clog my pores like a lot of other products do.  I am a big fan of the AcneFree line of products.  Their products seem to be the only ones that my adult acne responds to.</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as the actual soaps and lotions. I use this for traveling when I have long layovers. I would buy it again if its gets cheaper</li>
    <li> Son said these were nice to have for quick face cleans after working out...but left him feeling like there was some residue.</li>
    <li> These wipes work great! I use them on my doggie,  she gets black heads on her back and  these  wipes  get rid of them. It&#x27;s a  very effective  and much cheaper alternative  to the acne wipes the vet  sells.</li>
    <li> Awesome wipes! I use them when I&#x27;m leaving the gym</li>
    <li> Works great,im ordering a 6 pack of these,I use them while camping,and everyday at home.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this controlled oil during the day, but it really didn&#x27;t. I found that my oil absorbing sheets worked better, so I got rid of these towelettes.</li>
    <li> OMG I got these for my 12-year-old son who is starting puberty and getting pimples. I got it so he could take it to school and keep it in his locker at school. I was afraid he would be embarrassed to use them but it turns out all the other boys wanted one! So cute. Anyway, very reasonably priced and he likes using them after gym.</li>
    <li> Gets skin clean. Maybe not best for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Gross smell, way too much product one each wipe that left a sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> Great product I purchased for my daughter and it is working great. Follow the directions...it takes time for your face to look better.</li>
    <li> Convenient way to freshen up.  I&#x27;ve given this to my son to keep in his locker for use after gym.  Great for hot days.</li>
    <li> great for when your in a hurry or just too lazy to wash your face, removes makeup and the nasty stuff your face gathers throughout the day. i normally use two, one for the makeup and cleansing, and the second to juat make sure i got it all off, and there big not like tiny baby wipes!!!</li>
