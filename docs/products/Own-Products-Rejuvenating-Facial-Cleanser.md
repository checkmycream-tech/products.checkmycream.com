### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product worked best for me in the morning, since my face did not have makeup on it.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.</li>
      <li>It appears that they have changed the cap--and if so, that&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>This feels good and makes my face happy.</li>
      <li>so this was a pleasant suprise.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve loved it.  </li>
      <li>Does it put up a good fight against the forces of age?</li>
      <li>but, I&#x27;d still qualify it as a good cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It is a good quantity container</li>
      <li>It has good moisturizing and skin-conditioning abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having outlined the good points of this cleanser, I have to say that I would not buy it.  </li>
      <li>Using good stuff on your face...</li>
      <li>It has good moisturizing and skin-conditioning abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I experienced no breakouts, and really love the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>Just started using it, it does make your face pretty oily...but hoping for great results!</li>
      <li>Non-alcohol toners are equally effective for me and more pleasant to use.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Own face cleanser with my Clarisonic scrubber.  </li>
      <li>If you want to maximize the exfoliation results using this Own cleanser, you should leave it on your skin for one or two minutes before washing it all off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It effectively removes all of my make up, including my eye make up.</li>
      <li>Since this Own product says that it is both vegan and not tested on animals, I assume that the stearic acid used in this product is derived from plant sources and not from animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never heard of the OWN products before this</li>
      <li>It really is nice.</li>
      <li>It is also unscented which is also nice.  </li>
      <li>இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I was nervous when I decided to test Own for a week, but it was all for naught.  </li>
      <li>If you want to maximize the exfoliation results using this Own cleanser, you should leave it on your skin for one or two minutes before washing it all off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its nice to have a 2 in 1, wash n shave.</li>
      <li>but this one was nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>This is a nice, creamy and sudsy face cleanser.  </li>
      <li>non-foaming gel cleanser has a buttery smooth creamy consistency that feels very nice on the skin.  </li>
      <li>This Own cleanser consists of 24 ingredients, which is three times more than Cetaphil&#x27;s 8 ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Nice creamy feeling on your face-not greasy or oily like so many of them.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly in the morning, but when I tried it at night to remove makeup, it was effective.  </li>
      <li>That is very important to me.</li>
      <li>This product spreads out more like a lotion than a soap or shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Since this cleanser is \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;, I presume that the allantoin used here comes from the comfrey plant :-)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-foaming, is scent-free, but is just ok at cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Allantoin can be derived from either botanical extracts of the comfrey plant or the urine of most mammals.  </li>
      <li>Since this cleanser is \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;, I presume that the allantoin used here comes from the comfrey plant :-)  </li>
      <li>as most skin cleansers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Methylparaben is used as a preservative in many cosmetics.  </li>

      <li>Allantoin can be derived from either botanical extracts of the comfrey plant or the urine of most mammals.  </li>
      <li>I have reactive skin and was pleased that I ended up with no rashes or redness from this</li>
      <li>but they must have had too many orders from using Groupon-like sites too frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The top doesnt appear to be broken--i think its more of a design flaw.  </li>
      <li>May work better for others</li>
      <li>yet this product has a longer ingredients list than most.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
      <li>This face wash is very rich and luxurious.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which may be appealing for many consumers.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel very clean after using it...</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m breaking out pretty good.  </li>
      <li>But for the price, this is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product, removes all makeup, including mascara, and leaves my skin soft and not at all greasy.</li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip-top lid and the stand-on-the-lid design are great for storage and for those half-asleep early morning showers.</li>
      <li>I have found much better products available.</li>
      <li>The product lacks microbeads, which are actually tiny pieces of plastic and incredibly harmful to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>Because this cleanser does not rinse off as easily, it is probably easier to rinse off in the shower instead of standing over the sink.  </li>
      <li>When used in skin care products, MAP is actually more effective than straight vitamin C in functions of UV protection and repair, collagen production, skin lightening and brightening, and as an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>but so far all has been good</li>
      <li>The Own Products Facial Cleaner is an effective nightly face wash.</li>
      <li>However, after using Accutane, my skin is very dry, so a gentle cleanser is ideal and there aren&#x27;t many that are this</li>
      <li>Own&#x27;s Anti-Aging products\\&quot; and I am only using the cleanser, but I just can&#x27;t see myself buying the whole line if the cleanser doesn&#x27;t even meet my expectations of what a good cleanser should do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a rich, creamy cleanser</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find this cleanser to be anything I was excited about.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, but still leaves you feeling very clean.  </li>
      <li>It is not my wife&#x27;s favorite night time wash, but it is an effective night time facial</li>
      <li>my face does have a scrubbed, tingling feel to it and looks clean.  </li>
      <li>I love OWN&#x27;s rejuvenation facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It does not contain added fragrance, but it does have a scent, and that scent does not smell clean to me.  </li>
      <li>Sodium lauryl sulfate is excellent at dissolving oils, so it is also frequently used in laundry detergents along with uses in various industrial cleansers, and it is used as a degreaser on car engines.  </li>
      <li>First, the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the product is vegan so that alleviates a personal concern with most beauty products</li>
      <li>Unlike many milky or cream cleansers, it rinses off effectively with water, yet unlike most water-rinse cleansers, it is very gentle to my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE how gentle this facewash feels.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>The product does have a nice, soft, lotion like consistency.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The thing that stood out immediately about Own Rejuvenating Facial Cleanser was its scent. It has none. Certainly, whatever scent there is was not detectable to me. That&#x27;s fine. Better no scent than an unpleasant one. As for its more practical qualities, this seems to clean the skin well enough though no better than a lot of other products. There&#x27;s a slightly grainy texture, but very, very slight. My skin seemed a little dry after using, but since my skin tends to be oily, that&#x27;s a point in its favor. The other claims, like the claims made by all such products, are ones I can&#x27;t comment on. Does it \\&quot;rejuvenate\\&quot; the skin? Does it put up a good fight against the forces of age? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;ll give this a passing grade though, personally, I doubt I would buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for 3 weeks and found it to be non drying. It effectively removes all of my make up, including my eye make up. My skin feels clean, fresh and no overly dry, which can be a problem for me as I have needed to use acne products lately. I&#x27;d purchase this again and recommend it to others with combination skin.</li>
    <li> This product is everything I want and nothing I don&#x27;t......I need a face cleanser that is not abrasive or harsh and has no added fragrance. This cleanser is exactly that. A small amount is just enough to remove make up and clean the face without stripping it. I have reactive skin and was pleased that I ended up with no rashes or redness from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container sits on its end cap and is sturdy enough to not get knocked over in my busy bathroom. I also like the design as it ensures that you get a gravity assist to get every bit of product over its lifetime. It is a good quantity container and I estimate I&#x27;ll get a couple months of use from one tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d higly recommed this product to those who are looking for a daily face wash that is gentle, fragrance free and thorough.</li>
    <li> I liked this prodcut very much. I have never heard of the OWN products before this so this was a pleasant suprise. Nice creamy feeling on your face-not greasy or oily like so many of them. Some of these products are rough on my skin like they are cleaning something with a brill pad but this one was nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will look at some of the other OWN products in the future!</li>
    <li> The Own Products Facial cleaner is an effective way to deep clean your face. My wife has used it for several nights and while she likes it - it is not quite her favorite facial cleaner. After nightly washing her face feels healthy, clean, but not dry. The only issue that she has is that it is difficult to get completely rinsed off her face - it takes multiple rinses before it is completely rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Non-irritating or non-dryng&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No aroma or fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Deep cleansing removes all make-up and oil from your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Takes several rinses to wash off - probably the biggest drawback is that it does take awhile to completely rinse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict - The Own Products Facial Cleaner is an effective nightly face wash. It is not my wife&#x27;s favorite night time wash, but it is an effective night time facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars</li>
    <li> First, the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the product is vegan so that alleviates a personal concern with most beauty products&lt;br /&gt;2) The product lacks microbeads, which are actually tiny pieces of plastic and incredibly harmful to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;3) The product is easy to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;4) The product lacks a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do not like:&lt;br /&gt;1) The packaging is not very recyclable in many communities.  In many places, a #1 or #2 plastic is the most readily recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t clean very well.  I have to really scrub my face to remove makeup when I use this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;3) It takes a bit of time to remove all the product from one&#x27;s face, and even when it is removed there is usually makeup left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a fine product.  I likely would not opt for this though if given the choice between it and something like Cetaphil, which cleans better and comes in a recyclable container.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, creamy and sudsy face cleanser.  It leaves the face soft, but I do not like the scent of the product.  It smells like glue.  For that, it does turn me off from wanting to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF they can adjust the product&#x27;s scent, it would be a better facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I would say that this is a pretty average facial cleanser.  It has a little bit of exfoliating action, but not a ton.  It is unscented, but in reality that means that it just comes out of the container smelling like the tube (rubbery/plasticy?)  It cleaned my face on par with the product I had been using previously and I didn&#x27;t notice any of the drying out effects that a couple of other people have mentioned.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cleanser is White Knight, and Own&#x27;s facial cleanser has some nice similarities for a lower price.  As with White Knight, it is targeted at people with sensitive skin and has no harsh chemicals.  It may even be too gentle for a lot of people, and might lead to more acne in some skin types.  However, after using Accutane, my skin is very dry, so a gentle cleanser is ideal and there aren&#x27;t many that are this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is one area where White Knight easily wins, though I don&#x27;t see this as critical.  Rejuvinating Facial Cleanser smells kind of like glue.  It is surprisingly strong in use, but doesn&#x27;t linger or hurt my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Own facial cleanser is a great product for sensitive skin that I look forward to using more of in the future.</li>
    <li> I used it several days. It didn&#x27;t do me any hard but I couldn&#x27;t really feel or see any change in my skin. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not great. May work better for others but I really didn&#x27;t notice anything.</li>
    <li> I like that this facial cleanser doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance or parabens or sulfates. It is also not tested on animals which is a must for any beauty or cleaning or beauty product that I buy. It also contains lots of natural ingredients, most of which I recognized.  It lathered pretty well and felt creamy on my face, but it took a little more scrubbing than most products to remove make-up that I had on all day.  It was a little difficult to rinse clean, so I would more likely use it in the shower than at the sink. But after using it for about a week, my skin didn&#x27;t look any younger, it looked the same as if I&#x27;d used soap and water. Perhaps if I use it for a longer time, it will produce results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to compare this facial cleanser to Cetaphil because it is fragrance free, non-soapy and designed for sensitive skin. I think it is slightly harsher than Cetaphil, however, and for this reason I actually like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil is wonderfully gentle, but often leaves skin feeling unrefreshed. This cleanser is nearly as gentle, but surprisingly more refreshing. It still leaves the skin soft and not completely stripped of all moisture, but you feel more that the dirt has left your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks, I was waiting for my sensitive skin to develop some kind of irritation or adverse reaction to the cleanser but so far all has been good and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems. No sudden break outs or unusual reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this cleanser. I appreciate the fact that it is void of fragrance and other unnecessary ingredients which can irritate sensitive skin. I like the way it feels on my face and that it washes away easily. I don&#x27;t really have any major critiques, except maybe that the texture is a little too creamy/lotiony for my taste, but it hasn&#x27;t kept me from using it daily. I can easily give it a solid recommendation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this cleanser to be sufficient for daily washing.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which may be appealing for many consumers.  As a man, I often like to use my facial cleanser for double-duty as a sort of shaving gel.  With this, the soap is somewhat thin in texture, so less ideal for that purpose.  (Not fair to judge the product for that use, obviously, since they don&#x27;t sell it on that.  But this is my personal review, so I&#x27;ll let you know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t have any negatives about this cleanser.  It&#x27;s not one of my favorites, though.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and it does a good job at keeping my complexion clear.  Even at 41 I still break out...no matter what I do it seems I can&#x27;t ever get the break outs to quit.  I stopped taking fish oil and it helped.  Using good stuff on your face...helps...trust me.</li>
    <li> In middle age I have developed a problem that my dermatologist says may be rosacea or simply adult acne.  Unfortunately after using this facial cleanser for a few days I had a flair up of this skin condition that plagues me from time to time.  I can&#x27;t say for sure it was related to use of this product as I have had skin problems many times before but I am not taking the risk of using it again.</li>
    <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;փ Positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;փ This cleanser has an interesting, and complex, blend of cleansers with moisturizers and skin conditioning agents.&lt;br /&gt;փ This skin care product is free of animal testing, parabens, retinol, fragrances, sulfates, and GMO ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;փ This cleanser is vegan, which means that its ingredients are not derived from animal sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ჯ Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ჯ Perhaps due to its complex blend of oils and fatty acids, this cleanser does not rinse off as easily as most skin cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;ჯ This product contains phenoxyethanol, which can have worse side effects than the use of parabens.&lt;br /&gt;ჯ On a per-fluid-ounce basis, this is far more expensive than most facial/skin cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This non-foaming gel cleanser has a buttery smooth creamy consistency that feels very nice on the skin.  Even though foaming does not improve a cleanser&#x27;s cleaning effectiveness, some people prefer more of a foaming lathering action in their cleansers.  This product spreads out more like a lotion than a soap or shampoo.  While everyone&#x27;s skin chemistry can differ, I felt no irritation, rash, or redness after using this cleanser on my face for the past few weeks.  Except for maybe some really simple old-fashioned soaps made out of lard, lye, and water, all modern cosmetics and skin/hair care products can cause side effects in different people.  So the proverbial \\&quot;your mileage may vary\\&quot; disclaimer applies here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is natural to compare this Own cleanser to Cetaphil since Cetaphil has been on the market far longer.  This Own cleanser consists of 24 ingredients, which is three times more than Cetaphil&#x27;s 8 ingredients.  Cetaphil&#x27;s eight ingredients are: water, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben.  Three of Cetaphil&#x27;s ingredients are parabens.  Parabens can cause dermatitis and rosacea in people who are sensitive or allergic to these compounds.  If skin that is coated with methylparaben is exposed to ultraviolet light (e.g. UVB from sunlight), the methylparaben can react with UV rays to increase the rate of cellular death, DNA damage, skin aging, and overall skin damage.  Methylparaben is used as a preservative in many cosmetics.  The sodium lauryl sulfate in Cetaphil has a cleansing action in removing the oils from your skin.  Sodium lauryl sulfate is excellent at dissolving oils, so it is also frequently used in laundry detergents along with uses in various industrial cleansers, and it is used as a degreaser on car engines.  However, its degreasing effectiveness can also make it too harsh for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a brief description of each of the 24 ingredients in this Own facial cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Water: The main fluid in which all 23 other ingredients are mixed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Cetearyl Alcohol: A blend of Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol, this emulsifies and adds creaminess to the blend, and since it improves moisture retention, it is often used in hair conditioners.  Cetaphil labels this as two separate ingredients of Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Glycerin: Frequently added to moisturizer products, and like the propylene glycol used in Cetaphil, it acts as a humectant to help absorb and retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride: Like Cetearyl Alcohol, this is also derived from coconut oil.  It is considered an excellent emollient and skin-repairing ingredient in cosmetics due to its mix of fatty acids that skin can utilize to repair its surface and resist moisture loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil: Safflower oil is commonly used in foods and cooking, and it has excellent nutritional value due to its high content of linoleic acid.  When used on skin, it acts as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Cetearyl Olivate / Sorbitan Olivate: Both Cetearyl Olivate and Sorbitan Olivate are derived from olive oil, and they help to moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Glyceryl Stearate: An emulsifier derived from vegetable oils, it helps to soften and moisturize skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Lauryl Glucoside / Cetearyl Glucoside / Decyl Glucoside: All three of these glucosides are mild surfactants derived from plants that function as cleansers in this blend.  A \\&quot;surfactant\\&quot; is a compound that is often used in soaps and detergents because it can help dissolve and separate oil, dirt, and proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Stearic Acid: A powerful surfactant with a strong cleansing action, it also acts as an emulsifier to keep everything blended in this mix of ingredients.  Stearic acid sources can come from either natural oils like palm, coconut, and butters, or it can come from animal fat, such as the fat from cows, sheep, pigs, and euthanized dogs and cats.  Since this Own product says that it is both vegan and not tested on animals, I assume that the stearic acid used in this product is derived from plant sources and not from animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Glycolic Acid: Acting as a mild exfoliant, glycolic acid works by breaking down substances that bond dead skin cells beneath the top layer of skin.  Dead skin cells, which contribute to clogged pores and dull skin, can then be rinsed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil: Jojoba oil is extracted from seeds of a desert shrub that is native to California.  It is a waxy oil that is easily absorbed into the skin to help soften skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Tocopherol: A form of vitamin E, this is sometimes included in skin moisturizers and sunscreens.  However, it is debatable as to how useful tocopherol is when applied to the skin since it can be destroyed by exposure to the UV rays of sunlight.  When used as a facial cleanser, some tocopherol may be absorbed into your sebaceous glands before they are later released into your skin as part of your skin oil secretions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate: This interesting compound can be absorbed into your skin where it is converted into vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid).  When used in skin care products, MAP is actually more effective than straight vitamin C in functions of UV protection and repair, collagen production, skin lightening and brightening, and as an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Hydroxyethylcellulose: Derived from cellulose, this is added to give the cleanser a thicker gel consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Allantoin: Allantoin can be derived from either botanical extracts of the comfrey plant or the urine of most mammals.  Since this cleanser is \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;, I presume that the allantoin used here comes from the comfrey plant :-)  It has good moisturizing and skin-conditioning abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Sodium PCA: An amino acid derivative, sodium PCA is very hygroscopic, attracting moisture from the air. It imparts a moist feeling to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Sodium Hydroxide: Also known as lye, it is used in its concentrated form to make soap and dissolve through clogged drains.  But since sodium hydroxide is extremely alkaline, I suspect that it is added to this cleanser to adjust the pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Panthenol: A derivative of vitamin B5, it has humectant, emollient, and moisturizer properties.  It is often used in hair shampoos and conditioners because it quickly coats the entire hair shaft and seals the hair.  In this facial cleanser, it functions to improve the skin&#x27;s hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter): A fat that is extracted from the African shea tree, it has multiple uses in skin care products, acting as an emollient and moisturizer to protect and repair skin, and to improve the elasticity and suppleness of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Ethylhexylglycerin: Derived from glycerin, this is often used as an alternative to parabens.  Its surfactant properties allow it function as both a skin cleanser and conditioner.  It can be a skin irritant for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;₪ Phenoxyethanol: Although this is sometimes used as a preservative in skin care products as a supposedly safer alternative to parabens, this phenoxyethanol is, by far, the most suspect and controversial ingredient used in this facial cleanser.  Phenoxyethanol has been proven to be a skin irritant that can cause contact dermatitis and worsen eczema in humans.  Previous research has also shown that phenoxyethanol can cause various problems in the nervous, endocrine, and reproductive systems of animals.  In 2008, the FDA issued a product recall alert about a \\&quot;Mommy&#x27;s Bliss Nipple Cream\\&quot; that contained phenoxyethanol and the FDA warned that the phenoxyethanol \\&quot;can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration in infants.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many skin care products contain fragrances that can be either too strong or prone to causing allergic reactions.  Like Cetaphil, this cleanser is fragrance-free.  This cleanser lotion is gluten-free.  Even though gluten cannot be absorbed through the skin, the use of gluten or wheat products in cosmetics or skin care products can present a problem for people who have who have celiac disease or gluten intolerance if the product is swallowed.  And since this is a facial cleanser, there is tiny possibility that you could be too vigorous in massaging the cleanser on your face so that some enters inside your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is advertised to \\&quot;gently exfoliate\\&quot;, but the exfoliating effects of its glycolic acid ingredient are really subtle.  If you want to gently strip off more dead skin cells from the surface of your skin, there are various brands of microdermabrasion kits that combine a battery-operated brush scrubber with a gritty cream to perform gentle exfoliation on your face where the result may be more noticeable.  Stronger over-the-counter glycolic acid exfoliation treatments may contain a higher 10% concentration of glycolic acid.  Clinics offer chemical peels using 30%, 50%, or 70% concentrations of glycolic acid, along with other stronger chemical peels.  This Own cleanser likely uses a very mild glycolic acid concentration.  If you want to maximize the exfoliation results using this Own cleanser, you should leave it on your skin for one or two minutes before washing it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;௫ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good facial cleanser.  I would have really preferred that this cleanser did not contain phenoxyethanol, which can cause various adverse skin reactions in humans and can potentially have more toxic side effects.  I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because it does not seem to totally rinse off as cleanly as Cetaphil and many other skin cleansers.  To me, a skin cleanser should be like a hair shampoo in that they should both rinse off without leaving a residue, whereas a skin moisturizer is like a hair conditioner in that they both leave a residue or coating to serve their purpose.  Because this cleanser does not rinse off as easily, it is probably easier to rinse off in the shower instead of standing over the sink.  I tried taking a clean washcloth into the shower and using the wet washcloth to wipe my face more, and that helped to expedite the rinsing and cleaning.  But perhaps this Own cleanser uses such a complex mixture of cleansers combined with moisturizers and oils, it is like washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner at the same time: your hair does not wash and rinse as cleanly when shampoo and conditioner are combined together.  This Own cleanser is also currently four times more expensive than Cetaphil, currently priced at $2.40 per fluid ounce compared to 60 to 65 cents per fluid ounce for Cetaphil. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate: This interesting compound can be absorbed into your skin where it is converted into vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid).

    <li> I love this stuff. My face hasn&#x27;t been cleaner in years.  It doesn&#x27;t suds up but that it apart of its beauty.  I just wish they hadn&#x27;t gone out of business.  I&#x27;m stockpiling!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and needed a good cleanser. I was hooked on Terralina but they must have had too many orders from using Groupon-like sites too frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, removes all makeup, including mascara, and leaves my skin soft and not at all greasy. It is not at all irritating and has a slight, clean fragrance. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Own face cleanser with my Clarisonic scrubber.  I was initially using Olay but it made my face red afterwards.  This feels good and makes my face happy.</li>
    <li> It appears that they have changed the cap--and if so, that&#x27;s great. The flip top doesnt quite work and when I stand it up, the product spills out and makes a mess.  The top doesnt appear to be broken--i think its more of a design flaw.  But the cleanser itself is fine.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s mild and doesn&#x27;t foam (isn&#x27;t drying).  However, the texture is a little too close to a shower gel, meaning that it&#x27;s a bit too gel-like and too thick (hard to rub in).  I prefer Kiehl&#x27;s cleansing milk.  But for the price, this is a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I usually do not have sensitive skin, but this product made my face super sensitive after using it to the point it felt that much of my face was burning. I used it again and almost had an equal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally do not leave negative reviews, but so far I have not have a good experience with using this product, and I will not use it again it showed me twice that it did not agree with my skin.</li>
    <li> The Own Rejuvenating Facial Cleanser has a creamy texture to it. My face usually works better with a foam cleanser, so I was skeptical about this product at first. This product worked best for me in the morning, since my face did not have makeup on it. When I used it to wash off my makeup, I had to wash my face 2 times to completely remove the residue.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.Fast shipping.Ty</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser every morning.  It is light &amp; creamy without being greasy.  It has almost no smell, which I like.  The all natural ingredients help me feel like I&#x27;m doing something healthy for my skin vs. starting my day by putting chemicals on.  I also think the price point is a great value - making an all natural, everyday cleanser affordable.</li>
    <li> My old skin looks even older than it is, due to many years of unprotected exposure to the California sun.  Hence my interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blurb talks of other products with \\&quot;lists of unrecognizable toxic and harsh ingredients\\&quot; yet this product has a longer ingredients list than most.  Like many such products, it contains glycolic acid which, due to its ability to penetrate skin, acts as a defoliant, and that is really the key to what it does in terms of &#x27;anti-aging&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A distinguishing feature of this product is that it leaves the skin less dry.  With other products, you need to apply a lot of moisturizer immediately after use.  I have to say I still did apply some, but not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How your skin reacts to it is entirely an individual matter.  For some people, this - and similar products - will produce a quite painful burning reaction.  Other people will have no such reaction.  So don&#x27;t base your buying decision on what reviewers say about their skin&#x27;s reaction - you don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;ll react until you try it.  Note also that your skin might well get used to it after a few uses, so don&#x27;t let a mildly adverse reaction put you off too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give a definitive judgment of how good an exfoliate it is, but I can say it is an effective cleanser.  Try it if you prefer a lotion to an oil or foam, and if you like the idea of it incorporating moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very soft and creamy.  I use it after my makeup has been removed.  I&#x27;m not sure how well it actually works since my face is clean to begin with.  It is a lot nicer than other products out there.</li>
    <li> I am always on the search for a better facial cleanser, especially since I have sensitive skin that dries out fairly quickly in certain spots. I was intrigued to try this cleanser out. I have been using a sephora cleanser that works very well in cleaning without drying out my skin (or making it worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really has no scent - think of the non-smell of cetaphil, and you know what the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; reminded me of. It&#x27;s very creamy, and reminds me of lotion. It reminds me so much of cetaphil, to be honest. It feels strange washing with it, but feels like it rinses clean with no lotion feeling left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out for a three days before I started noticing whiteheads all over my forehead. I had changed nothing else about my skincare routine, and so I know it was this cleanser that was causing the problems. I have had this happen with products containing retinol before, though I don&#x27;t know that this has retinol in it, I suspect it does because of the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; claims. If you&#x27;ve had problems with retinol irritating your skin, then I would recommend against buying this. If you don&#x27;t like the feel of lotion-y cleansers that do not soap up, I would recommend against this.</li>
    <li> It seems to be cleansing without causing dryness, which is a plus since that&#x27;s a problem I experience often. And it actually removes make-up well with just one wash. I tested this by applying a face pad afterwards, which showed very little color/remnants overall. And I wear heavy foundation too, so that&#x27;s saying something (hand soaps don&#x27;t even remove the base from my fingers in a couple of rinses). Also I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts so far, which sometimes happens to me with new products since I have such sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> First off, I liked that this cleanser at no time felt heavy on my skin or left a residue behind after rinsing. My skin is extremely sensitive and while it did not burn, it did leave my face redder than a cleanser should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t feel like it exfoliated or cleansed my skin. You know that fresh feeling you get after a good face washing, where you feel the grim has been cleansed away. That didn&#x27;t happen with this cleanser. I know it claims to be anti-aging but I actually had more lines after using it. I think it dried my face out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out smooth, not heavy like a lot of cleansers but it doesn&#x27;t quite foam up like the back of the package says it should. If you have really dry skin, like I do, I don&#x27;t think this cleanser is for you either. It is not sensitive enough to use every other day and like I said up above, it dries out skin quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I use a variety of cleansers, I immediately follow them with lotion. Lotion specifically for dry skin and sensitive skin alike. Even after putting these moisturizers on, I still had lines and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess, this cleanser was probably created for oily skin types.</li>
    <li> I love OWN&#x27;s rejuvenation facial cleanser.  I keep it in the shower so it&#x27;s easy to use and does not take long to do.  My skin is tight and super clean after each use.  Try it!!</li>
    <li> I requested this as a vine product.  I&#x27;m 34, and I&#x27;m starting to get more fine lines and wrinkles, particularly around my lips and on my forehead.  So, anti aging products interest me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for around 20 days.  I need to get the review done since it is vine, but I will need to provide an update to give a final say on results after a longer use period.  For starters, I don&#x27;t like the smell.  Still, its not unbearable and pretty standard for these products.  The product does have a nice, soft, lotion like consistency.  I do like how it massages into the face.  Once I remove it...my face does have a scrubbed, tingling feel to it and looks clean.  Also, a little amount goes a long way so I still have quite a bit left of the tube.  I bet this will last me three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin...but, I&#x27;d still qualify it as a good cleanser.  Also, I&#x27;m breaking out pretty good.  It is common for my skin to do this though in response to a new product and generally stops after a month.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the non-foaming quality of this scrub.  It dried my skin out some and didn&#x27;t really do much to exfoliate.  I have found much better products available.</li>
    <li> I started just washing my face with this face wash, but now I&#x27;m shaving with it! Its nice to have a 2 in 1, wash n shave.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I&#x27;ve loved it.  It is so gentle to my skin.  With this cleaner, after I wash my face I feel clean and NOT dried out.  It really is nice.</li>
    <li> Pretty good cleanser - the caps are poorly made though. That&#x27;s a problem because the bottle faces downward.</li>
    <li> For starters, I have VERY sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and still deal with the occasional breakout if I alter my skin routine in just the smallest way.  So I was nervous when I decided to test Own for a week, but it was all for naught.  I experienced no breakouts, and really love the way this makes my skin feel.  It&#x27;s very gentle, but still leaves you feeling very clean.  There&#x27;s a grainy texture to the scrub, but it&#x27;s not nearly so harsh as a typical exfoliant.  I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-aging factors, and I do dock it one star for the rather pricey cost (comparatively speaking), but I would still recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I LOVE how gentle this facewash feels. It&#x27;s super luxurious. It smells pleasant,but natural. My only complaint is that I&#x27;m not always 100% sure I got all the residue off b/c of how creamy it is.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser first and foremost because it is vegan, and thus, cruelty free. That is very important to me. Secondly, it actually works, so you can&#x27;t go wrong :) It&#x27;s a rich, creamy cleanser and it is scent free. My only complaint is that even as a scent free cleanser, it has a smell that I don&#x27;t really care for, faint though it may be. Perhaps I am just too used to sented products.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and this cleanser is mild enough not to exacerbate that problem, but strong enough to clean my face without drying it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. It&#x27;s vegan and it works. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is notable partly for what it is not:  not greasy, not drying, not perfumed, not overpriced.  Unlike many milky or cream cleansers, it rinses off effectively with water, yet unlike most water-rinse cleansers, it is very gentle to my dry skin.  I use it mostly in the morning, but when I tried it at night to remove makeup, it was effective.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and I use a separate eye makeup remover for mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; or exfoliating properties that I can detect.  That is okay with me, but I think the manufacturer could build more customer trust without making those claims.  My skin is super-sensitive to chemical exfoliation (acids vs. scrubs), and this product causes zero irritation or peeling for me.  It contains glycolic acid, but the cleanser is not meant to stay on skin for any length of time. A separate treatment product is probably the way to go if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip-top lid and the stand-on-the-lid design are great for storage and for those half-asleep early morning showers. Given the size of the container and the small amount needed for each use, this cleanser is a pretty good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having outlined the good points of this cleanser, I have to say that I would not buy it.  Non-alcohol toners are equally effective for me and more pleasant to use.  I don&#x27;t like the scent of this product.  It does not contain added fragrance, but it does have a scent, and that scent does not smell clean to me.  That&#x27;s a personal preference, though, and for many people, this cleanser might be just right.</li>
    <li> This face wash is very rich and luxurious.  It is also unscented which is also nice.  Reminds me of the old Phisoderm face wash I used in my early teens minus the telltale scent.  Does not dry out my skin like other products.  Enjoy this very much.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, it does make your face pretty oily...but hoping for great results!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this cleanser to be anything I was excited about.  It&#x27;s non-foaming, is scent-free, but is just ok at cleaning.  I don&#x27;t feel very clean after using it... and with other cleansers I have used, I could tell my face was clean and all the makeup / oil / etc. gone... this one just doesn&#x27;t give me that feeling after I use it.  I have really sensitive skin, so I will say a plus is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to break a rash out on my skin like some cleansers have - and I would probably give the credit to the fact that this cleanser doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals.  The description of this product says \\&quot;Maximize results when combined with Own&#x27;s Anti-Aging products\\&quot; and I am only using the cleanser, but I just can&#x27;t see myself buying the whole line if the cleanser doesn&#x27;t even meet my expectations of what a good cleanser should do.  It claims to exfoliate, but I could not feel a difference in my dry skin areas - I had to follow up with a different exfoliating product.</li>
