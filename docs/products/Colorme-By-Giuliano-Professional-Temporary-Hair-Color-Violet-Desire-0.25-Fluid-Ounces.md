      <li>Through this Amazon vendor it arrived in a timely fashion,  and it was nice to have no shipping fees.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it at all, although the color was so nice - a shame that when I tried to brush my hair it just clumped together and was not as smooth/flowing as the parts which were not colored.  </li>
      <li>and I was kind of worry that the purple won&#x27;t show through.</li>

      <li>I knew the color wouldn&#x27;t be very bright since my hair is dark, but I can&#x27;t see any color at all unless I stand under a very bright light and lean close to the mirror.  </li>
      <li>My 4-year-old son thinks the more the better - something about rainbows.  </li>

      <li>Returned easily.</li>
      <li>I like that this color shampoos out and the mascara brush was easy to use.  </li>

      <li>It is a LOT of fun and looks a lot better than the &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; we have tried before.  </li>
      <li>and it helps me always look freshly dyed :)</li>
      <li>It washes out great and never leaves any trace of color on my blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and fun to put around the face when doing her hair in the morning before school etc...</li>
      <li>I could ply with purple highlights easily and have results that were really complimentary.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much that I also bought it in Fuschia Phenom.</li>
      <li>just trying to be fun and not a punk rocker).  </li>
      <li>I bought this to put streaks in my blonde hair and really liked the pigment and the ease of application.  </li>
      <li>This lets me experiment and have fun and then wash it out.</li>
      <li>You do get some on your hands, but all you have to do is wash your hands with soap and water and it comes right out of your skin.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to this product, I can add some myself, for a fraction of the cost, and they wash right out in the shower after just one use!</li>
      <li>It is a quick and easy way to add zing to you hair withhout going through major stripping and damage in the salon.</li>
      <li>It probably won&#x27;t be a problem for healthy natural blonde hair or brown hair, but bleached hair tends to absorb more pigments.  </li>
      <li>Good product to add a little color temporarily.  </li>
      <li>and I could brush through it \\&quot;big sexy hair\\</li>
      <li>I used to dye my hair fun colors in high school using another company (semi-perm).  </li>
      <li>If you have brown hair - even light brown - it barely shows up.  </li>
      <li>After seeing this very see product being sold in a salon in Canada for $15 plus tax (and not even having this colour, which I want), I decided to buy it on Amazon and give it a try.</li>
      <li>I dyed my whole head</li>
      <li>and there, they really make my hair pop.</li>
      <li>It made my hair very sticky, clumpy feeling.  </li>
      <li>Even the part that is gray didn&#x27;t really take the color.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think there is that much product in the tube</li>
      <li>Will surely try other colours.</li>
      <li>It shows surprisingly well on dark hair but probably not as well as say red or fuschia.</li>
      <li>I would not suggest this product for very damaged hair unless your ok with some slight staining.  </li>
      <li>It is so super simple to use</li>
      <li>This color, while a nice Caribbean blue, is a little too intense for me.</li>
      <li>While I think this product is a great idea, it turned out that the purple color I chose is not bright enough to stand out on my medium-brown hair.</li>
      <li>Still, I liked the product well enough that in the future I may order a different color.</li>
      <li>(I live in a humid climate, so</li>
      <li>Completely temporary, it washes out easily and without the smell or chemicals of other temporary solutions.</li>
      <li>I have used it in the past and love the product.</li>
      <li>At the least, it was nice to get a preview of what my hair will likely look like if I try to dye the whole thing purple.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work at all on my brown hair, and made a huge mess of my hair and my fingers.</li>
      <li>I decided to go with my old hair coloring in purple....</li>
      <li>Not messy like sprays.</li>
      <li>It goes on like a mascara (like a paint) and covers completely.</li>
      <li>I have medium chestnut brown hair, and was surprised to see that the purple showed up quite well in my hair, without lightening it beforehand.</li>
      <li>Wherever there is purple the hair is completely bleached out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive hair mascara from sephora and this works MUCH better for half the price.</li>
      <li>I love putting different colors on small pieces of hair.</li>
      <li>I wet my hair and applied it on just one side of my middle part and the color looks super.  </li>
      <li>Be careful if it is raining or if hot</li>
      <li>At the ends of my extremely dry damaged hair I would get some slight pink stains that would not wash out, but I personally really liked how it looked.  </li>
      <li>This is super messy and just makes your hair crusty.  </li>
      <li>Worked great when hairdresser used it but the sample I received from the company wouldn&#x27;t apply ... had to use an alternative product instead - hopefully just a bad batch.  </li>
      <li>If you are not careful when you apply it, the color can get all over your fingers, etc.</li>
      <li>stuff might be fun if you have pale hair and just want to streak a lock of hair by your face.  </li>
      <li>It is probably easier to do on straight hair, (I have thick, wavy hair), but I have done it on both my flatironed hair and my natural hair texture, before putting it up in a high bun, and both ways work well.</li>
      <li>Not long after I purchased this</li>
      <li>I am African American, with natural (not chemically straightened) hair that I use a flat tool to straighten when it dries.  </li>
      <li>The color is very vibrant on my black hair after I apply it twice over the same place.</li>
      <li>This applies like mascara, you control as little or as much as you want to put on.</li>
      <li>little more permanent but at least once I straighten my hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We got the Violet, Fuschia, and Blue.  It is a LOT of fun and looks a lot better than the &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; we have tried before.  To get it on even and to keep it to the strands of hair we want, I wind up having my fingers in there.  They tend to stain for a few hours (I suppose I could wear plastic gloves).  It looks great for 1-2 days.  Fades dramatically after one hair wash and gone with the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 7-year-old daughter likes me to color a small amount and then braid it.  My 4-year-old son thinks the more the better - something about rainbows.  I may use some for Halloween for myself.</li>
    <li> These are great, easy to use and fun! I have platinum hair and applied here and there, they really make my hair pop. This color, while a nice Caribbean blue, is a little too intense for me. I should have chosen a deeper blue. I&#x27;d like a wardrobe of these!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to add some colored highlights to my hair, but I am too scared to make a full-time commitment by having my hairdresser do it for me. Thanks to this product, I can add some myself, for a fraction of the cost, and they wash right out in the shower after just one use! I have medium chestnut brown hair, and was surprised to see that the purple showed up quite well in my hair, without lightening it beforehand. It is probably easier to do on straight hair, (I have thick, wavy hair), but I have done it on both my flatironed hair and my natural hair texture, before putting it up in a high bun, and both ways work well. I love this product so much that I also bought it in Fuschia Phenom. Great seller, great price, fast shipping. I would definately purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Yuck! My hair felt like straw and I could brush through it \\&quot;big sexy hair\\&quot; makes a better product .. Just yuck! A bad trend</li>
    <li> I obviously have a different view of this product than other customers, and maybe it is my hair type.  I am African American, with natural (not chemically straightened) hair that I use a flat tool to straighten when it dries.  I used to dye my hair fun colors in high school using another company (semi-perm).  I decided to go funky and have purple in my hair, but I didn&#x27;t want anything permanent (I&#x27;m 41...just trying to be fun and not a punk rocker).  It made my hair very sticky, clumpy feeling.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all, although the color was so nice - a shame that when I tried to brush my hair it just clumped together and was not as smooth/flowing as the parts which were not colored.  I decided to go with my old hair coloring in purple....little more permanent but at least once I straighten my hair it flows perfectly and doesn&#x27;t clump together.</li>
    <li> This is a great purple color and we have lots of fun adding a splash of color to our hair once in a while.  It washes out great and never leaves any trace of color on my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I like that this color shampoos out and the mascara brush was easy to use.  But the color did not show up on my dark brown hair and it made my hair extremely stiff.  If you are not careful when you apply it, the color can get all over your fingers, etc. and it is hard to wash off.  So don&#x27;t get it on your face or scalp.  If you are adding color to your bangs, put a business card or some other protector on your face while applying it.  I don&#x27;t think there is that much product in the tube either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun for a party maybe or for a dare.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put streaks in my blonde hair and really liked the pigment and the ease of application.  It does stay a little sticky for a while, so I would usually put it on before doing my makeup, and by the time I am done with that my hair is ready to be brushed and styled.  I would not suggest this product for very damaged hair unless your ok with some slight staining.  At the ends of my extremely dry damaged hair I would get some slight pink stains that would not wash out, but I personally really liked how it looked.  It probably won&#x27;t be a problem for healthy natural blonde hair or brown hair, but bleached hair tends to absorb more pigments.  Not long after I purchased this I dyed my whole head purple and I almost gave this away thinking I wouldn&#x27;t need it, however I found its really handy for touch ups! I put this at my roots where color doesn&#x27;t hold well and it helps me always look freshly dyed :)</li>
    <li> I have dark brown / black hair and I was kind of worry that the purple won&#x27;t show through. After seeing this very see product being sold in a salon in Canada for $15 plus tax (and not even having this colour, which I want), I decided to buy it on Amazon and give it a try. As suspected, it did NOT show on my black hair. AT ALL. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> (Long dark brown hair, curly.  No hair damage at all besides some split ends: I haven&#x27;t touched a blow-dryer or curling iron in years, and I&#x27;ve never dyed or bleached my hair before.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.  I knew the color wouldn&#x27;t be very bright since my hair is dark, but I can&#x27;t see any color at all unless I stand under a very bright light and lean close to the mirror.  Tube was empty after adding only 5-6 streaks.  Hair feels crispy and gummy, even after letting it dry and combing it; very unpleasant to touch.  Fingers still come away faintly purple even after the dye dried, but that could be because I added a little bit of oil to my hair afterwards (I live in a humid climate, so some anti-frizz measure is a necessity); I&#x27;m not worried about it staining my shirt, but it would probably tint a pillowcase if I slept on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big thank you to other posters who recommended gloves: I managed to keep my wand-wielding hand purple-free, but my other hand was extremely purple.  The color doesn&#x27;t flick off the wand, so that&#x27;s nice: I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting it all over the counter.  The comb I brushed my hair with after the dye had dried ended up covered in purple that will come off on your hands but doesn&#x27;t wash off well--comb had to be thrown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff might be fun if you have pale hair and just want to streak a lock of hair by your face.  For anyone else, meh.  At the least, it was nice to get a preview of what my hair will likely look like if I try to dye the whole thing purple.</li>
    <li> I have used it in the past and love the product. It is a quick and easy way to add zing to you hair withhout going through major stripping and damage in the salon. Through this Amazon vendor it arrived in a timely fashion,  and it was nice to have no shipping fees.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these mascara colors.  Easy to use and fun to put around the face when doing her hair in the morning before school etc...</li>
    <li> Worked great when hairdresser used it but the sample I received from the company wouldn&#x27;t apply ... had to use an alternative product instead - hopefully just a bad batch.  Returned easily.</li>
    <li> A nice product to get a dash of colour without dying your hair permanently. It shows surprisingly well on dark hair but probably not as well as say red or fuschia. Not messy like sprays. Will surely try other colours.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all on my brown hair, and made a huge mess of my hair and my fingers.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Much better price from Amazon than from my hairdresser.  I&#x27;ve already gotten myself a second one and two extras in other colors that I gave as gifts.  It&#x27;s fun!  It washes out!  I ALWAYS get compliments when I use it!  It&#x27;s applied to a strand of hair just like mascara. It&#x27;s easy.  I&#x27;ll use it again and again!!!</li>
    <li> I love putting different colors on small pieces of hair. It washes out after a shampoo and then you can do another color. Amazon has a good price on this.</li>
    <li> This is super messy and just makes your hair crusty.  If you have brown hair - even light brown - it barely shows up.  This is a NOPE.</li>
    <li> My favorite color because my own hair is silver!</li>
    <li> Fabulous! This is a great way to color a strand or more of hair. Completely temporary, it washes out easily and without the smell or chemicals of other temporary solutions. One tiny stick will color an immense amount of hair. It goes on like a mascara (like a paint) and covers completely. For large applications, you can blow it dry but for small applications, this isn&#x27;t required.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking of letting my hair go gray (in my early 70&#x27;s), but I don&#x27;t want to look like a dowdy senior citizen.  So I took a chance on trying the Color Me in Violet Desire.  I wet my hair and applied it on just one side of my middle part and the color looks super.  It is not too bright or gaudy - it comes out a really pretty violet-y purple, and it stays in the hair until you shampoo it out.  You do get some on your hands, but all you have to do is wash your hands with soap and water and it comes right out of your skin.  It is so super simple to use so I am going to try out a blue one when I get the nerve.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had this today and put some on me..I have VERY  dark brown hair. It shows up beautifully! I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;Going to now order it in the pink and the teal..&lt;br /&gt;She has blonde hair and put some on hers to show me. It looked so cool!</li>
    <li> While I think this product is a great idea, it turned out that the purple color I chose is not bright enough to stand out on my medium-brown hair. Still, I liked the product well enough that in the future I may order a different color.</li>
    <li> Good product to add a little color temporarily.  Be careful if it is raining or if hot and you are sweating.  Can run or smear.</li>
    <li> This applies like mascara, you control as little or as much as you want to put on. The color is very vibrant on my black hair after I apply it twice over the same place. lasts all night too. I didn&#x27;t wash mine out and slept in it and it didn&#x27;t come off in my pillow either. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday and I love it. I&#x27;ve always been to scared to color my hair. This lets me experiment and have fun and then wash it out. The color is very bright and really shows up. Super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair.  This color did not show up at all on my hair.  Even the part that is gray didn&#x27;t really take the color.  The product leaves a gummy residue on the hair even after heat-setting with a hair dryer.  Use a comb that you can wash because the color comes off on everything.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair that has professionally done purple highlights. Wherever there is purple the hair is completely bleached out. Sadly even permanent professional dyes don&#x27;t last. My highlights were was fading into a horrible pale puce/white color. I was hoping to touch up my fading highlights and maybe even my roots(fingers crossed). Anywhere the hair was bleached white this product delivers a bright saturated purple color that looks great! The application is slightly sticky/messy but seems to stay put once dry. It leaves hair brush-able and about as stiff as an application of hairspray. On my darker roots the product shows up as more of a purple tint. It helps blend in my roots. I imagine this may be disappointing to someone who is trying to put this on really dark hair since the purple will not be as vibrant as shown. I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive hair mascara from sephora and this works MUCH better for half the price.</li>
    <li> This works juat as advertised. I could ply with purple highlights easily and have results that were really complimentary. Love it.</li>
