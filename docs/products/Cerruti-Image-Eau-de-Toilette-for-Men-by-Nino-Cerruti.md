      <li>I Love This Fragrance....</li>
      <li>I believe another reviewer nailed it when he called it Elegant.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;price is right&amp;#34; and I love the scent and nozzle.  </li>

      <li>Looking forward to receiving it again if for nothing more than the memories.</li>
      <li>Not a musk as so many men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s are.  </li>
      <li>I love smelling it as I put it on, and I have been complimented on the fragrance many, many times.</li>
      <li>I have had people (mostly women)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still available after years of being discontinued!</li>
      <li>Makes me feel so sexy......</li>
      <li>No idea who or what a Nino Cerruti is, but sure has some pretty good cologne</li>
      <li>Happy to have found it to relive great memories everyday.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the smell this product gives me and the stylish bottle.</li>
      <li>Image is easy on the nose and offers great day and Summer flexibility/versatility without being overbearing or offensive to some.  </li>
      <li>received item as ordered could have been packaged a little better but it arrived in one piece very happy with the order</li>
      <li>It is the first time I buy something from that brand and liked me, everybody likes that smell them.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of the cologne, and was sent quickly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fresh and understated, yet notable in its complexity.</li>
      <li>But before putting the cologne in my cart it said free shipping</li>
      <li>cuz I enjoy the fragrance.....</li>
      <li>I was very impressed in the low cost and fast shipment of this product...</li>
      <li>Its a pleasant and calming scent anyway, but its highly probable that it does have a very positive effect on the ladies.</li>
      <li>This product was originally given to me as a gift.  </li>
      <li>If the longevity and projection/sillage were greater, a much higher evaluation would be warranted.  </li>
      <li>Personally i place it on a list of great and fresh smelling colognes like Nautica Voyage.</li>
      <li>(ok - yes, I am OCD about certain things), add Image to your collection.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was something special.</li>
      <li>The special thing about this one is that it is literally in a class by</li>
      <li>I think if you like fresh clean light manly fragrances</li>
      <li>so it was an absolute pleasure to be able to buy it online.</li>
      <li>I have smelled others that were good, and purchased them, but I always come back to Cerruti Image.</li>
      <li>This is not a knock-off; it&#x27;s true Cerruti.</li>
      <li>Well the smell was not bad</li>
      <li>I am bewildered by why so many have rated  Nino Cerruti so highly when there is nothing unique to it.</li>
      <li>The delivery was also pretty quick and secure.</li>
      <li>Great size bottle for price and have had for a little over 3 months.</li>
      <li>Still wonderful for the price, the others are double the price of Cerruti and when you can smell it I get just as many compliments as the more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Fresh &amp; Clean....and</li>
      <li>The shipment came quick and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>The first time around I was in H/S, the second time around is even better brings back good times</li>
      <li>The price was right and the product was delivered on time.</li>
      <li>I will add that given the fruity and floral notes, while masculine, this fragrance could easily be worn (and worn with confidence) by females.  </li>
      <li>Smells timeless, fresh, clean &amp; masculine.</li>
      <li>and I had my first summer job.</li>
      <li>It was exactly as I remembered it over 10 years ago.</li>
      <li>What hits one first is the smell of the alcohol not anything like I hoped with the hint of citrus or spice.</li>
      <li>This was the first cologne I bought as a teenager.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this last minute as a birthday gift and figured I&#x27;d get it a day late BUt it arrived early the day OF! Excellent service! Fast and simple!</li>
    <li> Guys.....if you are in a slump, this will get you out of one........... IN A HURRY.  TRUST ME.  Without saying a word, your buddies girlfriends and wives are going to be hanging all over you.</li>
    <li> I like it, I love it  but for this time I am disappointed, I got it on Amazon but transportation company does not take toilette Spray, so, what can I do it is still in transportation compani&#x27;s store.....  I feel disapointed</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for a while now and really like it. The odor is not very heavy but you can still smell it late in the day which is always nice.</li>
    <li> Great cologne.  This is not a fragrance that you can get any where.  I first found it in Isreal and when looked in numerous malls and stores was unable to find it.  Found it here for a great price.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this cologne for years now. I thought it had been discontinued. I was so happy to see it was still available online. It was exactly as I remembered it over 10 years ago. I can&#x27;t wait to see what else I&#x27;ll find on amazon!</li>
    <li> received item as ordered could have been packaged a little better but it arrived in one piece very happy with the order</li>
    <li> My brand quality item knew what I was getting.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping.  Smells great too.  But before putting the cologne in my cart it said free shipping but when you go to check out there is a shipping charge.</li>
    <li> This cologne is a real catch especially for the price. Personally i place it on a list of great and fresh smelling colognes like Nautica Voyage. The special thing about this one is that it is literally in a class by it&#x27;s self. This Cerutti cologne has real distance on it and it passes the fan test/ walk by test with A+&#x27;s across the board. Buy it just don&#x27;t even think about it.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 like everyone else is that in a blind smell test, my wife liked \\&quot;Curve Soul\\&quot; and \\&quot;Diesel only the brave\\&quot; better. Curve Soul only lasts a couple of hours and Diesel is very expensive so this is still a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute VERY BEST Cologne I have EVERY tried! I&#x27;ve been wearing this faithfully since I was 18 n I&#x27;m now 30! That should say something... It&#x27;s really 2 bad you can&#x27;t find it anywhere but the internet tho... Definently a great price too!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed in the low cost and fast shipment of this product...it is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne...thanks so much!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite smelling colognes.  My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t last all work day into the evening like my other two favorites.  Still wonderful for the price, the others are double the price of Cerruti and when you can smell it I get just as many compliments as the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Personally, my many colognes average $80 a bottle. Cirruti Image is one of my two favorites...ever!</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  I have to spray 4-5 times, and only get 30 minutes out of it. I&#x27;ve bought Cerruti Image from other sellers that I only needed to spray 1-2 times, and it lasted hours, by comparison. Might be old or defective product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell this product gives me and the stylish bottle.</li>
    <li> this has always been one of my favorites...I&#x27;ve been wearing it forever.....girls have always liked the smell so that&#x27;s awesome but I wear it for me cuz I enjoy the fragrance.....</li>
    <li> The first time around I was in H/S, the second time around is even better brings back good times</li>
    <li> WOW!!! It goes on light, but after a few moments it will leave a trail that attracts women in a flash!!</li>
    <li> Yesterday, I wore and wrote a review on Image&#x27;s younger sibling, Cerruti Pour Homme.  Today, Image was next in my rotation of &amp;#34;fragrance of the day&amp;#34;... Image is a very pleasant scent that is fresh, clean, and a blend of fruit and floral notes.  Image is easy on the nose and offers great day and Summer flexibility/versatility without being overbearing or offensive to some.  It is that &amp;#34;fresh showered&amp;#34; scent that is safe for the office... I will add that given the fruity and floral notes, while masculine, this fragrance could easily be worn (and worn with confidence) by females.  Now the rest of the story... Image projects well during the first hour and then settles close to the skin.  With my &amp;#34;body chemistry&amp;#34;, following four hours of wear in an office-type setting, the fragrance/scent is hardly noticeable.  Pity - out of the bottle it is a good fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While no compliments have been received, I will add that during that first hour of wear, the &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; could appear.  This fragrance is readily available on line at moderate pricing.  The bottling and packaging are first class with the nozzle adding a great touch of character to the fragrance.  (kudos on the nozzle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final tally of Image is 3.8 stars out of 5 stars.  If the longevity and projection/sillage were greater, a much higher evaluation would be warranted.  For the collector, someone like me who is borderline OCD (ok - yes, I am OCD about certain things), add Image to your collection.  The &amp;#34;price is right&amp;#34; and I love the scent and nozzle.  For the person seeking a quality summer fragrance, maybe pass - there are more fragrances out there that last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily I.M. - &amp;#34;Dream BIG and Dream OFTEN - you may not capture all your dreams, but be glad/happy that you had/have dreams..&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the big bottle</li>
    <li> Uninspiring as Old Spice. What hits one first is the smell of the alcohol not anything like I hoped with the hint of citrus or spice. No notes of variation or complexity. I am bewildered by why so many have rated  Nino Cerruti so highly when there is nothing unique to it.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered it. An exceptional cologne.</li>
    <li> Great smell met my expectations! I would highly recomend it</li>
    <li> My husband loves this perfume and so I do! Very pleasant smell and the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> Ran into an old friend of at least ten years, who asked if I still wore that awesome scent. I immediately knew she was talking about this cologne. Came home and Googled it and much to my surprise it&#x27;s still available after years of being discontinued! Looking forward to receiving it again if for nothing more than the memories. If you&#x27;re looking for a new cologne you WILL NOT go wrong with this one. Ladies swoon to it, well in actuality if I&#x27;d have not been so naive,  so have a few men. This fragrance is purely intoxicating and not over done. I was shocked when they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about twenty years ago at a small fragrance shop and it has been my favorite ever since. I have been looking for it ever since. I finally thought to look on Amazon for it and bought it in about two minutes.</li>
    <li> Well the smell was not bad but i expect better smell based on the reviews</li>
    <li> Favorite fragrance for my husband!</li>
    <li> Use it slowly. Love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Nino Cerruti several years ago but the department store no longer carried it.  I found it at Amazon and glad to have it in my travel selection now.  The best.  I recommend looking on Amazon  for all those hard to find and \\&quot;discontinued\\&quot;  items.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne made, bar none. I have smelled others that were good, and purchased them, but I always come back to Cerruti Image. I will always purchase this item. I love smelling it as I put it on, and I have been complimented on the fragrance many, many times. Sitting  right next to the person who is complimenting the  smell, or someone on the other side of a counter somewhere.</li>
    <li> FAKE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> my new signature day fragrance</li>
    <li> Purchase this a few year ago as a gift for my husband and found it to be such a pleasant fragrance, and have found it difficult to replace from time to time because I can no longer find it in the department stores in my area.  Just by chance I came across and decided to buy 2 as a just incase purchase.  I think if you like fresh clean light manly fragrances you&#x27;ll love this one as I do.</li>
    <li> Very good value for money, it has a nice smell and the price offered is a real bargain for what you get . I have purchased this now for several years.</li>
    <li> Staple item for my husband and my brother in law. Smells timeless, fresh, clean &amp; masculine. We hope it never stops being sold.</li>
    <li> I had this Cologne a few years ago but when I ran out I couldnt find it in dept stores. I found here and didnt even had long enough when asked if he could have it. I gave it to him so im going to order another one.</li>
    <li> It is the first time I buy something from that brand and liked me, everybody likes that smell them.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son. Its great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as it is his preferred cologne to wear. The shipment came quick and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and have been looking for it now I&#x27;ve found it and I feel good again, happy days!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance for the price</li>
    <li> This is not a knock-off; it&#x27;s true Cerruti. Same box, same bottle, same smell, same duration as the one I purchased back in 2002.</li>
    <li> It was the summertime and I had my first summer job. This was the first cologne I bought as a teenager. I thought I was something special. :) Great scent too. Happy to have found it to relive great memories everyday.</li>
    <li> The perfect Eau De Toillette for any occassion. It does not over power or announce your presence from far away--it is the up close acceptance that counts..</li>
    <li> It is so nice not to have to be worry about recebing online purchases. it got home in less then 5 days</li>
    <li> Makes me feel so sexy...... Every time I ware this cologne I want to jump in the air and do a back flip. Me sexy man oh yea!!!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and get compliments all the time about how good I smell. it doesn&#x27;t take much and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Been using this one product since 2000, hasn&#x27;t steered me wrong yet.  Not a musk as so many men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s are.  Not too strong, and not too weak.  Makes the women stay close to you.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this since 2001 or so when I saw an insert in a magazine with a sample in it and was instantly hooked. I have had people (mostly women) ask me about it probably 2-3 dozen times since then, usually in the most awkward ways while in grocery stores or such. Nobody I know wears it, and I like that it is my little secret when it comes to fragrances. No idea who or what a Nino Cerruti is, but sure has some pretty good cologne... I&#x27;ve even been told I smell like unicorn farts! Which must smell amazing!</li>
    <li> This product was originally given to me as a gift.  I enjoyed it then until it ran out, so I purchased it from Amazon.  The price was right and the product was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I Love This Fragrance....Fresh &amp; Clean....and the bottle is Awesome.</li>
    <li> Had this cologne years ago always got compliments not to overbearing. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cerruti Image for years and I love it. The regular retailers stopped carrying it and I could only find it in the mall kiosks but they charging like it was the latest and greatest so it was an absolute pleasure to be able to buy it online.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this for me for Christmas because it is my favorite cologne.  Love the smell of the cologne, and was sent quickly.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was very good, but the UNIQUE spray lever broke midway through consumption. And so, I had to use innovation to consume the balance EDT. I will only buy this product again, if they sell it with a normal spray button.</li>
    <li> My best friend swears by the ability of this scent to attract the fairer sex and after having known him for decades, i can safely say that the ladies do flock to him. Its a pleasant and calming scent anyway, but its highly probable that it does have a very positive effect on the ladies. The delivery was also pretty quick and secure. A good product and a good shopping expereince.</li>
    <li> Great!!!!! Is unique from all the other store brought. Great size bottle for price and have had for a little over 3 months.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Correct product. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> mmmmmmm delicious scent</li>
    <li> The rave reviews for this scent are no fluke. I have been wearing it since about 2003 and usually have to get a new bottle every year (the one drawback is that on me, probably due to my body chemistry, the scent is a bit fleeting. I just reapply.) It&#x27;s hard to really find accurate descriptors for the scent. It&#x27;s a creeper--no one really seems to notice at first, I even forget I&#x27;m wearing it. But often I find out later on that the scent made an impact. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times people have told me in retrospect that when they met me they couldn&#x27;t get over how great I smelled. The subtlety of the scent is what makes it perfect--It&#x27;s great for work, date night, weekend traveling-- it&#x27;s fresh and understated, yet notable in its complexity. Soft floral, almost feminine at first, but the mossiness and woody undertones emerge, wait for it! I believe another reviewer nailed it when he called it Elegant.</li>
    <li> I am writing a review bout the dymo label writer. I have no complaints about the product at all. In fact I love the product, it is my second one and I would buy another one. However, the power adoptor that came with it does not work. I am using an old one I had from the previous model. Also the installment disk did not work and I had to download the driver from the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a follow up request how I liked the packaging and mentioned the faulty power adopter. No comment, I thought someone would actually read my comment since I bothered to write it, but I guess not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, poor support</li>
