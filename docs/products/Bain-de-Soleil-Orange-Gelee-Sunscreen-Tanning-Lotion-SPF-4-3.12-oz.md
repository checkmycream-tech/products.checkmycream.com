<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for as long as I can remember. It leaves your skin looking as if your tan was done in the Hawaiian Island. The color of my skin looks beautiful. I am also complimented on how great the suntan looks and I am always asked where  I vacationed. If you are looking for a rich silky looking tan , then this is the suntan lotion to use. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Frankie</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this product everywhere....And I never find it in any stores. So I decided to search online and here it was! I am so happy to have found it! This tanning gel smells good...and leaves you with such a beautiful golden tan!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for decades. Still has the same great smell. Not like any other suntan lotions. Still comes in a soft metal tube. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best sun tanning product on the market for the money.  It leaves you with a superb golden tan and soft, moisturized  supple, skin.  You may want to use another product with it that has a higher spf but I always put this on first to get the golden goddess look.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and would like to know why it is no longer carried in drug stores.  Thank goodness, I can get it through Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Orange Gelee...The only thing I get a great even tan with. Have used it for years.  Very hard to find in stores....but Amazon had it!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009R34JI Bain de Soleil Orange Gelee Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 4 3.12 oz (88 g)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who is seasoned in sun products, this is and has always been for me, the premier product. Available only through Amazon ([...]), this tube of thick, orange gelee should only be used after you already have a tan base because of the SPF 4 rating. It is rich in emollients for maximum skin conditioning and the smell carries you away to the beaches of St. Tropez, where the product was originally formulated.</li>
    <li> Great product! I wish it was more readily available. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009R34JI Bain De Soleil Orange Gelee SPF #4 3.12oz Sunscreen]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is product is amazing!!!  Hard to find in stores.. Worth purchashing on Amazon.  Easy purchase, easy transaction, received it really quick.  Will be ordering more before the summer rush....You will get a wonderful, bronze St. tropez type tan.......Enjoy.....</li>
    <li> I remember using an after tan skin lotion/moisturizer with an amazing fragrance.  I&#x27;m thinking it was made by Bain de Soleiland was named Apres le Soleil.Does anyone remember such a lotion?  Is it still being made?Thanks for any help.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  When I was a teenager and in my twentie&#x27;s I always used this, but as years went by I could not find it anywhere.  You would think when you live in Florida this would be available, but I searched all the stores and could not find it.  I was thrilled when I discovered I could get it thru Amazon.  It goes on smoothly and has lots of moisture to it and smells great, and you get a beautiful tan.  I will not be without it again.  I wish it would go on sale so I could buy more and have it on hand to share with others, but I keep it to myself.  Thanks for having it on your website, since that is the only place it can be found.</li>
    <li> This may be a bit expensive but the tan you ultimately develop when using this lotion is very nice. A mix between a bronze-y brown and orange. What&#x27;s more amazing is the rapidity with which you develop the tan. I was quite on the white side of the skintone spectrum at the start of June, and after only two beach outings I could already see a noticeable tan. The low SPF of this may turn people off; I wish they made this lotion in at least SPF 12 or something.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle of this lasts about 3-4 weeks of beachgoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint I have is about the actual packaging. It comes in sort of a toothpaste-esque tube, except it&#x27;s made out of hard metal. Once you get down to a bit of the lotion, it becomes very difficult to get it out. I&#x27;d say 10 percent of the bottle gets wasted because of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging aside, this is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. AND I&#x27;M A PALE WHITE DUDE!</li>
    <li> It is hard to find my old favorite suntan product in drug stores.  I love Bain De Soliel&#x27;s fragrances and emollient qualities.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It helps you tan darker and faster. Another plus - because it is orange gel you look tanner as soon as you put it on!</li>
    <li> Best sun lotion there is. It prevents most sun burn,  but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent skin cancer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 25 years.  It keeps the skin moist and the tan long-lasting.  If you are a sun lover and like to be a lovely bronze color, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> This product has always been a favorite of mine, however, not found in stores any more.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just began using this product a couple of years ago while traveling a friend introduced me to this wonderful product.  I travel to a tropical places and have never had a tan and moisturized skin at the same time until Ban de Soleil gelee.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find the product.  I live in KY and have had all my family and friends on the lookout for this great product.  This is the FIRST ever review I have ever felt compelled to write.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my order of Bain De Soleil, the price was right, and free shipping.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the greatest products I&#x27;ve ever used and the smell is just one that cannot be replicated - the best memories of my childhood are linked to this smell and being at the beach with my family and I am disappointed that they are discontinuing the product, but I&#x27;m happy to say that I have found quite a few to savor!</li>
    <li> This hard to find product is just perfect for fair-skinned people like me.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have used it for many years.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of the container.  It cracks and the product seeps out.  I wish they would use a toothpaste-like container.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for twenty years, &amp; can no longer find it in the stores.  A dermatologist recommended it as a light sun screen that can be used under makeup, but I truly believe since I am not a skin care product person it is the reason I look much younger than my 61years.</li>
    <li> always loved Bain De Soleil</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am to find this product. I have used it for quite a few years and was very upset to see it leave the shelves at the stores. I have a tube left with only enough to tan once more. This product does help keep your skin moist and young looking at the same time that it is tanning. WONDERFUL STUFF!!!</li>
    <li> Love this sun tan lotion hard to fine</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite tanning product ever. Everyone asks to use it. It keeps the skin very soft. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> this has been the best tanning gel I have ever used. It tops all indoor and outdoor tanning lotions, oils and accelerators.</li>
    <li> I searched for a while to find this again. I really longed for that deep golden tan I had gotten in the 80&#x27;s using this, and voila! Here it is. Same formula, same delicious Ban De Soleil fragrance and same results. I&#x27;ve been careful throughout my life not to do sun damage on a regular basis, but last time we went to the beach, I wanted to be prepared. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, either. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it daily for yrs in the sun, but for the occasional tanning trek or beach excursion, this is what you remember. Love it, please don&#x27;t stop making this jewel!! 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Thought I would never find this again. Just as I remembered. It smells great..Thank you..SPF 4 is not for a day in the Florida sun, but is perfect for me to go out for 30 minutes at a time. Loved it in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s and&lt;br /&gt;love it now.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quick, great condition and was as described.  I have to hide the sunscreen now as everyone wants to use it.  I would strongly recommend this item</li>
    <li> I thought they had discontinued this. I started using it 34 years ago and I was so amazed to find it here. It smells good, feels good on your skin and although its not a instant tanner, it gives you color immediately because of the color of the gelee. So, at least psychologically... that makes me feel great at the pool or beach</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this product anywhere in retail stores, so was very happy to find it on-line.  It&#x27;s just as good as ever, maybe even better since it&#x27;s still available for purchase!</li>
    <li> Bain de Soleil is no longer available in our area and what a treat to finally find it on Amazon!  I bought my mother some for Mother&#x27;s Day and the smell (although not as strong as I remember) is the same and brought back a flood of happy memories of hot summer days at the pool as a teen with my mother and sister.</li>
    <li> It is actually my wife who purchased this product.  She has used it for many years and finds it gives you a nice golden tan.  You don&#x27;t need to stay out in the sun for hours to get the results you want.  Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the quality I remembered and the SMELL. IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE IT USED TO IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. Still the same color and so on but no \\&quot;odor memories\\&quot; came back when I used it.</li>
    <li> I started using bain de soleil as a kid and then the product was gone. I am psyched that I can purchase this product again. It keeps your skin smelling good and silky smooth!</li>
    <li> The best sun screen ever. There is nothing like it that I have used in the past 30 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would be easier to find.</li>
    <li> Love it, have used it for years!!!!!</li>
    <li> perfect &amp; exactly as I remember. genuinely feel like my tan was a pretty color w/this lotion. smells good &amp; easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to find this product in stores, and due to allergies it&#x27;s the only thing I can use. It&#x27;s also the only thing that actually tans my face. I was thrilled to find it on-line, and service was just as written.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this in local stores for awhile so when I came across it on amazon I purchased two.  Although the emolients were very rich and nourishing on my dry skin I can&#x27;t say it did much for the tanning aspect I purchased it for and since it was pretty pricey for just a &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;  I would have to say it isn&#x27;t worth the money.  Also if I could do it all over I would have just bought a moisture lotion that didn&#x27;t come in a metal like tube that oozes out the creases when you get about 2/3 of the way down the tube.  I throw them out cause otherwise it makes a mess and it&#x27;s pretty greasy if ya know what I mean</li>
    <li> I love this product and wasnt able to find it anywhere, but, i found it here and will continue buying it FOREVER!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff to use for a great tan!  I have searched high &amp; low...until now.  Thank you!  You sure are a tan saver!</li>
    <li> A whole generation missed out on this.  Love it and used it for years.  Lots of ideas about tanning and they produce results however Bain De Soleil Orange Gelle really hits the mark. A friend from many years ago who was a model introduced it to me and I have sought it out for years.  Glad to see Amazon carries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hitting the beach for the first day of the year, perhaps you should consider a baby sunblock with SPF 150, yup they make that, but after the base tan is down season it with this SPF 4 Orange Gelle, and then see the difference.  Back in the day we would start out with this with two hours a day for a week before hitting the beach all day eliminating any really bad burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly produces a rich dark tan perhaps better than you ever had.  I would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The tube always cracks a some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Pro&#x27;s I knew used this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 35 years and was very upset it was taken off the Canadian market.  I tried everywhere to find it, and was estatic to find it here.  I use it as a daily moisturizer and sunscreen and it works for me.  I love it and can&#x27;t thank you enough for having it, please never ever run out, at least while I am alive, lol.  If you do find your getting low please notify me so I can stock up.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;L. Wilson</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. Just could never find it!!!! Thanks for having it and delivering it on time!!! I got a great tan from it!!</li>
    <li> bain de soleil is undeniably the best tanning product on the market, however it is close to impossible to find it in stores. i was relieved to find that it is available on amazon! great price and great service as always at amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in the stores anymore, not in Kansas anyway. Great product, I&#x27;d say use if you easily get a tan but want to protect yourself from burning...turns me nice and brown!! smells great too...</li>
    <li> I choose this sunscreen cause I have used it for years and always get a compliment on my tan. thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..my mom introduced it to me when I was a teenager. Just love it. It did arrive when I had hoped it would for vacation though... Otherwise great stuff.</li>
    <li> A Summer time classic (and hard to find at retail stores) since the early 80s!  That clove scent and the glistening orange gelee ... can&#x27;t be beat for a wonderful tan.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Just as I expected.  Highly recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this product ..could not find it in any store in Denver ...use to use it all the time. I am so glad I found it on Amazon. I went on a cruise in April...came back with the best color..it is very pretty color the gel gives you ...get a base first before using it alone.  you will burn with this product...but once you get a base tan...the color just gets better and better!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this awesome product as a teen by an Aunt and a Cousin who used it in the 80&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;I tan easy but i think I get abetter tan with this product. over the years i have used other tanning product but nothing compares to this thanks amazon for carrying the classics when we need them.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over 30 years. Love the smell,  the protection and I always get a deep tan.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!! My mom used it while I was growing up and now it is harder to find in stores - darn near impossible! It has such a unique scent and texture.&lt;br /&gt;It provides that nice oil feel and a little goes a long way rubbing it into the skin. Don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;gelee&amp;#34; mislead you, it is not a sticky gel or lotion by any means! The only difficulty is that it is in a metal tubing, so when you are getting down to the last of it, manuevering the remaining product out of the tube can be tough - but I find if you are out in the sun anyways, let the tube sit in the sun for a while too, and it will liquefy the contents a little better, making application of the gelee even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get a moisturized, rich tan when you keep using this product, and everyone at each pool or beach will ask about the scent, because it smells so exotic and different. I recommend it highly!!!</li>
    <li> I have looked for Bain De Soleil for a couple of years now and could not find it in my area.  I finally checked Amazon...and here it was.  This is the BEST suntain lotion/oil on the planet!  It gives your skin super moisturizers and you tan 10 times better.  Then, the tan lasts longer than with most tanning products.  I recommend this product to any sun \\&quot;worshiper\\&quot;! It comes in different SPF levels and there&#x27;s also one just for your face.</li>
    <li> Have used for 30+ years.  Dependable and the scent is pure summer.</li>
    <li> A+, hard to find item. Highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received my order in excellent condition and within the timing announced when I made my purchase. I would use this site again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff (Orange Gelee) and since they developed it almost a hundred years ago, hopefully do not test this specific product, but I ws shocked to read that this is happening wanted to inform for all who care....</li>
    <li> Both tubes and their boxes arrived in perfect condition---brand new.  I not only use this product on my face in the sunshine in Florida, but I mainly use it in Ontario, Canada, when I walk daily in the brisk wind during the winter.  I feel that it protects me from wind burn.  My mother used to use it as a wind protecter when she skied, for suntanning, and in all seasons as a moisturizer.  She never had any wrinkles--not even at age 78!  It&#x27;s a great product that is impossible to find in Quebec and Ontario.  I did find it in one CVS store in Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, on the A1A, at the Sea Ranch Plaza.  I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else in Florida-thus I ordered it on line.</li>
    <li> I used this suntan lotion years ago, but since moving to AK could not find it.  I was very happy to find it thru you and it didn&#x27;t take very long to receive it after ordering it.</li>
    <li> Have used Bain de Soleil Orange gelee for years.  I do use with a higher SPF spray...combo gives a nice natural glowing tan</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this particular Bain de Soleil product on Amazon.com! I have used it for most of my adult life and suddenly couldn&#x27;t find it at retail. I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it available the last few years here as it gives me the best tan ever, always even and natural, and smells wonderful as well!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Tan is accelerated when using this. Golden brown color...</li>
    <li> love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a trip and was disappointed.  Opened it up while on the trip and it smelled so bad we couldn&#x27;t even use it.&lt;br /&gt;It was also very oily and the oil separated from the lotion part which did not look right.</li>
    <li> Not only is it great for spf, but it also is a great moisturizer. It glides on easily and isn&#x27;t sticky. You have an orange glow while you sun yourself.</li>
    <li> Did give a little &amp;#34;dark look&amp;#34;. But be careful you will burn if not keeping track of your time under the sun. Would I continue to use? No. No different from Banana boat 15spf spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Ban de Soleil Orange Gelee is my wife&#x27;s favorite sun tan product. Great product &amp; will order again! Thanks.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!!!! best tan I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is New England and I haven&#x27;t had much opportunity to use  this product.  It cannot be found in this area and I was very happy to get it on line.  Oh well, there&#x27;s always next year.</li>
    <li> great !!! used it at the beach!</li>
    <li> beautiful color using this oldy but goody lotion.</li>
    <li> The only thing to us to get a moist, rich tan.&lt;br /&gt; We&#x27;ve been using for years but the stores no longer carry it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> It goes on nice and makes me feel so french 1979 cool.  it&#x27;s not too expensive and provides a good protection when you want a tan.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever...I have been using it for over 30 years and will not use anything else!!!!</li>
    <li> I was browsing the tanning lotions at Walgreen&#x27;s yesterday and picked this up after reading the reviews here. Got it for $10 so I&#x27;ll probably continue buying it there. It smells amaaaaazing. It goes on very smoothly but the only downside is it&#x27;s very, very greasy. It left my skin feeling amazingly soft though so I can deal with the grease.</li>
    <li> prompt delivery and product exactly as advertised !</li>
    <li> I recommend this product as EXCELLENT. I am a Fair skin woman and when I go to the beach I get good results from the Sun.  I love it looks like I been on a carribbean vacation.  I&#x27;ve been using it for like 3 years now, my sister introduce me to this product and ever since I&#x27;ve been ordering this produce from Amazon.  TRY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used your products for 20+ years and have been very satisifed. How-ever I can&#x27;t understand why you discontinued the higher SPF 15 or 17 sunscreen protection lines. Bringing those back would certainly make you tops in the world of sunscreen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
    <li> The availability of this product is becoming increasingly scarce.  I hope it&#x27;s not taken off the market!  I was able to find the Gelee in the Summer of 2011, but it was nowhere to be found (checked CVS, Walgreens, Walmart &amp; Target).  I was glad to find it on Amazon.  I like to use the Bain De Soleil Gelee SPF 4 during the late summer months when the sun is not as strong.  This formula gives me the best tan and I get so many compliments!  I love the scent and the moisturizing formula.  Some of you may remember the TV Commercials back in the 70&#x27;s and 80s--brings back so many memories!</li>
    <li> I bought this before a trip to cancun.  The bottle looked small but it had more product than I anticipate.  Seemed to do well on the 5 days we were in Mexico. I used a seperate higher spf on my forehead and nose. Still burned as they usually do.  Otherwise  I got a deep dark tan.</li>
    <li> Have used Bain De Soleil for many years---- since I was a teenager.( That&#x27;s a LOT of years.) I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap..... but it&#x27;s worth it. The emolients, moisturizers,etc. make a huge difference. My skin thanks me-- and I keep my tan for such a long time..... spending less time sunning.... this is good.</li>
    <li> I love this, have used it for years, use it when I go  down to Cabo and it&#x27;s the best for a beautiful  brown tan...there is nothing like this stuff, hard to  find, so I stock up every spring and use it all summer long..</li>
    <li> This hard to find sun tan oil is hard to fine but worth the search. Gives you the best color ever while making your skin super soft.</li>
    <li> I started to wear Bain De Soleil to get my tan in the 70&#x27;s. I waas not able to find it for a few years, so now I am very happy.I get that San Troupe tan</li>
    <li> i love this lotion from way back in the 90&#x27;s and i found it. i always used to get really dark tanned with this lotion and im so glad i found it. wish they didn&#x27;t take out of the stores....</li>
    <li> have used for 10 year wil not use only bain de soeil</li>
    <li> Beautiful Product!&lt;br /&gt;My friends always want to buy this product after boating with me and can never buy it in stores, as it&lt;br /&gt;always is &amp;#34;sold out&amp;#34; come Mid-Spring.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bain de Soleil for 2 years now, the tan that I get is gorgeous and it really lasts a long time. It even worked on my mom&#x27;s really fair skin :-)</li>
    <li> used this when I was younger and thought it wasn&#x27;t made anymore, so glad to get some.</li>
    <li> I have had so many  compliments on my tan and how nice it is, I have not gotten burnt but always end up darker and darker with a even glow wish I could look like this all year round,I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Despite by dermatologists thoughts, i am a sun worshoper.  I have tried multiple products for my face &amp; this is absolutely the best.  It gives a dark even tan w/ a touch of SPF. Took bad you can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I can never locate this at local stores so I have to order online. we &#x27;ve been using this for years, and, they have not changed the lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> My first exposure to this product was as an adolescent around the late 80&#x27;s.  My mom used to pick it up in the discount section at the local drugstore but then it disappeared from the shelves.  For my sister and I she would use the Orange Gelee and my brothers, who are fair skinned, just the Bain de Soleil sunscreen.  Both excellent products.  Despite it&#x27;s disappearance from the shelves, I always remembered the luscious smell and awesome tanning  abilities.  I am 1/2 Vietnamese with a naturally tan complexion but this product really brings out a warmth of color in my skin and makes it appear incredibly sun kissed.  I&#x27;d buy a case of it if I could!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves me golden brown and not red. I was sunburnt in spots that I missed with lotion. Everyone comments on how great the tan is! I will never use another tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> love this product. Has not been in the stores in the last few years and I never thought of looking online. I am so glad I did. Judy H.</li>
    <li> A friend let me use his Bain du soleil orange while on vacation in Mexico and I fell in love. The classic tanning gel works wonders!</li>
    <li> We thought this was gone forever, have not seen it in stores in years.  So glad to find it.  It is still the great product it always was.</li>
    <li> Best suntan lotion in the world.. And I have tried them all. And I have tried thousands. Perfect even color and you won&#x27;t burn (unless you are really not careful)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it  arrived with the seal missing and looking at the indents in the tube came to the conclusion that someone tried it.  I like this product though so rate it 4.</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome. Produces the best tan I have ever been able to achieve. The scent is soft and lovely. The price here is about 3X what I paid for mine at Walgreens, just so others know.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is hard to fiind in stores so shopping on Amazon makes life easier.  Although it has a low SPF, I find that always has protected me.  I also use it as a moisturizer after my shower.  A light coat protects my skin from drying out</li>
    <li> My mom has used this stuff for years, and I love the deep, dark color it gives you. It smells great and also moisturizes your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20+ years and it is the best you will find.  For those hard core tanners, it is very important to have a bit of a base tan before using the Bain de Soleil gelee.  For the benefit of other reviewers who say it&#x27;s not available anywhere else, it CAN be found at most Walgreens, but I have not seen it at any other retailer.  I have bought it there for the last 5+ years, but will now purchase from Amazon due to the pricing.  There is also a spray sunscreen now available in either SPF 4 or SPF 10, which is wonderful for doing your own back.  The metal tube for the gelee is a little awkward, especially when you get down to the end, but it is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Just like in the old days - glad to see this is still around!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice deep dark tan</li>
    <li> Was so glad to find after going without for a couple yrs, thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like Bain De Soleil products and have used them a great deal over the years.  This product smells great and feels nice on the skin.  ^..^</li>
    <li> Used this back in the day on the foil blanket. The smell reminds me of those carefree times. Nope, not getting a foil blanket but will enjoy a nice lie in the sun, minus the SPF 50 paste buzzkill. Insead will enjoy this lovely amber gel with a lovely scent to match.</li>
    <li> A Caribbean color that makes the most gorgeous tropical tan! I have used Bain de Soleil for years and it&#x27;s the best-if you don&#x27;t need a lot of sunscreen. There is SPF 4 to contend with but if you have slightly tanned skin, this will darken and beautify it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and as described!</li>
    <li> This product is for people who tan. I&#x27;ve used it for years and my skin color is great after taking the sun, I also use it on all my vacations. Smells nice. It needs to be kept out of the sun because it  melts, it&#x27;s like a gel when kept cool. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Throw back to the 1980&#x27;s gives the best tan and moisturizes.</li>
