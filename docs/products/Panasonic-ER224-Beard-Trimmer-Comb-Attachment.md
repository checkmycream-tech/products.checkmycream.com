      <li>Very happy with the replacement, but have to be more careful so not to broke this one as well.</li>
      <li>This item is a perfect fit same quality as origanal an identical match to the origanal.</li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise to find these replacement combs for such a great price - I ordered two, and received them before Christmas, just in time to clean up nicely for the parties.</li>
      <li>This thing breaks really easily.</li>
      <li>good price shipping was to high though.</li>
      <li>(Might just go back to scissors and comb; doesn&#x27;t take much more time, and you can do a better job--with a good quality scissors.)</li>
      <li>Part works fine as promised.</li>
      <li>Good to have such a good way of getting replacements fast and easy.</li>
      <li>Snap-in fit.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately the replacements are cheap</li>
      <li>The replacement beard trimmer fit my trimmer as described.  </li>
      <li>but they snap easy when you remove to clean the blades.</li>
      <li>Fits great and the same quality (or lack thereof?)</li>
      <li>It fit like it was suppose to</li>
      <li>Trimmer baby and smooth.</li>
      <li>Its cheaply made, but priced accordingly.</li>
      <li>I would not spend the money on this trimmer because this cheap plastic attachment will break</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy the replacement part was still available and it seems at least as good as the original.</li>
      <li>Fit just like the original comb.</li>
      <li>: Broke the original attachment just by taking it off.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, as others have written, this replacement Beard Trimmer comb Attachment fits as well as the original piece on the Panasonic ER224 RC Wet/Dry bread trimmer.</li>
      <li>Identical to original comb attachment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to replace the attachment twice since the original one broke.  </li>
      <li>as the original.</li>
      <li>It was clean.  </li>
      <li>too easily broke if not done just right</li>
      <li>So just be careful attaching and detaching the trimmer and anyone should be happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>This is a good thing since the actual part matches my trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The fit is absolutely perfect - I don&#x27;t understand the reviews complaining about a poor fit.  </li>
      <li>Good deal overall.</li>
      <li>It feels as though the trimmer doesn&#x27;t fit quite right and snags on the trimmer itself.</li>
      <li>Wish everything in the world would arrive as quickly and work as well</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was shipped quick and promptly received.</li>
      <li>The comb comes quickly from Amazon, and I&#x27;ll continue to order them, but it&#x27;s a shame</li>
      <li>Right part, good trimmer, 4 stars for being a fragile comb.</li>
      <li>It seems to be at least as good as the original.. possibly better.</li>
      <li>Easy to break even though my husband is gentle while he is using it.</li>
      <li>Exactly like the original.</li>
      <li>The attachment is an odd shape so a more accurate picture would have been much more helpful.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to have a few of these replacements handy for the eventual breakage.</li>
      <li>Definetely worth buying instead of buyng another shaver.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit, picture is wrong.  </li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly, and very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Glad we didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new one!</li>
      <li>When my beard trimmer&#x27;s guard broke I found the part number somewhere and knew it was the right product</li>
      <li>so much so that I&#x27;ve stopped removing it to clean the clipper for fear of breaking the comb.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Panasonic make a great clipper, but the main weakness is the comb breaking due to stress.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is the same as original</li>
    <li> I bought this attachment because the original one had broken. When the new one arrived it was broken in the same place!</li>
    <li> This is just like my old one. I had dropped my Beard Trimmer and broke this attachment a few weeks ago. I found and ordered this for a good price and am very happy with it. As long as I don&#x27;t drop my trimmer again, this looks to last a long time.</li>
    <li> the picture is not what it actually looks like...</li>
    <li> perfect fit for ER224S</li>
    <li> The picture is absolutely NOT what you are ordering.  The description IS what you are looking for.  The guard does not mount in the middle as pictured, it mounts on the sides like the original ER224 RC guard.  Seller needs to update or remove the picture.</li>
    <li> Although the photo doesn&#x27;t quite match up to the item (the angle is from above), it fits the model perfectly.  The original piece is not particularly well made (it fell into the sink and cracked).  The replacement part is far cheaper than buying a new one.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the product photo doesn&#x27;t look anything like the replacement comb for my Panasonic shaver/beard trimmer.  But it&#x27;s identical to the original in every way (including its fragility), and is packaged in a little cardboard box to protect it from accidents in the mail.  It&#x27;s what I needed, at a reasonable price, and was quickly delivered.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the original. People have complained about breaking the original comb attachment, but I haven&#x27;t broken mine (yet?). If/when I do, I bought two of these replacements so I&#x27;m ready. I can see how it could be broken as you have to take it off quite frequently to clear the hair out, or if you drop the whole trimmer. Four stars for potential breakage.  UPDATE 9/17/16: Broke the original attachment just by taking it off. Never dropped it or anything. So I&#x27;m glad I bought two of these replacements in case of breakage (and I&#x27;m glad I bought them when I did, as they&#x27;re literally three times more expensive now).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure where they got the picture for this but it is not correct. Use the description and you will get the correct attachment. It seems to be at least as good as the original.. possibly better.</li>
    <li> The product picture is wrong, this is the correct attachment for the ER224S all-in-one trimmer.</li>
    <li> perfect replacement for my trimmer</li>
    <li> It is the same item as with original purchase of the shaver. It was nicely shipped in it&#x27;s original box. Definetely worth buying instead of buyng another shaver.</li>
    <li> great part, matched what I needed to replace</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The product fit with my razor that is a few years old....and didn&#x27;t have go driving around searching.</li>
    <li> The picture here is wrong. When my beard trimmer&#x27;s guard broke I found the part number somewhere and knew it was the right product so I ordered it. It fits as expected and my trimmer is back in service.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a back up, since the trimmer comes with the attachment. However, it seems to be a common complain that the attachment is weak and tends to break easily, son I bought it just in case and don´t expect to use it any time soon.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit replacment. It fit exactly the same as the original one and feels and looks exactly the same. Perfect match.</li>
    <li> Its cheaply made, but priced accordingly. It is great to be able to order just this piece instead of replacing clippers.</li>
    <li> I worried that it would be the wrong part based on the photo here that looks nothing like the guard that broke, but the photo is wrong, it&#x27;s exactly the same as the original piece. It&#x27;s still a very cheaply constructed part, but at least it was easy enough to replace.</li>
    <li> Like many reviews posted before, the image (at the time I bought it) was NOT the actual replacement item that I needed. But because the reviews said it was the right item, I ordered and got exactly what I needed. Fits perfectly on my trimmer and I have not had any issues since I bought it.</li>
    <li> i use it everyday for shave me, in the shower, in dry or in my car!, i love it and recommend</li>
    <li> Exactly right for ER224+ fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the same as the original comb and does the same.</li>
    <li> perfect fit and great price.  just what i needed for replacement as the original part is poorly made and breaks easily.  as others have said, don&#x27;t be swayed by the incorrect picture - it is actually the exact replica of the original part.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, as advertised, product worked great!  no problems at all with a well designed product. Every product should be this good.</li>
    <li> This piece saved my trimmer. It even seems to be better made than the one that broke. Good deal overall.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part for my Panasonic ER224 cordless trimmer.  As noted in other reviews, the product image is NOT of the actual product, but does with the ER224.  Great price on here as well, only other place I could find it was on ebay and was almost twice the price.</li>
    <li> The replacement beard trimmer fit my trimmer as described.  The item was shipped on time, very happy I did not have to replace the whole trimmer</li>
    <li> Attaching and detaching the trimmer is a little more difficult to do than it should be. It feels as though the trimmer doesn&#x27;t fit quite right and snags on the trimmer itself. Half the time I take the trimmer off I&#x27;m afraid its going to break. But as far as the functionality of the trimmer itself, its spot on.  So just be careful attaching and detaching the trimmer and anyone should be happy with the product.  Finally, when I called Panasonic to order the product, there was a 2 month waiting period for the trimmer.  Amazon had it in stock and I received it in less than 5 business days.  I can always count on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for seven years and I am not about to replace it yet . .</li>
    <li> It did what it was designed for, that is all one can ask.  Good service and was shipped promptly.  It fit like it was suppose to</li>
    <li> This was an exact replacement for my guard. Actually, this replacement is of higher quality than the one that came with the unit originally. It was shipped quickly, and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> new comb attachment, identical to the original piece of the Panasonic ER224. the picture shown is not of the actualy piece you will receive</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my original comb attachment that broke from an unfortunate dropping incident.&lt;br /&gt;So far this attachment is as good as the original and has not broken or shown signs of poor construction..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who needs to purchase a replacement comb attachment for their Panasonic ER224 trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product was ordered to replace the original one which had gotten broken.  Standard shipping showed the product to be received 2/2-2/7/14.  It arrived 2/2/14.  It was not damaged in any way.  It was in a box that had been placed in a padded envelope.  It was clean.  The printed order was enclosed and very professional with all pertinent information given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased.  And will order from them again and will recommended them to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative feedback is the picture.  The attachment is an odd shape so a more accurate picture would have been much more helpful.  Several minutes were spent cross-referencing the product before an actual determination could be made.  Also, had to check the seller&#x27;s return policy just in case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy the replacement part was still available and it seems at least as good as the original. Probably would&#x27;ve given it a 5 star if the price (including shipping) was a bit cheaper or if the product was made of stronger material.</li>
    <li> It is as good as the one that came with the clippers I don&#x27;t like the way it is taken off too easily broke if not done just right</li>
    <li> They work great, but break easy. I have to continuously reorder them.</li>
    <li> FIts perfectly, works perfectly...but this is the second one I&#x27;ve had to purchase due to the plastic cracking so easily.  I&#x27;ve had to replace the attachment twice since the original one broke.  Otherwise, great.</li>
    <li> Great price and fits better than original.</li>
    <li> I always break the plastic beard trimmer comb so I always ended up purchasing them every year or so. !</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for Panasonic wet dry trimmer</li>
    <li> Order 2 or 3...this breaks all the time!!!</li>
    <li> as a few others have mentioned, this is the correct item. The picture is wrong, but it fits fine. I did notice that the one i received does not seem to click in place and so it fits slightly loose. It doesn&#x27;t effect the function, but at the highest settings the guide wants to fall off. I dont use them so it doesn&#x27;t bother me but is something to consider, though i dont think there are any other options on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these with the trimmer but I don&#x27;t have a problem at all with removing the attachment . The best tip is to move the dial to 20 when removing and move it to the lowest setting when putting it back on. DON&#x27;T FORCE IT and you will not have a problem.</li>
    <li> This is in fact the correct attachment for my Panasonic beard trimmer. Works great and shipped promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that this is the second time having to replace this particular item.</li>
    <li> Trimmer baby and smooth.</li>
    <li> This item is a perfect fit same quality as origanal an identical match to the origanal.Don&#x27;t waste your time with Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I purchased it .It fits perfectly</li>
    <li> Fis the ER224S Panasonic perfectly...like it was made for it ,, just great</li>
    <li> Part works fine as promised.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, picture is wrong.  This fits the rechargeable trimmer perfectly.  Snap-in fit.  No burrs or other defects.</li>
    <li> These are necessary to replace the cheap Chinese plastic comb attachment that inevitably will break.  SADLY, these are just another cheap Chinese plastic piece.  The manufacturer should have made these out of a more durable, less brittle, Nylon material that would last a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this beard trimmer, sadly this piece is the weak link.</li>
    <li> Does not look like this. thought my er224 razor was useless after dropping it but found this on amazon just like new now . good price shipping was to high though.</li>
    <li> as others have said, this IS the one you want for your trimmer. I don&#x27;t know why the pic is wrong but it is. Fits great and the same quality (or lack thereof?) as the original. I wish they made an option for a longer comb length!</li>
    <li> The comb attachment on my Panasonic ER224S broke. I was looking for a replacement. This one was a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be scared. The photo provided stinks, true. And is not of much help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as others have written, this replacement Beard Trimmer comb Attachment fits as well as the original piece on the Panasonic ER224 RC Wet/Dry bread trimmer.</li>
    <li> Easy to break even though my husband is gentle while he is using it. I wish they made it little bit durable.</li>
    <li> This part saved me from throwing away the trimmer I use, and like. I&#x27;ve cracked 2 original ones, but buying this part saves me $30 - $40 a new trimmer would cost.</li>
    <li> He very much likes this product.  Functions the way he needs it to, without effort, and the price is great!</li>
    <li> These are definitely good to buy in bulk.  I bought a half-dozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic make a great clipper, but the main weakness is the comb breaking due to stress.  Every time I take off the comb to clean the blades, I feel like I&#x27;m starting a hairline crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the trimmer.  Be sure to have a few of these replacements handy for the eventual breakage.</li>
    <li> The comb of the ER224 is amazing, it has many different sizes,&lt;br /&gt;i have had it for 2 years and never had a problem with it other than once i dropped it and broke the comb and thats why am buying a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Diffidently one of the best beard trimmers</li>
    <li> As other reviews have stated, the attachment pictured is not the one you receive.  As advertised though, it is the exqct replacement for the Panasonic ER224 RC.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this&#x27;ll fit any of the ER224 series, but the problem, as others have pointed out, is the flawed design that leads this piece to break (although if the plastic were better quality, I suppose it would be fine). This is the second time I&#x27;ve had to replace this piece (even though I was very careful with it, especially after the first one broke). So I&#x27;ll replace the part one last time, but after that I&#x27;m getting a different kind of trimmer, probably not a Panasonic. (Might just go back to scissors and comb; doesn&#x27;t take much more time, and you can do a better job--with a good quality scissors.)</li>
    <li> the product is good and easy to use .it is strong and perfect in use .i advice every one to buy it and enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> Did not have to buy a new trimmer. Perfect!!! The ER224 is a great trimmer. I use it to trim my beard. Have had it for at least 5 years and it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Just used this attachment replacement a few moments ago. It&#x27;s just the same as the original comb and does the same, smooth job on my beard and sideburns. Very happy with the replacement, but have to be more careful so not to broke this one as well. The first picture of the item is wrong by the way, check the others and you&#x27;ll see this one is indeed for the Panasonic ER224.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic clipper/beard trimmer is a great little device, works smoothly wet or dry, holds a charge a long time, and is quiet.  Its Achilles heel, however, is its comb guide.  The comb is brittle and breaks extremely easily with the least amount of pressure, so much so that I&#x27;ve stopped removing it to clean the clipper for fear of breaking the comb.  The comb comes quickly from Amazon, and I&#x27;ll continue to order them, but it&#x27;s a shame the design of the comb, the type of plastic used to make it, makes it so fragile and brittle.</li>
    <li> The picture does not do it justice.  This is the replacement of the beard trimmer piece.  Very happy with product..</li>
    <li> Picture not correct depiction of product... Fits perfectly on Panasonic ER224 Beard Trimmer... Identical to original comb attachment.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the replacement comb attachments for my Panasonic ER224 RC.  The fit is absolutely perfect - I don&#x27;t understand the reviews complaining about a poor fit.  The comb snapped right in place on the slots running down both sides of the shaver and is indistinguishable from the original product.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this very neat beard trimmer but broke this piece so I was pleased to find it again as it works well.</li>
    <li> This replacement comb was an exact fit to the broken comb that came with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped quick and promptly received. My only complaint is in the design of the part itself. This is my 4th broken comb.&lt;br /&gt;I am extra careful when but they snap easy when you remove to clean the blades. Fortunately the replacements are cheap</li>
    <li> I bought two of these because the wife accidentally broke the one I have. They fitted perfectly. They arrived packed well and work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perfect no problems works well</li>
    <li> The panasonic ER244 attachment fits but the shaver is a peice of junk !!! I&#x27;m so mad I loved the shaver but battery go&#x27;s dead and then it&#x27;s usless after about 4 - months !</li>
    <li> The product picturedon the Amazon site is not the correct item; however, i did receive the correct item, which by the way is the weakest link to this very nice and powerful trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought the clippers a few years ago and used them often to trim my beard and shave my head, but when they fell off the bathroom counter I thought they were done. Imagine my surprise to find these replacement combs for such a great price - I ordered two, and received them before Christmas, just in time to clean up nicely for the parties. Wifey approves!</li>
    <li> As others have noted, the picture and the product do not match.  This is a good thing since the actual part matches my trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this 4 stars because I paid for overnight shipping and it took 5 days to get to me.  The seller refund the upcharged shipping as expected.</li>
    <li> Fit just like the original comb.</li>
    <li> This part tends to break after some use. It was great to find the replacement on-line and at such low cost. Perfect part.</li>
    <li> If you have the Panasonic clipper this goes on, you no doubt have had the guide break at least once. This fits perfectly, and so far, no problems.</li>
    <li> the trimmer comb attachment worked quite well, and the only reason I had to order a replacement for the original was due to charging the trimmer on a wall socket too high up. gravity is a bitch.</li>
    <li> Despite the poor angle of the preview photo, this is in fact the correct replacement part for the Panasonic ER224 beard trimmer. No issues to report and my beard trimmer is back up and running.</li>
    <li> exactly what we needed</li>
    <li> This thing breaks really easily. I would not spend the money on this trimmer because this cheap plastic attachment will break</li>
    <li> This picture is not the product. It&#x27;s really the comb to ER224. Perfect</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  It fits perfectly on my husband&#x27;s trimmer which I accidentally knocked off the wall. Glad we didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new one!</li>
    <li> Exactly what other reviews have stated. The picture is wrong but the product is great. I ordered 2 last time on account of regular dropping of my trimmer when I am not trimming my beard...</li>
    <li> Picture seems wrong, but this is in fact the correct part for the Panasonic trimmer. This comb is the most fragile part of the trimmer, but they&#x27;re cheap and as long as you don&#x27;t drop the trimmer, it really won&#x27;t break that easily. Right part, good trimmer, 4 stars for being a fragile comb.</li>
    <li> Great replacement part, fit exactly. Not much else to say. My other one cracked, this one is the exact same thing and it fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> It got here in a timely fashion, it&#x27;s what I wanted and I love it. Good to have such a good way of getting replacements fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Great buy, got it quickly and it works.  Wish everything in the world would arrive as quickly and work as well</li>
