<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Extremely effective and efficient...a little does, in fact, go a long way. The aroma is spot on, the bubbles generous.</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance!  Just wonderful.  The rosemary mint is strong in a good way.  I also bought the sugar vanilla but can barely smell that one.  Good bubbles, too.</li>
    <li> Its strange to be in a hot bath and feel and smell the coolness of mint. It is a unisex fragrance, so its great for both men and women. The scent is void of that sweetness that accompanies most bubble bath products- its strong and refreshing. The bubbles are full and long-lasting. Makes for a beautiful and relaxing bath, and it is wonderful for achy muscles and muscle cramps (including period cramps).</li>
    <li> Leaked from lid slightly when I got it</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie, this is a very strong mint scent. I pulled it out recently when I had a cold and it was dynamite for my cough and stuffy nose.</li>
    <li> So the way I like to relax at the end of a long day is a bubble bath.  As an adult finding bubble bath is sometimes a challenge, so I was pleased to try this product.  It foams very nicely.  The scent is pleasant, but somewhat understated.  So you can either pour in too much and foam yourself out, or settle for a subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: An amazing relaxing scent, really nice bubbles, soothing aroma overall and it really does make you feel like a queen. ;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: there are preservatives in this - it is my fault that I assumed there wouldn&#x27;t be any, but that was really disappointing. The bubbles disappear pretty quickly after 10minutes of soaking (that&#x27;s when jets help the issue - if no jets... Might get a little tricky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much, I&#x27;m tied. I like this bubble bath, but I would much rather get a completely natural bubble bath without preservatives so I&#x27;m literally not marinating in poison (even though potassium sorbate is said to be the least harmful of preservatives). Sort of ruins the calming atmosphere... Otherwise, beautiful product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! A little luxury at the end of a long day.</li>
    <li> very relaxing! bubbles last. good quality and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I originally purchased it based on other reviews.  It smells wonderful and not overpowering and makes enough bubbles to be nice but not flowing over the sides of the tub.  Even my husband likes it. :-)</li>
    <li> I actually just bought this as a Xmas gift for my fiancee</li>
    <li> Best bubble bath I&#x27;ve used. Makes a dense bubble foam and lasts for a long time. Much better than some bubble bath I got from the Body Shop.</li>
    <li> Shipping from this seller &#x3D; bad, as others have mentioned recently , some of the contents leaked out (a good 5th of the bottle) which was not fun and a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product overall&#x3D; very good. I love the smell, it&#x27;s very refreshing. The ingredients are great, natural, no harsh chemicals, and aloe is a main ingredient. Not the bubbliest but it does bubble a bit.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent!  As a previous reviewer said, not too girly and smells like stay at a spa.  The bubbles are amazing!  Huge and long lasting and the best part, it only takes a bit of it to make all those glorious bubbles.  I&#x27;ve already used it four times and haven&#x27;t even used 1/2 of it yet.  Makes my skin feel soft and smooth as well.  Highly reccommended.</li>
    <li> Amazing and the smell is awesome. Makes wonderful sudsy bubbles! A little goes well but I like to use a generous amount!</li>
    <li> My main complaint with this product is that the bubbles don&#x27;t last very long. Very nice fragrance. Does not dry your skin. I probably would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love bubble bath, so it doesn&#x27;t take that much to make me happy.  The scent on this is very good - not too minty - and not sweet at all, which suits me.  It makes adequate bubbles, but really doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Philosophy line or Lush&#x27;s bubble bars which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This bubble bath smells great and makes great bubbles.  Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I was wanting a nice bubble bath but didn&#x27;t want something too...florid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosemary mint has an awesome smell, isn&#x27;t overpowering, bubbles well, and makes my skin feel nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to buying again!</li>
    <li> Smells good and very bubbly.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. The bubbles last and last, and the scent is absolutely fabulous. I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future, of every scent I can find. I see this one and the lavender one being my favorites, though. Just perfect! Buy it, trust me. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Loved, loved, loved this. Bought it for a vacation and used it for months afterwards. Great scent too; very relaxing.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice, but very understated.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product seems to make less bubbles than other bubble baths, even if you put a lot of it in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;EO Renew Bubble Bath, Rose and Chamomile is much better and similar price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift for my sister.  She said she LOVED it! Arrived on time. I didn&#x27;t use it, so I cannot say if it was a good quality.</li>
    <li> This product does not have a safety seal under the cap - which seems kind of weird for today&#x27;s standards in beauty and bath products. The cap opened in transit and luckily it was in a plastic bag, but much of the product leaked out and was unusable. I salvaged enough to give as a gift, but didn&#x27;t get my moneys worth. Not cool.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used [[ASIN:B001B1R6OK Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo]] or conditioner, you&#x27;re very familiar with its enchantingly neutral Rosemary Mint scent.  This bubble bath has the exact same scent, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It&#x27;s not overly strong or girly, and the rosemary is subtle so that you don&#x27;t end up smelling like a boiled chicken in broth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, as promised, this bubble bath leaves your skin quite soft.  Some bubble baths can be drying, but this does not have that effect.  Even with my house&#x27;s horribly hard water, this bubble bath created generous bubbles and foam from just a few squirts.  You will likely be able to get at least 15 baths from the bottle.  I&#x27;ve used it around four times now, and it&#x27;s perhaps 1/4 empty. (Note that, as mentioned, I have really hard water so it takes more than most people&#x27;s water will require.)</li>
    <li> Good bubbles. They lasted a while and got very big. I feel like bubble bath these days doesn&#x27;t have the same magical effects as bubble bath in my youth. I used to enjoy large towers of bubbles and now most of them are just lightly scented foam. This stuff brings the bubbles. I used probably 1/5 to 1/4 of the bottle on one bath, but I think that&#x27;s pretty worth it for the massive return in bubbles I got. Great for a soak - treat yo self!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best mint bubble bath I&#x27;ve ever used. It has the perfect balance of rosemary and mint, as I strongly prefer mint and do not like it when the mint is too weak. This is now my go to relaxation bubble bath. I have to admit that I love it so much that I even used it in the shower a few times. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I use this as a body wash, am a guy and it&#x27;s very refreshing and revitalizing in the morning.  It also goes a long way.  My bottle lasted me 6 months or more.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this. It isn&#x27;t particularly heavy, so if you are looking for something SUPER scented then I wouldn&#x27;t get this. Lots of long lasting bubbles and it leaves my skin nice and soft, not dried out like other bubble bath can. I also like that it is natural.</li>
    <li> Love Deep Steep.  Their fragrances are wonderful and stay strong through the entire soak.  Good bubbles that last too!&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous!</li>
    <li> Smells great very relaxing. I dont have a jet tub so not much lather. I&#x27;ve used others that creates amazing suds without jets this just skins the surface. That being said, it&#x27;s very natural.  Not too strong</li>
    <li> This is the best darned bubble bath out there for me, natural but still strong pleasant scent. The bubbles last long enough for good long hot bath. I do use a lot of the product to fill the tub with bubbles, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Smell is wonderful!! Sooo relaxing!</li>
    <li> I got this carefully packed, it smells good but I didn&#x27;t find any more bubbles than normal bath? I will not order again bc of the price &amp; I personally like mr bubble better! But the review reflects the fast service careful paging and pretty bottle</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. A nice clean scent and appears to be a good product. I will probably order from them again.</li>
    <li> This Rosemary Mint Bubble Bath is great for a nice, long relaxing bath. The smell of the Rosemary mint is wonderful. The price of Deep Steep Bubble Bath is excellent for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bubbles and scent are long lasting and wonderful!! Be Queen for a Day and try Deep Steep!</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a Christmas gift. I was hesitant to buy a scented item based on reviews only, but am glad I did. It smells lovely, fresh out of a spa. The scent reminds me of Aveda products.  I plan to buy some for myself.</li>
    <li> I have drawn three baths with this so far and it is a very relaxing smelling addition. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave residue on the tub. I have noticed while the bubble last a while (10 min-ish) they are not dense and rich. using more may achieve this, I don&#x27;t know. I use about an ounce at a time. I am satisfied. Packaging is not bad, I leave it out and it doesn&#x27;t stick out like a Mr Bubbles container. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Seller was great. Fast shipping and reasonable price. Good packaging too. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this bubble bath. I study allot in the tub and while some bath bombs and bubbles make me sleepy, I actually found this invigorating and mentally stimulating. As another reviewer posted, it does have a cooling effect in a warm bath, and for this I buy in bulk to use over the summer, especially in a cooling bath. The scent lingers in the bathroom though not on your skin. Love this and will buy every spring.</li>
    <li> The Rosemary Mint makes nice thick bubbles, smells crisp and herbal - a nice way to start the day.  I have found it to be non drying and a very pleasant product.</li>
    <li> My niece has a garden tub &amp; specifically requested bubble bath for Christmas.  This was perfect, especially with the scent.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes a decent amount of bubbles unlike some cheap bubble baths. Good quality for a low price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bubble bath, makes lots of bubble, smells great.  Perfect for a nice long soak after a hard run!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that likes to take the occasional bubble bath. It&#x27;s effeminate enough to be sitting in a candle lit bath by yourself on a Tuesday Night listening to a Lana Del Rey/Frank Sinatra playlist. The last thing I need is to be smelling lavender and other flowery scents while doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep Steep kills it with the Rosemary Mint scent. A great neutral smell which is incredibly refreshing and different than your typical fruity blends. This bottle is big, fair priced and produces a solid amount of bubbles without using too much liquid. I&#x27;ll be a buyer for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Amazing scent&lt;br /&gt;- Big bottle&lt;br /&gt;- Very reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;- Great bubble production&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None</li>
    <li> Smells great! Very relaxing. It isn&#x27;t oily, just pleasant.</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing smell. It can produce moderate amount of bubbles, not a lot. I also like the ingredients being organic. Big plus.</li>
    <li> Nice bubbles and smells divine. Perfect for a relaxing soak in the tub. My bathroom actually smells like this all the time now, which is great.</li>
    <li> This Bubble Bath makes the best foamy bubbles. I love filling the tub full of warm water and lots of bubbles and soaking on a cold winters evening. This product has made those heavenly baths even more lovely. And the smell, it is delicious, minty and yummy. Leaves me feeling relaxed and smelling good. I am a huge fan!</li>
    <li> I love the rosemary mint scent, but the bath produced fewer bubbles than when I just put in some body wash. Disappointed in the amount of bubbles.</li>
    <li> Again I love this stuff and smells and feels great on the skin what a way to relax</li>
    <li> PURCHASED BUBBLE BATH TO GO ALONG WITH BUBBLE BATH WINE GLASS.  HUGE HIT AND QUITE A NICE FRAGRANCE.  WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Smells both refreshing and relaxing.  A little goes a long way - the bottle lasted much longer than I expected!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, made a good amount of bubbles.</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve used another company one before and it didn&#x27;t make a lot of bubbles but this product definitely works well and I only need a little bit of it to get enough bubbles.. and the scent is also amazing I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
    <li> Great seller! Great product!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t taken a bubble bath since I was a little kid, so it was with glee that I squeezed this product under my faucet and dove in. All right, I actually stepped in carefully, but I would have dived in if I could. I was that excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells FANTASTIC. It&#x27;s not too tingly, not too sweet, not too strong... just perfectly delightful and refreshing after a long day. I have extraordinarily sensitive skin; I cannot use any fragranced or medicated lotions or products without developing an itchy rash. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I rinse off in the shower after my soak, but I have used this multiple times now, sometimes soaking in it for an hour or more, with no adverse reactions. That&#x27;s a first!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good or bad thing about this product is that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after the bath. So, if you want to smell like rosemary-mint after your bath, you&#x27;re out of luck; if you want the smell of the bubble bath to stay in the bubble bath, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and regarding bubbles: maybe it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t had many bubble bath experiences in the last couple decades, but I think the bubbles this stuff produces are stupendous. They&#x27;re fluffy and light and plentiful, and most of them do last to the very end of my bath. If you aren&#x27;t getting enough bubbles, you&#x27;re being stingy with the product. Go ahead, give it two or three good squeezes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I only wish I had found it years ago.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and relaxing smell. Zen like.</li>
    <li> too lemony for my taste</li>
    <li> Long-lasting bubbles, great scent!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I bought this for my wife and she loves it. I gave it three stars because when it arrived it was leaking in the packaging. Not only was it leaking, it was in a zip lock bag, as if they knew it was leaking when packaged.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  The scent is great, the bubbles are persistent and it is very gentle on the skin.  I love it, my wife loves it and so does our 4 year old grandson.</li>
    <li> This is amazing bubble bath. I LOVE taking baths. I am careful what I use in my bath for my skin and sensitive parts to absorb and these ingredients are wonderful. You can&#x27;t help but breath deep as soon as this mixes with hot water and to know you&#x27;re not breathing in anything harsh makes it much better. I also take VERY long baths and the fragrance lasts and lasts as well as the bubbles.</li>
    <li> Bought it for our anniversary night. I surprised her with the bath and it did wonders.&lt;br /&gt;I used maybe 1/10th of the bottle to fill the tub and it was more than enough to cover the tub with nice smelling bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best bubble bath ever! Smells great, makes tons of bubbles, and great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Not very bubbly,but smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I tacked this bubble bath onto an order my husband made just so we could get free shipping on the whole order. It has been an awesome add on.  I do like baths but have never found an adult type bubble product that was good.  Since I&#x27;ve gotten this, I&#x27;ve taken seven baths and about half the bottle is gone. I use three good squeezes which seems to work out to a little over an ounce of product for each bath.  Definitely use hot water. Warm water won&#x27;t give you the same amount of bubbles. Baths can last from 25 to 45 minutes for me. I have not had a problem with bubbles totally leaving during the duration of my bath. If you do notice the bubbles starting to deplete, just turn on the hot water again for a bit and they will perk right up again.  I got the rosemary mint scent and it is lovely. Not at all overpowering. it&#x27;s subtle but very nice.  I do notice my skin seems soft after my bath as well. I highly recommend this product. And a total bonus- it&#x27;s made in the USA.  (this is nice only because it seems like nothing is made in the USA anymore).  I am planning on ordering a different scent just to have variety.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bubble bath so I&#x27;ll keep it simple. The price is good for a very large bottle of bubble bath. The smell is very gentle and not overpowering at all - subtle hints of citrus-y and herb-y but the nicest hint is the mintiness, which makes for a relaxing scent while using this product. Since I was looking for a bubble bath, I think it does its job in creating a nice quantity of foam vs. a regular body wash.</li>
    <li> My bottle was half empty because it was leaking. I had to transfer what wS left (which wasn&#x27;t much).</li>
    <li> I love this bubble bath and will order it again!  It smells do wonderful, the bubbles were great and my skin was so soft!  It was exactly what this mother of 3 needed!</li>
    <li> I hate spending money on myself because im a mother and wife its hard for me which is why ive never spent more than 2$ on bubble bath glad my husband pressed me to do something for myself love it came on time smells great</li>
    <li> After a long, hard day at work, or a cold, blustery winter&#x27;s day, a good hot soak in a tub of this bubbly, refreshing , mint scented concoction opens the door to a whole new world of relaxation. I felt wonderful the rest of the night.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she says she loves it.</li>
    <li> This brand of bubble bath does not make very good bubbles.  I prefer EO brand.  I love taking bubble baths.</li>
    <li> I really dig this stuff. Plenty of bubbles and a pleasing aroma. Leaves the skin feeling smooth and fresh. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She likes it.  I like the way it smells on her.  Can&#x27;t beat that combination.</li>
    <li> I usually buy random stuff from the corner pharmacy, but I was placing an order here so I thought I&#x27;d add this in. I was very pleased. Nice balanced scent, and I agree with others that it doesn&#x27;t have that twee sweetness some cheaper ones do. And you can use less of it for super quality bubbles. So I think the value is there too.</li>
    <li> Great scent that lingers in the tub! Moisturizes the skin and makes a ton of bubbles especially in a tub with jets. Be careful not to overdo it, I once flooded my bathroom with bubbles. They last forever and a little bit goes a long way. The fragrance is relaxing which makes it more conducive to night time baths rather than early morning pick me ups.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> If you are a bath lover, this bubble bath is a must have item. It smells so good (very calming), is all natural, and leaves your skin so soft! I absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> Great, natural smell. I am a die hard aveda girl, but I use so much bubble bath that I needed to find something cheaper. I wasn&#x27;t sure about how this would smell, but I am super thrilled!! I love really natural smells and hate it when they&#x27;re too &amp;#34;prettied&amp;#34; up like bath and body works stuff.... this stuff smells fine, and smells like it cost way more than 10 dollars. Snag these up for christmas gifts!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really like the smell, leaves skin soft and clean. Makes a great amount of bubbles. Nice big bottle, excellent value for price.</li>
    <li> This smells so wonderful! The bubbles are so abundant and the smell is so nice in the hot water. I can relax in a nice hot bubble bath with such a nice and relaxing smell. I cannot remember the last time I had such a nice bubble bath.</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a bubble bath that not only creates a lot of bubbles, but long-lasting ones too! I was probably in the bath tub for an hour and even towards the end, there were some left. The smell can be described as clean and not overbearing. So worth it.</li>
    <li> I loved bathing in these bubbles but it was hardly worth the cost with the amount of liquid actually offered. I prefer tons of bubbles and this bottle only lasted 7-10 baths.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic and it smells amazing. I can and DO use it every day for a bath gel just because it smells so amazing, even compared to more expensive Philosophy products.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and a little goes a long way. Bought it for my wife when Bath and Bodyworks was out of the mint bubblebath she had been buying and this is good (and less expensive) alternative.</li>
    <li> I just got a new bath tub and decided that it was time for a bubble bath. I have never used bubble bath before and I was surprised about how much fluid it takes to generate a good amount of foam. I would estimate that this bottle will last 6 baths. The smell is very refreshing and clean. The bubbles will last the whole time and you will probably need to shower them off when you are done. The bubbles are small and dense, with no color. I would buy this again but if you take a bubble bath every day expect it to only last a week.</li>
    <li> Nothing to e-mail or text home about.  Has a good smell but you need to use a lot to get a lot of bubbles.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this bubble bath before I purchased it and many people said positive things.  I agree.  It makes a lot of bubbles without having to use a lot and it also makes my skin feel silkier than other brands.  I especially like the Rosemary Mint because after I work out, it feels soothing to my tired muscles.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great smell, but not enough bubbles, which is the main reason I ordered the product.  I like lots of bubbles when soaking in tub for all of my baths.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the soution or my water pressure, but it didn&#x27;t bubble up as much as I had hoped.  However, the scent is amazing and lasted on my skin afterwards in a subtle way that allowed me to feel relaxed for a few hours after.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great! Got some for my wife for Christmas and it was a winner!</li>
    <li> Got to have the right scent for the bath and this is it.  It&#x27;s light, a bit citrus, not cloying.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! The scent is nice and strong and relazxinn! I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Love this bubble bath! Great bubbles and scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my daughter loves it.  It suds up nice with just a small amount maybe a tablespoon or two.</li>
    <li> I love this natural bubble bath and my only complaint is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last.  Which makes sense because you&#x27;re not running water the whole time so new bubbles aren&#x27;t created.</li>
    <li> I love Deep Steep. the only downside for this particular shipment is that the container came open and oozed out about 10% of the bottle, it was a hot mess when I got it and had to wash it off. On the plus side, it smelled divine.</li>
    <li> First time I have tried this brand and we were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I both use this and we find the scent to be amazing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to bubble, smells great, and leaves my skin soft and smooth. Great purchase, and I greatly prefer this to one-time use bath bombs, that typically don&#x27;t bubble much and are much more expensive per usage.</li>
    <li> This is a great combination of scents for a bath, the mint opening your senses for the rosemary to sink in. It feels as effervescent as the bubbles it makes, and is a great addition to any bath!</li>
    <li> This bubble bath smell good but it really does not give much for bubbles and they do not last very long. I would probably not buy this again. Not that it is bad just I like a lot of bubbles.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, amazing smelling, and very very relaxing. I recommend this product whole-heartedly.</li>
    <li> The smells is nice but it doesn&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;Make many bubbles. I&#x27;m not impressed and won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This bubble bath is fantastic. The Rosemary Mint has just a hint of rosemary and a little more mint so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re a part of a pot roast. I have a nice deep tub and I squeezed a generous amount into my bath. Then I ran my jets for a bit so the lather became even more dense - it was fantastic. I sat in the bath and read for an hour! It left my bedroom (my jetted tub is in my bedroom,not in my bathroom, I know, kinda weird) smelling and feeling warm and minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One surprise was that the dense lather stayed for quite a while. As I mentioned, I was in the bath for an hour, and every once in a while I&#x27;d run some hot water in to keep me toasty. The dense foam stayed and I never added more. As a matter of fact, it was tough to get the foam off of me when I rinsed before I got out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite bath gel so far and I&#x27;m definitely going to order more, or see if there is a larger size.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t produce many bubbles. It smells nice and is organic, but it doesn&#x27;t make many bubbles. I&#x27;m kind of disappointed with it and I wouldn&#x27;t re-buy.</li>
