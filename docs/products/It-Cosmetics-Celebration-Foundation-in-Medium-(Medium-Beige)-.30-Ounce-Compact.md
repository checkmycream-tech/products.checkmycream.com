    <li> I would buy it if it came in more than one shade for black women. We are not all the same brown color.</li>
    <li> Nice foundation good price</li>
    <li> I hated it.  It shows every wrinkle, it does not cover any needed spots, it looks powdery,</li>
    <li> Very nice full coverage foundation.</li>
    <li> Love it  will order again for the third time  your price is the best on the market  keep it lower sales will soar.</li>
    <li> I purchased medium beige.  It goes on very smooth and has beautiful coverage.  I&#x27;ve used a brush or a powder puff to apply.  I&#x27;ve bought other IT cosmetics and they are all wonderful.  The color is a \\&quot;true\\&quot; medium beige.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful foundation.  Not Bare Minerals.  But a totally different foundation.  Incredibly light and leaves you feeong like you have no makeup.  I am usually light and the medium light was just right for me.  As a senior citizen 70, I can wholeheartedly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation!  It is perfect coverage for me and can be applied quickly.  My boyfriend does not like it because he thinks it adds too much coverage but it is perfect for me and I would buy it again! This is the only foundation I will wear during finals week because it covers my blemishes like no other.  Perfect 10!</li>
    <li> Light to medium coverage.  Natural looking.</li>
    <li> Great product great service. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> beautiful coverage!  I switched from bare essentials</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this! It is one of my must haves. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome coverage alone or as touch up over other foundation.</li>
    <li> I have used other mineral powder products. And yes, after a couple of hours you could see where they would cake on my cheeks. I saw this product on a blog and she was in her 50&#x27;s. I liked how it looked. So I bought it from Amazon. This product is really good. I&#x27;m 69 and this product is always light and not heavy. Doesn&#x27;t settle in creases and lasts all day. The best part is there is no shimmer, just a natural cover for those who like their cosmetics light.  The ultimate compliment is from people telling me that I don&#x27;t look like I wear makeup.  I bought it especially for these summer months because all makeup is too hot and sunblock is so much hotter. This stays on.  I was a little nervous about the shade. But the shade  you would  wear in other cosmetic bases would be the same shade you would order. For instance I would wear a med. beige and that&#x27;s the shade I ordered. Perfect. Oh, yes, I forgot, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great item, FAST shipping.</li>
    <li> prefer this to liquid foundations or spray.  Just easy to apply and easy to take along</li>
    <li> I bought this make up because I like the reviews.....But after I used it it broke out my skin</li>
    <li> Really like this product especially at a good price.</li>
    <li> Like the coverage of this product</li>
