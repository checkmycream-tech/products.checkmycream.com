### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I guess it works great!</li>
      <li>Great price!  </li>
      <li>Excellent,  nice looking, great price.  </li>
      <li>I still find this stand attractive.</li>
      <li>Good product, works as it should.</li>
      <li>it showed up but in more than one piece it look like a good product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice addition to the decor in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>You can tell this product is very cheaply made</li>
      <li>but it may be more of an issue to someone else.</li>
      <li>Even if I were able to hold up my brush with the bristles the bristles would be touching the bottom.</li>
      <li>One of the better features; it came with a pre-drilled counter sunk mounting hole.</li>
      <li>After mounting (ensuring not to overtorque) it provided a sturdy mounting for my tweezerman brush.&lt;br /&gt;Looked okay too.</li>
      <li>No longer able to support my brush...</li>
      <li>The price was right, and it looks good on the counter.</li>
      <li>It holds every brush I have perfectly fine and was cheap.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it at all, buy it if you need a cheap stand.</li>
      <li>Fortunately this stand does fit my brush.</li>
      <li>I bought this item thinking it would fit my Van Der Hagen brush</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine with me, as I didn&#x27;t need it, but that tells me that these are being manufactured quickly and cheaply.</li>
      <li>Probably would work fine for the right size brush handle.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll likely get hooked into this magnificent shaving form and start throwing money at better products, so you can get ahead of the game and buy a nice stand or try your luck with this starter.</li>
      <li>Cool right ?</li>
      <li>It holds my shave brush right at the end of the bristles on its handle.</li>
      <li>Only just received it in the mail so can&#x27;t review much more than that.</li>
      <li>I bought this stand to hold my Tweezerman badger brush, and it does exactly that.</li>
      <li>Spend the extra money on a better product.</li>
      <li>Good Stand, nice and small for someone with limited space, shows off the brush without being a distraction.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need an elaborate stand to dry and store my shaving brush.  </li>
      <li>My brush handle diameter is to large for this holder.</li>
      <li>The stand itself works fine, after the initial 20 minutes of cleaning with peanut butter and water and a lot of rubbing.</li>
      <li>Holds my shaving brush very well and it was just what I needed.</li>
      <li>but really it does what it was intended to do</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>so I try and be gentle with it</li>
      <li>Too small for my Van Der Hagen brush, but fit the Tweezerman brush just fine.</li>
      <li>My fault tho, i didn&#x27;t read other peoples reviews describing the space in between the top and bottom as ~2.5 in.</li>
      <li>Great small and simple stand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely the most extremely basic stand you can get, unless you are making one out of a wire hanger.</li>
      <li>It should have been trivial to put this stand into service, but it turned out to be a huge pain because it had several very gummy stickers and a big chunk of double-sided tape stuck to it.  </li>
      <li>I ended up making a stand with an old wire hanger and it saved me time and money.</li>
      <li>The stand isn&#x27;t much to look at compared to the more expensive metal stands for sale, but it works.</li>
      <li>Simple, inexpensive stand to hold my new badger hair brush in the proper position.</li>
      <li>but the holder is clearly not wide enough to hold the handle or even the bristles.</li>

<li> However, it holds the brush a little passed the beginning of  the wooden part which touches the bristles so it doesn&#x27;t actually touch the hairs of the brush.</li>
<li> Holds my brush well and can be discreetly placed on the bathroom countertop, which has limited space.</li>
<li> I thought it&#x27;d be flimsy based on the picture, but it&#x27;s actually quite sturdy and holds the brush upside down quite well.</li>
<li> When I got mind instead of having a hole in the back like you see in the picture mine came as just being an extra chunk of plastic, like a small blob the size of what the hole should have been.</li>
<li> very* hard to remove, along with their residue, especially given that the stand is clear acrylic.  </li>
<li> This works well, the hole that the brush sits in is a little smaller than I expected</li>
<li> Otherwise the stand is functional, Just not very fancy.</li>
<li> Will not fit bigger brushes</li>
<li> You will need a special tool to penetrate it without cracking, which is disappointing.</li>
<li> The stand holds my Tweezerman brush between the bristles and handle, was hoping for it to hold the brush at the knob end like other stands.</li>
<li> And if you can hang it from a shelf in your mirror cabinet like mine, it also works upside down and the brush will be held at the knob end.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how rough others were being with it</li>
<li> I&#x27;m to lazy to go thru the trouble of reshipping it and bla bla bla.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s really not much more to say about it.</li>
<li> The hole pictured is not drilled through, merely perforated in its hard assumably acrylic.</li>
<li> , the neck opening is approximately 1\\&quot; (25mm) and from the neck to the base is approximately 2 1/2\\&quot; (63mm).</li>
<li> Without removing them, the stand would look very ugly indeed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My brush handle diameter is to large for this holder. The description does state the dia. although I didn&#x27;t measure as I thought it would be standard for all. My fault. Probably would work fine for the right size brush handle.</li>
    <li> It should have been trivial to put this stand into service, but it turned out to be a huge pain because it had several very gummy stickers and a big chunk of double-sided tape stuck to it.  They were *very* hard to remove, along with their residue, especially given that the stand is clear acrylic.  Without removing them, the stand would look very ugly indeed.  The stickers should have been of the minimal-gum type (e.g. similar to a post-it) and the double-sided tape should have been included, but not pre-attached to the stand.    The stand itself works fine, after the initial 20 minutes of cleaning with peanut butter and water and a lot of rubbing.</li>
    <li> Just want I wanted. Simple, inexpensive stand to hold my new badger hair brush in the proper position.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I needed, It was my fault for not measuring my sons brush. Otherwise the stand is functional, Just not very fancy.</li>
    <li> You can tell this product is very cheaply made but really it does what it was intended to do so I can&#x27;t really complain. I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by it but it may be more of an issue to someone else. When I got mind instead of having a hole in the back like you see in the picture mine came as just being an extra chunk of plastic, like a small blob the size of what the hole should have been.</li>
    <li> Excellent,  nice looking, great price.  Too small for my Van Der Hagen brush, but fit the Tweezerman brush just fine. Make a stand from a plastic disposable cup until you get one like this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shave brush stand.  It holds a shave brush.  It hasn&#x27;t fallen over yet, so I guess it works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this stand to hold my Tweezerman badger brush, and it does exactly that. The stand isn&#x27;t much to look at compared to the more expensive metal stands for sale, but it works. I thought it&#x27;d be flimsy based on the picture, but it&#x27;s actually quite sturdy and holds the brush upside down quite well.</li>
    <li> This stand delivers on its purpose. It holds my shave brush right at the end of the bristles on its handle. The hole pictured is not drilled through, merely perforated in its hard assumably acrylic. Personally purchased this to mount into the wall. . . You will need a special tool to penetrate it without cracking, which is disappointing. Fortunately this stand does fit my brush. I still find this stand attractive.</li>
    <li> Great small and simple stand.  Holds my brush well and can be discreetly placed on the bathroom countertop, which has limited space.</li>
    <li> Good Stand, nice and small for someone with limited space, shows off the brush without being a distraction.  Will not fit bigger brushes, the neck opening is approximately 1\\&quot; (25mm) and from the neck to the base is approximately 2 1/2\\&quot; (63mm).</li>
    <li> Holds my shaving brush very well and it was just what I needed. Great price!  No sticky stuff on mine!</li>
    <li> I would like to start by saying that I made this purchase with the understanding that it was a cheap&lt;br /&gt;and simple stand. One of the better features; it came with a pre-drilled counter sunk mounting hole. Cool right ?&lt;br /&gt;WRONG. After mounting (ensuring not to overtorque) it provided a sturdy mounting for my tweezerman brush.&lt;br /&gt;Looked okay too. A week later, one of the arms broke off... No longer able to support my brush... I got what I paid for: rubbish. Spend the extra money on a better product.</li>
    <li> It does what it is designed to do. It holds every brush I have perfectly fine and was cheap. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it at all, buy it if you need a cheap stand. I&#x27;m not sure how rough others were being with it but it is plastic so I try and be gentle with it, if you want something that is sturdy that you can beat up this probably is not for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking it would fit my Van Der Hagen brush but the holder is clearly not wide enough to hold the handle or even the bristles. Even if I were able to hold up my brush with the bristles the bristles would be touching the bottom. I ended up making a stand with an old wire hanger and it saved me time and money.</li>
    <li> The stand holds my Tweezerman brush between the bristles and handle, was hoping for it to hold the brush at the knob end like other stands. My fault tho, i didn&#x27;t read other peoples reviews describing the space in between the top and bottom as ~2.5 in. However, it holds the brush a little passed the beginning of  the wooden part which touches the bristles so it doesn&#x27;t actually touch the hairs of the brush. And if you can hang it from a shelf in your mirror cabinet like mine, it also works upside down and the brush will be held at the knob end. Only just received it in the mail so can&#x27;t review much more than that.</li>
    <li> This works well, the hole that the brush sits in is a little smaller than I expected and it is not tall enogh to suspend the brush over a soap cup but it does work the price is low .</li>
    <li> Good product, works as it should. The price was right, and it looks good on the counter. It&#x27;s a nice addition to the decor in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> So if you&#x27;re here you&#x27;re probably a broke-ass student who&#x27;s starting to wet shave with a double edge or something. Hopefully you&#x27;ve already picked out your brush, and are now looking at a stand so you don&#x27;t ruin it. Well, this is a piece of plastic that will serve your needs. It&#x27;s definitely the most extremely basic stand you can get, unless you are making one out of a wire hanger. Mine feels durable enough, but I received a defect one that didn&#x27;t have a mounting hole in the back. That&#x27;s fine with me, as I didn&#x27;t need it, but that tells me that these are being manufactured quickly and cheaply. There&#x27;s really not much more to say about it. You&#x27;ll likely get hooked into this magnificent shaving form and start throwing money at better products, so you can get ahead of the game and buy a nice stand or try your luck with this starter.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and functional.  I don&#x27;t need an elaborate stand to dry and store my shaving brush.  This is functional and inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy.</li>
    <li> it showed up but in more than one piece it look like a good product but i never had a chance to actually use it, i hope the damage was done from the delivery and was not actually shipped like this either way I&#x27;m to lazy to go thru the trouble of reshipping it and bla bla bla. its only 7 bucks</li>
