### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product and service.</li>
      <li>cheaper than others in price but works great</li>
      <li>These are a great value.</li>
      <li>Three out of two were great.</li>
      <li>They were very nice about it.</li>
      <li>I love them and the price was great too!!</li>
      <li>I make knitted/felted purses and these are the perfect fit for them.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t hold air for more than 12 hours.</li>
      <li>I actually love the twist airlock style.</li>
      <li>Some leaked air and then others leaked until we figured out how to better seal them</li>
      <li>I will sell them as included and will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more of these bags:)</li>
      <li>Would not buy these bags again for positively sure.</li>
      <li>I ordered many and can&#x27;t remember which were stronger quality if there was a difference.</li>
      <li>So easy to pack my clothes and all my bedding in the trunk of my car</li>
      <li>It makes it easy to get all of the air out.</li>
      <li>The size I got was huge.  </li>
      <li>When I filled them i could not lift them.</li>
      <li>Very large Fits more then one blanket</li>
      <li>These storage bags are very strong and work very well.  </li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s not as good as “space bag”…harder to zip closed, and the valve is non-automatic; takes more ‘fiddling with’.</li>
      <li>Good vacuum bags!</li>
      <li>perfect for packing large amount of clothing when you have little room to store the packed items.</li>
      <li>These are great, I have extra pillows and blankets and comforters and they always took up so much room.  </li>
      <li>The bags were great and can be used in numerous ways, just too big for me.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
      <li>Now I sealed them and they all fit under the bed in our spare bedroom, completely out of the way.</li>
      <li>wish the bags were a bit thicker as they rarely last more than one use.</li>
      <li>These are some pretty large bags, I&#x27;m using them to compact linens and blankets for an upcoming move.  </li>
      <li>When you need these bags you really need them.</li>
      <li>After all the packaging the next morning the bags had filled back up with air.</li>
      <li>It helps if you close tightly with fingers first and then squeeze the white piece as tight as you can to get a good seal.</li>
      <li>I could see easily getting misplaced while preparing to use the bag for storage.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is once you have sucked the air out of the bag you must quickly place the cap over the hole as there isn&#x27;t a flap that seals the hole once you remove the vacuum hose.</li>
      <li>Very unfriendly directions for something that should be simple to use.</li>
      <li>Just use your fingers on a flat, firm surface and make sure that the seals are engaged.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many different brands of these vacuum bags, and I&#x27;ve only had a leak issue when the double zip closure wasn&#x27;t properly sealed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Two of the bags did not work. Air kept getting in side after two days. I followed the trouble shooting guide over and over.  Three out of two were great.</li>
    <li> I need to return the space bags!!  I was so disappointed. After all the packaging the next morning the bags had filled back up with air. Tried another two and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> I actually love the twist airlock style. It makes it easy to get all of the air out. These are a great value.</li>
    <li> These storage bags are very strong and work very well.  It is convenient and takes up less space.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy then again</li>
    <li> perfect for packing large amount of clothing when you have little room to store the packed items. Amazon price was half of what it is in retail stores</li>
    <li> Some hold a seal, some don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> GOT ALL MY BANCKETS IN THE BACKS AND WINTER CLOSE</li>
    <li> These bags are jumbo!! I love them and the price was great too!! Will be buying more of these bags:)</li>
    <li> These are great, I have extra pillows and blankets and comforters and they always took up so much room.  Now I sealed them and they all fit under the bed in our spare bedroom, completely out of the way.</li>
    <li> These are terrible.  I am using them, but they were difficult to use.  Very unfriendly directions for something that should be simple to use.</li>
    <li> cheaper than others in price but works great</li>
    <li> Very large Fits more then one blanket</li>
    <li> When you need these bags you really need them. I ordered many and can&#x27;t remember which were stronger quality if there was a difference. Some leaked air and then others leaked until we figured out how to better seal them</li>
    <li> These bags suck! They don&#x27;t hold air for more than 12 hours.</li>
    <li> Good vacuum bags! Thick enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about stress tears. Very big! Watch out for losing the smaller valve components as there are small gray washer pieces which are plastic I could see easily getting misplaced while preparing to use the bag for storage. We&#x27;ll have to see in spring how well these bags actually do! Will update.</li>
    <li> It helps if you close tightly with fingers first and then squeeze the white piece as tight as you can to get a good seal.</li>
    <li> hard to get all of the air out of the bag</li>
    <li> I placed 6 pillows in one bag then removed the air and they where the size of 1. All 5 bags worked like they should.</li>
    <li> these are a must for anyone moving.  So easy to pack my clothes and all my bedding in the trunk of my car now.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the bags were a bit thicker as they rarely last more than one use.</li>
    <li> the bags seem to keep the air out and they were big in size. The only drawback is once you have sucked the air out of the bag you must quickly place the cap over the hole as there isn&#x27;t a flap that seals the hole once you remove the vacuum hose. I will definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stay sealed, leak and let a lot of air in.  Would not buy these bags again for positively sure.</li>
    <li> These are some pretty large bags, I&#x27;m using them to compact linens and blankets for an upcoming move.  Dimensions are 47&amp;#34; x 32&amp;#34; (120 x 80 cm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a lot of reviewers complain of the bags leaking.  I&#x27;ve bought many different brands of these vacuum bags, and I&#x27;ve only had a leak issue when the double zip closure wasn&#x27;t properly sealed.  They come with a clip that you can run across the zip to seal them - DON&#x27;T USE IT!  Just use your fingers on a flat, firm surface and make sure that the seals are engaged.</li>
    <li> The size I got was huge.  When I filled them i could not lift them. They were very nice about it. Returned with no problems.The bags were great and can be used in numerous ways, just too big for me.</li>
    <li> I make knitted/felted purses and these are the perfect fit for them. I will sell them as included and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s not as good as “space bag”…harder to zip closed, and the valve is non-automatic; takes more ‘fiddling with’.</li>
