      <li>These curlers are great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m finally happy withe the Rollers.</li>

      <li>AND I LOVE THE CURLS!!</li>
      <li>Shipping good too.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and great quality too.</li>
      <li>Love these rollers!</li>
      <li>love the results I get with&lt;br /&gt;these and without heat!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and is very easy to curl and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I put the rollers in very easily (within 10 minutes) and went to sleep with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention to the measurements.</li>
      <li>Maybe will try the top ponytail &amp; then roll it...</li>
      <li>There is better out there</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>Mixing them with different size rods has been very successful and gain many compliments.</li>
      <li>:) They are comfortable to sleep in and have never undone.</li>
      <li>There easy to put in and are easier to sleep in than magnetic rollers.</li>
      <li>I take them out and my hair is fabulous</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m telling you straight up, this is sooooooooooooo much better than standing in front of a mirror holding a curling iron.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try the tip on twisting your hair first before rolling...sounds like a winner!</li>
      <li>They require being applied to dampened hair if hair is fine, straight.</li>
      <li>I find them a nice alternative to curling and flat irons.</li>
      <li>but I just can&#x27;t seem to get it right.</li>
      <li>Perfect for wrapping my hair around at night to give my long hair a little shape by morning.</li>
      <li>The key is to put the curlers on top of your head if you&#x27;re going to sleep in them.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>u so much!</li>
      <li>This first order is to test</li>
      <li>These flexi rods do not bend, and they fell apart the first time that I used them.</li>
      <li>With that said, these absolutely DO work if you get the right combination of those three because I have managed really lovely loose curls once or twice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve slept with my head full of these but for everyday, I put my hair in a pony tail on top of my head.  </li>
      <li>I put my long hair up into a high ponytail on top of my head, then use 2 of these babies.</li>
      <li>AND THEY WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR ME</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I will like to buy more in the near future.</li>
      <li>I live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s very humid, so that&#x27;s quite a feat.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use two, one on each side like Princess Leia if I want a little more curl.</li>
      <li>These rollers are probably longer than most people need, so I do recommend this length only if you have long hair.</li>
      <li>They are soft to sleep on, and when I&#x27;m in a hurry and applied for a half hour or so or while showering, they were just as effective as wearing for several hours.</li>
      <li>I actually use only one rod, gather my hair up as though making a ponytail in the back, then wrap around and twist each end in to secure.</li>
      <li>These are soft and pliable.  </li>
      <li>I have thick, almost to the top of the bra line hair length.  </li>
      <li>I have really long, layered hair, and I don&#x27;t like to use heat to curl it (too much damage).</li>
      <li>I had to get two packs to make sure I had enough rollers for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them a few times to varying degrees of success depending on the rolling technique I used, the dampness of my hair, and styling products.</li>
      <li>Put the big green rollers on top, medium in the middle and small on the bottom.</li>

<li> My daughters hair is very straight, thick/coarse/heavy and hard to hold a curl and mine</li>
<li> : I twisted my hair before I wrapped it around,and I got more of a spiral curl vs. a wide, voluminous curl.</li>
<li> The curls from these last several days (personal experience) and the curls are fluffy and bouncy.</li>
<li> I have long curly hair (3B) that I no longer straighten.</li>
<li> But these are so long that they are uncomfortable to have in your hair for long and would not be comfortable to sleep in.</li>
<li> I have longer then 26&amp;#34; long hair and my daughter has about 22&amp;#34; long hair and they work for us!</li>
<li> It takes forever to blow dry</li>
<li> but this strong smell has got to go-it even made my hair smell weird all day!</li>
<li> Wanting to experiment with vintage hair styles and other looks without heat, I decided to give these rollers a try.</li>
<li> They do smell weird at first</li>
<li> My hair is down to my hips</li>
<li> The curls are not to tight they give medium curls with body.</li>
<li> I have long, very thick hair.  </li>
<li> This size is hard to find, so I ordered a bunch on the internet.</li>
<li> Wow, the chemical /plastic smell was so bad it permeated my sleep &amp; gave me a migraine.  </li>
<li> Otherwise, they can be uncomfortable.</li>
<li> It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep them rolled up and on my head.</li>
<li> Also impossible &amp; painful to sleep in.  </li>
<li> and I hate the curling iron.  </li>
<li> It smells horrible don&#x27;t buy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are soft and pliable.  I find them a nice alternative to curling and flat irons. The curls from these last several days (personal experience) and the curls are fluffy and bouncy. The larger the roller, the larger the curl.  Mixing them with different size rods has been very successful and gain many compliments. They require being applied to dampened hair if hair is fine, straight. They are soft to sleep on, and when I&#x27;m in a hurry and applied for a half hour or so or while showering, they were just as effective as wearing for several hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m telling you straight up, this is sooooooooooooo much better than standing in front of a mirror holding a curling iron. Very comfortable and great quality too. I bought a two pack of these, a two pack for the gray 11/16 rollers and the purple 3/4 rollers from Annie. Put the big green rollers on top, medium in the middle and small on the bottom. Do it at night. Wake up in the morning and you have luscious beautiful curls ~ that definitely turn heads!</li>
    <li> These flexi rods do not bend, and they fell apart the first time that I used them.</li>
    <li> These are TOO big. I should have paid more attention to the measurements. It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep them rolled up and on my head. I have thick, almost to the top of the bra line hair length.  Maybe I&#x27;m not proficient enough at rolling them but I just can&#x27;t seem to get it right. May work for someone with shorter hair but for me it was a bust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years now.  I have long, very thick hair.  It takes forever to blow dry and I hate the curling iron.  I&#x27;ve slept with my head full of these but for everyday, I put my hair in a pony tail on top of my head.  Add the rollers and kaboom...wake up to great hair.  I&#x27;m going to try the tip on twisting your hair first before rolling...sounds like a winner!</li>
    <li> i AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND THEY WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR ME AND I LOVE THE CURLS!!</li>
    <li> It smells horrible don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I finally got what I was looking for for my hair! I will like to buy more in the near future. This first order is to test n I&#x27;m finally happy withe the Rollers. Thanks u so much!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for the price. Shipping good too.</li>
    <li> These curlers are great. I sleep with them in at night with damp hair. I put my long hair up into a high ponytail on top of my head, then use 2 of these babies. When I wake up, VOILA, supermodel hair. The key is to put the curlers on top of your head if you&#x27;re going to sleep in them. Otherwise, they can be uncomfortable. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Love them. Perfect for wrapping my hair around at night to give my long hair a little shape by morning. I actually use only one rod, gather my hair up as though making a ponytail in the back, then wrap around and twist each end in to secure. I&#x27;ll use two, one on each side like Princess Leia if I want a little more curl. :) They are comfortable to sleep in and have never undone. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in these so maybe if i did the curl would last longer. But these are so long that they are uncomfortable to have in your hair for long and would not be comfortable to sleep in. Makes me feel like I have some sort of helmet on when wearing them. Don&#x27;t recommend. There is better out there and I will find it.</li>
    <li> I have longer then 26&amp;#34; long hair and my daughter has about 22&amp;#34; long hair and they work for us! My daughters hair is very straight, thick/coarse/heavy and hard to hold a curl and mine is medium/limp/CrAzY and curly and they work great for us both! They do smell weird at first but it goes away.</li>
    <li> I have really long, layered hair, and I don&#x27;t like to use heat to curl it (too much damage). I saw a video on Youtube about using these sort of rollers, and decided to try these. My hair had big, bouncy curls that stayed in all day. I live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s very humid, so that&#x27;s quite a feat. I had to get two packs to make sure I had enough rollers for my thick hair. I put the rollers in very easily (within 10 minutes) and went to sleep with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I twisted my hair before I wrapped it around,and I got more of a spiral curl vs. a wide, voluminous curl.</li>

    <li> Love these rollers! They are the best for heartless curls! 😃</li>
