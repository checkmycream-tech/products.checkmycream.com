      <li>I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 12month old, ive used these on them both for a little over 3 months now with no problem at all.</li>

<li> Shipper folded them in quarters and mailed them on small plastic sack...will have to see if the creases come ouy.</li>
<li> Hard to stay on babies head.</li>
<li> so hard to judge.</li>
<li> It looks silly and takes a little getting used to</li>
<li> i read some bad reviews on them from other websites complaining about the sizing, and them not fitting their babies head.</li>
<li> The shower caps are made of a thin foam type material.  </li>

    <li> I received this product comes damaged and deformed, not recommended as it should send to other parcels or announcing it would not come under the conditions that you see in the picture.,</li>
    <li> These baby shower caps work great for keeping water and soap away from baby&#x27;s face and they are super cute while they do it.  The shower caps are made of a thin foam type material.  Each shower cap lasted several uses.  Two shower caps per pack.  Overall a good value for the money.  Bath time photos just got cuter</li>
    <li> It took about 3 weeks to get here. They are very flimsy. Hard to stay on babies head. Does the job when I finally get them to stay on babies head.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter hated bath time because she didn&#x27;t like water in her face. It looks silly and takes a little getting used to but it was a blessing. The two pack was a deal. Now we have an extra in case my grandson doesn&#x27;t like water in his face.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy these cause i read some bad reviews on them from other websites complaining about the sizing, and them not fitting their babies head. I must say that im so glad i decided to get them anyway. I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 12month old, ive used these on them both for a little over 3 months now with no problem at all.</li>
    <li> Received them much faster than stated.  I bought them as a gift for a boy and a girl (grandbabies) I liked the quality and they look very durable.  Both daughters love having them for their babies and have reported that they work great!</li>
    <li> Pointless foam pieces with large and odd-shaped openings - no baby&#x27;s head is this big.  The description states that it provides extra room &amp;#34;to fit over rollers and bouffant hairstyles&amp;#34;.  My fault for skimming over that part... especially since I did not think that a baby would need to use rollers.</li>
    <li> Not as stiff as I was remembering these type of shower caps from years past.  But it will do the job.</li>
    <li> This sure is a good idea, but it&#x27;s not handy with newborns, i couldn&#x27;t use it for my daughter until she reached 4 months of age!! And still it&#x27;s sliding off of her head, if these came with straps that can control the size i would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars</li>
    <li> My grandbabies love these!! Never want to take them off!! They work just as expected. So glad I found these!</li>
    <li> gave as a shower gift..really liked it for a grandchild also..try it you will like it.. This was a good idea</li>
    <li> I had one of these for my child and loved it.  I now have a grandchild and was so glad they still existed.  Works like a charm and it can be used for several years to come.</li>
    <li> We received these &amp;#34;caps&amp;#34; yesterday and they are larger than I expected.  They also look like rubber or silicone in the picture, but they&#x27;re actually foam.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy for my 3 year old, but will not work very well with my 2 month old.</li>
    <li> baby they were bought for not here yet......so hard to judge. Shipper folded them in quarters and mailed them on small plastic sack...will have to see if the creases come ouy.</li>
    <li> unbelieveable deal and they work fantastic.  My nieces were thrilled to get these for their babies everyone wants one they are just the best invention</li>
    <li> I remember having one of these as a kid. Unfortunately, these didn&#x27;t really work for my toddler. The foam is a little too floppy. She likes wearing them, just not in the bath.</li>
    <li> My son hates to have his hair washed. He can&#x27;t stand getting water in his face. This has made a tremendous improvement in baths.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast service. My kids had these when they were little, so happy I could find on for my Granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Expected it to be more like plastic material. But it&#x27;s foam. Little disappointed. It&#x27;s a great idea just need it to be something that will last</li>
    <li> These visors are great. I use them for my 4 1/2 year old son and 1 1/2 year old daughter every night. Yes, they&#x27;re foam but you just bend as needed and they do the job. I&#x27;d suggest not letting kids play with them because they look like they would stretch out easily and not fit the head snugly.</li>
    <li> bouffant ??? what baby has that? this seams like it might be fake. Im going to buy one of the other ones.</li>
