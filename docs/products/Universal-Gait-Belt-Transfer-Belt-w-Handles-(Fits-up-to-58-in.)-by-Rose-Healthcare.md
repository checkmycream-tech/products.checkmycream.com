      <li>Good for walking and lifting.</li>

      <li>I will not hesitate to buy items from Rose Health Care</li>
      <li>She already owned one and we really liked it and used it for safety reasons.</li>
      <li>EVEN SO MY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER LIKED THE STYLE</li>
      <li>This belt is very good, It made the rehab of my wife much easier.</li>
      <li>Sturdy, Easy to Latch and Unlatch, Quick Shipping, Works Great to Help Transfer my Dad From Bed to Wheelchair and Visa Versa.</li>
      <li>My Mom feels more confident when I use this belt.</li>
      <li>Glad I did the research before buying this product.</li>
      <li>Better than expected service was excellent .</li>
      <li>Arrived in excellent shape with minimal packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone assisting others with unsteady gait.</li>
      <li>It is easy to adjust.</li>
      <li>Great, substantial product that allows for safe transfers, safety in ambulating, and ease in guiding patients or loved ones that may have unsteady gait issues due to recent survey or illness.&lt;br /&gt;The generously sized belt makes it easy to fit most patients.</li>
      <li>The belt is machine  washable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great item picked up to help with my mother&#x27;s total knee surgery.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
      <li>Nice to be able to have larger size to adjust as needed.</li>
      <li>The cheaper belts are much easier to use and are also able to be sanitized, unlike this belt with the fabric material.</li>
      <li>Overall - the belt is a good belt</li>
      <li>Not great for patients who cannot stand by themselves, but when used properly, it&#x27;s great for helping to hang onto the person lightly in case they fall if they can walk on their own.  </li>
      <li>The loops are a bit large, but it turns out that my hands can find them more quickly that way.</li>
      <li>Leg amputee &amp; this belt (and 2 strong guys) is a real progress booster.</li>
      <li>Kind of flimsy compared to the ones used at physical therapy</li>
      <li>Possibly more clear instructions would&lt;br /&gt;be in order.</li>
      <li>Very easy to get on and off, once you adjust it to the proper size.</li>
      <li>The handles started to tear the first time we used it.  </li>
      <li>It gives me extra confidence in keeping my client safe.</li>
      <li>and I thought that this belt looked like a nice alternative to the other cheaper belts I have seen.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>This belt works very well.</li>
      <li>I really like the loops to hang on to.</li>
      <li>much easier to lift with this device</li>
      <li>The sewn in hand-holds are double stitched and secure.</li>
      <li>I really like the two rings so that two of us can hold on to her.</li>
      <li>it really helps having the handles on it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit conspicuous but it is readily available to anyone who might help me get back on my feet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Makes one realize why real wait belts don&#x27;t have handles.</li>
      <li>Not stitch very well.  </li>
      <li>My mother&#x27;s body is very pear shaped, so</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much that has to do with</li>
      <li>THE BUCKLE ON THE FIRST ONE DEVELOPED A HAIR LINE CRACK AND</li>
      <li>Strong and worked as I expected</li>
      <li>This belt is very strong and will last a very long time.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps if it could be attached to the pants the patients are wearing, it would be more useful for patients that need extra help getting up and down as well as steadying them when they walk.</li>
      <li>Would use again &amp; highly reccommend.</li>
      <li>However, I would recommend this model highly for use on people who have a defined waist.</li>
      <li>Handholds need to be more firm.</li>
      <li>Easy enough to use that both my 22 year old daughter and 11 year old daughter had no trouble helping their grandmother ambulate.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>Just the right size for a smaller person who may need help with&lt;br /&gt;transfers and ambulation.  </li>
      <li>Belt was too loose to be useful.</li>
      <li>Not as secure as I expected, like  a regular &amp;#34;belt&amp;#34; like buckle and not just a slip through fastener.</li>
      <li>Caring for 94 year old Mom and using it makes both of us feel safer.</li>
      <li>Very Well made, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that any gait belt never works as well on a figure shaped like a hard-boiled egg.  </li>
      <li>Purchased to help me with moving my 94 year old Mother.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice if this was for a particular size person but her therapist advised me to get one to save my back.</li>
      <li>Could not use the belt, as the handles did not allow the belt to adjust to a small enough waist size to fit her.  </li>
      <li>Very strong yet not intrusive nor uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>The belt only fits bigger patients, and therefore makes it kind of useless.</li>

<li> So when the belt is adjusted for my 130 lb wife one handle is in the center if her back and another getting in her way in front.</li>
<li> Not good for a large person.</li>

<li> I am not certain that I can trust this clasp or fastener as the belt may slip through.</li>
<li> For some reason, no matter how tight I make the belt, it always slips up to her armpits (under her breasts) every time I try to use it.</li>
<li> However, the belt is very difficult to adjust when you are trying to secure it around individuals, and the handles are almost always going to be in the wrong position for proper use.  </li>
<li> Took a little to see how to use the belt should have some instruction.</li>
<li> I bought this product and within a few days it arrived.</li>
<li> Although I got this belt for the added handles to help with patient assists, the placement of the handles in relation to the belt buckle make it hard to adjust down in size.</li>
<li> belt itself is very stiff and every time I try to make it real tight, she says it hurts her.</li>
<li> Too difficult to adjust.&lt;br</li>
<li> Difficult to tighten and loosen.</li>
<li> meant that the handles were in a useless place for me</li>
<li> Afraid of liability?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not great for patients who cannot stand by themselves, but when used properly, it&#x27;s great for helping to hang onto the person lightly in case they fall if they can walk on their own.  It does tend to slip up under the patient&#x27;s armpits if used as a lifter.  Perhaps if it could be attached to the pants the patients are wearing, it would be more useful for patients that need extra help getting up and down as well as steadying them when they walk.</li>
    <li> Purchased for parent, have not used. End of belt is unfinished, so it ravels.  I am not certain that I can trust this clasp or fastener as the belt may slip through. Not as secure as I expected, like  a regular &amp;#34;belt&amp;#34; like buckle and not just a slip through fastener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a physical therapy student and I thought that this belt looked like a nice alternative to the other cheaper belts I have seen.  However, the belt is very difficult to adjust when you are trying to secure it around individuals, and the handles are almost always going to be in the wrong position for proper use.  The cheaper belts are much easier to use and are also able to be sanitized, unlike this belt with the fabric material.</li>
    <li> Not stitch very well.  The handles started to tear the first time we used it.  Item was returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> Although I got this belt for the added handles to help with patient assists, the placement of the handles in relation to the belt buckle make it hard to adjust down in size. The belt only fits bigger patients, and therefore makes it kind of useless. I suggest getting one that is more adjustable, and velcro ones seem to be the best.</li>
    <li> this works well if you have to assist someone getting up.  much easier to lift with this device</li>
    <li> My Mom feels more confident when I use this belt. I really like the two rings so that two of us can hold on to her.</li>
    <li> use it on my husband every day</li>
    <li> My mother cannot stand by herself or walk, so I must transfer her from bed to wheelchair and wheelchair to living room chair and then back again all day long. I was told by a nurse that I should be using a back brace and a Gait belt. For some reason, no matter how tight I make the belt, it always slips up to her armpits (under her breasts) every time I try to use it. My mother&#x27;s body is very pear shaped, so I don&#x27;t know how much that has to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;The belt itself is very stiff and every time I try to make it real tight, she says it hurts her.</li>
    <li> Kind of flimsy compared to the ones used at physical therapy</li>
    <li> Just the right size for a smaller person who may need help with&lt;br /&gt;transfers and ambulation.  The handles are a bit misleading, as the&lt;br /&gt;ancillary care person thought she was supposed to pull the patient&lt;br /&gt;out of the wheelchair with them.  Possibly more clear instructions would&lt;br /&gt;be in order.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.  It came as described, well made,easy to use, and it came on time. I will not hesitate to buy items from Rose Health Care</li>
    <li> The buckle is made of plastic which poses a safety hazzard. Too difficult to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;Buckle needs to be metal.</li>
    <li> This gate belt is excellent it really helps having the handles on it</li>
    <li> Nice and strong with excellent stitching around &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34;. Nice to be able to have larger size to adjust as needed.</li>
    <li> Gait Belt was what I wanted!  Took a little to see how to use the belt should have some instruction.</li>
    <li> Overall - the belt is a good belt but I don&#x27;t see the need for the extra hand holds. Delivery, service &amp; packaging were all good &amp; timely.</li>
    <li> Strong and worked as I expected</li>
    <li> Very strong yet not intrusive nor uncomfortable. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works perfectly. Glad I did the research before buying this product. Very pleased. A+</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Handholds need to be more firm. They collapse around the helper&#x27;s hand when used.</li>
    <li> Purchased to help me with moving my 94 year old Mother.  Could not use the belt, as the handles did not allow the belt to adjust to a small enough waist size to fit her.  The handles got in the way.  Belt was too loose to be useful.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE SECOND ONE I BOUGHT. THE BUCKLE ON THE FIRST ONE DEVELOPED A HAIR LINE CRACK AND POOPED&lt;br /&gt;OPEN. EVEN SO MY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER LIKED THE STYLE SO I ORDERED THIS ONE. IF SELLER WOULD SEND NEW&lt;br /&gt;BUCKLE I WOULD HAVE A BACK UP.</li>
    <li> Gait belt just like the professionals use. Great, substantial product that allows for safe transfers, safety in ambulating, and ease in guiding patients or loved ones that may have unsteady gait issues due to recent survey or illness.&lt;br /&gt;The generously sized belt makes it easy to fit most patients. The sewn in hand-holds are double stitched and secure. The belt is machine  washable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great item picked up to help with my mother&#x27;s total knee surgery. Easy enough to use that both my 22 year old daughter and 11 year old daughter had no trouble helping their grandmother ambulate.&lt;br /&gt;Fast transaction. Arrived in excellent shape with minimal packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone assisting others with unsteady gait.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and washable, this belt is heavy-duty enough to be adjusted and stay put. The loops are a bit large, but it turns out that my hands can find them more quickly that way. (All woven belt materials will unravel, so I paint the edges with a sewing item, &amp;#34;Fray Check&amp;#34; prior to use. It&#x27;s actually just a glue that dries waterproof.) An excellent quality product for the price!</li>
    <li> Love it! Sturdy, Easy to Latch and Unlatch, Quick Shipping, Works Great to Help Transfer my Dad From Bed to Wheelchair and Visa Versa.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  I fell while walking on 9 March and wound up with a cracked elbow and lots of bruises.  The nurses here at the home got me back on my feet using a belt like this.  I figure it is a good idea when I am out walking briskly for exercise to wear one of these belts.  It&#x27;s a bit conspicuous but it is readily available to anyone who might help me get back on my feet.</li>
    <li> great buy and find too</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  Delivery was excellent.</li>
    <li> Handles on side makes it easier to lift.  Plastic buckle  is sturdy and opens without effort.</li>
    <li> Better than expected service was excellent . Would use again &amp; highly reccommend.</li>
    <li> Great idea. Except the handles can not be adjusted across the belt. So when the belt is adjusted for my 130 lb wife one handle is in the center if her back and another getting in her way in front. Best to cut it off? No instructions included. Afraid of liability?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes one realize why real wait belts don&#x27;t have handles.</li>
    <li> This belt is very good, It made the rehab of my wife much easier. Her transfer from the bed to the comode, or the transfer to her wheelchair would have been much harder without it.</li>
    <li> Good for walking and lifting. We bought this for my mom who had a stroke. She already owned one and we really liked it and used it for safety reasons. The second we bought for using in the shower.</li>
    <li> This belt works very well.It is easy to adjust. I really like the loops to hang on to.It gives me extra confidence in keeping my client safe.</li>
    <li> Had to add velcro to suit my needs. Not good for a large person.I was very disappointed. Not enough straps</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to assist my husband on &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; days the only downside is that 58&amp;#34; meant that the handles were in a useless place for me so I customized the belt and now it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Very Well made, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that any gait belt never works as well on a figure shaped like a hard-boiled egg.  However, I would recommend this model highly for use on people who have a defined waist.</li>
    <li> has helped my Uncle assist with standing with support after a stroke. the handles on the belt are great to have.</li>
    <li> This is great for my health in lifting my mom.  I did take off he side loops because my mom is too skinny and I have a lot of extra strap.  Didn&#x27;t notice if this was for a particular size person but her therapist advised me to get one to save my back.</li>
    <li> Leg amputee &amp; this belt (and 2 strong guys) is a real progress booster. I fell and my husband and I used it in our fix. Worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> This belt is very strong and will last a very long time.  The handles are an extra, but you can still use the belt without them.  A very good product that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Difficult to tighten and loosen. Besides that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and within a few days it arrived. I was very impressed with how quick the delivery was. I have yet to use the product but it seems to be sturdy and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Caring for 94 year old Mom and using it makes both of us feel safer. Very easy to get on and off, once you adjust it to the proper size. Closure is a snap to open and unlock.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and simple. I was going to order a more expensive one. But this will probably work. I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet with my mother.</li>
