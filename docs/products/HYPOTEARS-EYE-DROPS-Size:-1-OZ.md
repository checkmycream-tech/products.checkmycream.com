      <li>The drops are fine.  </li>
      <li>At once my eyes are free of the scratchy feeling and my vision is improved.</li>
      <li>A great way to add extra lubrication to my eyes.</li>
      <li>my ophthalmologist recommended these drops many years ago as the &amp;#34;closest thing to natural tears&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve love them ever since.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product much easier on your eyes than other brands.</li>
      <li>This is the best eye drop for me - wish my CVS would continue to carry it, as this was considerably more expensive than it used to be.</li>
      <li>There are times ( like during the high pollen season) that I will have to put drops in more often.</li>
      <li>After using this product for many years and loving it, I find out that it contains Benzalkonium Chloride as a preservative which has been demonstrated to have extremely adverse effects on corneal cells.</li>
      <li>I normally use two drops in each eye when I get up, and two more when I go to bed.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re expensive but worth every penny --- the very best eye drops available!</li>
      <li>I have always loved hypotears for dry eyes, but what is with the price?</li>
      <li>However it is pricy but to me worth it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy about such a short expiration date.</li>
      <li>I have used these eye drops for many years and find they are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that work for me.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve found something I like</li>
      <li>This product lubricates my eyes first thing every morning.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I only have to put drops in twice a day.</li>
      <li>It is very soothing.  </li>
      <li>Since I started to use them I really like them as well</li>
      <li>it really helps my eyes</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>whenever someone creates a product that really works the government or consumers tend to force it off the market.</li>
      <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>have a smaller vial I carry in my pocket that I clean out and refill from the large vial.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had other drops where it takes more than 10 minutes until I no longer have a film over my eyes.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
      <li>Price way to high</li>
      <li>the price is insanely high and these drops use to be carried everywhere</li>
      <li>Clean out the small vial with contact lens cleaner then saline, refill and pop the top back on.</li>
      <li>Great product...very expensive though.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
      <li>Local stores only carry the smaller vials and cost a lot more, if they carry them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Due to the considerable amount of good reviews and the price of $9.99 I went back the next day and purchased the remaining 5 bottles that were left, the expiration date, November 2015.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve suddenly not been able to find it in drug stores that have been previous suppliers.</li>
      <li>it helps out my 93 year old Grandmother.</li>
      <li>There is no way to actually use this product without either pouring the whole bottle into your eye or purchasing a separate dropper.</li>
      <li>Please lower the price back to a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I may need to look into another product since I am retired and am on a fixed income.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well for dry eye issues.</li>
      <li>and now i have to pay such a high price for them.</li>
      <li>Now becoming hard to find.</li>
      <li>recently local pharmacies have stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was adequate as expected.</li>
      <li>The bottle was quite large in comparison to the other eye drops I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve gone through just about every brand), have severe chronic dry eye and go through eye drops very fast.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, Hypotears is disappearing and I am upset about that because it is such a good product.</li>
      <li>I seen these drops at my local Rite Aid for $19.99 but they were marked 1/2 off at $9.99.</li>
      <li>I have dry eyes and this particular product was recommended to me by my eye</li>
      <li>Getting kind of expensive, though.</li>
      <li>I like is that it lubricates my eyes well and it does not make them gunky like so many other drops do, or at least, the gunkiness lasts for only a minute after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For me, the best &amp;#34;dry eye&amp;#34; over the counter eye drops. I am sorry that the pharmaceutical company has discontinued this product. The company that shipped this  product to me was terrific and I received my package of drops showing  an over one year expiration date.</li>
    <li> recd in 4days I am still using the drops.</li>
    <li> I have used Hypo tears eye drops for over 30 yrs. My eyes feel great after using them. Please stay in business. Can&#x27;t live without them. Thank you, Linda</li>
    <li> The drops are fine.  I wasn&#x27;t happy about such a short expiration date.</li>
    <li> Great drops...easy to administer, very lubricating, no burning or blurriness.</li>
    <li> the best eye drops ever! too bad they dont produce these anymore. whenever someone creates a product that really works the government or consumers tend to force it off the market.</li>
    <li> Best Tear drops ever hell it helps out my 93 year old Grandmother.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry eyes and have been using these drops for 20+ years.  I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market over the years but always come back to Hypo Tears.  They&#x27;re expensive but worth every penny --- the very best eye drops available!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for dry eye issues.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent but no longer produced.  Prices are ridiculously exhorbitant!!</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and love them.  Have gone on to other eyedrops and always comes back to Hypo-Tears.</li>
    <li> After using this product for many years and loving it, I find out that it contains Benzalkonium Chloride as a preservative which has been demonstrated to have extremely adverse effects on corneal cells. It is also rather malicious that this product does not list Benzalkonium Chloride as a preservative used.</li>
    <li> I have dry eyes and this particular product was recommended to me by my eye dr. several years ago.  I really like it and it helps me a lot.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products, and I&#x27;m glad to find it on Amazon.  Thank you...</li>
    <li> I have used for over 20 years. Unfortunately, cannot find in any drug store anymore. Recommended by my ophthalmologist for my dry eyes. I have tried a wide variety of drops. Hypo tears are the only drops which are always soothing and not sticky. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent drops for dry eye.  Too bad they are discontinued and cost a fortune!</li>
    <li> Hxve been using Hypo Tears for probably 30 years.  Makes wearing rigid gas permeable contact lenses very comfortable.  Do wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> One of the best eye drops we&#x27;ve found, but it appears its&#x27; not being produced.  If and when you find a bottle, it is enormously expensive!</li>
    <li> my ophthalmologist recommended these drops many years ago as the &amp;#34;closest thing to natural tears&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve love them ever since.  Now becoming hard to find.</li>
    <li> These are the only eye drops I can use with my contacts.  Everything else burns or makes the contacts cloudy.</li>
    <li> I cant find this in any store in NW Arkansas. Best eye drops for use with my contacts. Glad you stock it.</li>
    <li> This bottle does not have an eye dropper attachment.  It looks as if this is meant to be a refill bottle.  There is no way to actually use this product without either pouring the whole bottle into your eye or purchasing a separate dropper.</li>
    <li> I have searched for the only eye drops that don&#x27;t make my eyes itch!!!!  I couldn&#x27;t find them in a store and was very pleased to be able to get them at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Are the best eye drops that have helped me with a chronic dry eye problem without hurting my eyes or irritate them</li>
    <li> Great quality!  The best eye drops recommended by eye doctor!  Hard to find this product now in stores!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love hypotears eye drops. I have been using them for years and I recommend them to anyone that has dry eyes such as I do. Most of the time I only have to put drops in twice a day. There are times ( like during the high pollen season) that I will have to put drops in more often.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. Never any problems with it. Only thing for my eyes that I am not allergic to.</li>
    <li> Hypo tears are an excellent eye drop. This is an excellent product much easier on your eyes than other brands.</li>
    <li> I started using it when I wore contacts and continue to use it since laser eye correction and eventually cataract implants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like is that it lubricates my eyes well and it does not make them gunky like so many other drops do, or at least, the gunkiness lasts for only a minute after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other drops where it takes more than 10 minutes until I no longer have a film over my eyes. It&#x27;s very annoying to blink with that! Like looking through a window pane with water rippling down it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my drops from Amazon (2nd order in ?10? years) because they have the best price for the largest size vials. Local stores only carry the smaller vials and cost a lot more, if they carry them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a smaller vial I carry in my pocket that I clean out and refill from the large vial. (I reused it after finishing the pre-cataract surgery drops.) For most vials the dropper part is just pressed in and removed by bending it sideways. Clean out the small vial with contact lens cleaner then saline, refill and pop the top back on.</li>
    <li> I love these drops. They are getting rather hard to even find in the stores where I live. So I was very happy to find them on Amazon. These are just the best lubricating eye drops I have ever used....</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It works very well for me.  The service was excellent.  I am concerned about the price that I paid this time.  It almost doubled over what I paid a few months ago.  I may need to look into another product since I am retired and am on a fixed income.</li>
    <li> Hypotears is the only eyedrop I can use that does not &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34;..  It is very soothing.  Must have the best ph for my eyes.</li>
    <li> Years ago my ophthalmologist recommended Hypotears for my dry eyes.  They have always worked well, with no blurring or sting upon application.  Now I find them hard to find, so the web provided the answer.  I received excellent service from the place I ordered them.  I would recommend them to all who have dry eyes. Since I have used them for 30 years, I can attest to their effectiveness,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dh</li>
    <li> The best.........don&#x27;t know why they took it off the market.  Nothing works as good.</li>
    <li> A great way to add extra lubrication to my eyes. I normally use two drops in each eye when I get up, and two more when I go to bed. My eye doctor told me that I can take as may extra drops as I want/need during the day.</li>
    <li> I received these and were within a few months of expiration.</li>
    <li> Great product that I have used for decades but recently local pharmacies have stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was adequate as expected.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years.  Never irritates my eyes.  Would recommend.  However it is pricy but to me worth it.</li>
    <li> The best &amp;#34;tears&amp;#34; on the market and I&#x27;ve tried them all. I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;ve taken them off the shelf though.</li>
    <li> I have used Hypotears for many years and am completely satisfied with this item. Unfortunately, Hypotears is disappearing and I am upset about that because it is such a good product. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars I would give it a 10.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this product.</li>
    <li> Great product...very expensive though.</li>
    <li> Wish they were still available - best lubricating eye drops ever made.</li>
    <li> i could not find  this in  my town. i was so glad you had it. i have been using this for 20 years. it really helps my eyes</li>
    <li> These drops were for my father. He loves them.</li>
    <li> I seen these drops at my local Rite Aid for $19.99 but they were marked 1/2 off at $9.99. The reason, they are being discontinued. The bottle was quite large in comparison to the other eye drops I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve gone through just about every brand), have severe chronic dry eye and go through eye drops very fast. It gets very expensive having this condition and doctors don&#x27;t seem to have a cure, very frustrating. I bought one bottle and decided to try them out. After I got home I came on this site to read the reviews and everyone was between a 4 and 5 star and many are very frustrated that they cannot find them at their local stores anymore. Due to the considerable amount of good reviews and the price of $9.99 I went back the next day and purchased the remaining 5 bottles that were left, the expiration date, November 2015. With the way I use them they will be gone way before then so it really was a great deal. Since I started to use them I really like them as well so I&#x27;m hoping Amazon continues to carry them. I just can&#x27;t understand why when there is a product that people like and the product sells that a company decides to discontinue. I find this happens a lot, it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve found something I like that they discontinue it. It&#x27;s quite frustrating to say the least. I thank this site and everyone that did a review so that I can hopefully continue to purchase these from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this is my all-time, long time, go-to product for simple eye relief from dryness and itching. It doesn&#x27;t blur my vision, it doesn&#x27;t burn like the dickens when applied, and I don&#x27;t have to apply it every two seconds. I&#x27;m very disappointed I can&#x27;t find it on the local shelves anymore, and I don&#x27;t know why that is. Thank goodness I can still get it out here in Amazon.</li>
    <li> Hypotears are the only drops that work for my Dry Eye problem.  They are very hard to find and that is why I buy them in spite of the exhorbitant price of $34.99 for 1 ounce!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye drop for me - wish my CVS would continue to carry it, as this was considerably more expensive than it used to be.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the manufacturer has stopped production of this product.  I had used HypoTears for decades....excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved hypotears for dry eyes, but what is with the price? the price is insanely high and these drops use to be carried everywhere and now i have to pay such a high price for them. Please lower the price back to a reasonable price. But, yes, they work great.</li>
    <li> I thought there would be two bottles not one....very expensive lesson. Price way to high</li>
    <li> For years &amp; years my favorite eye drops …. soothes my dry eyes &amp; isn&#x27;t gloopy at all.  Getting kind of expensive, though.</li>
    <li> I have used Hypo Tears for over twenty years. This product lubricates my eyes first thing every morning. I can feel the penetration completely around the eyes without any burning that occurs with some other products. At once my eyes are free of the scratchy feeling and my vision is improved. I hope Hypo Tears  is here to stay. I&#x27;ve suddenly not been able to find it in drug stores that have been previous suppliers.</li>
    <li> Did just what I expected; no longer feel like dust in my eyes!</li>
    <li> I have used these eye drops for many years and find they are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that work for me.  My only complaint was the cost.  I assume it&#x27;s because they have been discontinued and are hard to find, but the cost was almost double what I would normally have paid for them.</li>
    <li> This is a great, effective product for dry eyes, but I think they&#x27;ve stopped making it.</li>
