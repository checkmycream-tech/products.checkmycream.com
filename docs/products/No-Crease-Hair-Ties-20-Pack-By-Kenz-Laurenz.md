<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have thick hair, looping it twice will not hold very tightly but very comfortable around the house</li>
    <li> Great price when you consider these as a disposable product. They stretch out very easily.</li>
    <li> Hair ties are very comfy and arrived quickly. The only disappointing part is mine were all solid colors except for one. I was hoping for more cute patterns like shown in the picture. The price is definitely good though. Local boutiques are selling these $12 for 5 of them. Overall, this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> If you want to be a part of the trend of elastic hair ties without the metal connector or crease-imprinting rubber, then these hair ties will help you do that without breaking the bank. The colors are cute, vibrant, and come in a good variety for any day. I am a natural-haired (thick, kinky-curly haired) African American woman and use these to create my puffs (ponytails) and other styles. The ties have a good amount of &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;, meaning that they stretch wide for those of us with thick hair. I would recommend these to a friend and repurchase them when I need to refresh my supply of ties. Also, I would even seek out if this maker sells creaseless headbands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any children, but I imagine that these hair ties would be suitable and comfortable for a little girl to wear as well.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these hair ties! Not only do they come in a bunch of fun colors and patterns, they don&#x27;t break. My hair is pretty thick and I have a hard time finding hair ties that work with my hair. Even ones that say they will work often break very quickly. I tend to keep a hair tie on my wrist and use it until it breaks. I have had these hair ties for 4 months and I am still on my first one!</li>
    <li> I am so very happy to have purchased these. I hate the crease left in my hair by regular pony tail holders. When you spend a lot of time straightening your hair it&#x27;s really maddening to have it messed up just because you&#x27;d like to put your hair up for a while. With these I can pull my hair up if I like and then later that day take it out and my hair still looks great. No more big creases and bumps for me! It&#x27;s a great assortment of colors too!</li>
    <li> I got a lot of these for a really awesome price, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  They fit great in my hair and look cute on my wrist.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These hair ties arrived exactly as expected and they work perfectly. We received a variety of colors and are really happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> Got these for my girlfriend and all I can say is that they are amazing! she uses it to tie her braid or use it as bracelets, despite what others are saying they didn&#x27;t smell like gasoline and all of them were stretchable.</li>
    <li> Great colors and good quality</li>
    <li> I love these for the end of my braid. It holds well, you can wrap them securely and they can be smoothed back into shape when you take them out. Like the title says, &amp;#34;No crease&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> They stink like chemicals. They also stretched out quickly.</li>
    <li> I love these sort of hair ties but these REEK of gasoline. I don&#x27;t know what the deal is but clearly from the other poor reviews I&#x27;m not the only one who noticed it. You&#x27;d have to have a very poor sense of smell to not smell it ... I could still smell it even after I took it out of my hair. Gross.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Very cute headbands!</li>
    <li> What a great variety of hair ties that anywhere else you would pay triple!  Shipping was a little slower than it should be but definitely worth the wait. I will order again and use as gifts for others. GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find these hair ties for such a good price. I received two separate packs, one with assorted colors and the other pack had half patterned and half plain colors. They arrived a few days before expected and are of great quality. I definitely recommend this seller and this product! :D</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.  I ordered solid color bands and was sent something totally different.  I just trashed the item as it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back!</li>
    <li> Love the selection of fun colors and patterns! They really don&#x27;t crease your hair and are much cuter than your regular old hair tie. Received them very quickly!</li>
    <li> Underwhelmed.  Not enough stretch for my liking.  Although they don&#x27;t break my hair, they don&#x27;t keep my hair up very well either!</li>
    <li> Thes ebands are cute and comfortable and they arrived rugby on time adding an extra plus!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine and somewhat breakable hair. I&#x27;m in that stage post pregnancy where you lose all the wonderful thick, shiny, super hair. These hair ties don&#x27;t add to the damage. They hold my hair tightly while minimizing damage. They come in cute colors and even some appropriate for my professional setting at work. I&#x27;ve ordered some as a gift because I am so pleased with them.</li>
    <li> OMGGGG!! I was so happy they arrived after 3 days of the purchase date! i mean how awesome is that right? I was so surprised! and the hair ties are flawless! cute and simple. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> These hair ties were amazing and were such a great price! I still have a lot that I haven&#x27;t used and they come in so many colors and designs they make me happy. They work great in my hair and I can use them for a very long time. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t leave creases in my hair like the old school bands do. Some of them stretched out a bit after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> I love these no-crease hair ties.  They really don&#x27;t leave a crease!  Plus, this is a great deal.  I see them at the store for almost $1 each.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try these but couldn&#x27;t find the elastic that wasn&#x27;t in bulk myself. I saw the price for twenty on amazon and decided to try it. I LOVE THEM adjustable, no crease and stylish I gave a few to my friend and will be ordering more for stocking stuffers for my girlfriends for the holidays. I got a wonderful array of colors and patterns this was a steel!!</li>
    <li> Love these! So cute and I didn&#x27;t realise they were stretchy so that is a massive bonus.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. No problems. Arrived on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very short. Not what I thought it would be. Would not order again</li>
    <li> This pack also reeked of petroleum, was able to soak them in bleach and soap then leave them out in the sun a few days to get the smell out. they worked fine after I got the smell out, but would not buy again from this manufacter for risk of another stinky batch.</li>
    <li> The hair ties arrived very quickly and was everything I expected. I read in the reviews before buying that there isn&#x27;t much patters so when I got it I wasn&#x27;t expecting them. Only thing I would change is half plain half pattern. But overall I love them!!</li>
    <li> cute, it&#x27;s a hair tie.. what can you really say about some hair ties? they held up my hair, I lost some, and cant find the rest. the usual.</li>
    <li> This product works great- it holds my hair just tight enough but not too tight to where it&#x27;s breaking it. Also, the company is great. My order was shy a band and they quickly responded to rectify the situation and even threw in a few extras. I will definately be purchasing from them again!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this product and never use regular hair tyes anymore. Cute to wear on your wrist as a little fashion accessory.</li>
    <li> Negative - I bought these hair ties under the impression that they would not leave a dent in my hair.  They came highly recommended by my friends but they still leave that annoying crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive - These hair ties are really cute and function well as wristbands.  They also don&#x27;t leave a mark on your wrist like elastic hair ties.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. My daughter and I love them. We use them everyday. Not damaging to hair like the other ponytail holders.</li>
    <li> These work really well, there is hardly a hair crease as with traditional hair bands.  They do look pretty stretched out after a few uses, so I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, but other than that, there&#x27;s a good choice of colors.  My girls are happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> Great fashion colors and prints, but most importantly they go in and come out SO smoothly... NO tugs whatsoever!</li>
    <li> 5 stars for:&lt;br /&gt;-timely delivery&lt;br /&gt;-product was met expectation&lt;br /&gt;-good variety of colors &amp; designs&lt;br /&gt;-great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend</li>
    <li> Cute! not bad for the price. I was missing one hair tie though. Pretty good quality. Super cute colors and prints.</li>
    <li> I really like these hair ties because they add a splash of color to a boring ponytail. I love wearing them as bracelets so i tend to just tie them twice around a black elastic so they don&#x27;t get stretched out.</li>
    <li> this is not for me - i have a lot of hair and this doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> I love them. I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Great price, fun colors, lots of variety, kept some, gave out some, something to fit everyone and everyday&#x27;s mood .</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  The price was right, and I received the hair ties in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> This  product came on time and was very satisfying i love this hair ties and they work really super well!</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I would get an assortment of mix designs and solids and in reality I got every dull solid color and two design patterns.. Disappointing, but they do help minimize the crease effect because I sweat in my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a runner with thick hair and I need something with grip to hold my hair back, especially on a long run.  After about 2-3 uses, these are stretched out so much I need to wrap them 4 times just to get them to stay in.  Road Runner Sports makes something called R-Gear Banzai Hair Ties that are everything these should be.  They don&#x27;t stretch out and they have a small pattern with grippers on them.  I was hoping these would be like them to get more ties for the money, but I&#x27;m going to have to go back to RR Sports.  These do have some cute patterns.</li>
    <li> Thought they were head bands</li>
    <li> These do the job well, and they come in such fun colors, it&#x27;s hard to resist. I love having the variety to choose from each day. Great value (far better than the &amp;#34;name-brand&amp;#34; ties).</li>
    <li> It makes putting your hair up cool. They are CLOSE to the Emi-Jay hair ties, but they&#x27;re not as soft or as stretchy (in reference to the printed ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things aside, you really cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I have very straight &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; hair and was worried these wouldn&#x27;t stay put, but they turned out to be great. I always keep an extra hair tie on my wrist, and unlike the typical rounded hair things, these don&#x27;t cut off your circulation or leave a mark (and they look cuter too).</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast on these, and I was so pleased when I received them.  I&#x27;ve seen these style hair pieces in retail stores and have really wanted to try them, but I&#x27;m always loosing my hair ties and didnt really want to spend much on them.&lt;br /&gt;These Kenz Laurenz ties are awesome though, and a great value.  I got a ton of cute colors and patterns to try out, and they&#x27;re so comfortable to wear on my wrist.  No painful crease mark is left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I wear them overnight in my thin, straight hair, and wake up with no crease in my hair either.</li>
    <li> So far so good! These work really well, don&#x27;t leave a crease, and don&#x27;t cause breakage.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how cute all these pattern were, even one with mustaches on them!!! My girls loved them, something to go with every outfit</li>
    <li> Great value for this set - these are super expensive everywhere else and they should be super cheap so thanks! Good colors, not too many patterns.. I think I got a zebra and stripes.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are the best. They don&#x27;t pull your hair at all, and I love the fun colors and patterns too!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought at all. These do not stretch</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t hold long hair in ponytail</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties and the price was fantastic! Will order from here again!</li>
    <li> Nice designs. The product met my expectations. However, the hair ties have a weird smell. Other than that, it was good.</li>
    <li> I love this kind of hair tie, but  they are difficult to find locally - or they are very expensive.  This was a great way to get lots to choose from.  I will likely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> These took quite a while to get here.  I thought there was a nice variety of colors.  Some had patterns like zig-zags and animal prints.  The reason I gave them three stars is because there are a few included that have glitter/sparkles.  These do not stretch like the others.  I cannot use these because they can&#x27;t be wrapped around my hair twice.  If I go around once then it is too loose to hold my hair.  This means that three out of the 12 are not usable.  To me, that is a waste of money and poor quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that one of them was yellow with black writing.  I don&#x27;t recall what it said, exactly.  But it was something that didn&#x27;t make sense.  The saying was clearly written as if it was incorrectly translated or a couple of words were left out of the press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones that aren&#x27;t glittery fit well and don&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.  But I wouldn&#x27;t order them again for this price now that I know that I can&#x27;t use all of them.</li>
    <li> Cute but deff creases my hair.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful! They do stretch out- it&#x27;s not much of a deal. They still work! You might have to retighten some of the knots when they arrive, but it&#x27;s very simple. I received 5 patterned hair ties total. Shipping was very fast. I&#x27;m very pleased with my order. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties!  Great price and a great variety.  There are so many to choose from and these don&#x27;t hurt your wrist to wear and they are cute in your hair!</li>
    <li> They came right on time, on the first estimated day of arrival! However--&lt;br /&gt;I was slightly disappointed at the lack of patterned designs I got (there were only 3-- giraffe print, tiger print, and a black&amp;white zig-zag print). However, my package did include a lot of cute bright colors, and a very necessary black (I have black hair), along with some other more neutral colors like a brown and a tan.&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was &amp;#34;Cute colors! But these don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ll last very long&amp;#34;. Then I tried tying my  hair up with one of them, and it actually seemed pretty strong. I don&#x27;t have very much hair, but it&#x27;s asian hair, which is thicker than other types of hair, and so I&#x27;m glad these cute little hair ties will hold my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that the knots weren&#x27;t tugged tight yet, leaving room for me to adjust their length so that they&#x27;d tie around my  hair easily and be wearable on my wrist without falling off or cutting off circulation. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like this product, and I hope they will last me a while.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Only thing is they could make some that are a little for people with very thick hair like mine but fine for my daughter.</li>
    <li> They are cute and do not break but they do get wrapped around my hair so bad that I have to cut it out : ( thats the only sad thing about this product .</li>
    <li> For me, these are the most perfect hair ties I have ever found.  I like them better than any other elastic out there for everyday use.  I do use a more rubber, traction like elastic to work out in.  The thing about these that I like is that they don&#x27;t leave that pony tail dent in your hair, so if you wear it all day then go out to dinner, your hair won&#x27;t have that bump.  They are also very soft and very pretty, colors to match anything.  I keep mine on my wrist when it is not in my hair.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter and give a few to her periodically as incentives.  She treasures them and has no idea how inexpensive they were!  Score!</li>
    <li> The hairbands are good except I wish it had more normal colors. Overtime the hair tires flat width gets folded and compromised, which will cause creases.</li>
    <li> Cute and fun but will need to use with an elastic ponytail holder. Ribbin doesn&#x27;t hold hair tight enough.</li>
    <li> I really like how gentle these are on my hair. I purchased these to pineapple overnight (works great) and started using regularly throughout the day too. They do stretch out a bit after time and from wrapping my hair too tightly but you get that with any hair tie. They only negative thing I could say about these are that there was a very strong chemical like odor when I opened the package but after letting them sit out for a couple of days it was gone.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t pull any hair out when they are removed.  Plus the assortment of colors and designs really appealed to my daughter!  There were also some neutral hair ties that I can use too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the product description halfway down the page before purchasing - only the descriptors at the top next to the product pictures.  So that was my bad, not a reflection on the owner&#x27;s advertising.  BUT in an effort to prevent someone else from making the same oversight, wanted to post a review to mention:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the measurements in the product description before purchasing.  The picture of the ties is so large that I thought these were going to be the size of the Ouchless &amp;#34;headbands&amp;#34;, not the ponytail bands.  I have 3c/4a hair and when my hair is loose I like to wear it in a fro with the hair pulled back to maybe the start of my crown.  These bands are nowhere near large enough to pull that off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if my hair was pressed or I was only trying to tie up a portion of my hair, these would be good.  The bands feel thick and sturdy enough to secure hair without snapping, and I had to do some serious picking to undo the knot the ends are tied into, which means they&#x27;re unlikely to unravel when under elastic stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll kkep these so that if I ever decide to press my hair or do ponytails, I have plenty of low hair stress bands.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whats &amp;#34;no crease&amp;#34; about this. they&#x27;re cute hair ties but they still crease your hair…also they get really thinned out and lose their width over several wears--kind of like they roll in on themselves. they don&#x27;t stay looking like a ribbon once tied and lose their shape. rather get a pack of regular scrunchies next time.</li>
    <li> These are great. Getting used everyday and hold up strong. Might need to order more colors! Wish these founded along time ago.</li>
    <li> TERRIFIC product...doesn&#x27;t pull hair...doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on hair when you remove them....all around AMAZING!  Would recommend &amp; purchase again &amp; again!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that breaks easily.  I can put my hair in a ponytail and pull these out without yanking out tons of my hair.  They also stay very stretchy.  I haven&#x27;t had one lose it&#x27;s stretch yet.  I get a lot of compliments on the different colors and patterns, as well.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
    <li> they stretch so easily and loose their elasticity quick as heck. if i could go back i wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this</li>
    <li> i loooveee thses cute little thiings :) they are very silky and dont hurt the hair! highly suggested :) :)</li>
    <li> Great hair ties that look cute and can be worn on the wrist as bracelets. They are a bit pricey when compared to purchasing them in a drug store, or to regular elastic hair ties, but they&#x27;re worth it with all the pretty patterns and colors. I love them!</li>
    <li> Hair ties came exactly as described and pictured.  I received two packs, one with an array of solid colors, and the other with many of the cute patterns shown and more not shown (adorable white one with black mustaches).  Definitely a great value compared to what local boutiques are selling these for right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also MUST brag on the customer service.  My 1st package arrived empty.  Our best guess, the summer heat had caused the adhesive to come undone on the package allowing the hair bands to escape before arrival.  I reported this to the seller.  Quickly, and without further questions or hesitation, a new package was on its way to me with their apologies.  New package arrived quickly and this time with all the adorable ties safely inside.  Thank you for such wonderful customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will DEFINITELY order from this company again!</li>
    <li> I personally was excited with the statement that these will not leave marks in your hair when you remove them.....not the case for me or my daughters. But they are cute and they work as a pony tail holder.</li>
    <li> These come in a ton of cool colors and they are very pretty. However, they stretch out super fast so be prepared to buy them again soon.</li>
    <li> Thought these would be easier on my thin smooth hair. But I have to wrap them so tight to keep them in and the knot pulls on my hair. It&#x27;s really ridiculous how much money they charge for these things. It&#x27;s not worth it for a silly elastic band. I&#x27;ll stick to the classics.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are fabulous! They are extremely helpful. I use them when I go to sleep and when I wake up my hair has no weird kinks in it! Wonderful! You can make them into bracelets too! They are fantastic and better for your hair! I highly recommend these hair ties</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of colors. I&#x27;d say the &amp;#34;no crease&amp;#34; lives up to it&#x27;s name, which is great. I have long (to the end of my back), thick hair and I can wrap it three times (it&#x27;s a bit tight I&#x27;ll admit). Also, the knot at the end of each one was just a little bit loose. I had to make sure with whichever one I was using to tighten it by pulling both sides (not the actual ends), but that&#x27;s not a big deal to me. I guess I was just expecting more magic or something, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and a horrible moth ball smell at first, but thank goodness it went away after one use.&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/10/15:&lt;br /&gt;I still use these same hair ties. I&#x27;m surprised they lasted this long! They have stretched out just a bit though over time and use. I&#x27;d bump it up to 4 stars because these are better than the ones I find at stores.</li>
    <li> These are a lot of fun and bright colors! The kids love these and they don&#x27;t pull hair as bad as the other!!</li>
    <li> love the bands, don&#x27;t love the colors.  just too bright for me. I also bought the neutral colors, and really like them a lot.</li>
    <li> What I expected. Very colorful, hold well and don&#x27;t pull hair when removing. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not as stretchy as normal elastic bands so they have the tendency to do that awkward fit where they really need to wrap a third time but won&#x27;t quite stretch that far. Maybe for thinner hair it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Very cute patterns and colors though.</li>
    <li> So comfortable! I often get headaches when I wear ponytails for too long. I get them FAR less when I use these. I also have curly hair, so it gets a kink very quickly with regular hair ties (whether straightened or natural). That isn&#x27;t an issue with these. I only wish they had some smaller ones. I have rather thin hair, so these can feel like there&#x27;s more material than I really need. That means, however, that if you have regular hair thickness or thick hair, they will work great for you!</li>
    <li> These were super small. Had to give to my daughter to play with.</li>
    <li> I love these creasless hair ties!  They are perfect for thick hair!  I got a great selection of colors and patterns! :)</li>
    <li> Just not what we expected, we thought they were full headbands, instead they are small for like a pony tail</li>
    <li> They work well and all different colors. I absolutely love them. They do not pull your hair when you take them out and they are great for this hot weather....</li>
    <li> I have very thin,fine hair. Normal elastic bands always left a big crease in my hair so if my hair was going up for anything it would have to stay up. With these I can put it up and take it down without the crease!</li>
    <li> loses elasticity fast</li>
    <li> I love these I recommend them to everyone all my friends love them too after they tried them. They don&#x27;t pull the hair at all Love them.</li>
    <li> Very good quality hair ties. I must say that I am very impressed with the quality of these hair ties of the price. I also like that they come in so many different colors. I would definitely repurchase from Kenz Laurenz in the future if I ever lose all 20 of these. :)</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as I was expecting, but I still like them much better than regular pony holders. I have thick hair and can get them around 3 times. They don&#x27;t slid out when I run. I got them for my daughter though who is 3 and they still kind of slide out of her hair. They don&#x27;t get tangled like regular holders though. So that&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when I need more instead of the others.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  And the variety was great!  I love how they are gentle on my hair.  And a great price compared to others on here.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Love them!!! They have become accessories as well as hair ties</li>
    <li> The hair ties arrived a couple days early, which was great! But the envelope that they were in was open, and the stick flap wouldn&#x27;t stay closed. But thankfully all 20 hair ties were still there, though they easily could have fallen out my accident.&lt;br /&gt;They all looked great, and are super cute, BUT. . . they smell really bad! Like a rubbery-plastic smell to them. It&#x27;s really bad. I washed them in the sink with some laundry detergent and the smell mostly came out of all of them, some of them still stink though.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed about the smell, since all the hair ties are so cute. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> and still make small creases in my hair, and some hair still comes out with them sometimes. But they&#x27;re way better than the goodie hair ties I was using that were so tight, and the creases come out way easier. AND they&#x27;re cute in the hair and as bracelets. I think they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> The hair ties came just as I expected them to be. There were five that were patterned, and the rest were just solids. I like using the solids better to match my outfits, so it worked out okay. Elastic hair ties do feel better than the average hair tie, but they wrinkle up a lot. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Cute and good variety.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping. I considered buying materials and making my own but there&#x27;s no way I could buy what I&#x27;d need to get a big assortment like this and I also don&#x27;t need 100 hair ties. I have super thick hair and love these things.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try something different than the boring old hair ties that i&#x27;m so used to. I love all the different colors and patterns, though they do fade with use. I have thick hair but had no trouble keeping it up on my head, even when I go running. They&#x27;re small but stretchy, I can use them on my thick ponytail or to tie the end of a braid. I imagine kids would adore these as well.</li>
    <li> These tiea are awesome, no crease, they hold up well, great colors, and 20 is enough since i lose them quite  a bit.</li>
    <li> These hair ties work well. They stay in and do not tangle. Our daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine and tangles easily. Other hair ties get caught and these don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are pretty good. I can&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t leave a crease in my hair but they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great variety at a good price. I love these things because they are easy to keep track of and look great---and NO hair breakage!</li>
    <li> I loved the colors and look of the hair ties, and they all varied, but they don&#x27;t tie as well as some of the no crease hair ties I&#x27;ve bought before. However, for the price that they&#x27;re at, they&#x27;re a really great buy.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Exactly what i wanted but i didnt want to pay emi jay prices. These were great quality and i would order them again if i ever run out :)</li>
    <li> A lot for a cheap price.. Im pleased</li>
    <li> these are ok but they stretch out a lot</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties, they are gentle on your hair and look good on your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t lose on these guys!</li>
    <li> Are great for adding elevation without creasing hair. I use it to keep hair up over night and curl it in the morning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all the rage to have these hair ties because most people don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s a hair tie until it&#x27;s in my hair! There were too many animal prints for my liking and they get stretched out a little too easily for my liking. But they do the job!</li>
    <li> Nothing outstanding about them. I have found others to be more attractive but these are still nice looking.  My daughter loves them.  Still to early to tell how they stand up to wear and tear. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice hair ties, especially for the price.  Only big complaint with these - they really were stinky, and even left my hair a little stinky.  I tried washing them in the washer, leaving them in the sun to dry and they still carry a smell.  But nice hair ties other than that!</li>
    <li> These hair ties are great!  They don&#x27;t leave ridges and yet they hold my hair.  Love them and will order more!</li>
    <li> I bought these in hopes of not having dents in my hair anymore and ho-ly cow these actually work! Plus, whenever I wear my hair up, I always have problems with getting headaches so I tend to not wear it up that often, but when I wear these, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re invisible. I can&#x27;t even feel them. I really want to try to make them on my own so I don&#x27;t have to buy more but these are super cute designs and they do custom orders!</li>
    <li> I use these ties practically every day! Great way to pull my hair back without pulling my hair out.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t know if it is my weird hair, but this product leaves a crease every time. Maybe less of a crease than others, but I just kinda don&#x27;t see the point. I like the price considering everywhere that I have seen these they are like $10 for 3, but they also don&#x27;t really hold up my hair unless I wrap them three times and then the crease is way worse. So I&#x27;m not really sure the point of this product, but A+ for the seller and the price.</li>
    <li> Love these, the patterns are adorable and they feel like they are nicer quality than the goody ones you can buy at walgreens.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors and the variety but they stretch out really quickly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a mustache print hair tie so I&#x27;m pretty sad. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars. I bought the pack because I really wanted a mustache print one! They&#x27;re really pretty hair ties and work well. I&#x27;m just sad I didn&#x27;t get a mustache print one :/</li>
    <li> These are amazing for the price, holds my hair so well (and I have a LOT of hair). Love the color selection, I literally have one to match every outfit! Higher quality than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> After using these I will never switch back to traditional hair ties. These are nice and stretchy, but tight enough that they keep my ponytail nice and snug! So cute and last forever! Love them!!</li>
    <li> CUTE but could not get past the toxic smell! Purchased as a gift but had to return.</li>
    <li> They still leave a crease. Don&#x27;t work as well are normal hair ties. But they&#x27;re very cute!</li>
    <li> My girls love these. Very vibrant colors and great quality.</li>
    <li> Great value.  They stretch out a little too easily though.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, and a great price!</li>
    <li> I received the order and noticed a foul smell so had to run them all through the washer and dryer (in a garment bag) which worked to take care of the smell. I have used a couple of them and for someone with really thick long hair they are a one time wear as they really stretch out.</li>
    <li> These are so cute and they add a different style for your hair than regular ties and they are great for young and old alike.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter, who just loved all the different varieties. They were very inexpensive, the quality was good,  and they made her happy, so I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair.  I guess it works best for fine hair.</li>
    <li> These do not hold hair. Good for over your normal hair tie, though.</li>
    <li> Love the selection of fun colors and patterns. They do not pull your hair when you take them out and they are great for hot weather. Overall, very happy with this!</li>
    <li> Work fine as hair ties but with my superfine hair they still leave a crease</li>
    <li> Negatives---they are way too small.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone gets them on their head&lt;br /&gt;  they smelled so strongly of moth balls, it was overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Positives---quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;  pretty ties.</li>
    <li> These literally are the best things ever. I&#x27;ve been using the same one for about a month &amp; it has not stretched out &amp; I have really thick hair. Right after you take it off it seems stretched out, but then after about 10 minutes it shrinks to original size</li>
    <li> I thought these were bigger but they were not at all. Two stars for fast shipping</li>
    <li> A soft, tangle-free hair tie. Our 4 year old who HATES hair ties lets us keep these in the longest.</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties! Whenever I straighten my hair and need to get it out of my face for a little I use these so that when I take it out, my hair doesn&#x27;t have a crease. These things work perfect and the price isn&#x27;t bad either!</li>
    <li> they came in different colors and patterns. Their size is good for everyone in my case they fit good. Good product what i expected-</li>
    <li> Perfect hair ties, very stretchy.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I adore them! They&#x27;re very cute and don&#x27;t pull my hair like normal ponytail holder!</li>
    <li> Awful...they stretch out enormously after a couple uses. The material is not good elastic either. I find scunchi/goody makes good ones. Returning these.</li>
    <li> Product arrived BEFORE expected delivery date! The hair ties are a gift, so I am not aware of how well they work. I received 2 bags with 10 hair ties in each (one had all solids &amp; one had all prints).</li>
    <li> Very professional. I had an issue with my order and they fixed it right away. The designs are also very pretty and wearable.</li>
    <li> Cute and doesn&#x27;t leave any crease.</li>
    <li> A must buy. Not only cute, but easy to use and manuveur.</li>
    <li> These Hair Ties have been a huge hit among all my friends!  My kids are wearing these daily as well as myself!</li>
    <li> Love these no crease hair ties! They hold hair in place gently &amp; when you remove them your hair is still smooth without creases!</li>
    <li> Very cute colored ties that don&#x27;t take my hair out, making it grow longer and be able to breathe.</li>
    <li> great colors-no frays</li>
    <li> Received many duplicate colors, and they weren&#x27;t representative of the ones shown.  Worse, after using for a couple of hours on damp hair my blond hair was STAINED and isn&#x27;t coming out with shampoo.  Negative 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love these hair ties!  They work wonderful!  They don&#x27;t slip either.</li>
    <li> i can always use these to match my outfit and have the colors for any occasion! I love these hair ties because they are REALLY comfortable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these types of hair ties before, but they were all in neutral colors so I wanted more of a variety. I usually don&#x27;t like buying from third party suppliers, because it usually takes forever to receive the product. However, I was pleased when these shipped out right away and I received them within 4 days, faster than my amazon order :) The hair ties themselves are satisfactory, pretty much the same thing I bought from sephora but more of a bargain. They dont snag or anything and I think they&#x27;re cuter than regular ties. The colors are really pretty (there were a few neutral colors too in case that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for) and I&#x27;m pleased with the prints I got, especially when I saw the same prints going for 8$ for a pack of 4 on a different site.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with these, same quality you&#x27;d find anywhere else but for a much better price. I would really recommend this seller and would buy from them again if I ever run out or want to buy some more for someone else.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and that they can act as a bracelet since I always have one on my wrist!</li>
    <li> Perfectly stretchy. Not too much. Not too little. Holds the hair to perfection. Colors are great. Hundreds of choices.</li>
    <li> These bands are great, just make sure to pull the ends tightly before using them otherwise they may come undone.</li>
    <li> These are great - I love the variety of colors and designs. I put my hair up / down several times throughout the day and these do not add that lovely crease in my hair. The seller sent these right away and I will definitely purchase again when I lose all my hair ties.</li>
    <li> Ordered it on Wednesday, received on Saturday.  Cute hair ties with great quality and super fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Very good did not take long to get at all and she gives you a coupon! Definatley will be ordering from her again!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the shipping was very fast! When I run out of these I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my wife before vacation. We were afraid they wouldn&#x27;t come in time because we were leaving 5 days later. But they came and she loves them.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find these locally, but its ridiculous paying 5 bucks for only 3 of them. The shipping for this item was super fast, but untrackable by the way. I didn&#x27;t get any double colors and there were more solids than prints but that didn&#x27;t bother me. Some examples of prints I got: black and white chevron, leopard print, white with black mustaches, pink with love and hears written on it. Some of these ties are looser than others and the knots are a bit bulky compared to other types of these that i have bought, but i consider that a plus. If the knots are looser to begin with its easier for you to adjust these to fit your writes tightly. Overall very happy with this, I might even order another pack!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this is a fairly new review I just got these in the mail 20 minutes ago and I am not expert on this product whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;my biggest problem with these is up all of the hair ties are of a different length. They also smell bad of chemicals when they come out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;They work great however so that is the only problem. Nice assortment of colors and prints. Only got 5 prints and the rest were solids. No repeats of colors. So overall, they are top quality, but watch out for the chemically smell (It is really bad!)</li>
    <li> They arrived fast!! I love them. I use them all time! They have pretty colors and designs! Love them! They are awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I could not find any locally that were a good enough price, but I really wanted to try them. They work well, but do stretch out after about three uses. They are very cute and come in a nice assortment of patterns/colors. They live up to their name, but be aware that they do stretch out easily!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughters and also use them myself, I like the price and the quality seems equal to the most expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I loved the first ones I bought of these in a 5 back so I had to buy more. When there arrived they seemed to be a stiffer material than the original ones I purchased.</li>
    <li> Just designer hair ties. They&#x27;re cute. Don&#x27;t try to use them as head bands, you will be disappointed. Only use to tie hair.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and very good quality</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! Having thick hair, I always have a problem finding crease-less hair ties that actually wrap around three times and keep my hair up. That said, these do an amazing job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will order again!</li>
    <li> I love the ties! They work great on my hair. I hated that I got so many of the same colors, however.  A forth of them were dark green. Really?</li>
    <li> Love the colors and they work really well!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I workout during my lunch breaks at work. My colleagues are always impressed with how great my hair looks (i.e. no creases!). My hair is long, fine and pretty straight. I haven&#x27;t used these when I&#x27;ve flat-ironed my hair, but for the most part they get the job done!</li>
    <li> Very upset I got this set as a gift and the 2 main ones I wanted (cheetah print and the mustache print) were NOT in there. I was under the understanding I&#x27;d be receiving the exact ones pictured and did not. VERY DISAPPOINTED as those two were honestly the WHOLE reason I asked for the pack. ...</li>
    <li> These are great!! Really good deal- I&#x27;ve had these for about a year now and they have held up really well. Lots of variety and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love these hair bands.  They don&#x27;t crease my hair after wearing.  My only complaint is that they are too expensive.</li>
    <li> Nice color I like it!</li>
    <li> What can I say..... serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> super cute and work very well. Great for thick hair. The shipping was fast as well.</li>
    <li> Pretty happy with these...  I didn&#x27;t have any repeated ones.. they are very durable.. I am ordering a second set because I lost most of them already.. :(</li>
    <li> These hair ties smell like gasoline!  Seriously.  I put them outside for a day to see if the smell would dissipate but, nope, they smell so badly I&#x27;m going to return them.  Or throw them out.  I don&#x27;t want them anywhere near my hair.  Pew.</li>
    <li> These are cute but they stretch out almost immediately and you will need a stronger elastic to hold your hairstyles.  They are great patterns and colors!</li>
    <li> I love these hair ties! Every time I see them in store, they&#x27;re usually rather expensive, but at this price they come out to 50 cents each. Although I was a bit dismayed that no tracking information was provided, they arrived only two days after being shipped and in good packaging. They come in two packs of 10, but I think there was a packaging error for my order, because one of my packs had 11 (I&#x27;m not complaining!) I&#x27;m very satisfied with the variety I received - 19 solid colors of practically every color of the rainbow, and 2 patterned. The quality of the hair ties themselves is also very good. They&#x27;re comfortable on my wrist and when I put them in my hair, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting pressure on my hair or pulling strands out. I have a problem where I am always losing my hair ties, so I will definitely be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> Cute. Don&#x27;t exactly not leave a crease but they leave less of one than regular ponytail holders and they are much cuter.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product!!</li>
    <li> These are inexpensive alternatives to purchasing the brand names. So far I haven&#x27;t experienced them wearing out, but all hair ties stretch with use over time, so for the price I think they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> they were ok I&#x27;ve gotten some better ones from Etsy for a better price but overall they stretched too much and i didn&#x27;t much like the glitter</li>
    <li> It seems silly that a hair tie can be so transformative but it is!  I have a lot of fine hair which ends up being fairly heavy.  With traditional hair rubber bands I was constantly tying and retying my ponytail.  These hair ties have changed all of that.  They hold my hair in place and make my ponytail feel relatively weightless.  No crease in my hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a great variety of ties and a bonus one.  Thanks Kenz Laurenz!</li>
    <li> I have been using scrunchies every day for approximately forever, and never thought I would find anything better.  Peer pressure finally persuaded me to try what &amp;#34;all the other kids are wearing&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m kind of wondering what took me so long.  They haven&#x27;t yet lost any elasticity, look great in both my hair and on my wrist, and are the perfect size (I already am annoyed with how bulky all my old scrunchies are!)&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the colors/styles are quite random, which means that approx. half of them don&#x27;t match anything I own/wear.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of colors. Hold the hair well and comfortably.  I gave 4 stars because they do crease.  Not like a rubber band or a scrunchie but don&#x27;t expect to have your hair up in this during the day and think you can let your hair down with that bump in the back. I like them because they aren&#x27;t tight, they hold well and not obnoxiously large. For the price I will probably get another pack.  They do get misplaced easy in my house and well they tend to scrunch together not looking as fresh after a few uses</li>
    <li> I really like the variety of colors...just got them today so i can&#x27;t speak to how well they hold up but i can say they work great for somewhat thin hair. I usually have to redo my ponytail a couple times throughout the day with most bands;  these are staying put...so far so good &#x3D;)) I did take the band off to brush hair late in the evening &amp; noticed no hair loss from these!!</li>
    <li> These ties have very little elasticity to them which makes them tough to use. Wrapping multiple times to get into a pony that will stay defeats the purpose of the ties as it still leaves creases.</li>
    <li> For the price? Just ok</li>
    <li> My hair creases very easily and these actually do not leave much of a crease; however, they do pull my hair out SIGNIFICANTLY when I try to gently take them out.  I would rather have a crease and no brake-age.  I will be looking for another product.</li>
    <li> They are okay. The colors didn&#x27;t have much variety and they seem to lose their stretch quicker than other hair ties I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> These have awesome quality. Colors are great and their stretch and strength holds my hair without taking my hair out.</li>
    <li> Came on time in good packaging!. Very sturdy on my hair. I have really thick curly natural  hair and they are awesome and gentle on my hair.I like the different colors and prints.</li>
    <li> so cute, won&#x27;t pull my daughters hair. she loves the designs.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping love the hair ties!</li>
    <li> I love these hair ties. They spice up an outfit and don&#x27;t damage your hair. However, I wish that the colors came in pairs instead of singles.</li>
    <li> Live it. So many different colors.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast Shipping!  Will Do Business with again!! A+++</li>
    <li> Smelled so bad but cheap and cute colors. I&#x27;m just washing and soaking them to help get the smell out!</li>
    <li> They smelled awful!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps my ponytail in place while I workout and doesn&#x27;t hurt when you take you take it off.  However, it doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s pretty shape after the first use but still holds my hair</li>
    <li> These are the BEST hair ties! Really good price (I&#x27;ve seen these no crease hair ties sell for $5 each). They really DON&#x27;T crease your hair (some hair ties claim they don&#x27;t but they do). I love all the cute colors and patterns and once I lose all of these hair ties I&#x27;ll definitely buy more from this same company/seller.</li>
    <li> I got these to give as gifts for a function as well as for my little girl - she loves them! They are pretty, hold her silky hair firmly, and as an added bonus, are ouchless!</li>
    <li> Love these they are awesome and come in great colors</li>
    <li> Too big for my daughter, too small for me. No use.</li>
    <li> Lies. these still leave a crease. If they don&#x27;t leave a crease, I can guarantee that it is not holding your hair in a pony tail! Stretch out in about 7-10 times of use, but still usable!</li>
    <li> These hair ties came on time in the exact color shown. The quality appears to be good. Only negative thing was the smell which was very chemical like. After spraying them down with some febreeze spray and letting them air dry they were good to go.</li>
    <li> All local stores sell these for 3 for $5.  I will order more of these!  My girls love that they can put their hair down and no crease.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and designs. It wraps my hair so well!</li>
    <li> I love all the colors! They are so bold, no creases, and you will get an extra one just for buying, it&#x27;s black and White on it and it says kenz laurenz on it, so you will get 21 no crease hair ties. I recommend and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> These are the only bands that I will use in my hair. They don&#x27;t pull or rip my hair like the metal ones. They are really cute and stay put.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations, and now I have lots to choose from, besides I shard some with my Granddaughters! :-)</li>
    <li> The girls loved them!</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties!!!! Seller was great also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these again in hopes that only this batch smelled bad because they are cute and work.  They are great and work great BUT they smell terrible!!!  I&#x27;ve washed them, left them in sudsy water for a day and left them on the counter to dry.  They still smell awful!!  Will need to return.  They even make my hair smell the same awful smell when I went to bed and took the tie out.  ugh  They are cute but if they are all like this, then Amazon needs to open a pack.  Hopefully this is a one bad batch only.</li>
    <li> Perfect set with the right colors for every outfit, my granddaughter will love these!!</li>
    <li> I bought one pack for my daughter. It looks beautiful and comfortable for her.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are really pretty but it doesn&#x27;t set a ponytail well. It&#x27;s not good for thick hair</li>
    <li> I love them, great for your hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased these adorable hair ties a couple weeks ago.  They were carefully packaged and arrived before the expected shipping date.  I also want to comment on the exceptional customer service I received.  Shortly after I purchased these ties, I noticed something on the site.  I contacted the seller and my question was answered and resolved immediately without any hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, regarding the ties...  I LOVE THEM!  They came in two packs of 10, and they are a range of colors and patterns.  I think I have maybe one duplicate color (a light pink), but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The ties are made of a stretchy fabric, almost like spandex or rayon.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m describing that accurately, but the material is such that I feel safe pulling it out of my hair without ripping 20 hairs with it.  Some hairbands seem to attract hairballs, but these don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, the material is stretchy, so depending on how thick your hair is or how much hair you want to tie back, you will definitely be able to wrap it twice, and likely a third.  My hair isn&#x27;t super thick or thin, and I wrap it 3 times, which gives me a really tight ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing about these hair ties is you can wear them on your wrist and it actually looks really cute.  If you buy a bag of 20, surely you can find one color to match your outfit.  It doubles as hair tie and bracelet.  Also, it&#x27;s stretchy enough that it doesn&#x27;t cut off circulation around your wrist, but tight enough so that it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend!  Quality product(s) for a great price!</li>
