    <li> My daughter has be looking for Elige which can not be purchased at Mary Kay because it was discontinued as this company loves to do. Sometimes this practice is useful and other times it is not because some people are loyal to a specific produce and will buy it for the rest of their lives. My daughter was so happy that Amazon.com allows the story of the love of a sense to live on until the supply and demand runs dry. Thanks Amazon.com for your support!!</li>
