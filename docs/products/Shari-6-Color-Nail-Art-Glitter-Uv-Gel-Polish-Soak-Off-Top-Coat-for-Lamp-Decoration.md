      <li>Awesome nail gel!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>Great colors!</li>
      <li>Well I LOVE THEM!!!!</li>
      <li>This had a very good price.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and great customer service on the seller.  </li>
      <li>and they work just great</li>
      <li>For starters, the price can&#x27;t be beat and the product is amazing!</li>
      <li>It is a good kit for the price.</li>
      <li>well, that was surprising.</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>Great glitter gel, nice colors</li>
      <li>I do my own nails.</li>
      <li>These are the best gel polish I can find the colors are vibrant and strong.</li>
      <li>The get though needs to be done in more than 3 coats to get the color to show.</li>
      <li>I will tell u more when I try them.</li>
      <li>one or two color repeats and I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
      <li>love the glitter!EXCELLENT FOR DECORATIVE NAILS...</li>
      <li>I LOVE these gels</li>
      <li>If you are accustomed to using Gelish or Gelaze type products be prepared: the outcome texture feels more like acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re going to do your own gel nails, which I highly recommend, please educate yourself.</li>
      <li>I love them, all of the colors are beautiful and the gel is thick</li>
      <li>With colored gels like these YOU must stir the gel to mix and distribute the pigment too get the true color of the gel.</li>
      <li>, some of the glitter was chunky, even after the top coat was applied and cured under UV light; however, after a quick buff and new top coat application, the results were professional quality!</li>
      <li>There are SO many tutorial videos out there that can teach you how to do pretty much anything.</li>
      <li>The only thing is, after so many coats, it then comes off your nail within 2 days really easy.</li>
      <li>I applied my top coat, and while it helped, you can still see and feel the consistancy after being completely cured and alcholed.</li>
      <li>Any who buy these fun glitters...</li>
      <li>if it didn&#x27;t work out, well my daughter would have some fun with them....</li>
      <li>so I only have to top coat it after I cure the color.</li>
      <li>I love putting the glitter over the solid colors but they work alone as well.</li>
      <li>Will add more later as I try each one.</li>
      <li>I opened the first bottle and touched the gel.</li>
      <li>Each container isn&#x27;t labeled, so you pretty much have to go through all of them to find the color you want.  </li>
      <li>I really like it for a beginners kit.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>the only problem is that some of them come opened and you have to clean it up....</li>
      <li>the uv light has too penetrate too dry polish.</li>
      <li>First off this had to be resent to me, first package never left china.</li>
      <li>This product is far from cheap in quality, I could tell the second</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t done more than a small tip with one color.</li>
      <li>but once I did sample dots for the tops of my pots, I realized I had less duplicates than I originally thought.</li>
      <li>/&gt;As far as the size of the package..</li>
      <li>About 1/3 of them were duplicate colors, So far no trouble getting them set</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick yet the texture of the glitter is fine</li>

<li> I never would have waited so long to buy if I had known what I was getting. ENOY!</li>
<li> It is clear with very little glitter</li>
<li> When I read a previous review, it was obvious that she wasn&#x27;t using the correct voltage.</li>
<li> haven&#x27;t attempted removal yet as I only received this product less than a week ago, but I&#x27;ve done two manis and one pedi</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t spread on smooth with the brush, you can see that the gel is thick and clumpy even with the smallest amount applied in a thin layer.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> The only negative would have to be the duplicate colors, I have 3 golds, I rather have 3 clears than golds.</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m being optimistic, but I did 2 or 3 coats of the dark purple glitter on my friend&#x27;s finger and toe nails</li>
<li> I used this gel with a bonder, base and top coat from another company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you are using a lamp less than 36w</li>
<li> A waste.</li>
<li> Have a few color that are doble but that don&#x27;t bather me.</li>
<li> Finally got around to opening all of them, they got a bit of a smell so if your someone wary to scents not a good choice.</li>
<li> The negative reviews where by people who don&#x27;t have a clue what they are doing.</li>
<li> I have no doubt each tub will do at least 10 mani/pedis.</li>
<li> /&gt;Ok, sorry for the CRAZY long review</li>
<li> You MUST apply any uv gel product in thin layers.</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> Which isn&#x27;t always a bad thing, because gel that stays on, ruins your nails, this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> you wrote bad reviews for the product</li>
<li> Bad maybe like a one time use product soon as I received it and saw the size I didn&#x27;t  even bother opening to see the rest just returned.</li>
<li> There are some bad reviews, and that&#x27;s because people don&#x27;t know how to use the product.</li>
<li> These are awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> You get what you pay for! First off this had to be resent to me, first package never left china. These things happen though! Finally got around to opening all of them, they got a bit of a smell so if your someone wary to scents not a good choice. About 1/3 of them were duplicate colors, So far no trouble getting them set but I haven&#x27;t done more than a small tip with one color. Will add more later as I try each one.</li>
    <li> There supossed to be 36 different colors, and there are 12 colors then are the same colors...</li>
    <li> I love putting the glitter over the solid colors but they work alone as well. Great colors! I only have one or two color repeats and I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty, but the gel is thick and clumpy, even after warming the container. It doesn&#x27;t spread on smooth with the brush, you can see that the gel is thick and clumpy even with the smallest amount applied in a thin layer. Even after curing, you can tell how lumpy it is. I applied my top coat, and while it helped, you can still see and feel the consistancy after being completely cured and alcholed. I only tried 2 of the colors, however, they were both that way.</li>
    <li> Freaking amazed by this product!  I figured for the price,  if it didn&#x27;t work out, well my daughter would have some fun with them.... Well I LOVE THEM!!!! if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing then don&#x27;t do it... Not the sellers fault you bought something you don&#x27;t have a clue to use.... Just saying.  Any who buy these fun glitters... Wear just the way it&#x27;s made or layer with others....</li>
    <li> I am obsess with nails... I do my own nails. This had a very good price. Fast delivery. I haven&#x27;t tried any yet bc it just arrived. Yesterday. Have a few color that are doble but that don&#x27;t bather me. I will tell u more when I try them. I recommend that before u do anything go to you tuve and get ur self inform on how to do gel. Learn tricks from different videos... And I takes a lot of practice... Good luck</li>
    <li> A few duplicates but in such a large box with no color labels it is to be expected</li>
    <li> These are the best gel polish I can find the colors are vibrant and strong. You know people you wrote bad reviews for the product well I DON&#x27;T AGREE  with you. The negative reviews where by people who don&#x27;t have a clue what they are doing. You MUST apply any uv gel product in thin layers. With colored gels like these YOU must stir the gel to mix and distribute the pigment too get the true color of the gel. Colored gels takes a bit longer too cure cause of the pigment the uv light has too penetrate too dry polish. Use thin layers and by the second coat you will see the true color after you cure for two minutes. Guys research nail art before you go and get things you know nothing about then complain when it dont work. It works you don&#x27;t know what you doing. I LOVE these gels and I got the ones with glitter and they work just great</li>
    <li> I love them, all of the colors are beautiful and the gel is thick so I only have to top coat it after I cure the color. If you are using a lamp less than 36w the gel will not set. When I read a previous review, it was obvious that she wasn&#x27;t using the correct voltage. This product is far from cheap in quality, I could tell the second I opened the first bottle and touched the gel. It&#x27;s thick yet the texture of the glitter is fine so there&#x27;s no lumps and bumps. Excellent product and great customer service on the seller.  The only negative would have to be the duplicate colors, I have 3 golds, I rather have 3 clears than golds.</li>
    <li> Bad maybe like a one time use product soon as I received it and saw the size I didn&#x27;t  even bother opening to see the rest just returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for at home use. For starters, the price can&#x27;t be beat and the product is amazing! I used this gel with a bonder, base and top coat from another company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, some of the glitter was chunky, even after the top coat was applied and cured under UV light; however, after a quick buff and new top coat application, the results were professional quality! (Wish I could attach a photo.. grrr).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the size of the package..well, that was surprising. It was smaller than I anticipated, even after reading reviews. Once I used the product, I realized that a little really does go a LONG way! I have no doubt each tub will do at least 10 mani/pedis. Maybe I&#x27;m being optimistic, but I did 2 or 3 coats of the dark purple glitter on my friend&#x27;s finger and toe nails and you couldn&#x27;t tell I used any product whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t attempted removal yet as I only received this product less than a week ago, but I&#x27;ve done two manis and one pedi and I&#x27;m just blown away! If you are accustomed to using Gelish or Gelaze type products be prepared: the outcome texture feels more like acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as duplicate colors go, there were a few. I believe I wound up with 3 of the same gold tone and 2 of a blue tone. Initially I thought I received something like six of the same golds and blues but once I did sample dots for the tops of my pots, I realized I had less duplicates than I originally thought. (WOAH... I&#x27;m a poet)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, sorry for the CRAZY long review but if you&#x27;re going to do your own gel nails, which I highly recommend, please educate yourself. There are SO many tutorial videos out there that can teach you how to do pretty much anything. I only went nuts on this review because I wish I had this information before ordering. I never would have waited so long to buy if I had known what I was getting. ENOY!</li>
    <li> It is a good kit for the price. The get though needs to be done in more than 3 coats to get the color to show. It is clear with very little glitter but after several coats you can see it. The only thing is, after so many coats, it then comes off your nail within 2 days really easy. Which isn&#x27;t always a bad thing, because gel that stays on, ruins your nails, this doesn&#x27;t. I really like it for a beginners kit.</li>
    <li> my wife has used them all the time</li>
    <li> These are awful. Poor quality. Used one color once. Stayed on for about ten minutes. Never again. A waste.</li>
    <li> Each container isn&#x27;t labeled, so you pretty much have to go through all of them to find the color you want.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Great glitter gel, nice colors the only problem is that some of them come opened and you have to clean it up....</li>
    <li> love the glitter!EXCELLENT FOR DECORATIVE NAILS...</li>
    <li> Awesome nail gel! There are some bad reviews, and that&#x27;s because people don&#x27;t know how to use the product. PLEASE learn how to use this before purchasing.</li>
