      <li>I notice the most difference when I use the product at night</li>
      <li>I love this lip balm.  </li>
      <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>and so glad I grabbed this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d use more often during the day, except I like a bit more glam and gloss when I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It just means that it works better if you dint expose your lips to any moisture for a while.</li>
      <li>I tried a sample in the store and in a matter of minutes my lips felt so much better.</li>
      <li>Will buy more tubes soon.  </li>
      <li>I love C.O. Bigelow</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>You have to use it dutifully every night to get results and maintain them, but that&#x27;s easy to do when you wake up with the most supple, plush skin on your lips.</li>
      <li>product is awesome, but I often can get a better price for it when there is a deal at Bath and Body Works or other retailers, hence the four instead of five star rating.</li>
      <li>they had a buy 2 get 1 free deal when I went. &#x3D; )</li>
      <li>My lips were so smooth when I woke up this morning.</li>
      <li>so theres also a light cocoa butter smell to it.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this balm at night I have found my lips have been smooth</li>
      <li>I love putting it on right before I go to bed</li>
      <li>This night balm is pure magic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice flavor/scent and keeps lips hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>Love it, much cheaper here than the mall.</li>

      <li>I rarely write product reviews</li>
      <li>It is easy to put on and leaves my lips smooth the next morning and throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>In general, I like the C.O. Bigelow lip products, but there are two products I LOVE.</li>
      <li>(most likely because I&#x27;m not talking, eating, drinking, and wiping the product off in general like I would during the day) and by the morning, the difference I notice is significant!</li>
      <li>My friend bought me my first tube almost 2 years ago and I am still using it.</li>
      <li>Intense hidration !</li>
      <li>This is the only balm I can stand using, No waxy residue, Doesn&#x27;t make lips feel more chapped when it wears off.  </li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and even though I try my best to stay hydrated my lips are always dry.</li>
      <li>and my lips were so much healthier and smoother.</li>
      <li>Very</li>
      <li>This product was very sticky.</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing compares with it</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I absolutely ADORE this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is PERFECT for those who hate to apply sticky and/or sweet smelling balm before going to bed.</li>

      <li>High quality lip balm that will make a difference in your lip hydration.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I love that this product helps fill in the lines in my lips, especially when they&#x27;re really dry (which happens a lot).</li>
      <li>It stays on and within a few days, the most stubborn, chronically chapped area on my lip has healed &amp; is now soft!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
      <li>My skin (including my lips) get super dry in the winter.</li>
      <li>I bought this for the first time  yesterday and used it last night.</li>
      <li>I used to get really chapped lips, especially in winter.</li>
      <li>This completely prevents the dryness from occurring.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m self-conscious about the lines in my lips and this is a product I will absolutely keep coming back to.</li>
      <li>This stuff is very greasy and leaves gunk on your lips when you wake up the next day.</li>
      <li>Love this night balm because it is thick and keeps my lips moist.  </li>
      <li>WOW extrodinary results I live in rough weather country in the heart of the Dakota&#x27;s and let me tell you high winds, sub zero temps can cause severe lip chapped conditions</li>
      <li>The price is a bit steep but you only need a little bit for full coverage.</li>
      <li>Ive been using it at night and when I wake up in the morning not only is some of it still on my lips, there really soft and plump.</li>
      <li>plus I&#x27;ve just moved to Colorado where it&#x27;s high altitude, dry winter weather for months.  </li>
      <li>I usually use it during the day when I&#x27;m hanging out at home or, of course, right before bed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I always have chapped lips and I read a review on this night balm so I decided to give it a try.  I rarely write product reviews but I love this stuff.  I just put it on at night before bed and it works wonderfully.  No more chapped lips for me!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every single night before bed. I&#x27;m completely addicted to how smooth and supple my lips are every morning. When the winter is really terrible, I even use it throughout the day. It isn&#x27;t sticky or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is awesome, but I often can get a better price for it when there is a deal at Bath and Body Works or other retailers, hence the four instead of five star rating.</li>
    <li> Amazing lip balm, by far the best stuff I have ever used. I put it on before I go to sleep &amp; in the morning it&#x27;s still on. Intense hidration !</li>
    <li> Love it, much cheaper here than the mall.</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE this product. I have had the worst peeling lips for years now, and I tend to pull off the skin which leaves painful scabs on my lips and is rather unsightly. I have tried every organic lip treatment and everything else in between, nothing has worked. But this, this is a miracle in a little blue bottle! You have to use it dutifully every night to get results and maintain them, but that&#x27;s easy to do when you wake up with the most supple, plush skin on your lips. The consistency is thick, so if you&#x27;re a rambunctious sleeper, it won&#x27;t rub off. It has a yummy flavor to it, too!</li>
    <li> I use this every night. I had horribly chapped lips, but when I started using this I would wake up and my lips were so much healthier and smoother. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> works great.  last all day or night</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time  yesterday and used it last night. My lips were so smooth when I woke up this morning. I love it! The tingly mint feels great on my lips. I&#x27;d recommend buying it from Bath &amp; Body works, its cheaper &amp; they had a buy 2 get 1 free deal when I went. &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a number of medicated lip balms for years!!! and my lips would constantly be peeling and cracking.  Within a week of using this Bigelow night balm, (night and day,) my lips have been smooth and subtle like never before!! plus I&#x27;ve just moved to Colorado where it&#x27;s high altitude, dry winter weather for months.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least ten drugstore lip balms and none of them worked.  This night balm is pure magic.  So disappointed that Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued selling it in stores.</li>
    <li> Small trial size is what you get.</li>
    <li> I got this in a Birch Box. I live in a very dry climate and even though I try my best to stay hydrated my lips are always dry. Since I&#x27;ve started using this balm at night I have found my lips have been smooth and I have been using a lot less lip balm during the day! The balm stays on all night and I love the freshness of it! I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This moisturizes without being greasy and is handy for travel. It is not terribly long-lasting but I haven&#x27;t found any that are.</li>
    <li> This balm provides great moisturizing protection and a smooth shiny glide, never sticky.  I actually use this throughout the day and not at night at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent night lip balm</li>
    <li> High quality lip balm that will make a difference in your lip hydration. This lip balm is great to keep in your bedside table to apply every night. It&#x27;s a nice flavor/scent and keeps lips hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> BEST LIP BALM EVER. I love putting it on right before I go to bed and it lasts all night. Keeps my lips moisturized well into the next day. I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
    <li> This is the only balm I can stand using, No waxy residue, Doesn&#x27;t make lips feel more chapped when it wears off.  It&#x27;s also nice and glossy.  I wear it day and night.</li>
    <li> this is the best lip balm i have ever used.  Absolutely nothing compares with it</li>
    <li> Works great. Cheaper at bath and body works but it&#x27;s always sold out. Now I know why!</li>
    <li> In general, I like the C.O. Bigelow lip products, but there are two products I LOVE. The Cinnamint gloss and this Night Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is PERFECT for those who hate to apply sticky and/or sweet smelling balm before going to bed. Conditions your lip through the night without an overpowering taste or smell. I usually use it during the day when I&#x27;m hanging out at home or, of course, right before bed. I&#x27;d use more often during the day, except I like a bit more glam and gloss when I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints and so glad I grabbed this product.</li>
    <li> I can not go without this! I used to get really chapped lips, especially in winter. Like every other reviewer has said, this balm prevents chapped lips and heals without the bad medicated balm taste or smell. I think it&#x27;s a bit cheaper at Bath and Bodyworks. This is my must have product.</li>
    <li> I love that this product helps fill in the lines in my lips, especially when they&#x27;re really dry (which happens a lot). I notice the most difference when I use the product at night (most likely because I&#x27;m not talking, eating, drinking, and wiping the product off in general like I would during the day) and by the morning, the difference I notice is significant! I&#x27;m self-conscious about the lines in my lips and this is a product I will absolutely keep coming back to. For me, it makes a dramatic difference in the appearance of my lips and I&#x27;m very glad I happened to come across this product.</li>
    <li> great product but i recommend buying it from bath and body works for a cheaper price</li>
    <li> Tried soooo many products! Search is over.  I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP mask at night. It is the BEST balm I have found. For those not familiar with CPAP therapy, you have air blowing on your lips all night......ugh! This completely prevents the dryness from occurring.</li>
    <li> I went out with my mom&#x27;s friend to the mall and said my lips were feeling a bit chapped. So, my mom&#x27;s friend took me to bath and body works and we asked the lady there about a really good lip balm. She showed us this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the word NIGHT. It just means that it works better if you dint expose your lips to any moisture for a while. (Such as water and saliva.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think that this is a rather small size for a lip balm but actually, you only need a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm tastes GREAT!!! It kinda tastes like cake. Very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the application and the amount it gives you. Like I said, you only need a little bit and the applicator DOES NOT help you with that. Otherwise, 5 stars all the way!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, it&#x27;s cheaper at Bath and Body Works than it is on Amazon. It&#x27;s 7.50 at Bath and Body Works.</li>
    <li> Love this night balm because it is thick and keeps my lips moist.  They have not been dry since I started using this.  Great product.  Will buy more tubes soon.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I wish it had not be discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product was very sticky. I did not like it at all. Maybe I bought a dud but will not repurchase. Cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also tried every lip balm out there &amp; nothing has worked as well as this one. It stays on and within a few days, the most stubborn, chronically chapped area on my lip has healed &amp; is now soft! I&#x27;ll never be without this!</li>
    <li> My skin (including my lips) get super dry in the winter. I also have a habit of biting and picking at my lips making them worse, To the point where people have asked me &amp;#34;what happened to your lip?&amp;#34; This...lip balm...is....amazing. a little bit goes a long way. Ive been using it at night and when I wake up in the morning not only is some of it still on my lips, there really soft and plump. You can use it throughout the day but I havent yet. It has shea butter in it so theres also a light cocoa butter smell to it. I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  $7.50 at bath and body works</li>
    <li> Whoa! I tried a sample in the store and in a matter of minutes my lips felt so much better. It has 5% shea butter and really makes it better. Other medicated lip balms have a horrible smell and normally don&#x27;t work. With this, it is completely opposite. I use this every morning, afternoon, and night. I can&#x27;t live without this! My lips aren&#x27;t cracked and peeling anymore!!!</li>
    <li> The best lip conditioning on the market!!!!  Solid gold.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is the absolute best lip balm ever.  For years I have tried lip balms for use overnight and nothing compares to this one.  It is easy to put on and leaves my lips smooth the next morning and throughout the day.  And one tube lasts a long time!  If you have been looking for a night balm this is the one!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.  It refreshes and rehydrates my lips overnight!</li>
    <li> This is the best night time lip balm that was ever made.  I have been using this stuff for years, and just love it.  I definitely recommend giving this stuff a try, for yourself!</li>
    <li> WOW extrodinary results I live in rough weather country in the heart of the Dakota&#x27;s and let me tell you high winds, sub zero temps can cause severe lip chapped conditions, I am a lip blam junky and I have tried every lip treatment known to man!!! seriously!!!&lt;br /&gt;from balms to glosses to specialized treatments....this little blue tube is the extra extrodinary lip healing treatment.  I do a lip scrub at night, they apply this gem of lip balm generously before bed. and good Lord my lips are healed by morning!!!! absolutely this best transformation ever!!! dont hesitate to purchase here or from bath and body.  you will not having any regrets !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will not live another winter season without a few of these on hand!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I use it every night and will definitely be buying it again and again. I love all of the C.O. Bigelow products.</li>
    <li> I love C.O. Bigelow My Favorite Night Balm because it heals my lips so that they are not dry the next day and it lasts into the next day. Over winter I had a serious problem with inside my nostrils being very dry. I took a tiny dab and applied it to my nostrils and by the next day the problem was gone. I reapply it if and when needed. C.O. Bigelow My Favorite Night Balm is awesome and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use this day and night. It feels great and looks like I&#x27;m wearing lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. The price is a bit steep but you only need a little bit for full coverage. My friend bought me my first tube almost 2 years ago and I am still using it. I put another on my Amazon Wish List and my husband bought it for me so now I have a second tube and won&#x27;t have to be without it when my current tube finally runs out. I have also used it on dry spots around my nose that occur after having a running nose and irritation from wiping it constantly. This stuff works great!!</li>
    <li> The best nighttime lip balm made!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to, no down sides. I also use it on my cuticles as well. It works amazingly everytime.</li>
    <li> Not sure about all of these high reviews. This stuff is very greasy and leaves gunk on your lips when you wake up the next day. It only works to hydrate a tiny bit. No thanks. I wish I could find Pharmacopia&#x27;s Chamomile and Tangerine lip balm...best I&#x27;ve ever used, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
