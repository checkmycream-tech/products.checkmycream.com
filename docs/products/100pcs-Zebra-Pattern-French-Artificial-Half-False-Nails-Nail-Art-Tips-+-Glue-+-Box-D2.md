    <li> love it for my plain jane days</li>
    <li> thank you i loved it and thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Delivered quick. Daughter loves them</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the description on this item is wrong. I was supposed to receive 100pcs and I only received 70pcs(7 for each size). Other than that they are nice and came in a box organized into each size.</li>
    <li> They are nice tips, fit good, but the only complaint is that the pattern isn&#x27;t the same darkness on all tips, some are a bit pale. Not a huge deal, just thought I&#x27;d mention it.</li>
    <li> I must say i am not really a animal print kinda person and i was kinda sceptical about getting these however they are absolutely gorgeous to use and i will definitely recommend these to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I havnt put them on yet but I Love I will be ordering some more after I try these on Thnk You</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy.. Looks nice tho</li>
    <li> just what i wanted and expected</li>
    <li> i loved these nails they look great I would recomend them to everyone. They look very sassy great for acrylic tips.</li>
    <li> SO COOL these are awesome !! Great price will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> Would have been 5 stars had I received them as shown in the photo.  Maybe 4 of the nails were a vibrant black as shown.  The rest are grey and some have the nice dark black but fade across the nail.  Maybe the ink ran out during production? I will probably still use them for something but wont be buying again.  Really wanted that nice vibrant black.</li>
    <li> Break very easily. Don&#x27;t stick to nail very well. Get what you pay for. Not sure if I would try any other tips from here.</li>
    <li> beautiful design, quality and very durable.  I get great comments when I have them on. attention grabber. Great price..and u cant beat the amount</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THESE TO DO MY STEP DAUGHTERS NAILS FOR HOMECOMING- WHEN FILED THE BLACK COMES OFF. SO THE ZEBRA PRINT COMES RIGHT OFF.</li>
    <li> I put these on as a french tip with gel overlay and received numerous compliments.  I love them!!!</li>
    <li> Received these today they&#x27;re really cute... only problem is the glue it came with is empty. Glad I bought a tube of it. Haven&#x27;t tried them yet but ye. Make sure you purchase glue.</li>
    <li> Ooooooh. Way super cheap.  The zebra print isnt even black its grey and like dotted painted and they are flat where you have to glue them. Used two and probably wont use anymore.. but hey, You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting!</li>
    <li> Love them !!!! Alot of fun</li>
    <li> Tips are great! Only complaint is the glue was hard as a rock when I recieved it, to go out and buy more before I could apply the tips.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Just as described. Strong storage case, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but I am so excited to try them out</li>
    <li> Good product reasonable shipping. Only thing I dnt like is the quality of the stripes. If u accidentally get glue on the stripes it messes them up a like bit.. And I found it difficult to glue them on. It took forever for them to adhere to my finger nail. but once it stuck it stuck. But other than that it was great.</li>
