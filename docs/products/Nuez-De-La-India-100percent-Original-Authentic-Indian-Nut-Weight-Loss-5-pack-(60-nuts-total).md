    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2EYN9YVBUSDWF]]I ordered a pack of 5 packs (60 nuts total) This is disgusting, all packs have MOLD, this can kill someone, I can not believe that they are so filthy to sell something like this!!! This is so dangerous. Take a look in my pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Try to upload pictures, but the seller has no option to upload photos, so I took a video.</li>
    <li> Call it coincidence or not, I lost inches and weight to the point where people are often asking if I have been losing weight because I&#x27;ve slimmed down so much. It was gradual and I didn&#x27;t stress over it at all so I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised when people comment. The scale went down about 15 lbs. I wasn&#x27;t monitoring anything to closely so I am unsure of the exact measurements, but my loss in inches make it seem as if I&#x27;ve lost about 20-30. I did not change my diet and really haven&#x27;t changed my exercise regimen.  I&#x27;m happy, really happy.</li>
    <li> My wife and I were hoping to lose some weight and quite honestly the only thing that we had was constant stomach cramps. Not really worth it. Not sure if it was bad luck or we got a bad quality product but in the end it was just a waste of money. We&#x27;ll start losing weight the old fashioned way :)</li>
    <li> I choose 5 stars because it was everything I was hoping for,and I going to order more soon I&#x27;m a satisfy customer,,,</li>
    <li> this did not help for me.. if anything it just made me ill.. still at the same weight. very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It came when they said it would and all the seeds i ordered came so I have no complaints at all. I have used this product once before and it is not a miracle worker but if you put in the effort this will really help you along.</li>
    <li> I love this indian nut. I been drinking this nut for a month I wasn&#x27;t losing pounds or inches at first but now I notice my clothes are fitting loser, so I measure my self and the inches are going love it. I will never go back on diet pills this is natural and won&#x27;t affect your health as long as you keep eating a banana a day and drink lots of water.</li>
    <li> I am 54, it is hard to loose weight at this age, I tried lots of diet and exercise, no luck. I started taking the Indian Nut and in three months y lost 17 pounds! It feels so good when you start feeling your body change!! I&#x27;m happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great value for your money. I would recommend this product. I  will purchase again. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product</li>
    <li> Nuez de la India helped boost my weight loss. I did combine exercise and &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; to follow a healthy diet. I lost 9 pounds in about a month and a half. I am still taking it and my body feels great and I am getting toned (from exercise). I recommend to help in aiding your weight loss journey.</li>
