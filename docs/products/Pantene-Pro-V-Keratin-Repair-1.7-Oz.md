      <li>I have waist long and full hair</li>
      <li>The smell is quite strong but not a problem for me since I find the fragrance very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and sleek texture of the &amp;#34;ampoule&amp;#34; tubes are poorly designed for using in the shower when your hands are super slippery.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth after use, but the problem is, I don&#x27;t use it often, due to the price.</li>
      <li>It instantly gave me a migraine the first time I used.</li>

<li> I have thin long hair in which I tend to blow dry and/or curl more than I want to because of the heat damage you get from using these types of appliances.</li>
<li> I used 1/2 tube on my ends (one tube was way to much and a waste with thin hair) and though it definitely helped smooth and soften my hair it felt weighed down</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This treatment left my coarse, dry 45-year old color-treated hair significantly softer and shinier.  Unlike the earlier reviewer I used the entire ampule as directed- can&#x27;t imagine getting 3 uses out of one tube with just-past shoulder length hair.  The package advises using one tube every 2-3 days, which I can&#x27;t imagine anyone keeping up, but this is a nice option as I am working on getting my hair into better condition.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and color it!!  I also have a thyroid  condition so I am looking for something to help soften my hair!!  This product does the trick and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> i have processed hair that tends to get dry, especially right after coloring and in the summer. One tube takes care of the dry ends instantly. I have collar length hair and a full tube is definitely needed. I was shocked to read the review that said strong odor. I&#x27;m hypersensitive to perfumes and odors and suffer from both severe asthma and migraines. Scents are major triggers for me. Yes, there is fragrance in this product but it&#x27;s very light. I had to sniff the tube to notice it. I&#x27;ve used products by John Frieda that have scents so strong they remain until the next washing - this was nothing like that.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair extremely soft, very shiny (my greys were the color of mercury), and super easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I use the Pantene Pro-V collection of shampoo, conditioner and split end fuser (Advanced Keratin Repair Collection) which have proven very beneficial for my dry, split end frizz.  I tried the 60 second repair but did not find any additional benefits to the other products.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and I can see the results immediately.&lt;br /&gt;The hair gets so soft that I had to order another package,</li>
    <li> I find it is ok, just the perfume is a bit strong for me. If you do not have problem with the intense smell then, I commend</li>
    <li> My beautician said not to use this product because is weighs the hair down &amp; causes a dull looking build up. I only used it once. It felt nice! But not using it again.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this keratin repair product makes your hair more manageable and softer. I have thin long hair in which I tend to blow dry and/or curl more than I want to because of the heat damage you get from using these types of appliances. However, using this product really helped my hair shine and I didn&#x27;t have a need to trim my dry ends that I usually get with blow drying and curling. It&#x27;s been almost two months since I ran out of this product and I&#x27;m missing it! I&#x27;m subscribing so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having to continually order this. I&#x27;ve never subscribed to an Amazon product before, but this keratin repair product is a must! Plus, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these three times now because they leave my hair feeling so soft and luxurious. The smell is quite strong but not a problem for me since I find the fragrance very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and sleek texture of the &amp;#34;ampoule&amp;#34; tubes are poorly designed for using in the shower when your hands are super slippery.</li>

I love the shampoo and conditioner, but am unable to use the treatment due to the odor.</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps my hair looking fabulous.</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my hair feel after using. I have only been using once a week, but will order more:)</li>
    <li> So far it has stopped the breakage of hair.</li>

    <li> If you have dry damaged hair buy these they help a lot!! I love them they leave your hair soft but without a heavy feeling!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I use it once a week and my hair stays shiny, silky and smooth</li>
    <li> After 3 uses 3 days apart my hair is more manageable and smooth to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have below shoulder thin color treated hair. I used my regular sulfate free shampoo and used this as conditioner. For the first application I used the entire ampule(subsequent application I only needed 70%). After 60 seconds I washed and styled by blow drying. My hair felt softer, more manageable, easier to style and no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight chemical smell after applying this product which wares off in few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other masks and smoothening treatments this takes only 60 seconds. That helps me use this more often. I am not sure why this has to be packaged in ampules though. I think amazon pricing is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like Pantene, but I was looking for a hot oil treatment and bought this by accident. Turns out it actually works! Works better than the expensive conditioner I use.    Update, a couple days later: I like this even better now! I have been using half a tube in the shower every other day (I only was my hair every other day) I love how it&#x27;s working so much, my hair looks even better than it did after the first use. I finally found something that saved my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that will help my dry ends. I have very thin hair with dry ends and oily roots, and iv tired all different things but nothing seemed to work. I used 1/2 tube on my ends (one tube was way to much and a waste with thin hair) and though it definitely helped smooth and soften my hair it felt weighed down after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now what i do, is mix 1/4th pantene repair and 3/4 normal conditioner and use it everyday! my hair is not weighed down but it still come out smooth and beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Did not see a big diference</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my dry hair! The fragrance is refreshing too!</li>
    <li> I have waist long and full hair and I had to use 4 of the 5 vials of Pantene 60 seconds therapy,beautifull shine so managable my hair feels.definetely I would recommend this product very highly for any type of hair,..defenitely I&#x27;ll keep the amazonprime with the Pantene collection,Love it!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth after use, but the problem is, I don&#x27;t use it often, due to the price. It&#x27;s a great product, and it definitely does what it claims to do for hair like mine (dry, color processed), but I wish it were a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> My girl friend ad a color correction done, she had used this previously and could not find it on the shelves any longer, this has TRANSFORMED her hair back to the silkiness it was previous to the color correction.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I just use half a bottle per use and it makes my hair soft and less frizzy for days</li>
    <li> I was able to get three conditioning from one tube. I have shoulder length thin hair so I didn&#x27;t have to use much.&lt;br /&gt;I made my hair soft and managable</li>
    <li> I didnt see a big difference but it did make my hair smooth!</li>
