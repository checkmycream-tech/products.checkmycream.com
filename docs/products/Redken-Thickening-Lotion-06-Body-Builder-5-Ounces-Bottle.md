      <li>Great stuff!  </li>
      <li>But I just had to practice to find the perfect amount.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful for giving your hair fullness.</li>
      <li>Used this with the 06 Rootfull and together they are great.  </li>
      <li>It looks just a great as it looked the day before.</li>
      <li>This thickening lotion is simply amazing!  </li>
      <li>This is the best product for making my fine hair manageable that I have ever found.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it on here at a lower price.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product I have found because it is not heavy and does not leave my hair feeling gunky.</li>
      <li>Redken hair products are by far the best!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I have very  fine hair</li>
      <li>I have really baby fine hair and this product is wonderful for adding body to your hair.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried so many volume products, but this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it unlike so many products truly works....</li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this thickening lotion.</li>
      <li>I have tried them all and this one works the best especially in combination with your blow dryer!</li>
      <li>Phytodensium and Kerastace  were the best body building products I&#x27;d found prior to trying this one.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it dispenses.  </li>
      <li>Will for sure continue to use this product and will also be trying the Redken shampoo and conditioner..</li>
      <li>I ended up liking this better.</li>
      <li>I need to use more that the directions say to give my hair body - but that could just be because my hair is fine.</li>
      <li>Easily distributes through your hair, leaving light body, but no stickiness.</li>
      <li>Gives body to my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every thickening and densifying hair product on the planet (slight exaggeration) and this one is the absolute best.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product for fine thin hair</li>
      <li>If you have fine thin hair like me this is the best product out there!</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to use \\&quot;in between\\&quot; my other great product (Nick Chavez, Flocker bought on Amazon) that might \\&quot;thicken\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Although this seemed to help a bit, I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out how much is too much to dispense because it either doesn&#x27;t help at all or leaves my hair sticky.  </li>
      <li>It helps my hair hold a curl just slightly longer than normal, so it&#x27;s not the best product if that&#x27;s the main purpose you&#x27;re looking to use it for.</li>
      <li>A small dime-sized dollop worked into damp hair allows for great styling without drying.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, white hair</li>
      <li>Redken Thickening Lotion is similar to hair gel for holding your &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; in place and gives your hair noticeably more body.  </li>
      <li>...gives your hair much needed body.</li>
      <li>It works great on my thin hair.</li>
      <li>your viewers like it as much as I do</li>
      <li>works very well, adds body to hair and does not leave it sticky.  </li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My hair has so much volume and feels so soft.  </li>
      <li>and the body comes right back.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see any results with this product especially when it comes to giving the appearance of thicker hair.  </li>
      <li>Instead it makes my hair look shiny, fuller, and soft.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft and in place.  </li>
      <li>I use about a dime&#x27;s worth and that is enough for my short hair.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time trying this product, and I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried so many things that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>It actually makes my thinning, fine, short hair look thicker without weighing it down or making it look greasy.  </li>
      <li>it gives my thin hair so much more volumne.....</li>
      <li>you can add a little water the next day and lightly blow dry it</li>
      <li>I usually get the Full Frame, but decided to try something different.  </li>
      <li>And if I use too much of it at once it actually has an opposite effect and weighs my hair down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product about twice a week and have been for about 2 years. It does what is advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before.  It works great on my thin hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only &amp;#34;thickener&amp;#34; that works for me.  A small dime-sized dollop worked into damp hair allows for great styling without drying.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Redken Thickening Lotion is similar to hair gel for holding your &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; in place and gives your hair noticeably more body.  When you run your hand through your hair it&#x27;s soft and in place.  I have a 16oz bottle at home and a 5ox bottle for travel.  And you don&#x27;t need much.  I use a dab a little larger than then a nickle.</li>
    <li> I have fine,thin hair. This is the best product I have found because it is not heavy and does not leave my hair feeling gunky.Plus it does not dry my hair out as other products do. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is not at all what I hoped for. This is just goop for your hair. Nothing special. You may as well use the cheaper types of mouse or gel. I was hoping for something with a little more of an oil base or an actual lotion, but this is nothing like that. And it does no more for my hear than a regular mouse or gel.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for fine thin hair</li>
    <li> I have really baby fine hair and this product is wonderful for adding body to your hair.  I have used it for about six years and used to purchase it from the beauty salon.  I was thrilled to find it on here at a lower price.  This product is wonderful for giving your hair fullness.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any results with this product especially when it comes to giving the appearance of thicker hair.  Disappointed...</li>
    <li> My hair is straight and stringy, usually.  I finally asked my hair dresser what she puts in my hair that holds the curl all day.  This is one of the products she uses.  It works!!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it unlike so many products truly works....it gives my thin hair so much more volumne.....I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Love the way it dispenses.  Easily distributes through your hair, leaving light body, but no stickiness.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this product, and I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried so many things that don&#x27;t work.  Just a little dab gives my thin hair extra fullness.  I love it and will continue to use it.</li>

    <li> Great stuff!  Thickens my thin hair without making it stiff.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product..I have very  fine hair and this does wonders...gives your hair much needed body. Thank you</li>
    <li> Redken hair products are by far the best!  This thickening lotion works great! I usually get the Full Frame, but decided to try something different.  I ended up liking this better.</li>
    <li> I have always hated how thin my hair is, but this product makes it look thick and beautiful. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>

    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have very fine, white hair and I have tried so many volume products, but this is by far the best.  Other products would leave my hair feeling stiff and dry. but not this one.  My hair has so much volume and feels so soft.  Used this with the 06 Rootfull and together they are great.  Will for sure continue to use this product and will also be trying the Redken shampoo and conditioner..</li>
    <li> This thickening lotion is simply amazing!  It actually makes my thinning, fine, short hair look thicker without weighing it down or making it look greasy.  Instead it makes my hair look shiny, fuller, and soft.  I&#x27;ve tried every thickening and densifying hair product on the planet (slight exaggeration) and this one is the absolute best.  Phytodensium and Kerastace  were the best body building products I&#x27;d found prior to trying this one.  I hope they never stop making this Redken product!  I take a dime-sized dollop of it and rub it between my hands.  They I apply it to my hair evenly and blow dry.  The next AM I just make my hair damp and then blow dry - I don&#x27;t need to add any additional product.  It looks just a great as it looked the day before. Redken Thickening Lotion, where have you been all my life?</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to use \\&quot;in between\\&quot; my other great product (Nick Chavez, Flocker bought on Amazon) that might \\&quot;thicken\\&quot; the look of my very thin hair and help it keep it&#x27;s style without having to heavily use hairspray.  Although this seemed to help a bit, I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out how much is too much to dispense because it either doesn&#x27;t help at all or leaves my hair sticky.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I need to use more that the directions say to give my hair body - but that could just be because my hair is fine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thickening lotion. My hair is straight, fine, AND thin, and a little dab of this rubbed through my wet hair before I blow dry does wonders for adding body. It&#x27;s by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my hair type. My only qualm is that it does make my hair get greasy a bit faster than it would with say, a mousse. And if I use too much of it at once it actually has an opposite effect and weighs my hair down. But I just had to practice to find the perfect amount. It helps my hair hold a curl just slightly longer than normal, so it&#x27;s not the best product if that&#x27;s the main purpose you&#x27;re looking to use it for.</li>
    <li> Gives body to my fine hair. Would not style my hair  or travel with out it .Hope your viewers like it as much as I do</li>
    <li> If you have fine thin hair like me this is the best product out there! I have tried them all and this one works the best especially in combination with your blow dryer!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for making my fine hair manageable that I have ever found. I have used it for years and it has been increasingly difficult to find in stores or salons.</li>
