      <li>That was the good part.</li>
      <li>Could it really be as good as they showed on the infomercial?</li>
      <li>, the Instyler seems to be a well-made, good hair straightening product.</li>
      <li>this is a really good product.  </li>

      <li>At what cost do you want to look good?</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t quite understand where those that are criticizing this product are coming from, I absolutly love it!</li>
      <li>My $36 Conair from Walmart worked better!</li>
      <li>I have curly but fine hair and the InStyler is great.</li>
      <li>It works for me because I color my greys and they are kinky - great way to smooth and curl.  </li>
      <li>This will give a nice lift and curve to your hair and it will turn under/up at the ends, but you have to keep it moving.</li>
      <li>My purchasing experience was exceptional and I am greatly satisfied with the product.  </li>

      <li>I have both now and I have to say that I am more pleased with the InStyler results than with the ReVo.</li>
      <li>A kind of whirring or buzzing sound.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>this is an item that is better used if someone is doing ur hair for you.  </li>

      <li>My grandkids love it.</li>
      <li>I received the InStyler for Valentine&#x27;s Day, I was so excited!</li>
      <li>Some say they break easily.</li>
      <li>As always, make sure you&#x27;re purchasing from a reputable seller - you deserve to get your moneys worth.</li>
      <li>Great item...much better than a flat iron</li>
      <li>Use the chart/guidelines enclosed and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>I waited until I used this product for 2 months to enter this review so that my review would be accurate.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth without the fried effect.  </li>
      <li>Be great for a teenage sleep over party.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair silky smooth and beautiful!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so u can lay ur hot iron on it and it won&#x27;t catch fire!!  </li>
      <li>SURE THAT THIS PRODUCT MAKE YOUR HAIR BECOME STRAIGHT VERY EASY, BUT THE BARRELS BECOME SO HOT</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product for Christmas</li>
      <li>and it arrived well packaged, with full instructions and warranteed, with a storage bag for when it&#x27;s not in</li>
      <li>It is a sweet thing when you use it on someone or they use it on you.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product to make volume but not as a straightener or curler, especially if you are trying to minimize the puff!</li>
      <li>no product in my hair, the InStyler made it have super volume and no control.</li>
      <li>but I have to say that this rotating barrel along with the combined brushes really does make styling effortless and easy.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It curled her hair in a nice way - very natural-looking, but then, my daughter has naturally wavy hair to begin with.  </li>
      <li>As always, make sure you&#x27;re purchasing from a reputable seller - you deserve to get your moneys worth.ccidental burns might be frustrating to some who are already challenged at styling their own hair.  </li>
      <li>Fun to have.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product because it really looked like it would work well.</li>
      <li>I have straight, natural, healthy hair, rarely use heat styling product.  </li>
      <li>When I first got it, it didn&#x27;t work right,</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it very much.  </li>
      <li>The only \\&quot;BUT\\&quot; that I have about this product is that you need to make sure you UNPLUG it from the wall when you are finished like it says in the user manual.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This tool exceeded all my expectations - no  more blow dries in a salon for me - it takes only 15 minutes to make my hair look great!</li>
      <li>so I could return it at the store if I didn&#x27;t like it instead of waiting to send it back to the company, but I love it and would never part with it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this iron!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the greatest product for African Americans because it&#x27;s hard to get to the roots.  </li>
      <li>I think of the guard more as &#x27;training wheels&#x27; as I will eventually get rid of it, but I can see how the guard as opposed to accidental burns might be frustrating to some who are already challenged at styling their own hair.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend using a good moisturizing conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, if this product is used on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love using flat irons to give my pin straight hair body.  </li>
      <li>The first one I got in the mail worked fine only ONCE.</li>
      <li>I also curled a few sections of my hair with it (just to see the results) and it gave me super sexy wavy locks (think beach hair).  </li>
      <li>and I have really really curly hair</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t throw away your curling iron if you want real curls.</li>
      <li>Removing the guard makes styling easier but definitely increases your risk of accidently burning yourself (for some reason, I&#x27;m compelled to reach up with my free hand and grab hold of the heated barrel).  </li>
      <li>I have very poofy, wavy hair (</li>
      <li>this product did absolutely nothing to straighten it.</li>
      <li>I really like the Instyler that I purchased.  </li>
      <li>Would absolutely recommend it.</li>
      <li>I was very upset with my gift to them.  </li>
      <li>Careful attention to the enclosed instructions will keep the user safe.  </li>
      <li>The following review reflects her experience and my observations, not my own personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was really upset after I had my pregnant hair stylist try the product on me prior to reading the label.</li>
      <li>The Instyler does a great job of straightening it, in a natural-looking way, unlike the way the hair looks when straightened with the ceramic flat iron she has used in the past.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be curious to see how well it curls for someone with really straight, fine</li>
      <li>have very long, normal to baby fine hair (lots of it)</li>
      <li>and I was surprised how straight it got my hair.</li>
      <li>Before buying this consider purchasing a flat iron at Target for less that $50 - you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
      <li>I have tried other straightening irons and they give me smooth results</li>
      <li>Plus it came to me re-packaged which tells me it wasn&#x27;t actually new, as it was advertised.</li>
      <li>I first saw it at Bed Bath and Beyond earlier this week and nearly bought it till I saw the price tag.  </li>
      <li>annoyingly loud.  </li>
      <li>naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
      <li>The end completely fell off which is suprising considering the cost of the instyler.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product direct from [...]</li>
      <li>Plus, I noticed that daily use of the Instyler quickly stripped my daughter&#x27;s hair of its natural oils and gave it a dry flyaway aspect - I&#x27;ve had to restrict her use to once a week.  </li>
      <li>I tried it first without any heat protecting product, it made it frizzy and dry.  </li>
      <li>and it took me a few tries before I got the hang of the InStyler, but I really love it.</li>
      <li>The infomercial is a complete misrepresentation of the actual product.  </li>
      <li>I actually can&#x27;t have to pick my time to use it because it&#x27;s so loud.  </li>
      <li>You just have to be extra careful because it does get hot to the touch.  </li>
      <li>Works very well on medium length thick frizz/curly hair, if straight and shiny is the goal.</li>
      <li>recommend this product highly, but take care of it and read the instructions carefully.</li>
      <li>daughter has a full, thick head of wavy (not curly), shoulder-length hair.  </li>

<li> (yes, I use a flat iron to do that) - but the Instyler will become my every day &#x27;go-to&#x27; styler and my trusty travel</li>
<li> but my hair is so flat against my head.</li>
<li> Unlike other irons, low heat actually does produce results (so if low is the recommended temperature, try it out before jumping to medium or high).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was excited to get this product because it really looked like it would work well. However, my actual experience was quite different. The first one I got in the mail worked fine only ONCE. Then the cylinder stopped heating. So I sent it back for a replacement. The replacement came and worked all of 10 minutes before the cylinder stopped rotating and the power started shutting off after just a minute. So I am sending the second one back as unusable as well. I do not want another one because I do not want any further hassles. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I would give it negative stars if possible.</li>
    <li> used it a handfull of times before it broke. The end completely fell off which is suprising considering the cost of the instyler.  I just called the company to let them know and they offered to send a replacement.  I admit, I am not that trilled since I have already wasted that money on something like this that one does not manage my thin hair and two breaks easily.  The brush is a waste of time...why not brush your hair then straighten it?  I think some of the reviews are from those who work for the company...there is no way this product is considered fantastic and the best out there.  Before buying this consider purchasing a flat iron at Target for less that $50 - you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product for Christmas however i was extremely dissapointed. I have very poofy, wavy hair (shoulder length)and this product did absolutely nothing to straighten it. I used it for about 20 minutes, got frustrated, and mailed it back the same day. My $36 Conair from Walmart worked better! Save your money and buy a Chi or a Sedu, they have guaranteed results.</li>
    <li> The instyler arrived a week sooner than estimated.  That was the good part. The styler itself is very difficult to use on oneself.  It is a sweet thing when you use it on someone or they use it on you.  Be great for a teenage sleep over party.  Fun to have.  My grandkids love it.</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with the product at all.  It did not work in the way that I hoped it would, and it does not suit my needs.  I am now unable to return it since the seller doesn&#x27;t allow you to use the product and then return it.  How you are supposed to determine whether you like a hair appliance without using it is beyond me.  Plus it came to me re-packaged which tells me it wasn&#x27;t actually new, as it was advertised.</li>
    <li> Order the Instyler....received and put away immediately for Christmas.......daughter opened up today.....the packaging that it was received in was very thin....looked like it had gotten wet, dried then wet again.....only to receive it dry.   The Instyler had no packing slip, no instructions........looked like it was used.......daughter said she found hair in it............not happy!  There is a black spot on the barrel where it looks like it was used and has a worn spot.   I am definetely returning this product.....now I hope I do not have to fight to return it!</li>
    <li> Works very well on medium length thick frizz/curly hair, if straight and shiny is the goal. Don&#x27;t throw away your curling iron if you want real curls. This will give a nice lift and curve to your hair and it will turn under/up at the ends, but you have to keep it moving.</li>
    <li> Even though I followed both the (infomercial) video and manual, this product is extremely damaging to my hair.  The infomercial is a complete misrepresentation of the actual product.  I have straight, natural, healthy hair, rarely use heat styling product.  I tried it first without any heat protecting product, it made it frizzy and dry.  Thought a little bit of heat protecting spray will protect (even though it said not to use), smoke and steam were released from my hair and I had to stop using it immediately. Needless to say, the result was disappointing!! SO spend your hard-earned  $$ on something else.</li>
    <li> I really like the Instyler that I purchased.  It takes some getting used to in order to get the desired results - but it actually does what it proclaims!  It leaves my hair silky smooth without the fried effect.  You just have to be extra careful because it does get hot to the touch.  My purchasing experience was exceptional and I am greatly satisfied with the product.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> When I first got it, it didn&#x27;t work right, but then I carefully watched the infomercial and watched the technique.  It works beautifully for me.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair - I make sure I always have a leave-in conditioner to protect my hair.  It works for me because I color my greys and they are kinky - great way to smooth and curl.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This tool exceeded all my expectations - no  more blow dries in a salon for me - it takes only 15 minutes to make my hair look great! I didn&#x27;t notice any damage to my hair and I use it often...</li>
    <li> I received the InStyler for Valentine&#x27;s Day, I was so excited! I had medium short hair and I tried it out and was completely disappointed. After reading the instructions it said you should&#x27;t use it with any hair product. I usually use flat iron spray to prevent frizzing, not to mention my hair isn&#x27;t even corse. I knew what would happen w/ no product in my hair, the InStyler made it have super volume and no control. After that I went and got a haircut to see if that would help. It did not! It is a good product to make volume but not as a straightener or curler, especially if you are trying to minimize the puff!</li>
    <li> Great item...much better than a flat iron and I have really really curly hair and I was surprised how straight it got my hair. I do have very long hair and it took awhile, especially since I wasn&#x27;t used to it but I think with shorter hair, it will be even more of a breeze.</li>
    <li> I have never used a flat iron or curling iron before and it took me a few tries before I got the hang of the InStyler, but I really love it. I was using the ReVo and they stopped making that. I have both now and I have to say that I am more pleased with the InStyler results than with the ReVo. I have curly but fine hair and the InStyler is great. I use the lowest setting so that I don&#x27;t fry my hair. Would absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> tried it for several days.. my hair is very thin, and it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> WARNING, the label on the cord states that the cord contained LEAD and you should wash your hands whenever you handle the cord. A product is not good if it has safety issues. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the product had the statement been placed on the box. I purchased this product after a girlfriend said it worked well for her. I was really upset after I had my pregnant hair stylist try the product on me prior to reading the label. This was really dangerous. I contacted my girlfriend about the warning because I felt she had not noticed the label. She went back to check her Instyler and instead found a warning that if you use oxygen you shouldn&#x27;t use the product. She contaced me because I use oxygen 24/7. At what cost do you want to look good? I returned my purchase.</li>
    <li> I gave the Instyler to 3 of my daughters as a Christmas gift. They all hate it.  I was very upset with my gift to them.  I wish I could send them back.  Can you help me?    Mary Piper</li>
    <li> SURE THAT THIS PRODUCT MAKE YOUR HAIR BECOME STRAIGHT VERY EASY, BUT THE BARRELS BECOME SO HOT THAT IT FRY MY HAIR.  I HAD TO CUT IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO BURN THAT I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE.  NOW I HAVE MY HAIR SHORT AS A MAN BECAUSE OF THIS IRON.</li>
    <li> this is a really good product.  i have bone straight, thin hair so i have to use a lot of product just to hold a style.  with the instyler, i don&#x27;t use any styling products &amp; my hair holds all day and a few days longer!!  It&#x27;s not the greatest product for African Americans because it&#x27;s hard to get to the roots.  this is an item that is better used if someone is doing ur hair for you.  i have to use my conair flat iron to get my roots and the instyler does the rest beautifully.  Even my extensions are being styled beautifully.  it comes with a heat resistant bag so u can lay ur hot iron on it and it won&#x27;t catch fire!!  The worst thing about it is it&#x27;s very loud.  annoyingly loud.  I actually can&#x27;t have to pick my time to use it because it&#x27;s so loud.  It tends to wake people up in the morning so i have to style the night before and pray my hair isn&#x27;t too different in the morning.</li>
    <li> this product works find and its amazing to see the results when i use it in my hair its the best thing ever.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite understand where those that are criticizing this product are coming from, I absolutly love it! I have naturally curly/wavy hair and this product is a lifesaver. It is a bit noisy but not offensively so.I have tried other straightening irons and they give me smooth results but my hair is so flat against my head. With the Instyler I can straighten my hair and add body at the same time. I waited until I used this product for 2 months to enter this review so that my review would be accurate. I did buy it at wal-mart so I could return it at the store if I didn&#x27;t like it instead of waiting to send it back to the company, but I love it and would never part with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Instyler as a gift for my daughter.  The following review reflects her experience and my observations, not my own personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has a full, thick head of wavy (not curly), shoulder-length hair.  The Instyler does a great job of straightening it, in a natural-looking way, unlike the way the hair looks when straightened with the ceramic flat iron she has used in the past.  My daughter was (is) pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two not-so-nice points are that the Instyler is noisy - while in use, it makes a noise that sounds similar to a toy remote-control car.  A kind of whirring or buzzing sound.  Plus, I noticed that daily use of the Instyler quickly stripped my daughter&#x27;s hair of its natural oils and gave it a dry flyaway aspect - I&#x27;ve had to restrict her use to once a week.  I would definitely recommend using a good moisturizing conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, if this product is used on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler is weighty.  It has a thick handle, and is somewhat clumsy to hold (I think), but it&#x27;s probably no more clumsy than any other hair straightener.  My twelve-year-old is able to maneuver it without a problem.  Careful attention to the enclosed instructions will keep the user safe.  I bought this product direct from [...] and it arrived well packaged, with full instructions and warranteed, with a storage bag for when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have only tried to curl her hair once, as a test.  It curled her hair in a nice way - very natural-looking, but then, my daughter has naturally wavy hair to begin with.  I&#x27;d be curious to see how well it curls for someone with really straight, fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it four stars, but I think the whirring noise the barrel makes while spinning is somewhat annoying.  Other than that, the Instyler seems to be a well-made, good hair straightening product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it very much.  The brush did not work well on my hair.  My hair kept getting tangled in it, but my daughter loves it.  It wasn&#x27;t easy to handle and the noise it makes when in use is a bit annoying.</li>
    <li> I recieved my Instyler and have to admit I had my doubts. Could it really be as good as they showed on the infomercial? The plain answer is YES. However, I did read reviews before I ordered. Some say they break easily. The only \\&quot;BUT\\&quot; that I have about this product is that you need to make sure you UNPLUG it from the wall when you are finished like it says in the user manual.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the extended warranty for 9.99 just in case it does break, but overall I loooove this product. I only wish it came in smaller sizes too! It makes my hair silky smooth and beautiful!!&lt;br /&gt;I have moderate thickness hair and it works wonders. I think for coarser hair it would take a few times to iron it out.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly, but take care of it and read the instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this iron! I first saw it at Bed Bath and Beyond earlier this week and nearly bought it till I saw the price tag.  With the holidays around the corner, I decided to hold off on this purchase but surprise surprise - I came home from work today to find it gift wrapped on my vanity (Thank you sweetie!  I love you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, normal to baby fine hair (lots of it) and I love using flat irons to give my pin straight hair body.  I know how to style my hair without any &#x27;gimmicks&#x27; but I have to say that this rotating barrel along with the combined brushes really does make styling effortless and easy.  I don&#x27;t possibly understand how the other reviewer managed to singe her hair to the extent described.  There are three different temperature settings for different hair textures.  Use the chart/guidelines enclosed and you&#x27;ll be fine.  Unlike other irons, low heat actually does produce results (so if low is the recommended temperature, try it out before jumping to medium or high).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron gives great body, hair flipped out or in at the ends.  I also curled a few sections of my hair with it (just to see the results) and it gave me super sexy wavy locks (think beach hair).  I&#x27;ll still keep my narrow flat iron on hand for creating baby doll spirals (yes, I use a flat iron to do that) - but the Instyler will become my every day &#x27;go-to&#x27; styler and my trusty travel companion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to keep in mind...  The barrel comes with a &#x27;safety guard&#x27; to help prevent accidental burns.  It&#x27;s definitely helpful but it makes curling your hair a pain in the butt (difficult to wrap your hair around the barrel with the guard on).  Removing the guard makes styling easier but definitely increases your risk of accidently burning yourself (for some reason, I&#x27;m compelled to reach up with my free hand and grab hold of the heated barrel).  I think of the guard more as &#x27;training wheels&#x27; as I will eventually get rid of it, but I can see how the guard as opposed to accidental burns might be frustrating to some who are already challenged at styling their own hair.  I&#x27;ve also read a few reviews where people have claimed to have received fake/counterfeit irons from sellers on ebay.  According to these reviews, the fake irons were shoddy or didn&#x27;t work well or at all.  As always, make sure you&#x27;re purchasing from a reputable seller - you deserve to get your moneys worth.ccidental burns might be frustrating to some who are already challenged at styling their own hair.
