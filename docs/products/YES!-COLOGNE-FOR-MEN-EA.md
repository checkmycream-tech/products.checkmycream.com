<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I cannot atest to the attraction factor on any cologne, but this one at least smells great, unlike some others, and I have at least gotten some complements on the fragrance. You gotta start somewhere...</li>
    <li> I would have to say that no it doesn&#x27;t, nothing does that not even pheromones.  Don&#x27;t be suckered in, however I really like this scent and that is why I buy it and give it four stars.</li>
    <li> Very good and works fine..  as per the product details</li>
    <li> very satisfy,the product was good,my girlfriend like it a lot&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t have a chance to respond your item.&lt;br /&gt;i am very sorry,very busy this past 2 months</li>
    <li> I bought this product based off of reviews, I was so disappointed. they must of paying people to write a good reviews. smells like soap ,  honestly i start spry it in my shoes.</li>
    <li> I LOOKED HIGH AND LOW FOR THIS PRODUCT. FINALLY FOUND IT AT AMAZON.COM.. IT&#x27;S A GREAT PRODUCT. I SUGGEST YOU GIVE IT A TRY. IT&#x27;S HIT AND MISS ...BUT IT DOES WORK.</li>
    <li> it works amazing! I have had 100x the response to women than usual. I tell you it works like a charm! and my Gf loves it, she doesn&#x27;t know what it is but she hounds me when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but there is some down sides&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells way too strong, I suggest you spray yourself at least 10 minutes before you enter any building because one spray is more than enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It needs to be bigger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise its a great product and I recommend it to anyone who wants to spice up their love life or get that female attention they have been craving.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Love when my boyfriend wears this it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This product is inexpensive. one of the least pleasant scents (carpet deodorizer)  but get more attraction with this. Its inexpensive enough to experiment with.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical (like everyone who buys pheromones) but I originally got it to use at work to help me be more approachable.  It did help with both men being more pleasant around me and more submissive but the real effect is what it does to my girlfriend.  She loves it! Always says I smell great and gets her super feisty.  Every time I wear it around her she wants to have sex.&lt;br /&gt;It was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Interesting. not sure if would buy again, but not bead for the money, I would not expect a &amp;#34;phermone&amp;#34; miracle.. Just be yourself, did have a compliment about the fraguarance</li>
    <li> This the only pheromone cologne I&#x27;ve used. Its the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought! Use it everytime I go out, and totally can tell the difference. When i used it i can notice women feel more comfortable around me and more interested while i speak to them! I have used it since March 2014, and still have a little left</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never consider this dealer or recommend them to others. stay away from doc johnson. I know not to order any items from them.</li>
    <li> I like how small is it you can carry it anywhere the smell of this Cologne is bomb definitely getting lucky tonight (;</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, refreshing and there is not a lot of ladies where I am so i caan not test it&lt;br /&gt;Once I do this test - hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to type :-)</li>
    <li> When put on I did have a few head turners, No Complaints here, Would probably buy it again that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Pleasant reaction from girls</li>
    <li> Its a smelly scam. I Dont know why I would buy in first place. I will just stay with Gucci guilty</li>
    <li> I have tried one other pheromone cologne before and I thought this one would be similar. NO. This one smells like old man and it is a strong smell. I have used Pherolure before and really liked the way it smells and so does everyone else that smells it. Unfortunately I tried to expand and see what other products are out there and was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> THE SCENT KEEP THE WOMEN ATTENTION..REAL GOOD.</li>
