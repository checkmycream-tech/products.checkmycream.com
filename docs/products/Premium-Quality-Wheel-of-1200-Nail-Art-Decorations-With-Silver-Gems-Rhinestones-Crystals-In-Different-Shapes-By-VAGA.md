    <li> These rhinestones came early and on time and I love them and the fact that they are all different shapes and sizes.</li>
    <li> Very cheapy bad quality, each stones are very ugly shaped....&lt;br /&gt;After i applied the top coat, the shiny color and the edge of the stone bacame dull.</li>
    <li> All different size diamonds. Got my product on estimated date . Pretty good cuality . Not the best but decent for 4$ . You should get it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these!!! Theyre perfect for me cuz I do my nails alllll the time. Theres a bunch of different shapes &amp; sizes. &amp; they last forever.</li>
    <li> Nail salon won&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with them if ur using for other things but too big for nails the get fought on things and end up falling off !</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday and I was surprised to see this item be so small (2 1/2 inches is diameter) However this is fine, I can&#x27;t believe how many shapes there are. This is going to be fun. Everything here promptly and well packaged too.</li>
    <li> I love Rhinestones and these were a nice addition to my collection, I actually used these to bling out a tee-shirt and they worked like magic!</li>
    <li> Purchased for our granddaughter along with other items to do fancy nails. She was very pleased and loves the crystals.I also purchased the tweezers to place the crystals on the wet nails. A fun teenage gift.</li>
    <li> First, this took less than 2 weeks to arrive from Asia...so dont let the estimated shipping time scare you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second...this wheel is maybe 2.5 inches around.  It is smaller than other nail gem cases Ive bought before. I would doubt highly that its 1200... but i will not be pouring it out and counting.  There are maybe 50 of the 12 designs TOPS.  For me, its plenty to be worth under $2 cost.  But, advertising is not true on quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shapes include:  3 difft size circles, teardrop, triangles, ovals, flowers, stars, squares, hearts, largeish rectangles... and one more shape thats kindof bean or comma shaped!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I would wear any of these shapes, and this is a good all silver/clear gem set.  I am happy!</li>
    <li> These are really pretty in the container.  Unfortunately as soon as you put a top coat over them they lose all shine and you can&#x27;t see a single facet on them.  It&#x27;s just like a cloudy lump of clear stuff on your nail.  I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I love how there were so many different shapes to choose from. So many different ways to do my nails!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not that sparkly; very cheap looking. I suggest purchasing from your local beauty store; so that you can physically see how they look.&lt;br /&gt;Welp, I&#x27;m stuck with them, now; so, I&#x27;l just use them to decorate other things.</li>
    <li> came as described, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product is so cool. It comes in so many different shapes and sizes. The product comes with stars, flowers, drops, leaves, rectangles, squares, hearts, three different sized circles, and so much more. I received it 7 days before the estimated date and when I opened up the package, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it came with.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and exactly as it was described. I am very happy with the nail art rhinestones and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love these crystal rhinestone shapes! They&#x27;re the perfect nail art accent! I used multiple shapes together to make flowers and butterflies. Item received very quickly, much faster than expected! Highly recommend this item and this seller!</li>
    <li> Great great great for the price.</li>
    <li> Sooo pretty I love them u got all the 12 shapes in one wheel and they&#x27;re diamonds very nice look</li>
    <li> These were perfect for my wedding.  I can&#x27;t wait to use them and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat!!! I was a little concerned When I ordered because the price was so cheap but they are perfect and as good as anything I could find at a retail store that would have cost a whole lot more!!!!</li>
    <li> As described. Good quality</li>
    <li> There is a wide variety of diamonds. Every section is different. I love these!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This wheel has a great selection of shapes, just about any shape you&#x27;d need. Great value for money, I&#x27;ll be ordering again.  [[ASIN:B006OMHU4C 2012 New Collection of Jumbo Nail Art Image Plates. Nail Art Jumbo Image Plate (A) of 42 Full Nail Art Designs at a Killer Price, By Cheeky.]]</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. Fast delivery too. I will order again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for these considering the price but I wasn&#x27;t happy to find zero complaints about them!</li>
    <li> Took absolutely forever to arrive in Pennsylvania from Hong Kong, but once again, they did only cost me $1.07 so it was worth the wait. My manicurist puts them on for me put it does not look hard to do yourself....Def a good purchase if you like a little bling on your fingers! Lots of variety in the pack. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the variety and different sizes but I don&#x27;t think that there is 1200 items I think that is their item number.</li>
    <li> what is not to love about these! the proce in incredable and the quality is just as good as the salon if not better.</li>
    <li> The item I received was not as described. There are not different sizes or shapes, all the gems I received were one size.</li>
    <li> Go price these at your local store, you can not beat this price! This product is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love um..... So many!!!!  Different shapes and the price is unbeatable!!!!</li>
    <li> OkOk really like this hate that there is a requirement for words. I have 8 more to go. Don&#x27;t like being required to writ lot</li>
