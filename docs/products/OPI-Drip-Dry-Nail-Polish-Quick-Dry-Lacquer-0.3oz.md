    <li> One drop and my nails are dry!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0012LIHUG OPI Drip Dry Nail Polish Quick Dry Lacquer 0.3oz]]     Cannot do without these drops for those last minute manicures. Polish, wait 45 seconds, drop OPI dryer over nails and be out the door in minutes!</li>
    <li> Guess I expected a product by OPI would be the best? I still like the aerosel dryer better. This product is too messy to use.</li>
    <li> It is good but I love doing Gel Nails so not much use BUT if I was going to use this would be it!!</li>
    <li> I love nail polish.  I have hundreds of bottles and change the color on my fingers and toes at least weekly.  This product is a must for any nail polish lover.  I&#x27;ve dried all kinds of things that were supposed to reduce your polish drying time and they were all disappointments.  A typical manicure for me consists of a coat of Nail Magic, a coat of iron strength Nutra Nail, a coat of Orly Rubberized Bonder Base Coat, two (or 3) coats of nail color, and a coat of Out the Door Top Coat.  With all of those coats it&#x27;s no wonder that it takes eons for my nails to dry, even with a fast drying top coat.  With these drops, at the most it takes 8 minutes...no really,  I timed it!  :-)  I will keep this in stock as long as they make this!  Oh and the item came packaged neatly, arrived with no defects and came on time.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product, it really does what it says. I bought three of them, but only one came with the dropper. the other two were supposed to be a gift, but what can i do without the dropper to apply it? :S</li>
    <li> Just as described! Absolutely love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing ... I now can polish my nails on the go!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, amazing product.</li>
    <li> After trying a ton of these (I think you know what I mean) this stuff FINALLY WORKED!!!!  HIGHLY recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> terrific for drying nails quickly.  wonderful</li>
    <li> Helps to get polish to dry faster</li>
    <li> Excellent product...I take it with me to the nail salon..dries in a few minutes..no more waiting under the dryer for the polish to dry</li>
    <li> Best stuff around....</li>
    <li> This item is not in the packaging that it shows you in the picture. This item is not gift worthy and the packaging is severely tampered with. The box has been cut and re-taped shut. If you plan to use it for yourself than it might be ok, but I would have preferred a new, unopened package instead. Which is what this was pictured and listed as.   This is a promotional gift item that originally came with a small bottle of free OPI nail polish in the Dim Sum Plum color.   They have cut off the top part of the box which had the free nail polish in it but the remaining part of the packaging still says that it should have the nail polish with it. The dropper is inside what is left of the packaging so you can&#x27;t just throw away the cut off box to give this product away as a gift.    They should not have pictured the item in the wrong packaging. I purchased two of these as gifts since they were listed as new items but because of the opened and cut off packaging I could not use them as such.  The company was quick to apologize and to send me a refund but I wouldn&#x27;t want someone else to find out the hard way like I did that what you see and what you will receive are two different things.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. As soon as I&#x27;m done polishing nails, I drip this onto my nails and instantly I can do whatever I want without worrying about smudging my nails. I&#x27;m not patient enough to sit for 15 minutes or more just to watch nails dry.</li>
    <li> awesome product, this is from my girl and she is pretty critical, dry really fast and it is easy to use</li>
    <li> I love this product. This was the first time I purchased OPI Drip Dry, and I continue to be pleasantly surprised by this product. It truly does dry your nail polish to the touch in about 1 minute. I wish I knew about this product sooner, it would have saved me many smudged and chipped nails and tons of time. The bottle is small but you only need 1 drop per nail, so I do think it will last awhile. I will definitely purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> First of all be aware that this is a teeny bottle. 0.3 ounces is not much. I had not looked closely at the quantity and was surprised at the tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle came without a dropper, and so I was not sure how to use the product initially. I had plastic droppers, but thought that the ingredients might not do too well with plastic droppers. Eventually, I unearthed a tiny glass dropper that I had saved from something else , and it worked alright.  I would think that dropper would be standard issue with a product  like this.  Perhaps it was a &#x27;special&#x27; bottle that should have had a dropper, but passed through the line without one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product works quite well as advertised. It does make polish dry more quickly. Give give it 5 minutes to really set (as the instructions indicate). This is not a manicure &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;, but it does help when you are in the middle of applying polish and run out of time! I am a fan of OPI products, but I was a but surprised at how small this &#x27;normal&#x27; sized bottle is, and I wonder why it is packaged this way and not in larger, more normal sized, bottle (with applicator!)</li>
    <li> This product is a life-saver! Every girl hates waiting for nail polish to dry and I&#x27;m one of the people that always messes it up in the process, so this is my new best friend.  It&#x27;s true: within a minute or 2 of putting it on, your nails are dry to the touch. Don&#x27;t do anything crazy with your nails for a few more minutes but it&#x27;s alot easier if you&#x27;re on-the-go.    GREAT buy! I recommend using every time you apply your nail polish (:</li>
    <li> Used it a former nail salon, then moved and new salon didnt offer it, so i found it on Amazon and ordered it.....first one i receiced box was crushed and top was lose.....called, replacement was sent out withing 2 days..back to using it!</li>
    <li> One of the best nail products ever.</li>
    <li> Have uses this before and like but these are too small to purchase at that price. Would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;this because to much cost and too small. Tips over and all product is gone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best quick dry but it works. The only thing I dislike is the dropper, is tiny. With wet nails, I was so nervous I might mess up my nails using the dropper.</li>
    <li> I get frustrated whenever I paint my nails because I ALWAYS end up smudging my paint before it has a chance to dry. OPI Drip Dry works like magic to dry my nails to the touch within a minute or two. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I paint my nails every 2-3 days and this product makes my life so much easier. With this product I can paint my nails and get on with life without having to wait for hours for my nails to dry. I usually err on the side of caution by not doing anything for about ten mins after applying. Then I can do most things, though anything super crazy can still dent your polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a few negative reviews about this product not working (polish still taking hours to dry) I have to assume they either got a bad bottle or more likely, are using thick goopey polishes that the product just cant penetrate. I use OPI polishes exclusively bc I prefer a thin even coat of polish and I&#x27;ve only had success with this product. I am currently on my third bottle and can honest say I will buy this product as long as I live or until they stop making it, whichever happens last.</li>
    <li> Saw this at a nail salon &amp; decided to buy it. It really does dry within seconds with only one or two drops per nail</li>
    <li> I love this product. Since I first bought it I have started doing my nails a lot more often as it takes me so much less time than it used to. A definite home-manicure must for me.</li>
    <li> Truly the best invention since sliced bread... I normally use gel or shellac on my nails, but when I do use regular polish, I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> OPI Drip Dry is amazing!  I wish I had known about this product years ago.  After I paint my nails, I wait about a minute and then put one or two drops on each nail.  Then they&#x27;re dry within another minute or two!  The drops have a sort of oily texture to them, which probably also helps prevent messing up your polish if you do happen to bump into something too hard.  This product is a must-have for anyone who paints their nails frequently and wants to get back to doing things without having to wait twenty minutes first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to write more informative reviews, so if you found this review helpful, please check &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; below where it says &amp;#34;Was this review helpful to you?&amp;#34;. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This makes all the difference in my manicure; it works exceptionally well.  Worth every penny.  No smudges, no chips and dries the polish thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Great product for me when I polish my nails. Drys quickly and polish lasts until you ready to change the color.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! It works really well, I love it.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Love this product, works fast. I take it to the nail salon and everyone asks me about it. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> One of my bets purchases. I usually use fats drying top coats, but many of my polishes are matte, so I decided to try this. I am very happy with the result,s it really dries fast and moisturizes cuticles as well. I&#x27;ll be being the 1oz bottle next time. Just be sure to order one with a dropper, mine luckily had one in the package.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I love doing my nails and have a job were people see my hands all day and where it&#x27;s important for them to look nice and professional.  My only problem was finding the time to get my nails done.  I work full-time and have a family so at the end of the day I&#x27;m tired.  I would find myself painting my nails and falling asleep before they were totally dry so I would wake up in the morning with sheet marks in the polish.  It was so frustrating!  This product really does dry my nails, COMPLETELY in five minutes!  They are dry to the touch in one minute and completely dry in five!  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect, delivery was made as the deadline.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> It really worked.It actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to. Your nails dry very quickly, what more can I say about this product.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works with almost all nail polishes.  Gave 4 stars because I really don&#x27;t like the way it smells.  Please change the smell if at all possible.</li>
    <li> hard to work with when doing one&#x27;s own nails.</li>
    <li> Even when I thought my nails were dry, I would go to sleep and wake up with rinkles on them. No more, EVEN!!!. And I polish 4 coats. Base, 2 color and top. Drop drip dry on and done. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. Don&#x27;t plan to be without this again. Try it. You will love it. Especially with kids who smudge there nails. :-)</li>
    <li> Really works! My nail salon ended up ordering some for their customers that are in a hurry. A few drops, a few minutes and out the door.</li>
    <li> One drop per nail and you are good to go......carefully.  But usually I can get into the car, drive and get home without wrecking my nails.  All without sitting at the nail place for 20  minutes.</li>
    <li> First tried this at the beauty salon - just HAD to have it at home.  My nails dry so much faster - within minutes they&#x27;re (lightly) touchable.  I can now do my nails before bed, and not have to worry about cross-hatched nails in the morning!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this! My daughter and I usually paint our nails and then sit for hours waiting for them to dry. My package arrived, I opened it and realized there was no dropper included. I went to several stores before I found a dropper at Walgreens. We painted our nails and applied a few drops to each nail (per a video on YouTube on how to use because I also didn&#x27;t get any instructions) I waited just as long as I normally would for the nails to be dry. There is no way I could dapple this product, wait a few minutes and then go about my day. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is life A GIFT FROM GOD! I wish I knew about this sooner! EVERYONE NEEDS THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 9 year old daughter who LOVES to paint her nails and changes her nail color frequently.  Tried this myself and loved that it dried my nails so quickly - before I was able to ruin/smudge them, lol.  So much easier than waiting for your nails to air-dry.  The only problem is that it runs out so quickly and you have to buy more.</li>
    <li> This little oily magic really works to dry your nails fast!</li>
    <li> good product, late delivery</li>
    <li> Love this product! If only I had discovered it sooner!</li>
    <li> Worth the money! Dries nails in about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> My nails are dry almost instantly! No more worrying if I will smudge them 30 seconds after I finish painting them! They can still smudge if something hits them hard for about 30 minutes but that has only happened once for me.</li>
    <li> IT really DOES WORK ...This stuff is Great. It goes on super super thin! You might think its not doing anything but it does! It gives you strength without being bulky resulting in annoying chipping on the sides!! AND you dont get that top coat stuck to the skin which later is a pain. If you know what i mean. That side chip you can never really fix. Takes a few coats . Use mindfully and precisely to save it. It goes on almost like water. As you might be able to tell I use it to also seal...protect my top coat. I use it EVERYDAY amazing how long you can go with fresh looking nails.</li>
    <li> I should trust the bad review and not buying this... I don&#x27;t see it helps to dry the nail color faster.</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference in how long your manicure last.</li>
    <li> Finally!  I enjoy doing my own nails but hate waiting for them to dry.  This decreases the time significantly.  I believe it works best with OPi nail polish.  I have used it with Zoya as well but it seems to take a little longer.  It definitely reduces dry time but I still give them 30-60 minutes to dry completely if I want no smudges.</li>
    <li> This just depends on why you want to buy it. It doesn&#x27;t dry the nail polish completely just makes the top layer dry enough to put on a second coat.</li>
    <li> Like this product, does help dry nail quicker</li>
    <li> Another product that does the trick</li>
    <li> Best quick dry ever.  Some complain of polish dulling after a few days.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  My manicure lasts almost 3 weeks without any changes.</li>
    <li> Finally!!!!  Now I don&#x27;t have to wait hours for my manicure to dry and then have it smudge anyway. A few drops on each nail and my night was free again. I need to stock up on this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy. it didnt come with a dropper.</li>
    <li> After receiving a manicure I decided to ask my technician for a quick dry, watched her apply the opi quick dripper and than to see it actually worked!! I was amazed. Now that I have my own, I know longer have to worry about the extra charge.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> love this quick dry lacquer, it really works</li>
    <li> I always use OPI products. This is the very best nail polish dryer drops. The price from this seller is a great value.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It work really well to dry your nails quickly which is important when you only have short amounts of time that you can&#x27;t touch anything.  It will change color when it gets old, but it still works.</li>
    <li> Omg have bought this sooo many times and will continue  dries your nail sooooo FAST! Its crazy. When ur in a rush or dont have patience  to wait around  this is a life saver. And its way cheaper on amazon  then like ulta!</li>
    <li> Drys my nails very fast. I usually do them before bed for some reason and this is great for not waking up with weird patterns smashed into the polish.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product and it didn&#x27;t have a dropper like the picture shows.</li>
    <li> IF YOU DONT HAVE TIME TO WAIT ON YOUR NAILS TO DRY,,YOU NEED TO GET THIS PRODUCT ITS INSTANT DRY FOR BUSY BODIES THAT CANT WAIT</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Does a great job! Will dry your nail polish and set it within 2 to 3 minutes! Sets it so no smudges. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> i love this product it really works!</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well! Nails are left a bit oily but won&#x27;t smudge or anything and are effectively dry within 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li> My nails dry so quickly.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I must be alone here... maybe it&#x27;s the water in Tennessee!  But I first had this used at the salon and I immediately ordered some for myself.  A few days later I noticed my nice pretty pedicure looked matte and flat and terrible!  I ASSUMED it was because I went to the pool and the chemicals didn&#x27;t mesh well with the polish, etc.  I then received this in the mail a few days later and applied when I repainted my nails... looked pretty for a day or 2 then same thing happened a few days later, this time no pool!  I have stopped using and it hasn&#x27;t happened again so this product is garbage to me.</li>
    <li> I never knew about this before I came across it online. It is so cool! I haven&#x27;t tried touching anything too much, but at least I can at least touch my phone or my hair without it ruining the paint job.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and works great to dry your nail polish faster. All you need is a drop on each nail from the dropper.</li>
    <li> To start, I invested in the entire gelish system because I hate when my nails chip. While I like the gelish system, it takes forever to do my nails. I wanted a better process for doing quick manicure and pedicures, so I started  looking on Amazon and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the OPI base coat, polish of my choice, OPI topcoat and then a drip of this on each nail and WOW - it dries immediately. Using this product with the combination of the OPI base and top coats has changed the way I do my nails. They often last a full week without a chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has almost made it unnecessary to go through the whole gel process and saves a ton of time. You will not regret buying this!</li>
    <li> What a great addition to mani pedi setup. Makes nails dry faster!</li>
    <li> Dries awesomely fast.</li>
    <li> Always a &#x27;must have&#x27; product for nail fanatics. Love this, polish dries in less than five minutes.</li>
    <li> I wish this worked. Maybe its me. I painted my nails and tried a few drops and still my nail polish never dried. I have heard Sally&#x27;s has a drip dry that works better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking a dropper would be included like it is in the picture. However upon receipt, there&#x27;s no dropper.  This is really frustrating!</li>
    <li> This probably works as advertised. But it came with a plain screw top -- no brush applicator, no eye-drop type applicator as shown in the photo. Sure, I could return it, but why bother. Easier and cheaper to throw it out. Just very disappointed.</li>
    <li> does a great job, just by  applying one or two drops to each nail after you have finished polishing your nails.</li>
    <li> I love how fast this makes my nail polish dry. At first your fingers will feel oily but it will evaporate.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product , for those of us who are impatient.  No time to waste.</li>
    <li> this product was O.K. not impressed.</li>
    <li> Everyone should keep this little bottle in your manicure experience!! It truly dries your nails quickly and for a bonus, moisturizes your cuticles. Can&#x27;t beat that ladies!!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. In 5 minutes my nails are dry!</li>
