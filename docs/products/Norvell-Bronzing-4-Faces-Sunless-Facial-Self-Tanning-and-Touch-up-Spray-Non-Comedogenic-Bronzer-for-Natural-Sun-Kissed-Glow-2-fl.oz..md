      <li>Love this face tanner.</li>
      <li>Make sure to wash your hands afterwards or they will be stained.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use a sponge....</li>
      <li>love this product line</li>
      <li>Might be better for darker skin tones than what I am.</li>
      <li>Use it all the time... :)</li>
      <li>I thought it would show up more with each use.</li>
      <li>I love my spray tan system, but face fades faster than the rest of my body.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>My customers love buying this separately for touch ups</li>
      <li>Love Love Love.</li>
      <li>and they get so excited!</li>
      <li>But good on normal skin.</li>
      <li>This product works instantly and is easy to use!!!</li>
      <li>Love this product, it goes on nicely, I get tons of compliments that it looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>Initially I thought it was a great sunless product.</li>
      <li>It is a perfect way to give a little extra color to your face between spray tans or even on its own~</li>
      <li>This keeps it off my fingers and gives me full control of the application.  </li>
      <li>This product is good, I have re-ordered numerous times.  </li>
      <li>My most favorite facial tanning!!</li>
      <li>It was a great price compared to what I&#x27;ve previously paid, even when you add in shipping.</li>
      <li>but I get better results from the professional using the airbrush.  </li>
      <li>Probably the most natural face bronzer I have ever seen on the market.  </li>
      <li>and sometimes I give as a complimentary gift</li>
      <li>I found it to be pretty fool proof.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read the directions the first time and sprayed it on my face.</li>
      <li>I spray about 3 to 4 squirts in my palms and rub in with a little of my own moisturizer.</li>
      <li>These areas for me exfoliate so fast they cant keep up with the rest of my spray tan.</li>
      <li>I really like the ease of application.  </li>
      <li>It dries fast so you can use it any time, day or night.</li>
      <li>The spray nozzle is unusual to use too.</li>
      <li>You may need to experiment with how many &amp;#34;sprays&amp;#34; as sometimes I&#x27;ve done a little too much</li>
      <li>I only use Norvell  cleanser when washing my face as most Dove or similar soap will remove the tan.</li>
      <li>Love to use this for a little sun kissed look on the face.  </li>
      <li>so it takes a day to make me look more natural and not so dark.</li>
      <li>It made my face super red and irritated and did not look natural at all.</li>
      <li>It does not run and looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>Product came quickly in the mail and was as expected.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look natural on pourus skin.</li>
      <li>I get professionally spray tanned and my girl uses this product</li>
      <li>It does not make you look orange at all, just a natural tan look.  </li>
      <li>A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>it had such a short shelf life, especially for how much it costs.</li>
      <li>; Unfortunately I don&#x27;t get to the beach often, but don&#x27;t look my best with my naturally pale complexion, so this product keeps me looking like I&#x27;ve gotten a little sun without the damaging rays.</li>
      <li>I have gotten NUMEROUS compliments on this touch-up/sunless facial spray as to how tan I look, how natural it looks, and constant questions &amp;#34;were</li>
      <li>it will make it much darker, so try to use less product on them or put a dab of moisturizer on them .</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t aggrivate my sensitive skin, natural color, little to no odor, and it matches the SUN Laboratories, which is what I use on my body.  </li>

    <li> useless. gave no color. broke me out</li>
    <li> I love this product! My customers love buying this separately for touch ups and sometimes I give as a complimentary gift and they get so excited!</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of application.  I use a small facial sponge and spray the sponge.  This keeps it off my fingers and gives me full control of the application.  The one caution I have is, it is dark, so be prepared for that.  I liked that, but for some it will be a drastic difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this little bottle says for the face. It&#x27;s basically a tiny bottle of spray tan, it&#x27;s not airbrush or aerosol so if i sprayed it on my face i&#x27;d look like a clown. I just don&#x27;t get it, maybe you can spray it on your legs or other body parts and rub it in but the face..uh. no. Maybe spray in your hands and put it on your face yeah, but I still just don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Great for blending my body spray tan with my face.  Doesn&#x27;t break you out.</li>
    <li> I get professionally spray tanned and my girl uses this product so I bought it to use myself. I spray about 3 to 4 squirts in my palms and rub in with a little of my own moisturizer. There is ZERO yellowing from this spray</li>
    <li> Perfect for spray tanning and when you take off your make up and notice that the make-up remover is taking the spray tan off too!  This product works instantly and is easy to use!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great seller</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or promote acne, which I am prone to.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Doesn&#x27;t aggrivate my sensitive skin, natural color, little to no odor, and it matches the SUN Laboratories, which is what I use on my body.  I will be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I thought it would show up more with each use. I can hardly even tell I put it on. The spray nozzle is unusual to use too.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly in the mail and was as expected.  It was a great price compared to what I&#x27;ve previously paid, even when you add in shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is good, I have re-ordered numerous times.  Self-tanners are a joke when compared to Amber Sun.  Apply before bed and wake up with a beautiful glow, just make sure to blend appropriately and wash your hands thoroughly after applying..</li>
    <li> Use it all the time... :)</li>
    <li> This product does not work well. It made my face super red and irritated and did not look natural at all.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for a quick all day or sometimes two day tan on your face.  It does not run and looks very natural.  Probably the most natural face bronzer I have ever seen on the market.  It does not make you look orange at all, just a natural tan look.  A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> My Bottle was out dated.it was 3/17/14 . I was scared to used it. The other bottle I got was out dated too</li>
    <li> Love to use this for a little sun kissed look on the face.  It works well, I use a sponge to pat it on my face after spraying.</li>
    <li> Initially I thought it was a great sunless product. Easy to use! Good color. Didn&#x27;t smell horrible. That was about six months ago. I went to use it last night in preparation for a wedding and it had turned green. I had no idea it had such a short shelf life, especially for how much it costs. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday because I don&#x27;t use much makeup.love the color every pretty.only wish it lasted longer but, I have used this for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> Amazon did a great job !!</li>
    <li> love this product line</li>
    <li> I used this spray on my face, and tops of my feet and hands as a touch up after my spray tan. These areas for me exfoliate so fast they cant keep up with the rest of my spray tan. I found it to be pretty fool proof. I used a makeup sponge and never once woke up looking orange. Its very buildable so its hard to mess up.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Excellent product. Thank you. Lori</li>
    <li> I will be buying this again, it does a great job and very easy to use. It dries fast so you can use it any time, day or night. I like to use before bed, but I have used as a bronzer if I want to be darker  that day.  One thing I found was if you have a mold (beauty mark) it will make it much darker, so try to use less product on them or put a dab of moisturizer on them . It wiill last about a week.  I only use Norvell  cleanser when washing my face as most Dove or similar soap will remove the tan.</li>
    <li> I love my spray tan system, but face fades faster than the rest of my body. Love this face tanner. Works great , way to use. Use a face sponge to apply. I didn&#x27;t read the directions the first time and sprayed it on my face. (Which made me look wayyyy to dark.) Used properly this is a must have item.</li>
    <li> 3 1/3 Stars would be my rating.  This works well but I get better results from the professional using the airbrush.  This must be applied using a makeups sponge or equivalent and it is difficult to get the same even coverage.  It brings out dark spots in some areas that are not produced when I have the airbrush application by a pro.</li>
    <li> Make sure to use a sponge....this is very spotty even after a few applications. Might be better for darker skin tones than what I am.</li>
    <li> its dark so be careful. its a great product though</li>
    <li> They sent me expired product so would never order from this company again. However I do like the product. Spray on face &amp; neck and blend with fingertips or a sponge. You can blend with face cream. Make sure to wash your hands afterwards or they will be stained.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it goes on nicely, I get tons of compliments that it looks very natural.  It&#x27;s great-sometimes I don&#x27;t even put make up on I just spray my face, rub it in and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Great with a tanning mitt for touch up in between spray tans.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I am not sure that I would purchase this item again. It&#x27;s does not leave an orange tint, but applying it evenly is difficult.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been writing reviews yet rely on them constantly, so making effort to start. I have gotten NUMEROUS compliments on this touch-up/sunless facial spray as to how tan I look, how natural it looks, and constant questions &amp;#34;were you just at the beach!?!&amp;#34; Unfortunately I don&#x27;t get to the beach often, but don&#x27;t look my best with my naturally pale complexion, so this product keeps me looking like I&#x27;ve gotten a little sun without the damaging rays. It does NOT LOOK ORANGEY or FAKE! I reapply every 3-4 days and the best part is I often don&#x27;t wear cover-up/foundation when I have the &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; from this product! I only found it from doing a &amp;#34;spray-tan&amp;#34; and the business sold it as touch-up but she&#x27;d shared her similar experience so I tried it. You may need to experiment with how many &amp;#34;sprays&amp;#34; as sometimes I&#x27;ve done a little too much so it takes a day to make me look more natural and not so dark.</li>
    <li> cant apply with sponge like suggested, cant spray on your face because it drips and spatters..</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. I use this all the time on my face in between spray tanning.</li>
    <li> Like I said its good for touch ups. It worked on my face skin type, but was a little blotchy on my daughter&#x27;s face. Doesn&#x27;t look natural on pourus skin. But good on normal skin.</li>
    <li> My most favorite facial tanning!!</li>
    <li> It is a perfect way to give a little extra color to your face between spray tans or even on its own~</li>
