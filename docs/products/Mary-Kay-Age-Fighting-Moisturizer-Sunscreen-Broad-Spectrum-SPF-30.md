      <li>My face remains very oily for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>this one is gentle and has the SPF I need without smelling like sunscreen or being too greasy.  </li>
      <li>and I really need</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased moisturizer that it contained sunscreen in it, it leaves my skin feeling very sticky or tacky.  </li>

      <li>I have used Mary Kay products since right after the company was founded, use it everyday.  </li>
      <li>Mary Kay products are the only products on the market so far that don&#x27;t bring it back.</li>

    <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay products since right after the company was founded, use it everyday.  Have been complimented often on how young I look from people in my age bracket and I give Mary Kay products all the credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices are great on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very nice facial cream with good sun block rating</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used...  it really protects my skin from sun and moisturizes at the same time.  I love it !</li>
    <li> I love this product it arrive quick. But just make sure u don&#x27;t touch ur eyes when putting the cream in ur face it stings</li>
    <li> No complaints!  Came as requested and fast!</li>
    <li> The Product says it is for oily skin, but my face looks like it has a sheen of oil on it after applying. My face remains very oily for the rest of the day. I already have very oily skin, so with the product on, my makeup doesn&#x27;t want to stay in place, and is wiped off or smeared by quitting time.</li>
    <li> I just order this about every month or so; it&#x27;s been my only facial moisturizer for years and works great for me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this moisturizer .</li>
    <li> Great product- have used it for years.  I won&#x27;t use a moisturizer without sunscreen.  This does the job.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I wrote for the wrong product.  Don&#x27;t get this one in your eyes.  It burns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Marykay user...have used this for years..Love the feel on my skin.  I will be ordering this in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream I ever use. It&#x27;s great, but be sure not to get too close to the eyes. There is a higher sunscreen 30* now and it burns if too close to the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Mary Kay lotions.  It works great after the night cream or even by it self. I like the travel size to keep in my different purses.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased moisturizer that it contained sunscreen in it, it leaves my skin feeling very sticky or tacky.  Nothing like moisturizer I know and love!</li>
    <li> love this!  Been using for years...no wrinkles :)</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I have found. Goes on easy and smoothly, absorbs quickly and protects all day long. No scent. I highly recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she is very happy with it, a lot cheaper than getting it at macys or other retail store.</li>
    <li> I have a rep who I usually buy my Mary Kay products from and I will continue to do so. She just wasn&#x27;t going to put an order in for three months and I was out. So I bought it thru amazon. I was extemely disappointed in the packaging. By the time I recieved my product, it looked like it went thru a crusher. I was surprised that the item was not destroyed. All my Mary Kay products, which came individually shipped looked like that. That part bothered me, but the products itself. I love. I have rosesha, which has taken me several years to clear up. Mary Kay products are the only products on the market so far that don&#x27;t bring it back. I have extremely sensitive facial skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and it&#x27;s the only one that does not sting and actually moisturizes without leaving my skin greasy.</li>
    <li> Use this product before and I am well pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It smoothed out the skin while providing necessary things such as SPF. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> creamy. Not oily. Blend on skin easily. Seems to work!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer around!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different moisturizers and this one is my favorite.  I have sensitive skin and I really need SPF 30- this one is gentle and has the SPF I need without smelling like sunscreen or being too greasy.  I use this daily and I think my skin looks healthier.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used! Cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product for very long so it&#x27;s hard to say. I like the idea of age fighting and SPF in one rather then using multiple products.  My only problem is it&#x27;s a little greasy feeling on my face.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I think it is ok for the price that is why the 4 stars bought this as a present for my mom who uses mary kay products maybe to her the product is 5 stars since she prfers mary kay but I think the price is a little too steep for the size of this product maybe i&#x27;m wrong this is just my opinion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a MK user for over 30 years. Their TimeWise moisturizer is the only one I will use on my face. I get comments from other people about how good my face looks for someone in their mid-50&#x27;s. I highly recommend/1</li>
    <li> I have usedMary Kay products for 15 plus years and I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> Great product. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I love my mary kay produce!</li>
    <li> I was unable to use this product because I am allergic to most sunscreens.  The Timewise that I have used has zinc oxide which is okay for me.  Not so this one.  I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I have had a real problem finding a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash.  This one works really well; and works as a good moisturizer under my makeup</li>
    <li> Great product - perfect condition - easy transaction - THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> I quit using the day solution when they increased the SPF from 15 to 30 because it irritated my skin and smelled bad. Same thing happened here. I loved this moisturizer when it was SPF 15. Now that its SPF 30 it burns my face and leaves it red and blotchy. I really don&#x27;t see a difference between this and the day solution. They smell and feel the same. I get irritated with Mary Kay because every time I fall in love with a product they change it. Time to make a permanent switch I guess.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay for many years, but just found this product.  My face clearly looks younger, pores are smaller, and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and have no trouble wearing it day to day. I just returned from the beach and wore it the first day and the warmer I was the more it burned.  Another lady at the pool said she felt the same way from the same product.  Needless to say the SPF has no value day to day indoors and the burn is not worth the protection outdoors.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It goes on clean and even.  A great protection against the sun however, you do need to reapply if you remain in the sun.  It does not have the unpleasant feel or smell of other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Great product, extremely fast service!</li>
    <li> Product as described and quick delivery!  I love that the moisturizer has 30 spf, yet it still goes on smoothly and wears well under make-up</li>
    <li> You can smell the sunscreen, I use this when I know I am going to be out in the sun for a long time.</li>
    <li> Leaves an oily sheen on my face.  Also have to be really careful not to apply too much at once, otherwise it&#x27;ll clump and peel off when you try to rub it in.  I have never had sunscreen that would immediately start clumping, which makes for any kind of makeup application over it mildly infuriating.</li>
