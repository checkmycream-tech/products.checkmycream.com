<li> Who would use a toilet cover on their face?  </li>
<li> While they did not absorb as much facial oil as the face blotting paper, using several to do the job is still considerably less money than purchasing the regular face blotting papers.&lt;br</li>
<li> It removes surface oil without disturbing the makeup I have applied.</li>

    <li> I purchased these for use with traditional foam rollers, so the ends of my daughter&#x27;s hair wouldn&#x27;t get rolled with funny kinks. It does the job! Such a tiny box for 1,000 sheets!!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted a great price.</li>
    <li> fast deliver, excellent price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s necessary when doing perm</li>
    <li> I am so happy I received it just in time. it is perfect and in good condition. my new system of hair styling works with this perfectly.</li>
    <li> These papers are a great addition to wrapping around ends of my long hair when I&#x27;m using rollers! They are a great size to enhance and facilitate manipulating around ends of hair before wrapping around rollers!</li>
    <li> Good size and good value for the price</li>
    <li> NEEDED TO STOCK UP ON THESE...AND GLAD TO FIND THEM ON AMAZON..THEY FILLED OUR NEED.</li>
    <li> They worked perfectly just like it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that end wraps are made of the same material as toilet covers, which some people (not me) use to wipe oil off their face.  Ew.  Who would use a toilet cover on their face?  My face is not a toilet, Jerome.  Please stop trying to urinate on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, these end wraps don&#x27;t work so well to wipe oil off your face.  I know it&#x27;s not the use they&#x27;re meant for, but for anyone who wants to try, don&#x27;t bother.  These don&#x27;t remove the oil, they just end up smearing it around, so your face feels like a hand painting.</li>
    <li> Needed this to protect my hair from my rollers, great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Large size is great. Didn&#x27;t have to throw away any of them like you do with the smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> Great deal and a great product!</li>
    <li> Exactly as you would assume end wraps to be</li>
    <li> One day while receiving a perm I noticed that the consistency of the perm end papers closely resembled the face blotting papers I was purchasing. I bought a package of end papers, and as an experiment, started to use them as facial blotters for the &amp;#34;afternoon shine&amp;#34; that I develop on my face. Much to my delight, they worked pretty well. While they did not absorb as much facial oil as the face blotting paper, using several to do the job is still considerably less money than purchasing the regular face blotting papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the perm end papers to blot excess moisturizer before applying my foundation. This helps to prolong the appearance of excess oil on my face. Then I use the papers to remove excess oil whenever I need to freshen my makeup. It removes surface oil without disturbing the makeup I have applied.</li>
    <li> It arrived as expected in good condition. The product is durable and protects the ends of my hair from sponge rollers.</li>
    <li> The end wraps were exactly what I was looking for and needed.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery product was as described... thank you</li>
    <li> Arrive fast and did it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Glad I got the larger size, makes hair wrapping easier.</li>
    <li> Used them for the first time today.  Gave myself a perm.  The only way they would be better if they were prefolded.</li>
