    <li> Great tan color. A little bit goes a long way, so this little container will probably last a while!  Will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this bronzer for myself and am extremely pleased with the product. I have been a fan of W3ll People&#x27;s product line as an aesthetician who sees many companies producing mediocre and/or chemical-laden products. This bronzer has a beautiful texture (very blendable) and natural tan without requiring layers of powder to see definition. The seller, Carbon Beauty, shipped quickly and on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in search of an all natural bronzer.  I&#x27;m dark complected and have tried bronzers in the past, however it was hard to find one that showed up on my skin tone.

    <li> I am very happy with the Bi Bronzer.  It applies easily, is a very nice, natural looking color, and stays all day.  This is my first w3ll product, as I am slowly replacing my makeup with natural/safe alternatives.  I will definitely continue to replace with w3ll products!</li>
    <li> My skin is on the lighter side and has golden undertones. With more sun in spring, I do tend to get tanned. It&#x27;s only May on the east coast and I&#x27;m already getting a bit tanned, so this bio bronzer is a good match right now. It may be a bit too light for me in summer though. I like it&#x27;s texture, but wish that it had a bit more peachy color to it. It&#x27;s a bit too brown to my taste.</li>
    <li> Great product! Super natural looking. Not orange at all! And so nice to put a product on my face that I know is not filled with chemicals.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s not sparkly or glittery.  The color is rather dark on medium beige skin.  Glad I tried it out but not sure if I would purchase the same color again.  Good also for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> When I first tried the bronzer, I didn&#x27;t think I would like it.  It has a bit of sparkle, and was lighter in color than I&#x27;m used to--it seemed to be very opaque when I put it on.  But it blends incredibly well, and looks very natural.  In the end, I think it&#x27;s a great product!  It does have a bit of sparkle to it also.</li>
    <li> I love this natural bronzer. I was looking for an all natural bronzer and after reading reviews decided to try this-well worth the price. I use a little over my foundation and it gives that natural tan look-have used alone as well and I like both ways-I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated  it at all-Great buy!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bronzed look- if you have pale, faiir skin like mine, make sure to swirl it on tissue and apply lightly.  I was afraid it would be too dark, but it was actually perfect.  Fast and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is the perfect color for me!  I used to use a dark bronzer and blush over the top to achieve the look I wanted from natural mineral makeup.  Now I don&#x27;t have to!  This shade is like a sun kissed tan.  I applied with with a blush brush in contour areas and it equaled a beautiful glow.  I&#x27;m very happy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> great bronzer and I really really like the Kabuki brush to apply this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my W3LL People Bronzer.  I just started use W3LL People products and I am completely obsessed.  They are natural, safe for my skin, and wear well!  I would highly recommend to anyone that has peaked curiosity.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this bronzer. It looks natural and does not have a orange or shimmery look. I like it best with the well people translucent finishing powder on top. Definitely going to continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bronzer! It gives you the most natural beautiful color. Prior to switching to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; beauty products, I used Benefit&#x27;s Hoola bronzer and I loved it. I think W3ll&#x27;s bio bronzer is really similiar to Benefits, but slightly superior in color and way superior in the ingredient category. I will definitely buy this again and again and would recommend to everyone who likes a nice bronze glow without laying out to get it.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this bronzer.  I have very fair skin, but it blends in well (and doesn&#x27;t make me look like I applied spray tan to my face). It also feels light on the skin while providing good coverage.</li>
    <li> I am very conscious about using safe, chemical free products. I love this product. It is by far my favorite bronzer! This is my first W3LL PEOPLE product and I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I&#x27;m very fair (Blonde hair and blue eyes) and this bronzer works with my skin tone. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using this product. I would 100% recommend this product to anyone!  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and was worried that this bronzer was going to be too dark, but it blended so perfectly and evenly. Gave me a little glow without looking make up-y.

    <li> Great color, Best all natural bronzer I have found.</li>
