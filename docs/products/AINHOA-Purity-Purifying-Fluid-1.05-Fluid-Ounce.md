### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This ia perfect for a day or 2 after a peel..</li>
      <li>, I thought \\&quot;great: my skin&#x27;s going to get all inflamed and cracked</li>
      <li>The bottle is attractive.</li>
      <li>I feel like this works as a good toner but do find that it&#x27;s pricey for what it is.</li>
      <li>I used it at night and my skin totally loved it.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve always used an astringent after washing my face, most of the time I just use witch hazel because it&#x27;s inexpensive and convenient to buy, but this has been a very nice alternative.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try it, though!</li>
      <li>I also felt the smell was pleasant and refreshing.</li>
      <li>The results are amazing.  </li>
      <li>I also can&#x27;t imagine spending that kind of money on something like this.</li>
      <li>I liked it.  </li>
      <li>It comes in nice packaging.</li>
      <li>I liked the serum like texture of this toner.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell that it does anything for me.</li>
      <li>is a nice way to refresh your skin</li>
      <li>but my skin seems to be clearing up nicely</li>
      <li>After about a month of using it, it almost smells nice, but not quite.</li>
      <li>It smells nice.</li>
      <li>I found this fluid to work wonderfully with my skin, immediately tightening pores and giving my skin a nice healthy glow.</li>
      <li>Since using this product, I&#x27;m having more problems with breakouts than before.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s any better than the nice-smelling witch hazel</li>
      <li>this product has made me more diligent about the rest of my skin-care regimen, namely remembering to use it AND a moisturizer before bed.  </li>
      <li>more like $10 would be better.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice and light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something else out there.  </li>
      <li>I think that my skin is more balanced and healthier.  </li>
      <li>REALLY love this product but can&#x27;t justify the $55.00 price tag that comes with it.  </li>
      <li>Many people commented on the smell -</li>
      <li>I would love to try more products in the AINHOA line, however...</li>
      <li>I used this along with the Gold serum which is just ok.</li>
      <li>When I tried this product, its fragrance was very familiar to me.</li>
      <li>I am all about paraban and pthalate free products and have found others out there that deliver better results than this product and at a better price point.  </li>
      <li>More importantly, though, I just didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin after using this.  </li>
      <li>It feels nice on the skin, and is completely absorbed as soon as you apply it.</li>
      <li>Many languages, not so many useful things to say.</li>
      <li>And witch hazel is so much cheaper, and comes in a variety of nice scents.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this \\&quot;Purifying Fluid\\&quot; as I did with a cheap drugstore bottle of Witch Hazel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light when you put it on.</li>
      <li>One of the main ingredients is mint which leaves skin feeling fresh (and pleasantly tingling).  </li>
      <li>I do think that this leaves me skin feeling fresh and clean and rids my skin of excess oil that just ends up creating more breakouts.</li>
      <li>Great as a general toner, but doesn&#x27;t do much for more severe breakouts/cysts.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I also developed a blemish after the first two times of using it, although to be fair, I can&#x27;t say that I am 100% sure that this product caused it.</li>
      <li>To be fair, this product states it is most useful for oily to moderate skin</li>
      <li>Some reviewers complain about the smell, but I associate it with feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
      <li>It is not too large, so it is safe to pack it for travel purposes.  </li>
      <li>Since I have very oily skin, it was OK for me.&lt;br /&gt;It is watery, and I applied with a cotton pad.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product has a very strong smell, and for people like me that suffer migraines and are very sensitive to smell this immediately turned me off.</li>
      <li>I feel it is invigorating to my skin, and feels clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This could work well for someone with super oily skin, though.</li>
      <li>First of all my skin is admittedly very sensitive and while this product felt nice and tingly, it didn&#x27;t do wonders for my complexion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been told that I have normal skin, but I have so many breakouts, I can&#x27;t see why.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s very liquid in form and had to use a cotton ball to apply as it drips too easily otherwise.</li>
      <li>If it was thicker and cheaper, I probably would continue to buy it, but it just isn&#x27;t worth the price for what you get.</li>
      <li>Before using this product, I rarely had pimples.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has camphor/menthol, which gives it a distinct smell.</li>
      <li>, I imagine it would be useful in the summer months.</li>
      <li>Most toners are a complete liquid and they seem to evaporate before doing anything in depth.</li>
      <li>and my skin is fair and tends to break out just a little</li>
      <li>It is pretty runny and smells like rubbing alcohol</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty liquidy</li>
      <li>Or possibly like cough drops (eucalyptus), but to me it&#x27;s mostly mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anywhoo, the first couple of days I used it, I noticed no change in my pores.</li>
      <li>I was interested in seeing what \\&quot;purifying fluid\\&quot; was</li>
      <li>but just know it comes out funny and might spray you</li>
      <li>My pores are smaller and my skin is very clean.  </li>
      <li>I love witch hazel, been using it on my face for years, and I suspect a lot of what I like about this fluid is thanks to the witch</li>
      <li>But now I&#x27;m using it again, the Witch Hazel, and it was kind like welcoming an old friend back home.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything positive for me maybe it will for you.</li>
      <li>I have been searching and searching for a product that works for as long as I can remember, and I have not been able to find anything, until now.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so when I first had a whiff of this product right out of the pump (it smells like SeaBreeze- remember that stuff?)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brand, and I am sure that I will start adding other products from this line to my daily skin care routine.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and you get a large amount, so it will last for a while.</li>
      <li>It is not a serum at all, but a thin, clear liquid, just like Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel is okay very extremely mild acne, but for more severe breakouts or cysts, it will not do anything.</li>
      <li>I love trying out new skin care products, so I was excited to try this line, which I had actually not heard of prior to trying this product and the mascara.</li>
      <li>I wash my face with the cleanser by Natural Being, and it leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I do not have any real skin problems</li>
      <li>The thing you have to be careful is over drying your skin as it will react by producing even more oil and also give you unsightly peeling.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare it.</li>
      <li>This just didn&#x27;t do much for my skin texture or tone.</li>
      <li>I did find my skin hasn&#x27;t been breaking out as much</li>
      <li>and it goes away fast.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle and thorough.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much to control oily breakthrough</li>
      <li>/&gt;After that shock, I was able to note how pretty the bottle is, and how (like so many face/hair products) useless the instructions are.</li>
      <li>Could be unrelated, but I tried starting and stopping a couple of times and my general impression is that my skin is better when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Around the second or 3rd day I woke up to a huge sore cyst on my cheek!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more heartily recommended for less cost, keep lookin&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I have to admit I&#x27;m not much of a do-it-yourself facial kind of gal.</li>
      <li>So my most recent evening routine inludes using this fluid to cleanse my skin, I put toner afterwards and then follow up with AINHOA serum and night cream.  </li>
      <li>I would expect this consistency from something cheap, but not a high quality product.  </li>
      <li>this can be very drying, and can aggravate rosacea and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>At $55 a bottle, though, I don&#x27;t want to waste a drop of this apparently precious liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Recently I came across AINHOA serum product that has golden additives to it.  </li>
      <li>Probably better to use a cotton pad, which means a lot of waste.</li>
      <li>The first thing that struck me about this fluid is that it&#x27;s really fluid-y.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this for myself and my two teenage daughters, although after trying it myself, I decided it might not be right for them.</li>
      <li>I barely have any blackheads and even my aesthetician has noticed that my skin is not only clean, but also soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bisabolol ( A colorless viscous oil that is the primary constituent of the essential oil from German chamomile) ;Menthol;Camphor;Disinfecting Agents</li>
      <li>so think the fluid has a positive effect; my face has been feeling nice lately, but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was not impressed with this purifying fluid. It did nothing noticeable to my skin in the couple weeks that I used it. I also can&#x27;t imagine spending that kind of money on something like this. I can&#x27;t possibly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m not much of a do-it-yourself facial kind of gal. I was interested in seeing what \\&quot;purifying fluid\\&quot; was so I tried this product out... It comes in nice packaging. The bottle is attractive. The scent is night. It&#x27;s light when you put it on. The fragrance is nice and light. To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell that it does anything for me. Maybe if you use it in a skin care regimen daily you can notice, but I don&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t used other similar products so I can&#x27;t really compare it. It&#x27;s NOT made in China so that&#x27;s always a plus!</li>
    <li> When I tried this product, its fragrance was very familiar to me. It smells like Witch Hazel. This product is basically a high-priced Witch Hazel!  The only difference is the small amount, the fancy bottle, exotic-sounding brand name, and the high price tag. It is not a serum at all, but a thin, clear liquid, just like Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel is okay very extremely mild acne, but for more severe breakouts or cysts, it will not do anything. I got the same results with this \\&quot;Purifying Fluid\\&quot; as I did with a cheap drugstore bottle of Witch Hazel.  Great as a general toner, but doesn&#x27;t do much for more severe breakouts/cysts. For me, Witch Hazel never helped, even for whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling \\&quot;silky smooth\\&quot; as it claims. I would recommend you go out and buy a bottle of Witch Hazel from your drug store and save your hard-earned $$$ instead of buying this stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it is way too expensive for what it is: water, denatured alcohol and witch hazel. Lovely, packaging, but the small print is too light and fine, perhaps purposely made difficult to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;fluid\\&quot; is a little thicker than water, and looks like water. It smells nice. I put a single line of it on my finger and sweep across my skin (three times for cheeks and forehead). I feel it is invigorating to my skin, and feels clean and fresh. I apply my usual moisturizer after it dries: it doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs, really. I would take issues with the claims of being calming and hydrating. My skin feels a little tight afterwards, certainly not soothed, but not irritated in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this for myself and my two teenage daughters, although after trying it myself, I decided it might not be right for them. Their skin is too sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Ainhoa should tone down the price (pun intended). $55 bucks is just way too pricey for a product like this--more like $10 would be better. There are just too many companies trying to make a mega killing off of skin products, and this is not worth $20, much less $55! The company&#x27;s claim of \\&quot;spa quality at affordable prices\\&quot; is just ridiculous, because $55 is NOT affordable, and the product is simply not worth that.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong smell, and for people like me that suffer migraines and are very sensitive to smell this immediately turned me off. Also it&#x27;s very liquid in form and had to use a cotton ball to apply as it drips too easily otherwise. Has not really helped for breakouts and have been using for 2-3 weeks now and should have seen some improvement by now if it was going to work. It really doesn&#x27;t do much to control oily breakthrough-I still get the oily T-zone mid way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;All in all for the outrageous price tag I would expect better than this-I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so when I first had a whiff of this product right out of the pump (it smells like SeaBreeze- remember that stuff?), I thought \\&quot;great: my skin&#x27;s going to get all inflamed and cracked and my eyes are going to swell shut!\\&quot;  The thing is, I&#x27;ve been using this Purity Purifying Fluid for over a week now, morning and night, and so far, it&#x27;s worked really well.  It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.  My pores feel tight and my skin feels refreshed, and that SeaBreeze-y smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sort of dismayed me is that there&#x27;s a lack of instruction included on the brochure enclosed in the package.  When are you supposed to use this stuff?  How do you apply it?  I&#x27;ve been using my fingers, but the consistency is only slightly thicker than water, and I wonder if a cotton-ball would be a better approach.  At $55 a bottle, though, I don&#x27;t want to waste a drop of this apparently precious liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not getting miracles from this product.  I think any improvements I&#x27;m seeing in my skin are coming from the way trying out this product has made me more diligent about the rest of my skin-care regimen, namely remembering to use it AND a moisturizer before bed.  A little extra TLC goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  If you have some extra cash burning a hole in your pocket, and you want to drop $55 on this AINHOA Purity Purifying Fluid, go for it.  If you&#x27;re looking for something more heartily recommended for less cost, keep lookin&#x27;.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something else out there.  This product is working for me, but I think it&#x27;s the novelty, and the sheer wanting it to work that&#x27;s doing the trick.  I&#x27;m glad I got to try it, though!</li>
    <li> First off it smells like a doctor&#x27;s office and after having used it for three weeks, because I take my reviews seriously, I haven&#x27;t seen any change for the better or worse. I&#x27;m a long time user of Witch Hazel after I wash my face and for three weeks I&#x27;ve been using this instead and frankly I missed the Witch Hazel. But now I&#x27;m using it again, the Witch Hazel, and it was kind like welcoming an old friend back home.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid twenties and I still suffer from acne. Nothing major, but I get breakouts on a few problem areas on my face. I have been searching and searching for a product that works for as long as I can remember, and I have not been able to find anything, until now. I use Manuka Cleanser For Oily to Normal Skin by Natural Being and this ANHOA Purity Purifying Fluid together. I wash my face with the cleanser by Natural Being, and it leaves my skin so soft and smooth. Then I use the ANHOA and that clears up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purifying fluid is very liquidy, so be prepared for that when you pump it out, otherwise it will go everywhere. It is easy to apply and you get a large amount, so it will last for a while. I experience a slight burning sensation after I apply the product, which I really like because it makes me feel like I can feel it working. There is a little bit of a strong smell, but it&#x27;s not too terrible and it does not last very long.</li>
    <li> I had my girlfriend use this product, and after using it for a few weeks, she says she can&#x27;t tell any difference in her skin. So, while I guess it may work for some people who have specific skin issues (she doesn&#x27;t), I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s effectiveness on normal skin that has no issues.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so I&#x27;ve always used an astringent after washing my face, most of the time I just use witch hazel because it&#x27;s inexpensive and convenient to buy, but this has been a very nice alternative.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.  Some reviewers complain about the smell, but I associate it with feeling clean.  The only issue I have with this product is that it contains alcohol which is something that I generally would prefer not use on my skin.  My skin hasn&#x27;t felt dry because of the alcohol, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to create a problem, but it makes me uncomfortable to use alcohol on my skin so I probably won&#x27;t buy this product after I&#x27;ve finished this sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you&#x27;d also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it&#x27;s just to say, Hi!\\&quot;) feel free to post it below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this company before, but I have oily skin, so I decided to order this for review.&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is a witch hazel based toner. Be ware that the second listed ingredient is denatured alcohol- this can be very drying, and can aggravate rosacea and sensitive skin. Since I have very oily skin, it was OK for me.&lt;br /&gt;It is watery, and I applied with a cotton pad.&lt;br /&gt;It has camphor/menthol, which gives it a distinct smell. I did not find it unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It degreased without stripping my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice way to refresh your skin, I imagine it would be useful in the summer months.</li>
    <li> I liked the serum like texture of this toner. It was similar to a watery, alcohol based gel. Most toners are a complete liquid and they seem to evaporate before doing anything in depth. I used this along with the Gold serum which is just ok. I also felt the smell was pleasant and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Recently I came across AINHOA serum product that has golden additives to it.  I used it at night and my skin totally loved it.  When I found out that the same brand has this Purifying Fluid in the line (I refer to it as cleanser), I decided to use it along with the serum.  I am very particular about taking care of my facial skin.  Since I excercise daily, I sweat a lot and it is at utmost importance to me to \\&quot;prepare\\&quot; my skin before going to bed.  So my most recent evening routine inludes using this fluid to cleanse my skin, I put toner afterwards and then follow up with AINHOA serum and night cream.  The results are amazing.  My pores are smaller and my skin is very clean.  I barely have any blackheads and even my aesthetician has noticed that my skin is not only clean, but also soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this purifying fluid is that it comes in a conveninet to use pump.  It is not too large, so it is safe to pack it for travel purposes.  One of the main ingredients is mint which leaves skin feeling fresh (and pleasantly tingling).  I absolutely love this brand, and I am sure that I will start adding other products from this line to my daily skin care routine.  I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is serious about taking care of their skin.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this product, however it caused me to breakout after one night of use. I am all about paraban and pthalate free products and have found others out there that deliver better results than this product and at a better price point.  This just didn&#x27;t do much for my skin texture or tone.</li>
    <li> I have generally dry skin and acne is not aproblem for me. That said, I do various peels etc that can irritate the skin. This ia perfect for a day or 2 after a peel..it&#x27;s gentle and thorough.</li>
    <li> First of all my skin is admittedly very sensitive and while this product felt nice and tingly, it didn&#x27;t do wonders for my complexion. I am late 40&#x27;s and my skin is fair and tends to break out just a little and I have dry skin and oily T zone. This product didn&#x27;t clear up my skin at all, it actually seems to aggravate it making my skin a bit red and blotchy and more broken out. Didn&#x27;t do anything positive for me maybe it will for you.</li>
    <li> beware when this comes out of the pump, be sure to shake the contents and know it sprays a little further than expected. It is a very thin product. It does work well but just know it comes out funny and might spray you</li>
    <li> I admit that I do not have much of a beauty regime on average days.  I wash my face with Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser and then I follow it up with the Ainhoa Purity Purifying Fluid.  I have sensitive skin and I am prone to breakouts, so I was a little apprehensive about using anything with menthol in it, but I didn&#x27;t find it unpleasant.  I actually think that it is only included to give it the feeling that it is doing something.  My biggest problem was the product&#x27;s consistency.  It is so watery that it can be a pain to apply.  I would expect this consistency from something cheap, but not a high quality product.  Two squirts is enough for me though.  The smell didn&#x27;t bother me because it isn&#x27;t too harsh and it goes away fast.  I did find my skin hasn&#x27;t been breaking out as much and it feels soft.  It didn&#x27;t have any effect when I used my makeup either.  I think that my skin is more balanced and healthier.  I no longer have oily or dry spots.  If it was thicker and cheaper, I probably would continue to buy it, but it just isn&#x27;t worth the price for what you get.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and thought I would review this product because I am ALWAYS looking for a skin toner/serum/fluid that I can use on my face before I put on my make-up that manages my oily skin but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  I squirt one small dollop of this fluid in my hand, pat on my face, let dry and then put my foundation/make-up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are:  Hammamelis Extract ( WITCH HAZEL) ;Bisabolol ( A colorless viscous oil that is the primary constituent of the essential oil from German chamomile) ;Menthol;Camphor;Disinfecting Agents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY love this product but can&#x27;t justify the $55.00 price tag that comes with it.  I would love to try more products in the AINHOA line, however...</li>
    <li> The first thing that struck me about this fluid is that it&#x27;s really fluid-y. It doesn&#x27;t give directions on how to apply, but I typically use my fingers, and this stuff is so runny that&#x27;s a little hard. Probably better to use a cotton pad, which means a lot of waste. (And this stuff is pricey.)&lt;br /&gt;I use 1 squirt, 2 if I must, and apply to my entire face and under chin (with excess running between my fingers). Note that it stings on sores and dry nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing that struck me was the smell. After about a month of using it, it almost smells nice, but not quite. To me, it smells like mold. Or possibly like cough drops (eucalyptus), but to me it&#x27;s mostly mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that shock, I was able to note how pretty the bottle is, and how (like so many face/hair products) useless the instructions are. Many languages, not so many useful things to say. Basically: wash face, apply a small amount by massaging into skin. (No instructions on the bottle itself, of course.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first listed ingredient is Aqua (Water), and third is Witch Hazel. I love witch hazel, been using it on my face for years, and I suspect a lot of what I like about this fluid is thanks to the witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so think the fluid has a positive effect; my face has been feeling nice lately, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s any better than the nice-smelling witch hazel I have used (note: I haven&#x27;t been using witch hazel while testing this product). And witch hazel is so much cheaper, and comes in a variety of nice scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably hit or miss, I rate this 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I would not call this product \\&quot;hydrating and replenishing\\&quot;, as stated in the description.  I have been using this product, along with the Sensitive Concentrate, for approximately 2 weeks and think my skin feels dryer.  To be fair, this product states it is most useful for oily to moderate skin so perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t be too harsh.  I do not have any real skin problems so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of reducing acne or other issues.  This product does burn a little when I put it on my skin but I felt it was the product working and it went away in a few minutes.  Many people commented on the smell - I liked it.  I am going to stop using this and go back to Oil of Olay</li>
    <li> I found this fluid to work wonderfully with my skin, immediately tightening pores and giving my skin a nice healthy glow. I know some have complained about the price, but a little bit goes a very long way. Many skin care products do little that&#x27;s actually observable, but that&#x27;s not the case with Ainhoa.</li>
    <li> This fluid is REALLY fluid!  It is pretty runny and smells like rubbing alcohol but my skin seems to be clearing up nicely so I will overlook that.  I have been using it long enough to notice a change in my skin&#x27;s texture and condition.  I am also using their wrinkle cream and the combo is quite satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This feels like it&#x27;s probably doing something to my skin (it feels like a toner or an astringent), but my skin broke out a bit after using it. Could be unrelated, but I tried starting and stopping a couple of times and my general impression is that my skin is better when I don&#x27;t use it. This could work well for someone with super oily skin, though.</li>
    <li> I use this in addition to the AINHOA Soothing serum.  I&#x27;ve been having problems with adult acne and oily skin. I do think that this leaves me skin feeling fresh and clean and rids my skin of excess oil that just ends up creating more breakouts. The thing you have to be careful is over drying your skin as it will react by producing even more oil and also give you unsightly peeling.  I feel like this works as a good toner but do find that it&#x27;s pricey for what it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as directed for just about two weeks. I&#x27;ve been told that I have normal skin, but I have so many breakouts, I can&#x27;t see why. Anywhoo, the first couple of days I used it, I noticed no change in my pores. Around the second or 3rd day I woke up to a huge sore cyst on my cheek! I don&#x27;t believe that the product caused it because I do have breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the smell is sort of witch hazel (as others stated) but it&#x27;s not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;  especially if you use witch hazel as a toner.&lt;br /&gt;2. it says serum..but it&#x27;s pretty liquidy (if that&#x27;s a word,if not it is now)&lt;br /&gt;3. It dried my skin out after using day and night so I put it on during the day&lt;br /&gt;4. Since it was drying my skin out, I decided to use it as a spot treatment&lt;br /&gt;  by putting it on the aforementioned cyst...it did not dry it out (???) I will&lt;br /&gt;  keep applying it to see if it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, I&#x27;m having more problems with breakouts than before. Maybe my skin is reacting to one of the ingredients. This fluid is very liquid. It&#x27;s just thick enough to apply it to your skin, but it is very runny. It feels nice on the skin, and is completely absorbed as soon as you apply it. It does cut down on the greasiness. Before using this product, I rarely had pimples. Since I used this product, I broke out all over my jaw line. As I said, maybe my skin is sensitive to one of the ingredients. I, for my part, won&#x27;t be using this product anymore, but it might work well for someone else.</li>
    <li> Well, I have skin that as of late has leaned toward oil and acne, so one would think this might be beneficial.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s ruining my skin, but any improvement happening is a test of patience.  Weeks of waiting in case of improvement (which at that point could be happenstance) is the goal here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad product and I like its astringent qualities.  But it&#x27;s not living up to my expectations and I be there are cheaper products out there that will give the same benefits.</li>
    <li> I love trying out new skin care products, so I was excited to try this line, which I had actually not heard of prior to trying this product and the mascara. I was not impressed with this purifying fluid. Although it has a scent like an astringent toner, it definitely didn&#x27;t make my face feel any cleaner - in fact, the first time I used it, I had a feeling like there was a film on my face that I should wash off. More importantly, though, I just didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin after using this.  It&#x27;s advertised as a product that is supposed to \\&quot;help prevent breakouts\\&quot; and \\&quot;renews the skin,\\&quot; but I did not notice any difference.  Additionally, I also developed a blemish after the first two times of using it, although to be fair, I can&#x27;t say that I am 100% sure that this product caused it.</li>
