      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This is the best acrylic system I have used.</li>
      <li>It works greats I love it!!!</li>
      <li>Loved this!</li>
      <li>Great product for the price</li>
      <li>It dries a bit slower, so its great for beginners.</li>
      <li>which is great.</li>
      <li>so its good</li>
      <li>The powder smells good, but is a bit runny.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good though.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, affordable acrylic powder and monomer with a good amount to start with as a beginner.</li>
      <li>It even came with a cute pair of rose earrings!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love 😍 it!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>And, the free earrings were cute!</li>
      <li>Filled to the top, sealed, and works amazingly.</li>
      <li>I was torn because the nail salons use better products but none of the technicians know how to manicure my nails that curve.  </li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more soon.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get much better than this</li>
      <li>Love it and is easy for a novice like me to use.</li>
      <li>Overall very good product.</li>
      <li>This is definetly salon quality, I enjoy this product a lot &amp; if I could give it more then 5 stars I would.</li>
      <li>I think it will work out just fine.</li>
      <li>also, the jar is huge for being 4oz.</li>
      <li>The application is smooth if you apply it correctly.</li>
      <li>Honestly I am totally blown away at how amazing this product is.</li>
      <li>I have done my own nails off and on for years only going to the so called professionals on occasions.  </li>
      <li>Though, I have been doing my own nails off and on for upwards of about 25 years and knowing how to apply the materials, when I used this product the first time my nails lifted the next day.  </li>
      <li>Good strength and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry also easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love it and will definitely use this brand from now on.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I purchased this product after reading the reviews and now realize that those who may have received better results may not have had long nails or and/or nails that curve.  </li>
      <li>When I first opened it it was wrapped in so much bubble wrapping</li>
      <li>The jar is filled to the top and this will last me a long time, thank you(-:</li>
      <li>As a nail tech and using several different monomer/polymers this one is hands down the best!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t lose to much</li>
      <li>Came fast.</li>
      <li>Better than others I used in the past.</li>
      <li>That stated, I am writing this review after using this product twice with great disappointment.  </li>
      <li>i havent used it yet but the acrylic powder was all over the place because the top was broken.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not a professional, it may be hard to get the hang of at first, but if you search the proper techniques its a breeze and the product is high quality.</li>
      <li>I quickly thought perhaps I may have done something wrong such as using a bit too much primer or something.  </li>

<li> I do not recommend this product for anyone who has long nails that curve!</li>
<li> So, I decided to redo my nails this time ensuring that I followed the processes that I have used for years and again my nails lifted the very next day and as a result, I have had to glue the lifted nails down.  </li>
<li> Came way sooner than expected</li>
<li> It was delivered faster than expected.  </li>
<li> Somewhat flexible and doesn&#x27;t break as easily as other brands.</li>
<li> and I was so greatful it didn&#x27;t spill or anything because it was sealed so tightly.</li>
<li> but there was NO free earrings......</li>
<li> This product is a poor quality product for long nails and/or nails that curve because the product will lift!  </li>
<li> I received this product from the merchant in a timely manner however this product sucks!  </li>
<li> How pathetic that not only did I have glue my nails down</li>
<li> So I have nothing bad to say about this product.  </li>
<li> but how pathetic that I have to carry and use glue at all!  </li>

    <li> Love it! If you&#x27;re not a professional, it may be hard to get the hang of at first, but if you search the proper techniques its a breeze and the product is high quality. Will definitely buy again when i&#x27;m out</li>
    <li> Loved this! I received it within 1 week of purchase. The powder smells good, but is a bit runny. It dries a bit slower, so its great for beginners. also, the jar is huge for being 4oz. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the best acrylic system I have used. Will be purchasing more soon. Love it and is easy for a novice like me to use.</li>
    <li> Everything is as stated. This is a nice, affordable acrylic powder and monomer with a good amount to start with as a beginner.</li>
    <li> Great product! Came fast. Filled to the top, sealed, and works amazingly. Good strength and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry also easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t smell good though. But it smells as you would expect an acrylic monomer to smell. Overall very good product.</li>
    <li> I love 😍 it!  Better than others I used in the past.</li>

    <li> Have not used the product yet.  Only problem was when I received it the monomer liquid was leaking . Didn&#x27;t lose to much so I wasn&#x27;t worried about sending it back.

    <li> Works so well! I love it and will definitely use this brand from now on. And, the free earrings were cute!</li>
