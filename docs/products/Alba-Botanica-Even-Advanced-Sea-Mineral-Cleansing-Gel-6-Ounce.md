      <li>I love how my skin feels after using this product.  </li>
      <li>Love Alba.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>As mentioned by many women in their reviews, the scent is strong and masculine--spicy.</li>
      <li>I wear a more intense mascara, so I always follow up with eye make-up remover for that as it is more effective with out rubbing my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff does have a somewhat strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>However, the perfume fragrance is way too strong for me.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nontoxic AND feels/smells lovely -- very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>As a huge bonus, it&#x27;s also cruelty-free.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, it is gentle on my sensitive skin, it foams up beautifully</li>

      <li>The scent is light, clean, fresh -- like spring.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin fresh and smooth.</li>
      <li>might repurchase, mildly improves acne.</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to, for sure.</li>
      <li>I love the other Alba products I own, however this particular face wash&#x27;s scent is too strong for my liking.</li>
      <li>This is gentle gel cleanser that foams lightly with water.</li>
      <li>The scent is so fresh that my husband can use it as well and not worry abut smelling like a girl.</li>
      <li>I use many Alba Even Advanced products: exfoliating scrub, day cream, night cream, so thought I&#x27;d try the facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>All natural, light and clean.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances; I have to watch out for strongly scented products because they will give me a headache.</li>
      <li>especially when applied to my face - and I would described this as kind of a spa like scent which I really like.</li>
      <li>Very gentle.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on skin and has improved the look &amp; feel of my skin.</li>
      <li>I used to use the cream, but the gel works so much better for my oily teenage skin!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the scent is overwhelming, especially as one has to inhale this scent when washing one&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>I bought this for the aloe being the first ingredient.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
      <li>skin is clean and clear of blemishes.</li>
      <li>This one seemed promising.</li>
      <li>- I really like the smell and</li>
      <li>Cleans well but gentle not drying</li>
      <li>I really like the Alba brand of skincare.</li>
      <li>and I really like the smell.</li>
      <li>(somehow cream cleansers don&#x27;t leave me feeling clean, I need the foam), rinses off without leaving residue, and the subtle scent is lovely.  </li>
      <li>Most of all, when I use a toner (an extra step I don&#x27;t always remember to do), it seems like a lot less residue comes off on the cotton, so this really does clean better than many other more expensive products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Still love the company and will continue using my other go to products like the pineapple enzyme face scrub!</li>
      <li>The product is decent but the bottle cannot withstand</li>
      <li>Nice thick consistency</li>
      <li>The lid cannot be screwed on tightly enough so the first bottle i recieved had come unscrewed and spilled all over the inside of the box during shipping.</li>
      <li>good value and natural enough, too much glycerin and not enough seaweed for me but appreciate the aloe, slightly drying on my combination skin in the summer, wouldnt want to use it in this dry climate in the winter.</li>
      <li>It seems to clear it up.</li>
      <li>I also use it before a shave instead of bath soap that would otherwise strip away the natural oils on my face.</li>
      <li>The herbal and marine scent is masculine and lingers on the skin.</li>
      <li>It removes mascara completely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll still follow with a moisturizer (I&#x27;m old and wrinkly)</li>
      <li>This is a lightweight formula that is gentle, but foams up enough to take off make up without struggle.</li>
      <li>My sensitive skin does well with this product.</li>
      <li>Is all natural without any preservatives.  </li>
      <li>just bought the astrigent for nite time before sleep so far</li>
      <li>very gentle, a little goes a long way.</li>

<li> It lathers up very well, a little will go a long way.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my small bathroom</li>
<li> only a dab is needed so it lasts long time.</li>
<li> Lasts a surprisingly long time.  </li>
<li> I have both dry and oily skin along with redness, and this soap takes care of it all.</li>
<li> Probably would work for someone who likes the smell and has younger, less dry skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks so still not sure how my skin likes it, but I think I&#x27;m starting to lean toward saying it&#x27;s drying.</li>

<li> (Something other washes I have tried didn&#x27;t seem to do)</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a big sucker for scents too -</li>
<li> Unfortunately the scent is very overpowering--smells like a clothes detergent, not at all how you would expect something like this to smell.</li>
<li> I exchanged via amazon returns, and the second bottle arrived with a broken-off nozel (again, product spilled out during shipping).&lt;br /&gt;Amazon took the care to wrap the bottles in plastic bags, so at least the mess was contained in the shipping boxes.</li>
<li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight afterwards.</li>
<li> It is somewhat hard to wash off( feels a bit greasy when applied), yet ironically, my face feels dry the rest of the day whenever I use it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks and is less drying than what I was using before.</li>
<li> Dried my skin out.</li>
<li> I was unable to find this at my local stores (typical conspiracy where they discontinue selling what I buy!)</li>
<li> But what a waste of product and money!</li>
<li> i usually find the organic products smell and feel icky.</li>

    <li> Great quality product.  Lasts a surprisingly long time.  Is all natural without any preservatives.  Nothing not to like about this!</li>
    <li> Smells good but makes me break out.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best. it&#x27;s nontoxic AND feels/smells lovely -- very fresh and clean. i usually find the organic products smell and feel icky. this feels like I just left the spa every time I use it. keeps my skin looking beautiful, even in my 40s.</li>
    <li> I really like the Alba brand of skincare. I&#x27;ve had this wash before and had to purchase it again. The product came on time and was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Used this face wash for years. Keeps my skin fresh and smooth. I will use it forever. I love Alba products, I use tons of their stuff. All natural, light and clean.</li>
    <li> has helped even out my skin tone</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The fragrance is light and clean. A little goes a LONG way. I honestly wish it didn&#x27;t pump out so much at once, but I&#x27;ll get the hang of it eventually. Works well on my combination skin. I&#x27;m glad it isn&#x27;t tested on animals. It can be a bit drying, but follow up with the sea moss moisturizer (also great). This is my new go-to, for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!!! It removes every trace of makeup on my face! The scent is so fresh that my husband can use it as well and not worry abut smelling like a girl.</li>
    <li> I used to use the cream, but the gel works so much better for my oily teenage skin! My skin is so even, now!!!!! I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that was vegan, cruelty free, and worked! I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances; I have to watch out for strongly scented products because they will give me a headache. This stuff does have a somewhat strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It works well.</li>
    <li> very gentle, a little goes a long way. smells nice, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin in anyway. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks and is less drying than what I was using before.</li>
    <li> only a dab is needed so it lasts long time. skin is clean and clear of blemishes. on reorder. love it</li>
    <li> The product cleans well, and I bought it for being cruelty-free (not tested on non-human animals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the scent is overwhelming, especially as one has to inhale this scent when washing one&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after using this product.  I also use the Alba Sea Mineral Cleansing Gel and Alba Sea Moss Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love the other Alba products I own, however this particular face wash&#x27;s scent is too strong for my liking. Still love the company and will continue using my other go to products like the pineapple enzyme face scrub!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, it is gentle on my sensitive skin, it foams up beautifully (somehow cream cleansers don&#x27;t leave me feeling clean, I need the foam), rinses off without leaving residue, and the subtle scent is lovely.  As a huge bonus, it&#x27;s also cruelty-free.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough -- try it!</li>
    <li> I love all their products. Basically, their ingredients are in the products of much more expensive skin care lines.</li>
    <li> Love Alba. This is a lightweight formula that is gentle, but foams up enough to take off make up without struggle. I wear a more intense mascara, so I always follow up with eye make-up remover for that as it is more effective with out rubbing my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight afterwards. I always moisturize, but it&#x27;s nice to not have that feeling.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my two-fers :) great stuff, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin been using it for almost a year with np :) just bought the astrigent for nite time before sleep so far I like it too.</li>
    <li> I was unable to find this at my local stores (typical conspiracy where they discontinue selling what I buy!) - I really like the smell and how well this cleans my skin.  Not overly sudsy like some that take many splashes of water to get all the foam off.  Most of all, when I use a toner (an extra step I don&#x27;t always remember to do), it seems like a lot less residue comes off on the cotton, so this really does clean better than many other more expensive products I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m a big sucker for scents too - especially when applied to my face - and I would described this as kind of a spa like scent which I really like.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I was looking for a reasonably-priced face wash in a pump container.  I&#x27;m tired of tubes where there&#x27;s always product that you can&#x27;t get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do -- love it.  The scent is light, clean, fresh -- like spring.  It foams nicely, rinses off well -- no residue.  I&#x27;ll still follow with a moisturizer (I&#x27;m old and wrinkly) but it&#x27;s not really necessary -- there&#x27;s no dryness.  I wish Alba made a body wash that left me with this sparkly feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend without reservation.</li>
    <li> good value and natural enough, too much glycerin and not enough seaweed for me but appreciate the aloe, slightly drying on my combination skin in the summer, wouldnt want to use it in this dry climate in the winter. might repurchase, mildly improves acne. do not like scent.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new facial cleanser without parabens or other questionable ingredients. This one seemed promising. However, the perfume fragrance is way too strong for me. It lathers up very well, a little will go a long way. It is somewhat hard to wash off( feels a bit greasy when applied), yet ironically, my face feels dry the rest of the day whenever I use it. Probably would work for someone who likes the smell and has younger, less dry skin.</li>
    <li> The product is decent but the bottle cannot withstand shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a bit drying and def brings clogs in pores to the surface, so it does its job. I can handle the zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, do NOT buy this online. The lid cannot be screwed on tightly enough so the first bottle i recieved had come unscrewed and spilled all over the inside of the box during shipping. I exchanged via amazon returns, and the second bottle arrived with a broken-off nozel (again, product spilled out during shipping).&lt;br /&gt;Amazon took the care to wrap the bottles in plastic bags, so at least the mess was contained in the shipping boxes. But what a waste of product and money!</li>
    <li> Cleans well but gentle not drying</li>
    <li> I have both dry and oily skin along with redness, and this soap takes care of it all. It is mild and rinses off easy. (Something other washes I have tried didn&#x27;t seem to do) I bought the entire alba line and it works great</li>
    <li> Nice thick consistency and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. Most of the ingredients are organic and it feels great on my skin. Very gentle. Foams well.</li>
    <li> As mentioned by many women in their reviews, the scent is strong and masculine--spicy. That&#x27;s why I love it! I&#x27;m a man! I use it in the shower daily, as the only products on my face, ears, and neck. I also use it before a shave instead of bath soap that would otherwise strip away the natural oils on my face.</li>
    <li> I use many Alba Even Advanced products: exfoliating scrub, day cream, night cream, so thought I&#x27;d try the facial cleanser. It dries out my skin and leads to breakouts. Will not be purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser.  I have tried others but keep going back to it.  Very gentle on skin and has improved the look &amp; feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels like I&#x27;m washing my face with shampoo. Dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my small bathroom and I really like the smell. I keep it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the aloe being the first ingredient. Unfortunately the scent is very overpowering--smells like a clothes detergent, not at all how you would expect something like this to smell. It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks so still not sure how my skin likes it, but I think I&#x27;m starting to lean toward saying it&#x27;s drying. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I am sad to say i am unable to use this product due to the scent. I reacted almosy instantly :(</li>
    <li> I like washing my face with this. It seems to clear it up.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin does well with this product.</li>
    <li> This is gentle gel cleanser that foams lightly with water. It removes mascara completely. The herbal and marine scent is masculine and lingers on the skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and prone to breakouts. I&#x27;ve noticed less red inflammation around my blemishes and my skin isn&#x27;t too tight after a shower.</li>
