      <li>and it was perfect!!!!      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best perfume out there in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I smelt it and this was the best smell ever</li>
      <li>Happy Happy Happy!</li>
      <li>The blend of sophistication and warmth in its sent makes it a joy to wear.  </li>
      <li>When I wear it I find I&#x27;m one popular lady!</li>
      <li>It is honestly Heavenly!</li>
      <li>and I will still hear a comment on how good I smell.  </li>
      <li>This way wearing Angel will remind you and others of pleasant memories of food and the warm feelings food evokes in the emotions.</li>
      <li>You have to love that!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE it and can&#x27;t even imagine tiring of it!  </li>
      <li>I was so pleased to recieve it for Christmas!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is indeed amazing</li>
      <li>Even though I was nodding through all these reviews, I still felt compelled to write my own.</li>
      <li>I own probably 20 bottles of perfume and when I wear Angel, EVERYONE asks what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I smelled her sample, I HAD to get my own.</li>
      <li>For me it is joy, begging, and as much love as you can show to your favorite person.</li>
      <li>This scent is so nice, what I smell when it is on is Honey.</li>
      <li>Best described as shockingly modern</li>
      <li>The most impressive thing to me is that, in my job I am in and out of the office all day, and whether hot or cold/sweat/</li>
      <li>It is a rich, beautiful and sophisticated scent that is NOT for everyone.</li>
      <li>Some say this is the best, most amazing fragrance created, and I may agree when you compare this to modern perfumes, which all tend to smell all alike.  </li>
      <li>It is one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
      <li>IT LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>When I see my fiance at the end of the day, I love that he ALWAYS says, \\&quot;Mmmmm</li>
      <li>and i love when I encounter another woman wearing it</li>
      <li>Angel is a refreshing change.  </li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s what makes it a memorable fragrance for me.  </li>
      <li>Plus, every man seems to find it seriously sexy, who wouldn&#x27;t love that???</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>so I could be sure to avoid it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no wonder that men love to smell this fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is one of the most hideous scents I have ever encountered in something that is, supposedly, a perfume.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Most of the notes in Angel are scents of things edible.</li>
      <li>but now it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
      <li>(hence the title :)).</li>
      <li>, I fell in love with the scent all over again, and HAD to get it.</li>
      <li>IT LOVE</li>
      <li>Great soft smell.  </li>
      <li>The shape of the bottle will still be the beautiful star shape like the one pictured above but the silver cap top will be removable.</li>
      <li>whatnot it always stays true!  </li>
      <li>If for some reason you decide to change fragrances after you finish your bottle, you could easily refill with something else.</li>
      <li>My fiance said he liked it, but it was strong (and this was after the first shower).         </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy and sweet without being sugary.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of baked goods and kisses and all the really sweet things in life in a way that most fragrances do not.     </li>
      <li>The 3 stars is because I would NEVER wear this ... too recognizable, too trendy, and, once you tell people what it is, everyone will go out and by it.  </li>
      <li>He said you miss understood, you really smell nice.  </li>
      <li>So free lunch on Angel or by an angel.  </li>
      <li>Then the Angel for men became available.</li>
      <li>I would describe it as magical, surreal and inviting.</li>
      <li>This is an entirely unique fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have never smelled anything so unique, so distictive at the perfume counter.  </li>
      <li>I like the small refillable star bottle I purchased fits perfectly in my handbag, as well as the tube of hand cream.</li>
      <li>Angel is a love it or shove it kind of fragrance that most people have trouble wearing.</li>
      <li>It was only then that I decided that I loved the smell....</li>
      <li>but the secretaries in my office always say how much they love it on the days I wear Angel.</li>
      <li>I loved it but also wanted to try different perfumes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a comforting, calming, fragrance that is exquisitely exotic and unusual.</li>
      <li>The refillable bottle gets a full five stars.    </li>
      <li>its really heaven in a bottle...ive never really been into strong perfumes but this one just settles so beautifully......</li>
      <li>you love it, and still have others that you love, you will always come back to this scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how even now, years later, with the glut of perfume from every other celebrity and designer on the market, the industry still hasn&#x27;t come close to producing a mainstream, beautifully seductive fragrance like Angel.</li>
      <li>and I can wear this gentle fragrance at work without it coming on too strong.  </li>
      <li>Angel is well worth the money, believe it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now</li>
      <li>The only warning I have is to remember that it&#x27;s very strong</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a matter of reframing your idea of what makes a great perfume and floral notes, as Angel demostrates, clearly aren&#x27;t not necessary.    </li>
      <li>This perfume is amazing but for only $4 more, you can get the same amount of perfume in a refillable version of the bottle.</li>
      <li>If you live near somewhere Angel is sold, most of the stores have a refill station, called the \\&quot;Angel Source,\\&quot; and a professional can refill your bottle for you for the same great discount.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing &amp;quot;Angel&amp;quot; for 3 years now, and I never fail to get compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>I used to wear this when it first came out.</li>
      <li>Which is exactly what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I smelled this was in a meeting</li>
      <li>Someone recommended Angel to me and I fell in love instantly.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like Angel when I first smelled it</li>
      <li>so make sure you only use the tiniest amount of it.</li>
      <li>and that is exactly what attracted me to it.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it was from a tester in a store.  </li>
      <li>This is not a shy aroma.  </li>
      <li>am getting married in two months</li>
      <li>It smells like honey and pepper, and reminds me of Greek loukoumades that I get at the International Food Fair every year.</li>
      <li>My husband liked the scent on me so much, that I purchased the Hand cream and Body Lotion, and hopefully will get the Shower Gel in the near future!</li>
      <li>Refills of Angel can then be purchased at a huge discount and come with a little funnel to make pouring the refill in really easy.</li>
      <li>According to the salesperson, the perfume is only available at The Bon and you can also get it refilled at the store as well.</li>
      <li>This scent really turns the heads of men as you walk by them.  </li>
      <li>Well, I was unsure about this scent as I find most fragrances too pungent or sweet (which usually gives me headaches).</li>
      <li>and I honestly kept thinking what a fantastic smell was coming off the girl sitting behind me.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely LOVE the scent that stays, rather than evaporates like some other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(originally it was from a different product line).</li>
      <li>It has a sexy, deep base combined with delicious chocolate and vanilla tones.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how long this fragrance has been around, since I only just found it, but I am so glad that I have my new fragrance!</li>
      <li>no matter how little I put on, it&#x27;s always too strong and too much, so I have to put it on before my shower.  </li>
      <li>It is strong, but that means I only have to use a tiny dab each time.</li>
      <li>One important note, this fragrance is designed to smell different on different people and takes a day or two to &#x27;settle in.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong and last a long time, so use sparingly.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s interesting is that I am 46 and not into wearing perfume and there has only been one other time in my life that I purchased perfume (Island of Gardenia) and it was when I was a teenager.  </li>
      <li>the word you will utter when you first take in</li>
      <li>(A little strong to wear during the day...)</li>
      <li>It has lasted so long because I am a cheap-skate and only wear it for special occassions.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an entirely unique fragrance. I would describe it as magical, surreal and inviting. It&#x27;s a comforting, calming, fragrance that is exquisitely exotic and unusual. The only warning I have is to remember that it&#x27;s very strong so make sure you only use the tiniest amount of it.</li>
    <li> The first time I smelled this was in a meeting and I honestly kept thinking what a fantastic smell was coming off the girl sitting behind me. I, of course, asked what it was and here I am still addicted to Angel 9 years later.  EVERY time I wear it I get a compliment on the smell, everyone loves it!  The most impressive thing to me is that, in my job I am in and out of the office all day, and whether hot or cold/sweat/whatnot it always stays true!  It can be the end of the day, when I&#x27;ve been running around like a crazy woman and I will still hear a comment on how good I smell.  You have to love that!  Plus, every man seems to find it seriously sexy, who wouldn&#x27;t love that???</li>
    <li> For years, I wore Tuscany per Donna when Estee Lauder marketed it (originally it was from a different product line). I was asked every single time I wore it what the name of it was. When they discontinued it, I was so upset. Someone recommended Angel to me and I fell in love instantly. It lasts and evolves all day long so that by day&#x27;s end, there is a soft hint of the fragrance still lingering. When I see my fiance at the end of the day, I love that he ALWAYS says, \\&quot;Mmmmm, you smell so good\\&quot; on the days I wear Angel. I have a couple of other fragrances I wear occasionally but the secretaries in my office always say how much they love it on the days I wear Angel. I&#x27;ve had lots of friends who have tried it and it truly smells very, very different on each person. Those low ratings here are clearly simply cases of a bad body chemistry match.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting married in two months and I can assure you there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind what I will be wearing that day!</li>
    <li> I HATED perfumes until I tried Angel. Everything and anything I walked within ten feet of at the mall fragrance counters gave me the worst headaches. I ordered a tiny sample of a few gourmands online, and this one blew me away. It smells like honey and pepper, and reminds me of Greek loukoumades that I get at the International Food Fair every year. It is strong, but that means I only have to use a tiny dab each time. If you don&#x27;t get along with floral scents, try Angel!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing &amp;quot;Angel&amp;quot; for 3 years now, and I never fail to get compliments on it.  The blend of sophistication and warmth in its sent makes it a joy to wear.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is one of my favorite perfumes.  Def. give it a try!</li>
    <li> I first discovered Angel when helping my father look for a present for Grandmother, who passed on later that year. By myself at the Bon, I came across Angel. The display is just a plain light blue and black. I smelt it and this was the best smell ever, I drag dad over. We were both addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  According to the salesperson, the perfume is only available at The Bon and you can also get it refilled at the store as well. The price there ranged at the time from $68 on up and the refill is $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Dad got one for grandma, it later got stolen at the nursing home in Oregon where she was (hence the title). Then the Angel for men became available. He bought one for him and one for my brother. I got jealous (hence the title :)). I begged and pleaded for a year. He gave in on my birthday and got me some. I was the happiest girl alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Angel is well worth the money, believe it. For me it is joy, begging, and as much love as you can show to your favorite person.</li>
    <li> 7 years ago, a co-worker told me about Angel. Small sample bottles were on sale for $12.00. As soon as I smelled her sample, I HAD to get my own. What&#x27;s interesting is that I am 46 and not into wearing perfume and there has only been one other time in my life that I purchased perfume (Island of Gardenia) and it was when I was a teenager.  &lt;br /&gt;The small sample bottle I purchased so long ago is almost empty. It has lasted so long because I am a cheap-skate and only wear it for special occassions. Now that Valentine&#x27;s Day is almost here, I asked my husband for a full-sized bottle and if I get it...I plan to wear it every day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing but for only $4 more, you can get the same amount of perfume in a refillable version of the bottle. The shape of the bottle will still be the beautiful star shape like the one pictured above but the silver cap top will be removable. Refills of Angel can then be purchased at a huge discount and come with a little funnel to make pouring the refill in really easy. If you live near somewhere Angel is sold, most of the stores have a refill station, called the \\&quot;Angel Source,\\&quot; and a professional can refill your bottle for you for the same great discount. If for some reason you decide to change fragrances after you finish your bottle, you could easily refill with something else. This is the reason why it looses a star. The refillable bottle gets a full five stars.    One important note, this fragrance is designed to smell different on different people and takes a day or two to &#x27;settle in.&#x27; If you don&#x27;t like the fragrance at first, you might want to wear it for a few days to see how it develops. I didn&#x27;t like Angel when I first smelled it but now it&#x27;s my favorite. I always get tons of compliments each time I dab it on.     Most of the notes in Angel are scents of things edible. This way wearing Angel will remind you and others of pleasant memories of food and the warm feelings food evokes in the emotions. Blended into the scent are top notes of bergamot and jasmine, middle notes of red berries, dewberry, and honey, and base notes of patchouli, vanilla, coumarine, chocolate, and caramel. It&#x27;s no wonder that men love to smell this fragrance. When I wear it I find I&#x27;m one popular lady!</li>
    <li> I discovered Angel perfume in 1998.  Since that time, it is the ONLY perfume that I wear.  I have the refillable bottle, and it is one that sits flat on my dresser, unlike the more common stars that use a holder.  This scent really turns the heads of men as you walk by them.  I am an RN and I can wear this gentle fragrance at work without it coming on too strong.  I used to have a refill station in town, but now can not find one.  It is cheaper to refill it at a store if you can find it. The 1.7 oz bottle lasts me a year, and that is with almost daily use!</li>
    <li> I was attracted to this perfume because it doesn&#x27;t carry any floral notes.  I think that&#x27;s what makes it a memorable fragrance for me.  It&#x27;s sexy and sweet without being sugary.  In fact, I get complements from men and women when I wear this fragrance.  (A little strong to wear during the day...)</li>
    <li> I own probably 20 bottles of perfume and when I wear Angel, EVERYONE asks what I&#x27;m wearing.  I almost hate to say what brand it is, because now all my friends wear it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE it and can&#x27;t even imagine tiring of it!  It&#x27;s the best perfume out there in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Even though I was nodding through all these reviews, I still felt compelled to write my own. I too am an \\&quot;Angel\\&quot;. I have been wearing this perfume for about ten years and it&#x27;s the only one I ever wear. It is a rich, beautiful and sophisticated scent that is NOT for everyone. But then i suspect the women attracted to it doesn&#x27;t desire that for her signature scent.     Angel is a love it or shove it kind of fragrance that most people have trouble wearing. It is not a floral (though I&#x27;m told there are versions with floral notes, gasp!) and that is exactly what attracted me to it. It reminds me of baked goods and kisses and all the really sweet things in life in a way that most fragrances do not.     I think people hear the list of ingredients and are fearful because of the absence of floral notes, but don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s really a matter of reframing your idea of what makes a great perfume and floral notes, as Angel demostrates, clearly aren&#x27;t not necessary.    I love it and i love when I encounter another woman wearing it and we exchange that secret acknowledgement of scent sisterhood.</li>
    <li> I was standing in line getting lunch....when a young man in mid 20&#x27;s behind me said you smell nice.  I was taken back because it was one of the warmest days in the city...so I chuckled and said sorry it&#x27;s warm out.  He said you miss understood, you really smell nice.  I said oh why thank you.  He said may I ask what perfume your wearing.  I said yes Angel, he said I&#x27;m going to buy some for my girlfriend I think she will like it, then he said may I buy you lunch. So free lunch on Angel or by an angel.  Either way it made my day!   For everyday wear, I only use shower gel and lotion, no perfume.  The scent is strong and last a long time, so use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sort of a perfumeaholic you could say, even though i have my favorites that i never let go of, i still always try to find something different. I&#x27;ve always seen angel at perfume stores but never paid attention..till one day while at work a male co worker mentioned it and i went to the store the following day to try it..what can i say..its really heaven in a bottle...ive never really been into strong perfumes but this one just settles so beautifully......and i gotta admit i sniff my wrist like an idiot all day...LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> The 3 stars is because I would NEVER wear this ... too recognizable, too trendy, and, once you tell people what it is, everyone will go out and by it.  It is definately not a signature fragrance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The smell is indeed amazing and it&#x27;s unlike any other perfume.  Some say this is the best, most amazing fragrance created, and I may agree when you compare this to modern perfumes, which all tend to smell all alike.  Angel is a refreshing change.  The smell goes well with Mugler&#x27;s clothes, or any spacy or weird lookin type outfit.  It does NOT do well with floral dresses, jeans/tshirts, or suits (unless, Mugler&#x27;s suits).  Best described as shockingly modern I&#x27;d say.  Again I would not wear this out in public, maybe in private.  mmmmmmm.....  Definately \\&quot;something about it\\&quot; ..YUM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve smelled this stuff before. When I detected it today on someone in the gym, I asked what it was so I could be sure to avoid it. It is one of the most hideous scents I have ever encountered in something that is, supposedly, a perfume. Why can&#x27;t I choose ZERO stars???</li>
    <li> Before I start with my review, I would like to say to the person who posted a negative review on this fragrance that never tried it.  How can you give a review on a product you did not try on yourself?  Everyone has different chemistry and one fragrance could smell different from person to person.  You base your negative review on a woman who was wearing the fragrance at the gym.  I don&#x27;t think under those circumstances you can review a fragrance, as that person probably had body odor from sweating during a workout.    Now onto my review.  I purchased the Angel 0.33 oz Refillable Shooting Star Eau de Parfum Spray last week based on the reviews I read.  Just a background of what I normally like, I have worn Donna Karan Cashmere Mist and Donna Karan Black Cashmere (discontinued) and sometimes Aqualina Pink Sugar. I usually like woody scents (sandalwood, patchouli, amber) and also food scents like Vanilla, Chocolate or Honey type of scents. Well, I was unsure about this scent as I find most fragrances too pungent or sweet (which usually gives me headaches). This scent is so nice, what I smell when it is on is Honey. I don&#x27;t really smell patchouli or chocolate or any of the other scents everyone has stated.    My husband liked the scent on me so much, that I purchased the Hand cream and Body Lotion, and hopefully will get the Shower Gel in the near future! I am so addicted to this scent. I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists. I like the small refillable star bottle I purchased fits perfectly in my handbag, as well as the tube of hand cream. I don&#x27;t know how long this fragrance has been around, since I only just found it, but I am so glad that I have my new fragrance! Happy Happy Happy!</li>
    <li> I asked for this fragrance after only smelling it once years ago.  I was so pleased to recieve it for Christmas!  I have never smelled anything so unique, so distictive at the perfume counter.  It has a sexy, deep base combined with delicious chocolate and vanilla tones.  This is not a shy aroma.  One half to one single spray will last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have totally missed the big introduction/release for Angel because I have never seen it in any department stores or ads.  It&#x27;s amazing how even now, years later, with the glut of perfume from every other celebrity and designer on the market, the industry still hasn&#x27;t come close to producing a mainstream, beautifully seductive fragrance like Angel.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this when it first came out. I loved it but also wanted to try different perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;It has such a distinct scent, it is one of the very few that you will immediately recognize if someone walks past you wearing it. Which is exactly what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that brief \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; breeze, I fell in love with the scent all over again, and HAD to get it. I&#x27;m wearing it right now and I absolutely LOVE the scent that stays, rather than evaporates like some other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to alternate this with a few others such as \\&quot;Kate\\&quot; by Kate Moss, \\&quot;THE ONE\\&quot; by Dolce and Gabbana, \\&quot;PRADA for Women\\&quot; by Prada, &amp; Versace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually wearing this ANGEL with KATE and the two combined are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love it, and still have others that you love, you will always come back to this scent. It is honestly Heavenly!</li>
    <li> The scent of Angel can be described in a word.. the word you will utter when you first take in it&#x27;s aroma.. the word you will hear when you pass others while wearing it.  The word?  Ooooohh....</li>
    <li> The first time I tried it was from a tester in a store.  I sprayed a big, fat squirt on my arm and I nearly drowned myself in it.  It was repugnant.  I was even riding my moped home a little later that day, and even in the outdoors going 45 miles an hour surrounded by the smell of car exhaust, this junk was all I could smell and it was making me nauseous.  It took 2 days and 3 showers to get the smell off my arm.  My fiance said he liked it, but it was strong (and this was after the first shower).         The counter lady gave me a little 1.4ml spray sample to take home.  I sprayed a TINY spray on my wrist, dabbed it on the other wrist, and the sides of my neck.... THEN I TOOK A SHOWER.... and it was perfect!!!!      It was only then that I decided that I loved the smell.... no matter how little I put on, it&#x27;s always too strong and too much, so I have to put it on before my shower.  Great soft smell.  But I have to take away a star for all the drama involved in not killing myself with it.</li>
