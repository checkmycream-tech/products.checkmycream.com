    <li> Well, we didn&#x27;t get to use this product.  I purchased for my Dad to use after his stroke, but he passed away shortly after.  I donated this product to the local rehab facility, and they were very pleased.  I hope passing it forward did some good for someone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 90 year old mother whose hands are stiffening.  It is helping her greatly. The product was shipped quickly and arrived as ordered.</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we expected.  Helping with hand therapy after surgery!</li>
    <li> helps ne restore the use of my left hand after suffering a stroke  not too hard just right really works shipped nd delivered fast!!</li>
    <li> it fits into my hand just right, i just started using it but seems good</li>
    <li> I am very happy, thank you!</li>
    <li> I AM HAPPY WHIT THIS ITEM. IT IS GREAT. I LOVE IT. I RECOMEND IT. IT IS WHAT I WANTED.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR STROKE (OT) THERAPY</li>
    <li> This device made all the difference in my recovery from Ulnar Nerve Entrapment surgery. Recommended.</li>
    <li> My 87 year old mother fell and shattered her wrist on the Saturday before Mother&#x27;s Day and after her surgery, she was sent to PT to rehab her wrist and hand.  One of the items the PT had her use is this Digi-Flex finger exerciser.  I immediately went on Amazon to purchase one so she could use it at home as well since we could only make it to PT once a week.  She has used it daily since starting her PT and she is almost totally rehabbed after 3 months and the Digi-Flex is a large reason why she&#x27;s done so well so quickly. There are different levels of Digi-Flex and the yellow is the lightest exerciser, but a must have if you are rehabbing your hand after injury/surgery.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help me recover from an injury I did to my right ring finger about a year ago.  I dislocated it downward in a way that is difficult to fix.  It was fractured in several places and tendons and ligaments were torn.  It is still crooked and I cannot straighten it fully yet.  The large knuckle has 3 dislocated fractures. The entire finger is weak.  I was in PT until July.  Now I am trying to strengthen the finger that is still weak and painful. This exerciser allows me to isolate the ring finger structure so I know just how much it can do.  I use all 4 fingers to depress this, but I can tell just how much each individual finger can do.  This is the lightest exerciser in the group. Since the other fingers are much stronger, I must concentrate to force myself to use the ring finger, but it is possible with this since each finger is isolated. I am using this for P.T., but pianists, violinists and other musicians might use it to strengthen fingers needed for  musical play.  There are tighter more challenging ones in the series and they are color coded.  This seemed expensive, but for my purposes  it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I use in physical therapy. It works well, built well, kid resistant. will last a while</li>
    <li> I love this product. I recently had my cast removed from my wrist. This is helping me to bring my wrist back to normal.</li>
    <li> I use it each morning.</li>
    <li> WAS EASY TO USE. MY HUSBAND HAD A STROKE, AND THE DIGI-FLEX IS HELPING HIM REGAIN HIS MOTOR SKILLS IN HIS HAND. HE LOVES THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Wife uses it everyday to exercise her hands. That&#x27;s all I to say about this useful device.</li>
    <li> Digi-Flex was very helpful in strengthening my fingers after a broken wrist.  As a musician...I recommend this device as a PT aid.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my ocupational therapist</li>
    <li> This is the same thing our theraphist used.  My husband has CMT(disease named Charco Marie Tooth)  It effects his fine motor skills among other things and this was used to strenthen muscles in hands.  Our mistake was to order the lightest weight and we plan to order next weight soon.  We ordered this from Amazon and received wrong merchandise.  They were VERY GOOD about correcting the problem.</li>
    <li> Since i have been using this product, My hand muscle has grown. (hypertrophy)&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product for people who are massage therapists/ physical therapists.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool that has aided my rehabilitation after my stroke.  I will be purchasing the next level Cando Digi-Flex to continue strengthening my hands.  I would greatly recomend to anyone considering this product.</li>
