      <li>It is lightweight, which makes it ideal for drying your hair.</li>
      <li>Where it IS good is that it is not damaging to your hair; the bristles being all one piece including the balls at the end is very good engineering.  </li>
      <li>I started using it too its a great product</li>
      <li>This hairbrush is great.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for anyone with frizzy, fly away hair.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
      <li>GREAT brush.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even do that great a job straightening my hair as a paddle brush.  </li>
      <li>It feels great in the hair and does not promote fly aways.</li>
      <li>It looks and works good</li>
      <li>I just grab whatever looks good and buy it.</li>

      <li>This brush looks really cool And feels good in your hand.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>For me, it didn&#x27;t make my hair shinier, softer or more manageable.  </li>
      <li>hair is smoother and shinier without the flyaways and there&#x27;s no problem with static even in the winter.  </li>
      <li>It was an OK brush but the handle broke.</li>
      <li>My 1st one was my daughters favorite</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and there&#x27;s zero static.</li>
      <li>This brush gets through the knots so much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried, with or with out a spray on detangler.</li>
      <li>and I say it takes smells out of UR hair magic</li>
      <li>This brush is just ok.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s because the bristles are more thinner and sharper than the paddle brush</li>
      <li>My favorite of all time.  </li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It is an okay brush.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this brush.</li>
      <li>It is  very light, which makes it easy to carry.</li>
      <li>and she said it doesn&#x27;t really help with static electricity like it claims, but its a good brush.</li>
      <li>Great brush to replace my old one</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good at detangling and just brushing in general, but it does not eliminate static.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t believe a brush could really &amp;#34;reduce static&amp;#34;, I thought it was a gimmick, to be honest.</li>
      <li>I liked this brush so much I had to replace it when it wore out.  </li>
      <li>Great price too and fast fast service.</li>
      <li>Costly but worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I bought the Bio Ionic Silver Classic Paddle Brush from Invanity because of all of the good reviews but the first time I used it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a very durable brush; I used my original one for many years before wearing it out.  </li>
      <li>This brush is magic total static free smooths when blow drying</li>
      <li>I also loved the price; I paid nearly twice as much at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is considered a quality brush used by many pro&#x27;s in high end saloons and you can save money buying it here on amazon.</li>
      <li>The wide bristles are great for getting out knots, but it makes my hair more staticy than my old $8.00 drug store brush.</li>
      <li>Great comb to tame my unruly hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m practical and originally didn&#x27;t buy into the whole ionic line.</li>
      <li>The funniest part is that right on the brush it states static free, while in the meantime it causes excessive static whenever I brush my hair with it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, no static.</li>
      <li>It will go through my hair more easily than other brushes</li>
      <li>Ok, I never thought there was I big difference in brushes, but now - I do!</li>
      <li>I could literally hear the static electricity popping as I brushed my hair.</li>
      <li>All-around very positive experience.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using it on very wet hair as it will pull and break, but it&#x27;s great to use when blowing dry and all of the tangles are out.</li>
      <li>I now have a princess’s hair with the shine and the smoothness all thanks to this bio ionic brush.</li>
      <li>really like what it&#x27;s doing to my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
      <li>Definitely makes my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>I finally decided to look for something that would be better for my hair and last long and 2 years later I am still using and loving this</li>
      <li>This brush has a really small neck and kind of hurts my wrist when using it for some reason.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the older version.</li>
      <li>I have an older paddle brush I am trying to replace and thought I would try this one based on the reviews.  </li>
      <li>I have broken my fair share of brushes trying to get the knots out of my hair.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t bought a new hairbrush in years, and I figured it was time.</li>
      <li>was becuase the new Bio Ionic paddle brush I was using.</li>
      <li>I think my hair dries quick when I use it to blow dry my hair.</li>
      <li>I see better results as far as shine from my boar bristle round brush, although that is rougher on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I ordered bio ionic silver paddle brush and received agave natural bamboo paddle brush.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter and she loves this hair brush.</li>
      <li>From the start, I noticed how silky soft my hair felt after using the brush.</li>
      <li>It feels soft and gives hair a shinny look.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t see it from the expensive ionic blow dryer I bought, either.  </li>
      <li>The first one lasted a long time, and I&#x27;m pretty rough on my brushes.  </li>
      <li>I also love that the bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt my kids&#x27; scalps when I brush their hair, but the bristles are firm enough to get out tangles.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, butI</li>
      <li>I use it for both blow drying and general brushing</li>
      <li>have super straight and thick Asian hair, and definitely recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and goes through your hair with no snarls and leaves your hair with no static at all!</li>

<li> I bought it for my daughter who has long hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for 2 or 3 years - have thick curly hair - this brush makes blow drying much easier than trying to yank a bristle brush through.</li>
<li> that typically takes 5 painful minutes to comb through (if straightening it), combined with a good leave-in conditioner.  </li>
<li> But now, I&#x27;d like to explore other products such as a hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have long curly hair (loose ringlet type curls)</li>
<li> I purchased the round brush at the same time, but don&#x27;t feel I get the same results.</li>
<li> With the same amount of conditioning product, I can now get my hair combed in about 2 minutes, with a lot less tangles and pain.</li>
<li> Not much you can say about a brush.</li>
<li> My advice - stay away from this brush and look at Invanity&#x27;s return policy carefully before you buy anything from them.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t detangle my wet hair like I was hoping for.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this to be a back up for the same brush I have owned for years. The one shown in the picture is not what arrived. That&#x27;s the older version. The newer version arrived and it is still good. I have long thick hair and it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered bio ionic silver paddle brush and received agave natural bamboo paddle brush. Not quite the same thing.</li>
    <li> It is an okay brush.  I have an older paddle brush I am trying to replace and thought I would try this one based on the reviews.  This brush has a really small neck and kind of hurts my wrist when using it for some reason.  It doesn&#x27;t detangle my wet hair like I was hoping for.  I will probably keep looking.</li>
    <li> I can truly tell a difference in the shine and health of my hair.  I also started using the Bio Ionic straightener at the same time so it could be a combo of the two.</li>
    <li> Actually, I got an ionic paddle brush, but it wasn&#x27;t silver. It had a bamboo handle and the teeth were earth colored. It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, butI really like what it&#x27;s doing to my hair.</li>
    <li> I got the Agave that had the &amp;#34;Bio Ionic&amp;#34; label, the one I ordered and should have gotten.</li>
    <li> Love it I  have been searching for this brush for years owed the someone years ago but the dog got it ... This brush is magic total static free smooths when blow drying and I say it takes smells out of UR hair magic I tell u</li>
    <li> I now have a princess’s hair with the shine and the smoothness all thanks to this bio ionic brush.</li>
    <li> Came on time and works great! I am waiting on the blow dryer they reccomend I use the brush with! Can&#x27;t wait to use them together!!</li>
    <li> I got two of these brushes, one for each daughter.  It seems to be a heavy duty brush that will stand up to their thick, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these brushes years ago at a spa in Chicago and I&#x27;ve been looking to replace it for quite a while but couldn&#x27;t find the identical product.  Now I have, and I&#x27;m thrilled; it&#x27;s the best brush I have ever owned.  I also loved the price; I paid nearly twice as much at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is smoother and shinier without the flyaways and there&#x27;s no problem with static even in the winter.  It&#x27;s also a very durable brush; I used my original one for many years before wearing it out.  I use it for both blow drying and general brushing so it gets a work out.  Love, love, love this brush!</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair (loose ringlet type curls) that typically takes 5 painful minutes to comb through (if straightening it), combined with a good leave-in conditioner.  My hairdresser recommended this brush and it&#x27;s changed my life.  With the same amount of conditioning product, I can now get my hair combed in about 2 minutes, with a lot less tangles and pain.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush and it does exactly what its supposed to do. It feels great in the hair and does not promote fly aways. This is considered a quality brush used by many pro&#x27;s in high end saloons and you can save money buying it here on amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter and she loves this hair brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is just ok.  For me, it didn&#x27;t make my hair shinier, softer or more manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t even do that great a job straightening my hair as a paddle brush.  Where it IS good is that it is not damaging to your hair; the bristles being all one piece including the balls at the end is very good engineering.  It will go through my hair more easily than other brushes and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the little balls breaking off, leaving harsh bristles to scratch my scalp.  I just don&#x27;t see the ionic benefits that everyone raves about.  To be fair, I don&#x27;t see it from the expensive ionic blow dryer I bought, either.  I see better results as far as shine from my boar bristle round brush, although that is rougher on my hair.  Maybe my hair just doesn&#x27;t respond to ions!  Ha.</li>
    <li> Very nice! I hadn&#x27;t bought a new hairbrush in years, and I figured it was time. It is lightweight, which makes it ideal for drying your hair. Look elsewhere if you are looking for the heavy ones that were used for corporal punishment.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after a recommendation from my stylist. From the start, I noticed how silky soft my hair felt after using the brush. My carpool buddy noticed the shine in my hair and questioned whether I got it treated. I told her it&#x27;s was becuase the new Bio Ionic paddle brush I was using. I&#x27;m practical and originally didn&#x27;t buy into the whole ionic line. But now, I&#x27;d like to explore other products such as a hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super straight and thick Asian hair, and definitely recommend this brush. I purchased the round brush at the same time, but don&#x27;t feel I get the same results. I think it&#x27;s because the bristles are more thinner and sharper than the paddle brush and I&#x27;m too scared of harming my hair with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for 2 or 3 years - have thick curly hair - this brush makes blow drying much easier than trying to yank a bristle brush through. Great price too and fast fast service. All-around very positive experience.</li>
    <li> Nice hairbrush.  My hairdresser recommended.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is great. This is my 2nd one. My 1st one was my daughters favorite so I gave in and let her have it.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush all the way around, does what they advertise, solid, well built, perfect for what I wanted.  Will definately buy another one - should I ever need one.</li>
    <li> Costly but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Alright. Until I purchased this brush, I have always been a drugstore brush person. I just grab whatever looks good and buy it. I finally decided to look for something that would be better for my hair and last long and 2 years later I am still using and loving this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, when I first read the reviews, I was skeptical. I didn&#x27;t believe a brush could really &amp;#34;reduce static&amp;#34;, I thought it was a gimmick, to be honest. But after using this brush for at least a year, I forgot it when we went on a trip. I used my friend&#x27;s brush and couldn&#x27;t believe how static-y my hair was! I am a believer. I also love that the bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt my kids&#x27; scalps when I brush their hair, but the bristles are firm enough to get out tangles. Really, I am so pleased with this brush!</li>
    <li> AWESOME! Love this brush.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bio Ionic Silver Classic Paddle Brush from Invanity because of all of the good reviews but the first time I used it I could literally hear the static electricity popping as I brushed my hair. And afterwards my hair looked like I&#x27;d stuck my finger in an electrical socket.  Invanity offered to replace the brush only after I&#x27;d left a bad review but they denied my first return request and were impossible to get a hold of. My advice - stay away from this brush and look at Invanity&#x27;s return policy carefully before you buy anything from them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! My favorite of all time.  Bought several so I don&#x27;t have to be without!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it I started using it too its a great product</li>
    <li> I have long frizzy hair and its so hair to blow dry my hair using a brush but finally.....a brush that glides through my hair without ripping!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the bioionic paddle brush!!!!! It&#x27;s very good for blowdrying, it has awesome slip as you are drying the hair. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes my hair smooth. I don&#x27;t recommend using it on very wet hair as it will pull and break, but it&#x27;s great to use when blowing dry and all of the tangles are out.</li>
    <li> It was an OK brush but the handle broke.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush. Was recommended by my hair stylist. Bought one for me, and then my son kept stealing it and I could never find it... so I bought another one for HIM! GREAT brush.</li>
    <li> This brush looks really cool And feels good in your hand. I bought it for my daughter who has long hair and she said it doesn&#x27;t really help with static electricity like it claims, but its a good brush.</li>
    <li> It got to me on time. It is  very light, which makes it easy to carry. It feels soft and gives hair a shinny look.</li>
    <li> Great brush to replace my old one</li>
    <li> I love this hair brush! It is light weight and goes through your hair with no snarls and leaves your hair with no static at all! I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Great comb to tame my unruly hair.</li>
    <li> Somehow this brush lives up to all of its crazy claims. I have broken my fair share of brushes trying to get the knots out of my hair. This brush just glides through them without breaking my hair or torturing my scalp.  My hair is shiny and there&#x27;s zero static. I hate static.</li>
    <li> Not much you can say about a brush. It looks and works good I guess. I don&#x27;t personally use it, but my wife appears to like it.</li>
    <li> Eh.  It&#x27;s good at detangling and just brushing in general, but it does not eliminate static. That&#x27;s pretty disappointing since the description says it does, and it also says on the brush itself &amp;#34;Static Free&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return it if I could... I threw away the box already. Doh!</li>
    <li> The wide bristles are great for getting out knots, but it makes my hair more staticy than my old $8.00 drug store brush.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE brush, complete waste of money. The funniest part is that right on the brush it states static free, while in the meantime it causes excessive static whenever I brush my hair with it. Unless of course the vendor sent me a fake brush!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, no static. I have had several brushes but nothing like this. This is my third time purchasing the same brush. I even purchased one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush so much I had to replace it when it wore out.  The first one lasted a long time, and I&#x27;m pretty rough on my brushes.  I recommend it for anyone with frizzy, fly away hair.</li>
    <li> Ok, I never thought there was I big difference in brushes, but now - I do! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 curly haired kids that hate having their hair done in the moring because there are so many&lt;br /&gt;Knots in them. This brush gets through the knots so much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried, with or with out a spray on detangler. I think my hair dries quick when I use it to blow dry my hair.</li>
