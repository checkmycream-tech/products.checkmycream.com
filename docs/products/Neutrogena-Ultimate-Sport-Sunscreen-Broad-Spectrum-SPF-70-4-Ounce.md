      <li>Besides old fashion zinc oxide, this is the best sunscreen we have found.  </li>
      <li>it has been my best sunblock cream so far</li>
      <li>I have converted completely to Neutrogena sunscreens, and this, I think is their best for sports and sweat.</li>
      <li>This lotion has a good feel and an ok, clean, smell.</li>
      <li>It is water resistant for more than an hour and protects well from sunburn.  </li>
      <li>I love the non greasy feeling of this sunscreen and that it stays on:)</li>
      <li>I want to buy about 6 more bottles to make sure I always have it on hand.</li>
      <li>It smells better then most sunscreens and I never get sunburned.  </li>
      <li>Does not have that chalky feel that so many sunscreens have.</li>
      <li>I am ultra-sensitive to the sun and am rarely more than 3 feet away from sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I sweat a ton, and this stuff stays on me better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Not disgusting if you get some in your mouth by accident (</li>
      <li>And, I should mention, that it sits on top of your skin a bit</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>At some point you may want to slice the top off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The high SPF is wonderful for someone like me who burns super easily.</li>
      <li>Excellent sports sunscreen that works long hours like I do.  </li>
      <li>Its thickness gives the impression it is super effective, but for some reason I still tan when wearing it, as I do with all sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and was very pleased at how well this product worked for me on a recent beach trip.</li>
      <li>and it has strong scent that I wouldn&#x27;t miss too much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will keep using this product, strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned.</li>
      <li>It has a ridiculously high SPF and offers excellent sunburn protection.  </li>
      <li>but it was fine).  </li>
      <li>It seems to work fine, after a couple of hours or so in Houston sun</li>
      <li>I combined a big hat, thoughtfulness about my hours in the sun and this product and had a great two weeks with no sunburn at all.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t sting my skin or eyes, and went on silky smooth without a greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>Great protection for me white skin.</li>
      <li>so price-value ratio is important  to me.</li>
      <li>While gooey like all sunscreens, the Neutrogena sunscreen seems more worth the goo.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite product of the summer!</li>
      <li>I was not sure what to expect from this product, but is the best sport sunscreen I had tried.</li>
      <li>Felt fine on the face, absorbed well,  and did not allow any burns.</li>
      <li>It seemed to work fine (the doctor recommended me to wear sunblock so that fresh surgery scars on my face would not get sun damage</li>
      <li>Apparently these folks don&#x27;t like this chemical even though it&#x27;s by far the most popular active ingredient in most sunscreens and has a great sunlight wavelength absorption spectrum.  </li>
      <li>We were willing to try out many sunscreens to find the right one and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty easy to apply (disappears relatively quickly).  </li>
      <li>Absorbs into skin quickly</li>
      <li>I like the Neutrogena better because it is not as greasy and absorbs better, a big plus if you are wearing it with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It protects my son.&lt;br /&gt;The arrival was adequate.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on easily without too much fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen has never failed us!</li>
      <li>Even my teen son likes it, and that is a great thing since we live in Arizona.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all.</li>
      <li>Was not uncomfortable to wear in very hot weather.  </li>
      <li>As far as results, I have played many tennis matches at noon on a hot day, and have not been burned once where this sunscreen was applied.  </li>
      <li>far as results, I have played many tennis matches at noon on a hot day, and have not been burned once where this sunscreen was applied.  </li>
      <li>This is a light cream which absorbs quickly into the skin, leaves it soft, and has no milky residue.</li>
      <li>Have survived melanoma and this just stays effective for a long day on whale watch trips as well as tropical beach days.</li>
      <li>Used it extensively in Nicaragua which I visited in April and early May. Worked pretty Damn good.</li>
      <li>It also, in my experience, didn&#x27;t run very much when I sweat or had been in water</li>
      <li>It is difficult to find in brick and mortar stores, but the best sunscreen protection I have used.</li>
      <li>Add these factors to my tendency to break out with certain sunscreens, and finding the right product has been a headache.  </li>
      <li>It is not expensive and I use it just 2 times per day because my skin is protected</li>
      <li>This is the first sun screen I&#x27;ve used that really and truly felt as if it wasn&#x27;t there!  </li>
      <li>so kids don&#x27;t laugh (too much) at me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This sunscreen manages to make it&#x27;s way into my eyes, even if I only put it on my cheeks and forehead. It stings my eyes like nothing else, and it has left a burning sensation on my skin around my eyew. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so be wary!</li>
    <li> I sweat a ton, and this stuff stays on me better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I was so tired of sunscreens that leave white residue on clothes and make me look white as ghost. Neutrogena Ultimate Sport by far has least residue for SPF 70 sunscreen.I do not think it is very water or sweat resistent and it has strong scent that I wouldn&#x27;t miss too much.&lt;br /&gt;However it is 4 oz. and all other comparable  Neutrogena  sunscreen lotions  are just  3 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I use ton of sunscreen so price-value ratio is important  to me.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect from this product, but is the best sport sunscreen I had tried. Is really soft and creamy, and additionally is not leaving my face white as other sport sunscreens do, for sure I will keep using this product, strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> . . .and we&#x27;ve tried them all.  We live in the Southwest where it&#x27;s always sunny and the 6000 foot altitude predisposes folks to getting fried if they aren&#x27;t careful.  We&#x27;re outside all summer, hiking, playing tennis, golf or swimming in the heat of the day. Add these factors to my tendency to break out with certain sunscreens, and finding the right product has been a headache.  We were willing to try out many sunscreens to find the right one and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Sport goes on thick and rubs in immediately (without the white film).  It is not greasy, it&#x27;s VERY water resistant and easy on sensitive skin (even on the face).  It has a ridiculously high SPF and offers excellent sunburn protection.  I checked out the \\&quot;Environmental Working Group 2010 Sunscreen Guide\\&quot; and this product was given an avoid recommendation.  According to their site this is because it contains oxybenzone as one of the active compounds that absorbs the energy in the sunlight.  Apparently these folks don&#x27;t like this chemical even though it&#x27;s by far the most popular active ingredient in most sunscreens and has a great sunlight wavelength absorption spectrum.  They cite \\&quot;Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Biochemical or cellular level changes\\&quot; and a myriad of other reasons that they feel this product isn&#x27;t safe.  In the end, avoidance of all sunlight is really the only way to prevent solar skin damage, and potential toxicities of organic compounds used in sunscreens need to be weighed against the well established fact that skin cancers, especially melanoma, can be deadly.  The main issue with oxybenzone is that it may cause photoallergy in some people.  If you are one of those people with this sensitivity, this product may not be for you.  In general though, if you&#x27;re not sensitive to oxybenzone based sunscreens, I believe this product is a lot safer than a sunburn.  (As an aside, I&#x27;ve tried one of the EWG Guide&#x27;s &#x27;BEST&#x27; sport sunscreens - \\&quot;All Terrain TerraSport Performance\\&quot; - and it stung my eyes like crazy, rendering it useless as a sport sunscreen.)  In the future with microencapsualtion of sunscreen components and supramolecular sunscreens, some of these concerns may be further addressed, but for now, oxybenzone and similar organically based compounds simply are the best we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results, I have played many tennis matches at noon on a hot day, and have not been burned once where this sunscreen was applied.  Another benefit is that this won&#x27;t drip off of your forehead and sting your eyes like some others we have found.  As with any sunscreen, prolonged sun exposure requires you to reapply your sunscreen.  We reapply every two to three hours when we&#x27;re in the direct sun during midday (or at lunch on a ski day). If you don&#x27;t, you will get burned, no matter how great the sunscreen or SPF Factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, nothing beats avoidance of the midday sun, a hat or skin coverage as ways to avoid skin sun damage.  But if you&#x27;re active outside, these mitigation strategies aren&#x27;t always feasible.  Besides old fashion zinc oxide, this is the best sunscreen we have found.  Use it properly, reapply when needed, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.- \\&quot;All Terrain TerraSport Performance\\&quot; - and it stung my eyes like crazy, rendering it useless as a sport sunscreen.)

    <li> This product works very well for me as a bike rider exposed to lots of sun.  My complaint is with the packaging - I bet most people only get 3 out of the 4 available ounces - when the tube gets low I have to remove the cap and diligently fold up and squeeze to get the last ounce out.  They should knock 25% off the price or repackage the product.</li>
    <li> I have used other Neutrogena sunscreen products in the past.  They have left me dissatisfied due to the greasy nature and white residue.  Not an issue at all with this Ultimate Sport Sunscreen.  This is a light cream which absorbs quickly into the skin, leaves it soft, and has no milky residue. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Hi, we always use it on the water when we are out waterskiing or on the beach. the kids never ever had a sunburm or a rash and two of my kids have very sensitive skin! I have no idea what other people do that they are not satisfied...mum of 3, best ever and we tried a lot!</li>
    <li> Goes on easily without too much fragrance.  Does not have that chalky feel that so many sunscreens have. Even my teen son likes it, and that is a great thing since we live in Arizona. Too much sun.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very quickly, in excellent condition. Needed for summer--family members work outside, and I won&#x27;t use anything less than 50 spf, so this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t apply it on your forehead, or it will run into your eyes as soon as you start sweating, and it stings badly.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst sunscreen I have ever used!  I slathered it on liberally before a hike and still got FRIED. It was as if I had applied baby oil -- I had to stay indoors and out of the sun for three days, the sunburn was that bad.    It&#x27;s a pity because I usually like Neutrogena&#x27;s products, but this experience and their obviously poor QA has turned me off completely.</li>
    <li> This is my third time coming back for more...only disappointment was that there was only one in stock....excellent product....I live in Jamaica where there is sun all the time</li>
    <li> This is the first sun screen I&#x27;ve used that really and truly felt as if it wasn&#x27;t there!  It didn&#x27;t sting my skin or eyes, and went on silky smooth without a greasy residue.  I will definitely stick to this product!</li>
    <li> It goes on pretty thick and white, but smooths out and loses the white color. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Its thickness gives the impression it is super effective, but for some reason I still tan when wearing it, as I do with all sunscreens. After a few minutes, I pretty much forget I&#x27;m wearing it as it doesn&#x27;t leave a really bad greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Used every day on face and body on a trip where I was in the sun everyday and it preformed well.  It does not leave that white color on your face and actually feels very nice on your face and not to heavy or oily and still protected well.  No sunburn!</li>
    <li> While gooey like all sunscreens, the Neutrogena sunscreen seems more worth the goo. It actually felt thicker to me than a lot of other products but it did seem to lose its gooeyness quickly. I have fair skin and was very pleased at how well this product worked for me on a recent beach trip. I combined a big hat, thoughtfulness about my hours in the sun and this product and had a great two weeks with no sunburn at all.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product of the summer! I run every day and spend time on the boat fishing - this product has been marvelous each and every time. I use it on myself and my 6yr old. No burns and it&#x27;s nice to know we are truly protected. I want to buy about 6 more bottles to make sure I always have it on hand. I also bought the companion Face sunscreen and it&#x27;s marvelous too!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena at it&#x27;s best w/ it&#x27;s Sunscreen which stays on through sweat but should be reapplied if you&#x27;re playing volleyball or in and out of the water a lot. Now a days, Dermatologists are recommending EVERY BODY who spends time out side, even when it&#x27;s cloudy and esp. The little ones, infants and up ( dogs too if they don&#x27;t have much air due to the breed, a med. Condition, age ) , every body due to the loss of our ozone layer, WEAR SUNSCREEN TO AVOID SKIN CANCER ! People die from Melanoma. It should be at least an SPF 30 and it doesn&#x27;t matter , Ladies, if your cosmetics contain sunscreen. It&#x27;s not enough. Any skin exposed to the sun should be covered. Neutropenia has a whole line covered, so use it.</li>
    <li> False Advertising and Toxic Chemicals.  Do Not Buy This Product anymore!  If I could return the last two I bought, I would  Read this article. http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2015/06/neutrogena-sunscreen-toxic-avoid/  Then do your own research.  U.S. food and Drug Administration state that SPF levels max out at 50.</li>
    <li> Be careful around your eyes with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of science, I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned. I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATERIAL: I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  For simplicity, I&#x27;ll just refer to them by their SPF rating (50, 60, &amp; 70).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METHODS: The test was simple. I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time. Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye. After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  The results were quite surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:  Lotions were vastly different. I literally had no reaction to 60, but 70 felt like I had been pepper sprayed.  The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned. I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it and ran to the kitchen sink to rinse my eyes.  After a 2 minute recovery and towel dry, I went back to try 50, which was the spray.  Now this was a bit confusing, but I got a different reaction in each eye from 50.  I applied it to my eyes immediately after spraying and kept my eyelids closed.  Within 3 seconds, my right eye was burninglike fire, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything from my left eye.  Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  I then got my fingers wet and rubbed my eyes to get the areas around my eyes really wet. This actually caused a very subtle stinging in the left eye finally, but made my right eye feel like I had just poured Tabasco in my eye. I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye. The left eye seemed fine.  The final test was direct spray onto the eyelid of each closed eye.  Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all. However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  Clearly, 60 is completely painless, 70 could drop an assailant in his tracks, and 50 was only painful briefly until it dried and then left the skin around my eyes feel stiff with a barely noticeable burning sensation.  For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPEARANCE:  Very different appearance between the 3 products.  Item 50 was unnoticeable without a sheen immediately, 70 dried basically clear with a subtle whitening or lightening of the skin that persisted and was a bit shiny, and 60 remained visibly very white like clown makeup for a long time, and only really lightened after repeated rubbing every 5 minutes or so for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have very acne-prone skin. I had breakouts every day after taking the sunscreen off the night before. Once I stopped using it, I stopped breaking out. Also, my skin looks very oily throughout the day because the label doesn&#x27;t say that it is oil-free. Putting on my foundation was a nightmare. I should not have bought it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this sunscreen has a high SPF and still doesn&#x27;t feel greasy going on. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling uncomfortable like some sunscreens do because of the stickiness. However, an odd problem I have had with this particular brand of sunscreen is that it takes the outer layer of nail polish off my fingers. If I apply it while wearing a shiny polish and I am not careful, the polish will be completely matte and tacky by the time I am done. I have to apply it with the palm of my hand and be careful not to get it on my nails. I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient is causing this to happen.</li>
    <li> Has a habit of staining any clothing or other surfaces you come in contact with for a sustained period of time.  Very effective as a sunscreen and noticeable shading of sun with SPF 70  versus SPF 50.</li>
    <li> Best I have found.  Have survived melanoma and this just stays effective for a long day on whale watch trips as well as tropical beach days.</li>
    <li> The only aftershave a fellow with sensitive skin should use.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works extremely well since I am susceptible  to sun burning. Very competitive pricing.</li>
    <li> Used it extensively in Nicaragua which I visited in April and early May. Worked pretty Damn good.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s what I was looking for. great product for the price. it has been my best sunblock cream so far</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found for construction work in the hot Texas sun. Doesn&#x27;t burn if a little gets in your eyes. I usually wet face and arms before applying to make it go a little farther. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of types in the past 30 years of working outdoors, and this remains the favorite.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a good feel and an ok, clean, smell. It is difficult to find in brick and mortar stores, but the best sunscreen protection I have used. I use it for hiking trips, snowshoeing, biking, and cross-country skiing -- for those applications it lasts well all day. (much of that is just protection from sun reflected off the rocks or snow)</li>
    <li> Ordered this because of bigger size than in stores.  Amazon remedied a little problem we had with shipping.  Other than that, I like this sunblock because it works for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent sports sunscreen that works long hours like I do.  I have converted completely to Neutrogena sunscreens, and this, I think is their best for sports and sweat.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.  I am ultra-sensitive to the sun and am rarely more than 3 feet away from sunscreen.  Absorbs into skin quickly so kids don&#x27;t laugh (too much) at me.  I&#x27;ve tried the neutragena ultra and although that sounds good, it is not as good as this product.  I use it when I go running and it still seems to last a while.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It protects my son.&lt;br /&gt;The arrival was adequate.  Great for summer.&lt;br /&gt;My son uses it everyday.  We live in southern California.  And the weather can be very different during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;But this product does the job</li>
    <li> I live in the Caribbean and this sunscreen actually protects the skin from the sun rays which damages my skin,it glides on smooth and does not leave any residue but i also got few pimples from using it .</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used. My dermatologist advised me to use this on a recent trip to Puerto Vallarta. I actually tanned for one of the few times in my life.</li>
    <li> The #1 reason I like this stuff so much is it spreads right in with no white film.  For guys with whiskers, it can take forever to get that white stuff to go away.  Not with this one. It&#x27;s something I always keep around.</li>
    <li> We live in Los Angeles so we&#x27;re often outdoors. This sunscreen has never failed us! We use it daily!  It works great...even for my ultra-sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> my husband, competitive cyclist  has developed an allergy to the active ingredients in this sunscreen and all&lt;br /&gt;others with like ingredients. you have to read labels carefully to find the products that are acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;zinc oxide products which look different on and feel different have helped him get back on the road</li>
    <li> Great service!!!!!!!  Nice product</li>
    <li> I found this in a Consumer Reports review.  It was the only one with a high SPF that came in a tube. I carry it in a tool bag and use it in the field so it has to be in a tube.  It seems to work fine, after a couple of hours or so in Houston sun I haven&#x27;t gotten any kind of sun redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to find it locally.  That&#x27;s why I ordered it from Amazon.  If you try to find it locally be sure the name is exactly the same.  Both Walgreens and CVS tried to convince me a Neutrogena sunscreen with a similar name was really the same thing -- wrong!  I called Neutrogena and they explained that it wasn&#x27;t.  I dinged it one star because the shelf life is short -- if you buy a tube shortly after manufacture it will only last 18 months.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it contains oxybenzone and other organic chemicals, which gave me a rash and horrible itching for about 4 days. I suppose it works for some people, but if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend using sunscreen with ingredients that physically block the sun, such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> Great protection for me white skin. just hiked 250 miles on jmt and came back unscathed...</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awesome. It really does leave your skin less irritated from the oil, and it&#x27;s easy to apply and long lasting. It&#x27;s a pretty thick cream, but it spreads in easily and doesn&#x27;t have that grimy feeling I get on my face with other sunscreen products. The high SPF is wonderful for someone like me who burns super easily. I used it recently on a 5 day trip down to Cabo, and though I was very vigilant about regularly reapplying, I didn&#x27;t burn on my face/neck at all except my hairline where I didn&#x27;t think to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this product is a bit pricey for the amount you get, the oil free aspect and the fact it didn&#x27;t break out my skin at all even with several days of constant use outweighs that for me.</li>
    <li> I am so thankful for this product and I am praying it helps me as I am an increased risk for skin cancer. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn while sweating.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen for the face and neck.  It is light enough to go on before your make-up.  It has broad spectrum protection and does not irritate my eyes (I don&#x27;t put it near my eyes, but it is hard not to  touch my face and eyes at some point during the day).  I have tried all types of sunscreens--baby--sensitive--but they all irritate my eyes.  This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Just spent a week in Maui - constantly in the sun and water. I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn or even a suntan (though some people might consider that last a negative).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other positives:&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on white, but then absorbs so you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;- Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;- Not disgusting if you get some in your mouth by accident (though I don&#x27;t recommend it).&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in your eyes (though I don&#x27;t recommend it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Package is not great for travel - put in plastic bag in case the top pops and the stuff goes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;- Package is not great for getting it all out. At some point you may want to slice the top off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly pricey at $10 for 4 oz - but still worth it for me for all the benefits.</li>
    <li> I dont like it on my skin. Feels that it clogs all my pores and makes skin look oily and white in a powdery residue sort of way.</li>
    <li> I used this sun protection over the summer in Brazil (very sunny) and they protected my whole family. It is a little thick, but it should be for a 70spc. It has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Does the job well.  It is water resistant for more than an hour and protects well from sunburn.  I also like the Ultimate Sport fragrance more than the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch sunscreen.  When I bought this, it was also the cheaper one.</li>
    <li> It seems like a small tube but I used it on a 10 day vacation to Las Vegas (including Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, and some other places) in the middle of July.  This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  I tanned but never burned (a little red when I first came in but that went to tan soon).  It is not greasy when you put it on and you don&#x27;t need a ton of it.  It also, in my experience, didn&#x27;t run very much when I sweat or had been in water (I only did a little swimming with it but it was fine).  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week&#x27;s vacation in Hawaii, with two to three hours in the sun every day, both on the beach and hiking. No burn! None at all, just a little light color. I highly recommend, the oil-free formula didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all and it worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> Stays on when surfing.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen is good but the tube covering started to chip immediately so that I&#x27;d get little specs of silver and blue on me and around the bathroom where I was applying it. And, I should mention, that it sits on top of your skin a bit and if you want to wear cosmetics on top of it you&#x27;ll have a slightly creamy base. Suncreen aspect works well, though. I&#x27;m trying the Banana Boat right now, cheaper and less of a problem being absorbed- but still sits like the neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used up two whole containers of this. Since I only used it on my face, one container would typically get me through a whole year (daily use). It seemed to work fine (the doctor recommended me to wear sunblock so that fresh surgery scars on my face would not get sun damage and they have not so it works well). I never had an issue with the product breaking me out or causing any kind of discomfort. The only thing is that it does leave your face looking shiny, even if you don&#x27;t have oily skin (mine is normal). You&#x27;ll look horrible in flash photography if you don&#x27;t wear any makeup on top, but the problem actually goes away if you just wear this under your makeup. I&#x27;ve switched to a slightly more expensive sunblock now that leaves the skin looking matte, but I wouldn&#x27;t say no to this one either as it does its job of protecting your skin very well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy and I like that it&#x27;s water resistant.  Pretty easy to apply (disappears relatively quickly).  And it&#x27;s water resistant, which is great for the summer.</li>
    <li> Great product - non greasy.  Works well!</li>
    <li> Works as labeled as far as I can tell. Does not burn eyes.  Expensive. Listed by Consumer&#x27;s Reports as effective.</li>
    <li> it was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Does not sting, it has been good for endurance bike/run events.</li>
    <li> Really like this. Used to use Alba until reading reviews in Consumer Reports which highly recommends this Neutrogena. Used it in Hawaii and protection and longevity was great.</li>
    <li> I love the non greasy feeling of this sunscreen and that it stays on:) As a very fair skinned person, sun protection is really important to me - this checks all my boxes!</li>
    <li> Felt fine on the face, absorbed well,  and did not allow any burns.</li>
    <li> Have not used the product yet but arrived as specified.</li>
    <li> The Best Product I have ever used, not greasy and it lasts all day.....Blows Banana Boat out of the water....</li>
    <li> Shipped immediately.  Only question is , weather was extremely hot and product was extremely warm/hot upon arrival.  Does this affect the product performance?  Did use it on vacation and did protect from sunburn so obviously worked.  Will it continue to work as it should, or did the heat during transport affect the longevity of the product.  Guess will have to wait and see......&lt;br /&gt;Did not feel greasy.  Was not uncomfortable to wear in very hot weather.  Would recommend the product thus far.</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered this item frequently. Great sun protection! Lasts a long time. I will order again from this provider in the future.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works!! I am extremely fair-skinned and will not go outside unless I have this on! I wear it all the time; in the deep South it is an absolute must! And it absorbs quickly, it is not greasy and I don&#x27;t smell like I have sunscreen on.</li>
    <li> I surf every day early morning for 2-3 hours.  (Irish-German in Southern California).  This product works good.  It smells better then most sunscreens and I never get sunburned.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t kill my eyes.  I have sensitive eyes and no sun screen is perfect (this one included) but I find that as long as I don&#x27;t touch my face, my eyes do well.</li>
    <li> Let me be honest about this.  I had a terrible reaction to the ingredients in this product.  Shortly after going into the sun, I thought my skin was on fire.  For the next 5 weeks I battled a terrible  rash everywhere it had been applied.  Complete with blisters.  I tried everything to mitigate the results of this product, and finally saw a dematogist who proscribed a topical steriod.  Now I am not saying that everyone will have this kind of reaction, but I am saying if you have the least bit sensitive skin, for God&#x27;s sake be careful.  Try it on a small area to be sure you are not like me.</li>
    <li> I used this on a three-week tropical vacation and didn&#x27;t get even a little sun on my face. It even worked well under my BB cream and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (despite that I can&#x27;t use other Neutrogena products).</li>
    <li> We had been using Banana Boat Sport/Performance SPF 100.  I like the Neutrogena better because it is not as greasy and absorbs better, a big plus if you are wearing it with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; clothes for an outing.  It also has less fragrance than Banana Boat.  A downside is that because it is not as greasy/oily you need to use more, so it can become quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this Sunscreen. I need it to use  my job as a biologist. It is not expensive and I use it just 2 times per day because my skin is protected</li>
    <li> We go through a lot of sunscreen living in SWFL and being boat people. This one works great. Stays on and protects us even when we are in and out of the water.</li>
    <li> Work &amp; does not feel oily...</li>
    <li> The only one that doesn&#x27;t run when I sweat (and I do) while biking, hiking or just being out in hot son.</li>
