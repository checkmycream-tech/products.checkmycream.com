      <li>clean well, does not tingle, and makes my hair stringy, lifeless, greasy and yellow.</li>
      <li>My hair looked nice and shiney and I noticed I did not loose as much hair as I normally do with my other shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend for curly hair.</li>
      <li>But I like that because most shampoos feel too heavy on my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product, helped me in the past with dandruff, but I believeI have a more serious scalp issue since it hasn&#x27;t work this time around, but it does relieve the itchiness</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for nearly a year</li>

      <li>Makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s moisture and is near the clarifying section rather than the moisturizing section.</li>
      <li>My hair is very picky and doesn&#x27;t do well with a lot of different Shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Has helped scalp itch and dry skin decently.  </li>
      <li>50/50 my normal color and grey.</li>
      <li>I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean, and together with the matching conditioner which makes tangles easily removed by running my fingers through or with a brush.</li>
      <li>But sadly it has not worked for me, sure it made my hair healthier but it still left my scalp high and dry.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much healthier in less than a month.</li>

<li> I  was looking for a shampoo and conditioner that could give me moisture but not feel heavy.  </li>
<li> If you experience migrane it is possible that the minty smell could make it worse.</li>
<li> Makes hair stiff.</li>
<li> Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes.</li>
<li> I usually can go two days without washing my hair or even three if I add some baby powder to suck up the oils.</li>
<li> I do like other reviewers feel that tingle sensation which leaves me uncomfortable and my head itchy in the shower when using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for nearly a year and I have no intentions of switching. My hair feels great after using the shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
    <li> not bad to me was just over priced</li>
    <li> My family loves this and I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo and conditioner.  Has helped scalp itch and dry skin decently.  Smells great and keeps hair shiny and doesn&#x27;t dull my color.</li>
    <li> Both shampoo and conditioner are good;however, my skin had an allergic reaction. CAUTION: If you experience migrane it is possible that the minty smell could make it worse. And unfortunately, I am one of them.</li>
    <li> Tingles and feels and smells fresh but I bought it for helping with scalp odor which it did not do.</li>
    <li> I really like this tea tree - and I have tried a few others.  This is not minty, but does have that kind of feel - all tingly and a nice wake-up kind of thing.  Makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> My brother likes these products</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  Makes hair stiff.</li>
    <li> My daughter actually discovered this shampoo and conditioner and I just recently spent three weeks with her in Phoenix where she lives.  I used her shampoo and conditioner while I was there and quickly liked the results.  My scalp felt clean and moisturized.  My hair looked nice and shiney and I noticed I did not loose as much hair as I normally do with my other shampoo.  The difference was significant and it makes sense to me that there were probably too many chemicals in my shampoo.  I am super sensitive to alot of things.  I never thought about shampoo.  It must make a difference for people who are sensitive. I was really suprised  my order came in two days.  That was awesome.  I recommend this duo for anyone a dry scalp or anyone that seems to be losing more hair than they would like after they wash their hair. Drop all the chemicals and switch to this refreshing brand.  So so wonderful.  My hair is so much healthier in less than a month.</li>
    <li> It has a great awakening scent and rinses clean with no build up. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied. Will definately order again! I would consider this a good clarifying shampoo and a very light conditioner.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. I haven&#x27;t bought this in combination before. Not sure why the shampoo came for normal hair (which I usually buy) and the conditioner for oily hair (which may not work).</li>
    <li> I love this product, helped me in the past with dandruff, but I believeI have a more serious scalp issue since it hasn&#x27;t work this time around, but it does relieve the itchiness and it&#x27;s really easy on the curly heads like me.</li>
    <li> It is a nice set for my hair type. I just wish the tingling feeling lasted a little longer. The calming effect doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. Otherwise it is nice.</li>
    <li> I like the tingly feeling and the smoothness that results with continuous use. You have to use it a good 2 weeks to really see and feel the results. It doesn&#x27;t lather a lot which I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good or bad. I do however recommended it to help with lice. My niece brought lice home from school and I was complete disgusted and annoyed by those blood-sucking parasites. After doing a thorough comb through my thick long hair, I continued to shampoo and condition everyday and it seemed to help specially because of the tea tree extract. I did not use over the counter lice treatment but rather home remedies. I didn&#x27;t have to wait a week and do a second comb through.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th shampoo (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite. I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean, and together with the matching conditioner which makes tangles easily removed by running my fingers through or with a brush. By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean. This Tea Tree Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes. I love that this product is cruelty free. I recommend search around for a lower price on the internet (vitacost has great prices).</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my order. I just love these Giovanni products.&lt;br /&gt;Will never be without them!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so much more manageable&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Really nice shampoo and conditioner.  The tea tree oil makes your head tingle and is refreshing.</li>
    <li> Too soupy. Bottle not squeezable to get product out. I ended up returning</li>
    <li> my hair is so soft and healthy</li>
    <li> I  was looking for a shampoo and conditioner that could give me moisture but not feel heavy.  It has a chart on the back rating it&#x27;s moisture and is near the clarifying section rather than the moisturizing section. But I like that because most shampoos feel too heavy on my hair. It really clears out all hair spray, and hair products with a soothing mint feeling on the scalp. It relieved my irritated, itchy scalp so much and felt very nice! I love how the conditioner detangles my hair completely but feels weightless! Also it was very neatly packaged and arrived in just 2 days.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Her hair is soft and smells great. No tangles and very manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a great duo of shampoo and conditioner, I would recommend it for all hair types. The shampoo gently cleanses the hair of any dirt, oil, and build-up, and then the conditioner detangles and leaves your hair super soft. Giovanni makes fantastic natural haircare products, and their shampoos and conditioners are on par with expensive salon brands at a fraction of the price. Giovanni products contain natural organic ingredients and are cruelty-free. Keep in mind that this Tea Tree Triple Treat combo does have a very minty scent to it, some people are bothered by the scent of peppermint. If you don&#x27;t like the scent of mint then I would suggest the Smooth As Silk Giovanni shampoo and conditioner combo since it has a fruity natural fragrance.</li>
    <li> I had initially tried both of these Giovanni tea tree products.  I did like them, but when a sale came up, I decided to purchase a different brand of duo organic shampoo/conditioners.  These alternate products just made my hair stringy, dry, and tangled, even after using the conditioner.  Therefore, I switched, for good, to Giovanni for my hair care.  It&#x27;s truly one of the best, most trusted, organic shampoo/conditioner duos made.</li>
    <li> Perfect, arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a alright product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my hair but not so great for my scalp, I have a oily/dry scalp and thought this would help my head like it did for other customers/reviewers. But sadly it has not worked for me, sure it made my hair healthier but it still left my scalp high and dry. (A lot of dandruff) Which resulted me running back and using TGEL. I use that product before using these two. It&#x27;s a alright combo. But if you have a oily/dry scalp make sure you have anti-dandruff shampoo on you.. you&#x27;ll need it.&lt;br /&gt;Also I do like other reviewers feel that tingle sensation which leaves me uncomfortable and my head itchy in the shower when using it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for a stocking stuffer. I&#x27;m a dude and even I noticed her hair looked smooth after.</li>
    <li> Not what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  My hair is very picky and doesn&#x27;t do well with a lot of different Shampoos.  I tried this as the price was reasonable (on the cheaper side) and was happy to find that my hair did great with it.  The smell is soothing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo &amp; conditioner. I have very fine hair and need this type of product. The shampoo make my scalp tingle and feel really clean - and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite line from the Giovanni brand and for the longest I could not find this one in any beauty supply around me so I had to resort to buying online and it came fast and this buyer has become my lifesaver. I love the tingling sensation from the mint botanicals and it leaves my hair feeling extremely soft. I highly recommend for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing after one use. My hair is soft, shiny, and feels clean</li>
    <li> Well here is my two cents. I purchased this item for the price and for what is in shampoo and what is not mainly here is what they stated:  Enriched with certified organic botanicals. No animal by-products. Cruelty free. Increases scalp circulation for a refreshed, renewed feeling. Removes all traces of dirt, oils and build up. Alleviates dry, flaking scalp with organic peppermint botanicals. Contains no laurel/laureth sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I bought it, as I do not like sulfates etc. I have been using WEN products for years but I thought this would be cheaper if indeed it did what it did vs. Wen being $60 for 32 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I have used it for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m not impressed. I usually can go two days without washing my hair or even three if I add some baby powder to suck up the oils. I can only go 1 day on this and my hair was so greasy I had to wash it again. First of all, I have use a dime to quarter amount to prewash my hair and it doesn&#x27;t suds up to clean it. Rinse and repeat, so now I&#x27;ve used twice the amount to wash my hair. My hair is short just to my chin, very fine and straight as an arrow. So it doesn&#x27;t clean well. Secondly I have peppered hair, 50/50 my normal color and grey. It is not dyed. I have a 1&amp;#34; strip of grey hair on both sides of my part and this shampoo has turned my grey streak &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; not good. Washed my hair this morning with my other bottle of WEN and viola, no more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clean well, does not tingle, and makes my hair stringy, lifeless, greasy and yellow.</li>
