<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lasted 10-12 weeks before it quit altogether. When running it was so loud I was going to return it but decided to keep. Wish I had ,what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is ok but not really a liner device. It&#x27;s ok for trimming and cutting beard.</li>
    <li> This thing works good but; I had a Conaire I used for years that worked well.  I opted to try this one out when that one died.  This one works well but is obnoxiously loud while in operation.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money but kind of cheap feeling and very noisy. keep it clean and oiled after EVERY use and you will see much better results.(edit)...I&#x27;ve taken away a star but left two stars simply because I only paid 9.99 for this product. That is still no reason that after exactly one year of use, approx twice a week, the blades no longer cut at all. I am very Disappointed with the failure, however, In the beginning it did a decent job.</li>
    <li> As advertized everything was great.</li>
    <li> I bought this battery operated trimmer as a replacement for the rechargeable one.&lt;br /&gt;That one&#x27;s battery eventually &#x27;memoried out&amp;#34; and required an outlet to function.</li>
    <li> Does a good job. Comes with a variety or trimming attachments.</li>
    <li> I can see why this is cheap. I was not even able to get the batteries to fit. Threw it in the trash as it is not worth returning or replacing. I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Good cut.  Light weight.  I thought it came with rechargeable batteries, but they are replaceable alkaline.  Not a big deal, but enough things use batteries in my house with kids, so coming up with extras in a time of need might not be a high probability.  Same for when traveling.</li>
    <li> Terrific find, better than the A/C model for 200% more money!  AA batteries make it super convenient. Easy travel, no cord.</li>
    <li> A good value for the money-&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the shipping was almost as much as the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Perfect, works very good for the price</li>
    <li> Very good product for the money! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this model Wahl for at least 15 years to 20 year. Very durable, and does the job, perfectooo. They are very durable, and worth every penny. Can&#x27;t find them in the retail stores. I have to search Amazon for them. And when I do find them, I order two &amp; three at a time. Always have a back-up trimmer, on hand. He has tried others, and they sit in a drawer, because they want do the job, like this one!</li>
    <li> very happy. works great</li>
    <li> When my 10+ year-old Conair (purchased at Kmart for about $15) finally quit, I needed another inexpensive, simple beard trimmer.  Unfortunately, I chose unwisely.  This one pulls at my stubbly beard like Velcro with Super Glue on it!  Aieeeeeee!  The irony is, before it died unexpectedly, the old Conair was working much better than this torture device.  Things keep getting cheaper and shoddier.  Maybe I need to spend $100 for a Braun or something.  Certainly not another Wahl.  I&#x27;m going to miss old Connie...</li>
    <li> I bought this Wahl trimmer, coz of lots of attachment. But when I installed the battery, it didn&#x27;t    work. So I have to return it.</li>
    <li> Great value and versatile!  AA BATS a plus</li>
    <li> This clipper works as well as ones priced 3x higher. Very durable and my old one held up for over 4 years. Needless to say I bought the exact same model. Ive dropped it many times, had it soaked with water when shaving with it after a shower, and it still works great. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> A bit noisy but cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of not depending on rechargeable batteries anymore and this works well.  Wish it had a few more length attachments is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I really love these clippers. They are affordable and get the job done if you&#x27;re just looking for a quick groom.</li>
    <li> This Trimmer was purchased to replace an old dependable trimmer that no longer held a charge. I tried to find my old trimmer again but had no luck so settled on this highly raided trimmer. I liked to battery power and it seems powerful enough. The negatives were it had a narrow cutting blade of 13/16 inch as my old model was about twice the cutting width. This model takes far too long to trim a beard due to the narrowness. The plastic catches to adjust the blade cutting depth are not easily adjusted and have the feel of almost breaking when attempting to move them. The general cutting action for cutting a thick beard did not give great results either. I found to get a semi decent even trim I had to hold the trimmer in many different positions to get a final even cut. This makes this trimmer much inferior to my previous trimmers.</li>
    <li> I got it from my wife for Christmas. Iam very satisfied with this trimmer. It works very well. It has a lot of attachments and a spot for each of them. It is very handy.</li>
    <li> Cordless! Very comfortable in use. Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a cheap Vidal Sassoon trimmer that broke. This Wahl seems like a decent product, but it is extremely LOUD. I read another review where the author said he couldn&#x27;t hold the trimmer up to his face because of the sound. I completely agree with this. The device is so loud as to be painful at times. It sounds like a weed whacker on your face. I&#x27;m not sure why this is, since other Wahls I&#x27;ve owned were very quiet (even the $10 Sassoon trimmer was far quieter).    It does what Wahl claims it does, but is too earsplitting for me to give it more stars.</li>
    <li> This trimmer fantastic.  My husband has been using this trimmer for almost a year now.  He just commented on it the other day.  We have not had to replace the batteries yet.  It is light weight and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  Great product &amp; Great price!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, and he hasn&#x27;t used a razor since.  The attatchments are tough to put on, but there is a good variety and they all do their job.  He likes it a lot, and I like that his face looks a lot tidier;)  Geat product for the price.</li>
    <li> I expected more in the way of quality from Wahl. The plastic case had parts that did not properly fit making even the simple task of inserting batteries difficult. I was not successful in this most basic of efforts. It may cut well but I never even got it to run -- and, I am no stranger to inserting batteries into small appliances    I packaged it up for return within 15 minutes of initially opening the shipped item.     Thank you Amazon for an excellent return policy.</li>
    <li> The battery compartment was totally inadequate to hold the batteries and close the cover, which immediately broke.  I elected not to return the item due to the cheapness of the price.  Instead, I am now using this Chinese junk with tape holding the battery compartment closed.  My rating would have been 4 stars, but I removed 3 because of the incredible flaw in the battery compartment. I will never purchase anything from Wahl until they stop importing Chinese junk.</li>
    <li> We purchased this item for thinning my boyfriends goatee.  I have to say it works wonders, almost too good.  If you are not careful it will trim alittle more than what you want to trim off.  So, I would suggest testing it before you start trimming your face, as you might trim a lot more than what you actually want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional components that come with this trimmer are really not very sturdy, they are plastic and are very hard to snap onto the actual trimmer.  But if you use the bigger component it has a 5 settings that you can choose from for trimming and this is the only attachment that we use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something cheap and that will thin a mustache or goatee, I would suggest this one.  We do not use this item for trimming we just use it for thinning.  It does what it is suppose to, for the price.</li>
    <li> this works fine. it was a great price and it comes with multiple guides for trimming hair to different heights. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Well made, affordable, basic and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> The Wahl clipper does what it should, especially at the price. I think that it will run a long time on the AA batteries. I prefer this over the rechargeables that are never charged when you need them and eventually wear out.  It trims well and is well made for the price.     What I DON&#x27;T like:  1) The clipper head tines are flat on the end instead of tapered, so you have to go over your beard several times to clip it all. The tines do not comb the hairs into the slots to be cut, at least not very well.   2) The plastic attachments work well at setting the clip height, but they are VERY hard to get on and off - I feel that I am going to break one every time I remove it. Not well designed. There is one attachment that is adjustable - I leave that on most of the time to minimize removal, but I still have to take it off to use the bare head for close trimming.   3) The base unit does not hold all the attachments very well - they are always scattered around my counter.     Would I buy one again - probably - this is still a very good deal.  I do expect to break one of the plastic attachments in the near future. I&#x27;ll bet that they are not available separately!</li>
    <li> greatest new toy 4 me it works great.</li>
    <li> This product was to be used outside of US. So all those trimmers with 110v chargers were out of contention. Now the problem is that nowhere does Wahl mentions the input rating for it&#x27;s trimmers. I called up their office and after a couple of tries and a voice message later a lady called me back. She put me on hold and went out searching for the information. Finally it turned out that the Wahl trimmers sold in US can only be used within US, unless of course you wish to buy a bulky step down converter. How thoughtful Wahl! Don&#x27;t people in US travel out of the country? Why can&#x27;t your chargers be made to operate within a  range of voltage like the laptops and so many other electrical and electronic equipments do?    Thus the available choices reduced to a few battery operated ones only. And this one appeared to be the most promising from the various reviews on the Net. So I went ahead and ordered one on Amazon. It arrived well in time and was well packed. About the product, I think it is pretty good by itself. Here are my observations,    What you will like  ***************    -- Pretty ergonomic in terms of the grip.  -- Sound is not as loud as some people say it is. Most trimmers and electric razors make similar or even higher noise in my opinion.  -- It does not grasp a tuft of hair or pulls on it the way some people said it does. In fact it works pretty smooth. Ensure though to have dry beard when you run this trimmer.  -- Comes with different guides which makes it easy to find the one right for you.    What you will not like  *******************    -- It looks to me like the trimmer head is not made out of stainless steel. If you get it wet you may even have orange rust marks on it. My one seems to have come with one such blemish and it refuses to go away.  -- The guides are made out of pretty flimsy plastic. At least twice they fell off from the trimmer while in use because they do not grip the trimmer head very securely.  -- The base/stand is pretty useless in myopinion. It has lots of cuts and crevices but many can&#x27;t fit in any of the attachments provided in the pack. You will still be left with some attachments for which there is no space in the base.  -- The manual, if you can call that multiple folded pamphlet so, is pretty flimsy. A clear documentation on the usage of the equipment and the attachments is required but is sorely missing in the pack.    So there are no major deal breakers as such. All in all I will say it is a pretty nifty little device that comes cheap and works well once you get a hang of it.</li>
    <li> Had a previous model for MANY years.  This one seems just as good.  Nicer fit in your hand, lots of tools, including lubricating oil (which I never used on the old one).  Only complaint is that the adjustable head tool is a little hard to get on and off.  But I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Surprised how strong this trimmer runs. Also, I&#x27;ve had this months and have not had to change the battery. Still going strong. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This thing rocks! Got if for my boyfriend to trim his beard over 2 months ago and the battery still hasn&#x27;t died! Great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud. It&#x27;s pulled one hair. I still like it, I use it with confidence.after a year of use I upgraded and got a Phillips but went back to this $15 Wahl for a few weeks while I redid my upgrade to another Wahl.</li>
    <li> This is the third Wahl Groomsman I have purchased. The first was battery operated, and lasted 15 years. It worked fine until the on-off switch wore out. The second was a Wahl Groomsman rechargeable which I bought a few months ago. It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple of weeks, so I bought this Wahl 9906-717 Groomsman battery operated model. This one works as well as my first Wahl did, and the batteries last a long time. They have already lasted longer than a charge on the rechargeable model did. Both this one and the rechargeable model have the same exterior shell, and the attachments are identical. However, I believe the new battery operated Wahl Groomsman will last just as long as my first Wahl Groomsman. I would recommend only the battery operated model.</li>
    <li> I read the pinching reviews and have to say that I did experience some pinching with this trimmer, but not to the point where I yelled.  It is a cheap trimmer, but it works.  I have a thick beard and it mows through it with only slight tugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit thinner than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments feel a bit cheap, but, in case you haven&#x27;t picked up on a theme, work.</li>
    <li> Extremely loud. Doesnt lift my hair very well, making it difficult to make a very low cut even.</li>
    <li> i love this trimmer. It really works like the other people says it does and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> An excellent trimmer with all the needed attachments. Battery operated no need for an outlet. Great for travel and use anywhere, plus at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and was having a hard time finding. A no frills trimmer powered by AA batteries.</li>
    <li> perfect for beard &amp; moustache trimming.  Wish the edging gave better trim.  I have to use Remington Pg165 to achieve that</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  Great ergonomic shape, runs fast, and trims clean.  I reallly like the little pouch that&#x27;s included.</li>
    <li> - Stopped working after three uses. I switched the batteries and nothing happened. I applied oil like some other people mentioned and still nothing.     - Attachments are all made of cheap plastic.     - The 6-position guide trimmer slides between the various positions as you are shaving due to the cheap plastic construct.     - Wahl&#x27;s \\&quot;limited warranty\\&quot; on this product:    \\&quot;If your Wahl product fails to operate satisfactorily... Wahl will, at our option, repair or replace it and return it to you... [you are to] mail your product prepaid... [and] enclose a check or money order in the amount of $6.50.\\&quot;    In other words, you are to pay for shipping both ways and include a $6.50 fee, all of which will add up to more than the price of this product.     An overall excellent experience. Please not the sarcasm in that previous statement.</li>
    <li> I had my prior Wahl beard trimmers for years and finally they wore out. This set is a bit disappointing. The attachments are cheaply made. The #3 attachment snapped the first time I tried to remove it (Wahl did replace free of charge) and the clippersare too loud when using by your ears. Considered returning, but decided the price was right, so I&#x27;d try to live with them a while.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a non rechargeable trimmer, but now am glad I bought this one. It works like none other I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a few. It doesn&#x27;t pull, it doesn&#x27;t bog down, it just plain gets the job done, mustache side burns, eyebrows,light hair trimming, I think I could give full hair cuts with it. It comes with the usual plastic attachments but has one that is rather unique in that it is adjustable from 1 to 6, very useful. I have used it several times so far and had no battery drain problems that I could tell. So batteries are lasting.  Just one note, if you don&#x27;t use it very often do your self a favor and use the best batteries you can buy, to help ensure they don&#x27;t leak over time. It would be a shame to ruin such a nice tool because you forget to change or remove the batteries.  One more note, you may want to buy a small pouch to store it in as the cradle that comes with it for storage of the unit and attachments is pretty much useless. Bought a ladies makeup pouch on close out at that wall store, for a buck its just right, maybe even a bit big, but for a buck..........</li>
    <li> After 10 years, the Wahl trimmer I&#x27;d been using started to to give out on me.  Even with fresh batteries, its motor seemed to be going slower and slower.  I was pleased to see that Wahl still makes a model that uses AA batteries instead of built-in rechargeable ones.  This model is pretty much the modern equivalent of the one I was using for so many years.  I&#x27;d give it five stars, but for two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First is a rather minor thing:  it&#x27;s danged loud.  Obviously, that doesn&#x27;t affect performance, but it&#x27;s still a bit annoying, especially if someone is trying to sleep in the next room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second would be the guide combs. The guides fit on the blade differently than the ones on the trimmer I&#x27;d been using.  Unfortunately, my preferred beard/mustache length falls somewhere between two of the sizes.  When I attach the guide that seems to match the one I&#x27;d been using in the past, almost nothing gets trimmed, whereas putting on the next shorter one takes off far too much.  While the blades on both trimmers look identical, the guides from the older one don&#x27;t seat properly on the new one, so I can&#x27;t just use the old guides on the new trimmer.  As it is, I&#x27;m just trying to get used to a new beard length with the newer guide.</li>
    <li> I replace these every year because they wear out fast but this one is staying sharp halfway through the year and cuts nicely.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for another Wahl trimmer that broke after being dropped. This one offers several advantages:  1. It is very light weight and well balanced.  2. The cutting action is very smooth and clean.  3. It has a stand with several accessories.  4. It uses standard AA batteries (easily to replace) instead of a special size battery.</li>
    <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
    <li> Wahl Groomsman met and exceeded my expectations for my beard and mustache trimming need.</li>
    <li> So cheap, hurts your skin and does a choppy job. Batteries died after only about 30 minutes of use. Just threw it in the trash and decided we have to buy a different one.</li>
    <li> I had the older model for 10 years. This model is more ergonomic. Otherwise the same trimmer. Thank God. This trimmer does the job without fancy bells and whistles. If you want a dependable trimmer that takes inexpensive batteries (Mine lasted over 7 Months) then buy this trimmer. Just lube the head every Month with the provided oil and this trimmer will be the last one you own.</li>
    <li> Nice grip handle trimmer. Battery life is also solid. Can&#x27;t beat the price andvalie combo.</li>
    <li> It is really too loud to use on ears, and to have a separate clipper just for this purpose doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
    <li> Excellent low cost  mustache trimmer. I don&#x27;t have a beard so I don&#x27;t need the extra attachments that come with a lot of the trimmers. Highly recommended for moustaches, don&#x27;t know about beards.</li>
    <li> Small and efficient.  Works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for the last 13 years, and have gone through almost a dozen beard trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries typically die in less then a year (my fault, I don&#x27;t keep these things plugged into the wall all the time). Replacing the internal battery is always too expensive. The other parts usually work fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer solves the battery problem by allowing you to use your own batteries. This really extends the life of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use rechargeable NiMH batteries (which are less powerful then standard alkaline batteries), and the trimmer works fine. It&#x27;s powerful enough, and I don&#x27;t need to waste another set of alkalines.</li>
    <li> Forget about the fancy rechargeable trimmers. I&#x27;ve had a number of rechargeable trimmers &amp; razors from Norelco and it seems that they&#x27;re designed to self destruct in about 2 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Get yourself a replaceable battery trimmer like this one and you&#x27;ll be happier in the long run! Also, the cutting head/teeth are machined and not stamped like the Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great value for the money paid. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a really good trimmer as far as the way it cuts and battery life etc. But I used to use a conair trimmer that just felt better in the hand and was esier to get the results I wanted. This one is a little strange in the hand and the guides are really hard to use without getting a closer shave than you really want.</li>
    <li> Not much to say. This works well and didn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
    <li> After using this product I found that it was actually better than I expected.  At this time I must give it a four star rating.</li>
    <li> Works OK but is way too loud.  Battery cover is poorly designed.  It has to be inserted carefully and appears to be very fragile.  It is likely to break if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> After not being able to properly attach any of the guides and attempting to use this product once, it simply did not cut any hairs on my face.  And honestly, isn&#x27;t that the point?  Upon returning it to another brick &amp; mortar retailer the customer service rep said, \\&quot;Oh one of these, everyone returns them.\\&quot;  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> I have been using cordless/battery operated Wahl beard trimmers for years and years. The last one I bought was sturdy and lasted me nearly 13 years. I recently picked up a newer version in a local store and it was a piece of junk compared to previous models, especially the cheap flimsy blade attachments. As the blade was a different size, I couldn&#x27;t use the sturdier, older attachments on the new trimmer blade either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I returned that one and ordered this model from Amazon - which, based on the photos, looked like it was a bit sturdier (and perhaps a slighlty older model than is now available in retail stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is not quite as nice as my 13 year old Wahl trimmer, it is much better than any I could find in the local stores AND my old sturdy attachments fit his new trimmer body. (The attachments that came with this model are not as solid/easy to use as my older ones, but better than those that came with new one from the store.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you&#x27;ll need a new trimmer in the near future, I would recommend buying this while it is still available. Wahl should be ashamed of the new stuff it is producing (like most manufacturers these days).</li>
    <li> This item is not bad. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s really loud. I would say it&#x27;s definitely not something you use quietly. Everyone will know you are shaving in the household. But it is ergonomically designed and fits nice in my hands.</li>
    <li> It was brand new in the package. It came with all of the items shown above in the picture. Good value for the kit.</li>
    <li> Third one that we have.  Just like it should be.</li>
    <li> Just wanted something with actual batteries that can be replaced as needed.  I&#x27;ve had enough of the rechargeable kind where the batteries run out and you have to wait hours for them to recharge, then the rechargeable batteries die and you have to replace the whole thing.  This works great.</li>
    <li> Makes a little more noise than I expected but it is good overall</li>
    <li> this is a very good option over plugin rechargeable trimmers I have both and this one you can change the battery if they go bad and I am speaking of rechargeable of course,I like the style of this it fits your hand very comfortably it seems no matter how you hold it so this for me was a good choice well worth the money</li>
    <li> no power.  does not cut well</li>
    <li> all items met or exceeded expectations</li>
    <li> The Trimmer works fine but the various sizing attachments are cumbersome and even potentially dangerous to attach. The tabletop holder is neat and looks nice beside other bathroom accessories.</li>
    <li> I read countless reviews on beard trimmers and settled on this one. For such a low price this product does a remarkably good job. My first time using it, I  started at position # 6. Finally, I settled on position number 1 (shorter beard). I use it every Sunday and when I go to work every Monday I look and feel well-groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to point out. When I installed the batteries I thought the unit had a manufacturing defect. It \\&quot;appears\\&quot; that the second battery does not seat itself well in the battery compartment. Don&#x27;t be concerned though, the battery cover will fit right back on as it should and the product works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for about 2 months now and am very pleased. I&#x27;m also very happy I did not spend more on a \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; trimmer. I cannot imagine any of them working any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> the product isok i have no compalint with this item. good purchase</li>
    <li> The motor works well.  The blade guard is almost impossible to put in place and if lucky enough to get it on, almost impossible to get off.  The 7 trim guide does not fit on the head of the trimmer.  Why does a manufacturer put out a product without attention to these \\&quot;minor\\&quot; details.</li>
    <li> great product will buy again</li>
    <li> Works well with a lot of power for the size.  Quite a few accessories.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> this product really nice batteries seem to last awhile and i shave once a week have had it over yr i believe. good prices quality item.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this trimmer.  It arrived with several of the cutting teeth broken off which resulted in a painful trim as it attempted to rip hair where the broken teeth were rather than cut it.    It is also very loud, and the multi-height trim guard makes it very hard to get a consistent trim height.    As other people have noted before, it is also very hard to get the trim heads on or off.  I&#x27;ve gone back to the simple Philips Norelco G370 since I like their multi-height trim head much better.  On the bright side amazon refunded my money without even making me send it back.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wahl Trimmer (different model) for quite some time now ... but the in-built battery died forcing me to purchase a new one. This 9906 model comes with external batteries hence is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the performance of this trimmer ... powerful, sleek and no tension of in-built battery running out.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> i have used quite a few different trimmers, some pricey, some cheap.  this is the one i keep coming back to.  by far the best most consistent trimmer i have owned</li>
    <li> This thing has very sharp edges. It cut my skin during use and I dont use anymore. Too bad, cause it is so small and handy.</li>
    <li> It worked well for many years. Never took care of it, oiled it that is. And one day it seized on me. Not as versatile as the net product I bought but a good one.</li>
    <li> I owned a Wahl similar to this one for quite a while.  When it finally trimmed it&#x27;s last trim I decided to keep with the same and brought this one which works just as well.  Why change a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave four stars because it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Ok razor for the price, not as sharp though.</li>
    <li> I have an older version of this that takes 3 batteries. It is probably 20 years old and very tired.  So I thought that I would replace it.  The new Wahl lasted for about 15 uses. I only use it 2 or 3 times a month.  It worked well when it worked.</li>
    <li> Has all the tools you will need included. Nice little storage stand included. Keeps everything in its place. Getting one for my son too.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for over 6 years now.  It has been absolutely flawless.  I had my doubts about it at first because the attachments and stand seemed cheap.  However, I have used this Wahl daily for all these years without a single problem or broken part.  I am only now in the market for another trimmer because I want to keep this one as my dedicated travel trimmer.  I will buy Wahl again for sure.  The recharger even still holds 8 to 10 days!  Best $15.00 I ever spent!</li>
    <li> Simple easy to use low cost compact size adequate attachments&lt;br /&gt;Does the basic job I was expecting&lt;br /&gt;If a low end device is all you require this should be considered</li>
    <li> Got it for my boyfriend, he&#x27;s been using it non-stop since Christmas</li>
    <li> just exactly what my husband wanted</li>
    <li> Perfect !!!  The old one burned out afetr 15 years, so I bought a NEW one !!!  I was surprised the old one lasted double its life time !!!</li>
    <li> This purchase was to replace one just like it that I had for many years.  I dropped my old one and damaged the head.  I liked it so much I wanted another one just like it and found it on Amazon.  This is a great product and you will love it. The new model has a trim attachment that is different from the old one and it takes a few minutes to learn how to attach it and us it but once you figure it out you will love it.  Happy cutting.  Bill</li>
    <li> This replaced a Groomsman I have been using for 20 years. I gave my old one to my son.</li>
    <li> Great price! Don&#x27;t waste your money on those fancy, schmancy trimmers when you can get this one that works even beter.</li>
    <li> Cuts great- I am happy overall- blades are difficult to adjust - but I guess that means that they stay in place better...</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  The plastic accoutrements that attach are pretty stiff, and I wonder how long they will last, as I take them off and put them on repeatedly.  But hey, now that I have my trimmer, I&#x27;m a good bit handsomer, and my visage is no longer that of a big old lion.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great but I can&#x27;t say the same for the attachments and stand.  I have parts of the stand left over and no idea what they are for.</li>
    <li> Works good, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, easy to use. The finishing of the plastic body is a bit crude but that doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the trimmer. Works on 2 AA batteries so no need to worry about electric points, cord lengths, recharging etc. Very convenient. no complaints.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He had been asking for one for awhile, and for the price I don&#x27;t know why I kept putting it off. For 13 bucks, it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He comes and goes with having a beard, but the last couple of months he has really been sticking with it. He said this trimmer works great, aside from sometimes shooting little hairs into his eyes, which was the only downside he could find. It comes with a couple little accessories including a stand and oil to keep it running well. He did mention that he&#x27;s never needed to stop to clean it out, like you sometimes have to do with the big trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it when I&#x27;m giving him a haircut, it&#x27;s really great for around the ears and the back of the neck. Around the ear is a spot I&#x27;ve struggled with(hold the ear down, get a good angle, get the large trimmers to maneuver that spot, etc etc) and now I can do it without having him hold his ear out of the way and in the process, having his hand in my way. Also, and this is a huge plus!: he no longer worries about me chopping one of his ears off...which I got a large chunk once when using scissors. oops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall was that it&#x27;s battery operated. I don&#x27;t like tossing batteries in the garbage because it&#x27;s both toxic and expensive, but if you get rechargables for this, you&#x27;re all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely a great buy at a great price. I hope they last forever!</li>
    <li> I have an older blue Wahl Groomsman trimmer that cost me the same price as this one. It takes 3 AA batteries but I only use two and I haven&#x27;t oiled it after 4 years until today. What can you say for a product that costs under 15.00 and gets abused (I travel everywhere, this thing is abused), but keeps working great? I say it&#x27;s a great product, glad I got a cheap one, couldn&#x27;t see what a more expensive one would do better.</li>
    <li> Its a little noisy, but it cuts well and its easy to handle in odd positions. The parts storage device could be better.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t run on NiMH rechargable batteries (I use Eneloop, awesome batteries). Drains even quality alkalines really fast (I can get like two sessions out of a set, whereas my Braun Pocketgo shaver will last for a couple months and runs fine with my Eneloops). Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power. I got a haircut the other day and I don&#x27;t know what brand of trimmer they used but it was about the same size, battery operated and it was an amazing difference. This piece doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> not all AA battries will fit in it</li>
    <li> Worked nicely for the last 2 years.  In the last couple of months, the motor didn&#x27;t turn on. If I took the blades off, I could get the motor to start again by moving the very small metal dowel-looking pin that sticks out from the motor and makes the blades move. It was annoying to do this every time I wanted to shave, but it  worked for a few weeks and the motor was running strong once I got it started. Now the motor won&#x27;t start at all.    I&#x27;m thinking of buying the same model again (even though it seems to be made cheaply) because:    1) I don&#x27;t have any confidence from reading other reviews that the more expensive models will last any longer or much longer.  2) For the price ($15 on Amazon), lasting 2 years comes out to less than $1 a month.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this as I&#x27;ve bought it before at Walgreen&#x27;s (twice) and both times it did not work.  However, the product I received from this shipper has worked perfectly!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these trimmers daily now for 4 or 5 months and love them!  Gone through only 1 set of batteries so far, they clean easily (really can just blow them clean).  Excellent buy!</li>
    <li> I love this little trimmer! I now have two because I lost the attachments for the first one and rather then trying to track down replacements I just purchased another trimmer. The first one is over two years old and still works great!!</li>
    <li> I recently bought a Remington trimmer from Longs Drugs that is just crap.  It pulls the hair so I&#x27;m going back to the Wahl.  I had an older version, but the battery door broke.  The Remington looked better but is just really badly made.  So if you are looking for a really basic trimmer, this is your ticket.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, has a lot of accesories for a very low price, and even include batteries!! Sincerely i wasn&#x27;t expected much about this product but at the end it overpassed my expectations. highly recommended :D</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised, very quick shipping.  Would buy from this seller again.  Have used cordless groomers before and this one is nice, very light weight and easy to use.  All the accessories it came with are very nice, didn&#x27;t expect it to be so fully accessorized for the price, an excellent value.  Trimming is very smooth, no hair pulling etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is one knock on this design, it is the exposed metal plate on the bottom trimming blade.  It gets quite hot pretty quickly, presumably from the friction between the oscillating blades.  Have used cordless trimmers like this in the past where the metal is not exposed, only the cutting teeth, and they seem to stay cooler when the device touches the skin.  If you can keep that exposed metal off your skin this is a very nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a good unit and better than the slightly cheaper one that wmart carries.  This will serve for years if taken care of (cleaned, etc.)  Great set of attachments.  Make a great gift for a young man who is growing it out.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  Very durable, but light to handle.  Blades appear to be staying sharp as well.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product as it worked well and came with a great amount of accessories. Unfortunately one day I tried to switch it on and nothing happened. It just wont work anymore.</li>
    <li> The Trimmer has done it&#x27;s job. I actually thought this was a body shaver. but it&#x27;s just a facial hair trimmer. Either way, it did the job I needed it to do which wasn&#x27;t a beard but other \\&quot;area&#x27;s of concern\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a great trimmer and i&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this trimmer got so many 5-star reviews, because it&#x27;s performance is sub-par and it feels very, VERY cheap. It pulls hair all the time, takes a lot of passes to make an even-looking trim due to narrow size and crappy plastic adjustment heads. The only reason it got a second star is because it is only $15, and I guess one has to adjust expectations accordingly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this on my balls, but it works quite nicely on my beard. The motor is pretty powerful despite its reliance on AA batteries. The sound is a little loud, but my neighbors on the bathroom side of my apartment are A-holes, anyway. I mean, I guess they are friendly enough, but they cook up this strange smelling, spicy food a few times a week. I also have reason to believe that they may engage in genital mutilation, but that&#x27;s a whole other story. Buy this trimmer!</li>
    <li> The trimmer guards work poorly by design unless you like your beard/goatee very short.  It all depends on the angle at which you hold the thing.  Mess up and you chop your hair off close, regardless of the alleged guard length.  I am returning this product.  Too bad, nice quality otherwise.  Just need a better guard design.</li>
    <li> IT S WHAT I SPECTED. GOOD!</li>
    <li> This is actually the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought. The first was taken to college by his brother. I guess the fad (20 yr olds) is to shave but without shaving too close.&lt;br /&gt;The teenager likes to make designs in his chest and stomach hair. Also the small size is great on smaller faces.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it runs on batteries is also appealing, more portable.</li>
    <li> I got two of them for my grandsons and I really liked the looks of them. They both were well please with them.</li>
    <li> I had a similar Wahl (an older model) which I liked REAL well, so when it wore out I bought the newer (and cheaper) version. This one is powered by 2 AA batteries, and seems to work much better.  I am VERY happy with it.</li>
    <li> now that i&#x27;ve used this for some time, I can say that it works very well ... the batteries last longer in this unit than my last one did ... it does what i want it to do and has been very reliable ... changing out the dead batteries is very easy</li>
    <li> Works fine. Looks more fragile than the one that has rechargeable batteries. I hope it lasts, because the other one has been serving me since 2011.</li>
    <li> No problem, the merchandise was as described and shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> I had my Wahl 5537-1801 for 2 years and it served me well, so I thought it was time for an upgrade (I didn&#x27;t stop working, I just thought a new one was in order.)  So I bought this Wahl 9906, figuring since it was newer it would be just as good or a little better.  It was not.  Since I got this trimmer it always pulls on my beard, no matter how much I oil it or take care of it.  My previous Wahl was just as cheap but worked 10x better.  I let my beard get a little longer than most before trimming (laziness) but the Wahl 5537 never had any trouble with trimming a longer beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR-So if you let your beard get long before trimming, go with the Wahl 5537 instead ([...]  It&#x27;s just as cheap and wont pull on your hair.</li>
    <li> I think i paid $10... it works, but it&#x27;s pretty cheaply made.  I don&#x27;t think the trimming features work very well either</li>
    <li> This product was returned because of shoddy construction,e.g., recommended batteries wouldn&#x27;t fit, handle cover came off repeatedly and could not be closed.</li>
    <li> I go through trimmers like crap goes through a goose. Hands down this is the best trimmer I have ever used. Great power for thick beards, batteries last, and the price is incredible.</li>
    <li> My husband got this as a gift for Christmas.  He seems to be happy with it.  Good for mustaches, beards and sideburns.</li>
    <li> amazing that amazon can deliver overnight.  yes, item does not seem as well-built as the wahl i am replacing, and the accessories are made out of a more pliable plastic, but it does the job, and for the price i cannot complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the best part is still having it delivered to my door 14 hours after placing the order.</li>
    <li> I like getting those razors that can really be used for anything and this is a one of a kind. it has good speed when cutting and if your like me a worker in a grocery store where you have to shave like every 2 or 3 days this is a great shaver at a great price. it shipped here pretty fast too.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an old Con Air that finally bit the dust.  I really like it and does a good job.  Only draw back is that it is a little loud.  I highly recommend as it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my fianc&amp;eacute; a couple of years ago. It&#x27;s still going strong. It came on time, and faster than I thought it would since I ordered it so close to Christmas time! My fianc&amp;eacute; loves it, and I&#x27;m happy that he does!:)</li>
    <li> Works okay, but they&#x27;re SO SO LOUD.  I know I read that in some of the other reviews, but I guess I just didn&#x27;t realize how LOUD they would actually be.  Imagine using a handheld mixer to cut your hair.  Or a blender.  Or something equally loud.  They do the job, but man, the noise is obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, we bought these for trimming my husbands neckline and sideburns when I cut his hair.  I had a hard time finding a lot of reviews that said whether or not these (and other options) could be used for that.  They can!  Just expect that they&#x27;re going to be LOUD.</li>
    <li> Use it every other day to trim my beard.  Luv it</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It was inexpensive, cuts like crazy and uses cheap batteries that I haven&#x27;t had to replace yet, there are enough attachments but I only use one attachment once a week and it keeps my beard looking just how I like it. Ok, for you nit-pickers...it&#x27;s a little noisy. So what.</li>
    <li> This little battery trimmer is engineered to do one thing....trim hair.  This is no small task apparently, as a lot of trimmers are way over engineered, offer too many attachments, functions and cost a lot more.  This is a replacement for one that finally died, but only after 5 or 6 years of quality service.  Battery power, always ready, no charge base to content with.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself, is excellent. It is the stand, that I have a problem with. One would think that the stand would hold all the attachments, but, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be true.&lt;br /&gt;But, aside from that, I have been very happy with the performance of this groomer. It IS a bit on the noisy side, but, I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD recommend this to people, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model to trim my beard and moustache for decades, replacing it every five years or so.  It&#x27;s reliable and easy to use, and the AA batteries make it very convenient.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily because it did not have a rechargeable battery, but rather it uses one time use batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device I had in the past that had a non-removable rechargeable battery and it seems to not hold a charge very long. It seemed to always be discharged when I wanted to use it and took 8 hours to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit seems to hold a charge for numerous weeks/months and when it really is discharged, I simply put in a new battery .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my Wahl so far.  The attachments work great.  I&#x27;m not sure how long battery life will be, but for the price, I can&#x27;t imagine finding a better product.</li>
    <li> Great cheap trimmer for those on a budget</li>
    <li> I have a classic beard that I keep clean around my neck and cheeks and I keep trimmed moderately short.  I bought this thinking it would be a little more useful than it turned out to be.  I tried using it to keep my beard length what I wanted but it&#x27;s not very powerful or efficient and the blades are not variable enough to get the length that I want.  I do much better  using a plug-in trimmer intended for cutting hair than this specialized tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use it bare, without any attachments, for one purpose only: trimming the hair around the corners of my mouth so they don&#x27;t poke and bug me.  For that purpose it works reasonably well.  It was cheap so I don&#x27;t particularly regret it, but it definitely did not live up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It eats battery really fast.  I think it eats it while it is sitting around as well as while it is being used because it really runs through them fast.  Not worth it to take it apart and get the battery out after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Not very powerful.  It gets hung up on thick hair pretty easily.  It&#x27;s nothing to a plug-in shaver like the one I currently use for most of my trimming needs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Shoots hair at your eyes.  I have a hard time explaining why, but when I use this on my beard it somehow shoots the hairs straight into my eyes.  I have tried using a bunch of different techniques but somehow hair is always flicked into my face.  I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if it didn&#x27;t happen to me every time I use this.  Don&#x27;t ask me what the underlying cause is.</li>
    <li> Been using these for many years. They are inexpensive, last a long time on a set of AA batteries, and do a good job. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice little trimmer for the money wish it wasn&#x27;t battery operated seems to do a good job will do the job for now</li>
    <li> This is my second battery operated Wahl trimmer....had the first one for 10 years! I trim my beard every week and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t need to remember to plug it in to recharge it....if it&#x27;s dead, just throw a couple of new batteries in it. Don&#x27;t need to wait an hour for it to charge. It&#x27;s a great little trimmer!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer.  I bought this about 5 years ago.  The old one still works to this day.  I recently happened to lose a lot of the parts that come with it, out here in the Iraqi desert.  So, I needed to replace it and went with the same model I got 5 years ago. I&#x27;d buy this again 5 years from now.  Thank you so much for keeping this product around.  This product definitely keeps me with in Army hair standards!</li>
    <li> When I first thought about purchasing this trimmer, I had my doubts about how well it would work.  After a month of usage, I can tell you that I am very pleased with its size and performance.  It is a great value for a very reasonable price and I recommend it to anyone who is struggling with keeping their facial hair in good order.  Shipping was very prompt.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer was received right on time.  It is just as portrayed on line.  My husband is very happy with it.  It works beautifully.  We would recommend it to anyone looking for a good servicable trimmer.</li>
    <li> Still going after 8 years and one battery change.&lt;br /&gt;Good for occasional use.  If you need to use daily, get a better Whal model.</li>
    <li> Great battery life. Also very good for the hairline. Clipper guards workbforvall lengths of a beard. Battery life is very good on 2 AA which came with clipper.</li>
    <li> This product is small and easy to handle, serves the purpose. Does not look and feel cheaply constructed like other shavers. Attachments fit well.</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used, hands down. Much better than Conair whose rechargeable batteries lose their punch and can&#x27;t be replaced like the 2 AA in this one. And the price? A winner at $10 bucks.</li>
    <li> Great value for what it is. Batteries seem to last forever. You just have to keep it oiled so it doesn&#x27;t rust over. I dropped it once and it stopped working. I banged it a couple times and it started working again. Not bad.</li>
    <li> Ever since I bought this I have never used a razor. This is the best grooming set I have ever used. You get several sizes so you can get your perfect shave. And for the price it is a great deal.</li>
    <li> My wife got me this beard trimmer for my birthday keeping in mind that I had previously gone through about three or four other brands that were just absolutely terrible. I prefer to maintain a constant five-o-clock shadow and every trimmer I had tried gave me a patchy, unsightly beard, the acquisition of which required immense pain and hair tugging. This one was my last hope as far as affordable beard trimmers were concerned. The Wahl Groomsman is indeed a superior product. Remarkably inexpensive, the Groomsman provides a clean and painless shave. The trimmer includes a number of attachable lengths which afford the user endless styling options. The trimmer allows me to easily maintain a clean and attractive five-o-clock shadow. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product-it&#x27;s exponentially more effective and useful than most of the more expensive brands and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT RECOMMEND this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really irritated my skin. My face was red then had a burning sensation on my skin for hours after using this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the other Wahl battery operated trimmer and it&#x27;s really good. This one is really skin-irritating for some reason.</li>
    <li> Sales and service were excellent, product also excellent..</li>
    <li> thought it was a plug in rechargeable</li>
    <li> For the money its ok wish I would have bought a better one but again for the money it is what it is</li>
    <li> been using Wahl ever since I grew a beard (1979).  Bought this one simply for the price. I&#x27;ve only used the adjustable guide, and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Great gift. Works great. Has many uses. Would buy it for my Dad. Also a great price. The reviews. on this product were helpful in my purchase.</li>
    <li> Wear ear plugs, seriously, no I really mean it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Not the best trimmers I&#x27;ve had, but for the price, they&#x27;re pretty darn good!</li>
    <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this.  Plenty of attachments to cover a wide array of beard lengths. Cuts cleanly. I prefer a groomer that used regular batteries, as these fade more slowly and give you some warning as to when the batteries are kaput. With the rechargeables, I seem to get about 15 seconds of notice.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a trip, and it was an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> It probably works great for the intended purpose to trim beards.  I use it to trim long-ish sideburns and mustaches - hard to get an even cut, changes radically with the angle.  Probably not right tool for this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll probably always prefer a battery operated device vs rechargeable only for the sake of knowing I can always get full strength. There&#x27;s lots of nice attachments, my 1 caveat would be to be careful with the amount of pressure you use against your skin because the adjustable head can pop off wreaking havoc on your facial hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Just what I needed to strim beard and stray hairs.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money. Works for my needs at much less than other units.</li>
    <li> I never rate this low on anything unless it&#x27;s absolute garbage and that&#x27;s what this product is. It looked solid, but every single pass I made with it pulled my hair out. I tried everything I could, slow passes, short passes, it just yanks the hair right out. I only one complete time, I couldn&#x27;t complete a second shave it was just too torturous, and ended up just using my razor instead. I ended up growing a beard because I feared using that thing again, finally just gave up on it and am going to purchase another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good at all.</li>
    <li> The switch only worked intermittently and the rechargeable batteries lasted one day.  How much worse can it get?  I will try Philips next.</li>
    <li> The head is too narrow. It is easy on batteries and cuts very well. I had a battery powered one that was perfect and it lasted 7 years but it is no longer available. This one is a fair replacement</li>
    <li> It works, but not as well as the older model.  I bought this to replace the same trimmer that died after years of faithful service.  The new model is nowhere near as good.  The edge of the blade seems rough and is very uncomfortable to use; the old one was much smoother more comfortable to use.  In addition, the old one cut MUCH better than the new model.  I will probably be buying something else soon.</li>
    <li> good quality it works great.</li>
    <li> Very easy to maneuver to trim  beard but does not have adjustable head to thin the beard hair.</li>
    <li> Works, but it is very loud, even with oil.</li>
    <li> The guards aren&#x27;t that great and it doesn&#x27;t do well with thick beards. It&#x27;s just not that powerful. It works well enough w/o the guards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible trimmer, it actually allows for a very good beard trimming, comes with 1 set of AA batteries and has a noticeably powerful little motor. Overall, however, the product does need a few tweaks:    Attachments are a HUGE pain in the a** to get on correctly. I cut my thumb trying to \\&quot;simply slide (trimming guide) at a slight angle and press the release tab down to secure in position\\&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t wrenching it on or anything; it&#x27;s just that the trimming head/attachment assembly isn&#x27;t really designed as well as some higher-end groomer models are. After 20 minutes it got quite frustrating attempting to \\&quot;simply\\&quot; attach a thing unsuccessfully for the umpteenth time. The pieces don&#x27;t slide in/on so easily, you have to really gorilla them in. I&#x27;m afraid of cutting myself again and/or wearing out the plastic attachment bits prematurely due to this. Again, it is what it&#x27;s worth; I paid around $15.00 for mine.     The storage base was evidently an afterthought and not really meant to keep everything secure. Flimsy and somewhat mismatched with the units attachments (there&#x27;s a groove on one side of the base where I don&#x27;t know what is supposed to go), Wahl would have been better off with nixing the storage base and throwing in a vinyl zippered case instead. Probably would&#x27;ve been more cost-effective for them to boot.    The instruction manual is one sheet of thrice folded-over text with black and white renderings of unit&#x27;s assembly and trimming techniques. An actual booklet (pages turn) with color photographs would have improved things drastically.  All in all not bad, not great, about $15 bucks sounds right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two months now and like it.  I use the adjustable head for trimming eye brows and underarm/chest hair.  I use one of the fixed heads for a daily \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; beard look.  The shaver itself feels very solid but not too heavy.  It&#x27;s not overly loud, and seems to cut as well as if not better than other units I&#x27;ve tried in that price range.  If you&#x27;re expecting something like a professional would have, then be prepared to pay professional prices.    PROS:  Great for the price (I&#x27;d pay $30+ for one if I had to)  Shaver seems like a solid, quality unit  Trim guides for a wide range of cut lengths  Batteries so far have 2 months of daily use and still going strong  Comes with head lube for longer blade life    CONS:  Trim guides seem like they&#x27;ll break easily (but haven&#x27;t yet)  Trim guides changing can be tricky (READ THE DIRECTIONS)  No travel case  Stand works great until you bump it - accessories aren&#x27;t secure    I&#x27;ve struggled to take the guides on and off many times and have yet to break one.  When I first got the unit, I fumbled with them for a while, but once I actually read the directions, I could change them pretty easily.    Wahl&#x27;s comsumer products are not US made, but they are still headquartered in Sterling, Illinois and still produce their professional line in the US.  These days it&#x27;s as close as you&#x27;re going to get to supporting American manufacturing.</li>
    <li> This product works fine and I like it.  The person I give it to as a gift also loves it.  Trims and grooms really well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace and old one I had for 10 years that finally konked out.  This has lot&#x27;s of extras and works great.&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick beard and mustache and this glides through with no problems.  I would highly recommend for others.</li>
    <li> The unit works great.............Here is one thing that amazes me about&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime............This was delivered to me by USPS on a Sunday !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing....!</li>
    <li> The trimmer is great. Good balance, cuts well. The stand, though is a joke- the trimmer fits, but the accessories- no way. The stand on their previous model was inconvenient, but this one is nearly useless.</li>
    <li> I had owned a &amp;#34;Wahl model 9900&amp;#34; for many years, which gave me great service until I dropped it and the case broke.  So, why not purchased another &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; since I had such good luck with the last one .  This model does a great job also!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not anything special at all. I am not impressed by the rate in which it rusted. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> works well. even came with batteries.</li>
    <li> This replaced a two other units.  I use it with eneloop rechargeable batteries and take it on all of my trips to trim mustache and beard.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of maintenance.  I just put in newly charged batteries and press-on.  This is a great trimmer!</li>
    <li> Total garbage. I used this shaver for less than a minute before it was in the trash.I had to finish with my old broken norelco, lucky I saved it. This shaver is ultra cheap. If u get it near you&#x27;re ear it is deafening, it just chews on hair pulling out many in the attempt to clip a few. Not even a one time use.</li>
    <li> Works very very well!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my boyfriend. He couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. He loves it. It works great! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have had several Wahl products and have always liked them. However this one is disappointing. I received this for a Christmas and used it for about a month. I have a light beard and mustache with side burns. My last Wahl could clean up my beard quickly and neatly. The blades on this give an uneven cut, leaving stray hairs that you have to clean up with scissors. If my beard is  damp it gets much worse and within a day or two it looks scraggly. The enclosed batteries are already dead after one month. My beard is about as easy as it gets when it comes to trimming and if this model wont work on mine, then I don&#x27;t think it will do well on others.</li>
    <li> Have had mine for over a year. AA batteries last a number of uses.  Great for neck trimming, and beard.</li>
    <li> Managed to dunk it in water while it was running and it still works fine.  The stand is stupidly designed and doesn&#x27;t hold all the attachments shipped with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Five stars for this item, my husband loves it and has&lt;br /&gt;been using it for over a year now and it still works just&lt;br /&gt;like it did the first day we got it and it keeps it charge.&lt;br /&gt;recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old trimmer with this one. 2 years later, it&#x27;s still working great. I trim once a week, a pair of AA batteries last about a year. Just clean and lubricate now and then, it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use all the attachments too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver, and at the price it works awesomely, except for the fact that it scratch your skin preety bad. My face hurts for at least half a day after using it but other than that. It works great!</li>
    <li> Fr the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!  Does a great job and comes with it&#x27;s own batteries.  Haven&#x27;t changed them yet.</li>
    <li> The blades get hot rather quickly even though I clean and oil after every use. The adjustable guard is cheap and does not lock very well resulting in bald spots if you are not extremely careful. Battery cover is lose after a couple of uses and it drains my rechargeable and lithium batteries like a GameGear. It is fairly loud for something so small. The logo rubbed off after I oiled it the other day.</li>
    <li> In the past, I would purchase cheap trimmers and discard them after a few months when they get dull and not function as well as they use to.  I found that it was more cost efficient for me to do this rather than buy an expensive trimmer that eventually degrades in performance after a while.  I bought this relatively cheap Wahl 9906-717 Groomsman with the intension of using it for about 6 months and discarding it after it loses its sharpness.    Fast forward two years later, and this little gadget is still going strong.  I use it every 2-3 days to trim my goatee.  It is as sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull hair (which is a sign that it&#x27;s time to throw out).  The motor is still fast and it performs just like the day I bought it.  I didn&#x27;t really keep up with the maintenance of oiling the blade, I probably did it around 3 times in 2 years.  I will continue to use this razor until it finally stops working and then buy the same model.</li>
    <li> I thought based on the other reviews that this trimmer would be effective though not a great trimmer. It cut well but was a real pain to change to  the adapters and it did not have a very wide blade. It did cut well  while the battery held up.</li>
    <li> I made a big mistake buying this item.  It worked the first time I used it, but after that I had to play with the batteries and on switch extensively to get it to turn on.  After one or two times it refused to turn on.  I even tried new batteries, but no help.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> Love this Trimmer!! It lasts a very long time and is aa battery operated better than rechargeable ones that cost much more.</li>
    <li> The on/off button started malfunctioning after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Horrible pile of crap. Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> Great tool for grooming any kind of facial hair the combs are good to help achieve that length you are looking for but that comb isn&#x27;t too much help I use my barber tapered comb anyway. I like the battery rather than the rechargeable because it seems they always take a dump long before the usefulness of the cutting blades do.</li>
    <li> Great quality, works very well, lots off options for attachments included, the stand is the best option.</li>
    <li> When I first received this item it worked perfectly and I was very happy. however, after two months it stopped working, and I figured the batteries had died. So I put in some new ones, however it still didn&#x27;t work. Now these batteries were never used before, but had been sitting in my house for a while and i figured they had just lost their juice. This prompted me to go to walmart and buy a brand new pack of name brand batteries. I put those bad boys in the trimmer... and nothing... still not working. I put the batteries in another device to see if they worked, and they powered that device just fine. So this trimmer apparently just stopped working after only two months of use, and I only used it every other day, and cleaned it right after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I might have just received a dud device, but the fact that mine died after two months, makes me think they are all soddy devices and would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Trim my beard once a week. This is the smallest trimmer I have ever had. And battery powered to boot. The jury is still out, but so far it seems to handle my closely trimmed whiskers. My last Wahl product lasted 5 years, but it was electric. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> It works well,  the only gripe is that its loud when running.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but works fine for my side burns.  I use it once a week and it keeps my side burns nice and close and tight.  It&#x27;s very loud and battery operated.</li>
    <li> It does a fine job.  Good value for the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for a several years (decade?). Even though there aren&#x27;t many size adjustments, the medium length is perfect for me and the blade configuration itself is the best you can get for tight detail work around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was looking to buy a different kind of product because I have been purchasing one or two of these every year, because the internal battery would go out and it couldn&#x27;t be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that these come with a replaceable AAA battery, it is a 5 star product for me.</li>
    <li> Quick shaves are quick and easy. No cons at all.</li>
    <li> The clippers feel cheap, with a flimsy plastic exterior. That said, I did an entire body trim and these things kept up without getting stuck. I wish there was a long hair extension that worked (the one provided is bizarre and not usable) for body hair, but for face trimming the 3 extensions are perfect -- essentially &amp;#34;short, shorter, and shortest.&amp;#34; You&#x27;ll get the length you want if you&#x27;re looking for permanent stubble, which I am.</li>
    <li> Everything it was advertised to be!</li>
    <li> Owned a Wahl Mustache Trimmer for many years. When it quit I looked for another one just like it and found this one for $10. This one is nicer than the one I had, works great &amp; I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this groomer to replace a similar Wahl groomer with rechargeable batteries that were no longer holding a charge.   Several months later, I&#x27;m still getting a nice \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; from the AA batteries that came with this groomer (I only trim my beard once a week, so your mileage may vary).  It comes with three fixed-length guards and an adjustable-length guard for fuller beards.</li>
    <li> For the past 2 years this has been the ONLY SHAVER I USE. My $200 shaver sits unused, I prefer to shave dry, as it&#x27;s easier to avoid creating ingrown hairs, but it can work on wet skin as well. I use NO SHAVING CREAM or gel. I do use MOISTURIZING SOAP (Dove Men+Care) and high quality MOISTURIZER (Clinique, the yellow $20 gel in the square pump bottle) after I wash. I hardly ever have ingrown hairs or acne anymore :) ------ My Original Review: Cheap plastic parts, noisy, but it get the job done for a good price</li>
    <li> +Powerful&lt;br /&gt;+Great price&lt;br /&gt;+Battery powered.&lt;br /&gt;-Noisey.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is sharp,Powerful and very inexpensive....I liked it so much i purchased one for my brother....Buy one,You will see what i mean!!!</li>
    <li> it replaced one I had, it&#x27;s A perfect item to add to the shaving kit, I leave mine on the bathroom vanity</li>
    <li> Works OK, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the power switch is a POS.  I can get it to work by holding the switch constantly, but for how long?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sharp, fast and does the job I want it to do.. I like it and I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, but works very well. It is easy to cut precisely, and unless the batteries are about to die, it always cuts quickly and easily. Requires two standard AA batteries. The only flaw is that the batteries don&#x27;t fit precisely in my unit--the battery compartment for one of the batteries is a tiny bit shorter than it should be. Still, both batteries can be placed so that they make good contact, and the battery compartment cover fits back on the unit. I&#x27;ve never had a problem using the unit because of the battery fit.</li>
    <li> It works well enough, but looks and feels pretty cheap for the price and for a good brand name like Wahl. Also, the trimmer attachments can be awkward to put on and take off.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my husband for Christmas.  He no longer has a beard.  It did not TRIM his beard and mustache.  It made his beard NON-EXISTENT, and he didn&#x27;t even dare to try it on the mustache.  It&#x27;s COLD here, and now he will definitely be COLDER STILL as he works outside all winter.  NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is easy to use, works fine, and comes with more attachments that the ad offers.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is simple but effective for all of your beard or goatee trimming needs.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer noted, this trimmer is too loud. I feel like it would damage my hearing if I continued using it. Also, one of the attachments broke the first day I received it.    Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Works well, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This was NOT it, this thing will not trim wet rice,thread, spider webs. And is like mentioned SCREAMING loud. Built cheap compared to my intended replacement,&#x27;The Performer&#x27;. From the same company, unbelievable. The good one has lasted for years, many, many, many uses it deserves the rest. This one they should quit selling, and for more money. Buy The Performer, MUCH better value. I am off to beg for an exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Edit:Follow-up 3/22/09 Finally, after 2-3 weeks I got a response to my repeated emails. Maybe Wahl will correct this. So far, Amazon has been WAY more upstanding, and willing to help.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have used one for years.  Prefer the batter operated model over the rechargeable.</li>
    <li> For a cheap little trimmer the thing works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly feels extremely cheap but it cuts the hair you want it to.</li>
    <li> nicely made, i was confused where to put the batteries at, cause im a man and i dont read the instructions. I had to get the instructions out to find out where the batteries went.. the black flap on the front... Trims nice, cuts easy, love the different attachments it has.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my teenage son. No chance of him cutting himself with a razon</li>
    <li> excellent price and a decent little machine.&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price&lt;br /&gt;this is my second or third one in 10 or so years&lt;br /&gt;the last one I blew up overseas forgetting about the current differences - oops!</li>
    <li> As you might know, when you purchase a beard trimmer that has a rechargeable battery, you will need to replace it about every two years. After about a couple of years the battery will lose its charge and you need to then toss the trimmer in the trash. I was looking for something different that I wouldn&#x27;t need to toss in the trash after a couple of years. I thought if I bought this battery operated one, then I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy another trimmer for several years, beyond the two year life span of a regular trimmer. I got this one in Feb of 2011 and just today the trimmer quit working. The motor started acting funny and changing speeds from normal to slow, and then completely stopped today. This trimmer did last about eight months though, but today it had to be tossed in the trash. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you are expected it to outlast a regular trimmer, or even a normal lasting trimmer for that matter. Don&#x27;t bother with the ones you need to put batteries in, just go out and purchase a rechargeable one that should last a couple of years. It is too bad, I was so excited to get this product and was thinking it would last a long time.</li>
    <li> Came on time and trimmed my beard. 13 more words are required for me to finish this review. 2 more.</li>
    <li> So far so.good , 100% working , no issues., received everything and I m.using it sonce one month so far</li>
    <li> Another confirmation that Wahl makes the best grooming products!  This product is powerful, small, durable, and MUCH better than other similar products that I have recently owned (and broken or trashed out of frustration).</li>
    <li> Was great when I had a beard, have no use for it now</li>
    <li> Works great was purchased for a Dr .office to shave chests for ekg</li>
    <li> nice product and shipping was fast.it does the job</li>
    <li> Made in China.&lt;br /&gt;Battery cover very hard to open, seems like it&#x27;s going to break trying. But batteries seem to last enough so it&#x27;s not like a daily issue.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, works well.&lt;br /&gt;Clean and lubricate every time for the next use or blades will go bad quickly. I&#x27;ve had several of these before and doing the cleaning and lubing they stay sharp at least a year, and I cut my whole hair weekly, (buzz cut) with it.</li>
    <li> Didnt give it 5 stars because it is loud</li>
    <li> Performs flawlessly. This trimmer is sturdy, well built, reliable, easy to use and runs for a surprisingly long time on standard batteries.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Very precise trimmer.</li>
    <li> Extremely loud.  My hair cutter used them for trimming, and they almost busted my eardrums.  Probably okay for trimming Hobbits feet.  That is about as close as my ears can stand with these.  Someone is gonna be a very lucky person come xmas.</li>
    <li> This trimmer carries a well-known name, but it is not what I expected. The various attachments are poorly designed, small and somewhat flimsy. They are small enough to go down the drain if you aren&#x27;t careful. The base should have storage for the attachments, and I guess you could say it does, but the small, oddly shaped little compartments simply don&#x27;t organize these little bits. The clipper itself seems ok and I wanted battery power, but I&#x27;m afraid I am going to return this clipper for another type.</li>
    <li> Batteries do not last very long but it does a good job.</li>
    <li> My husband hates this! He says the attachments are all wrong! IDK Just passing along his comment!</li>
    <li> I bought is at Walgreens about a month ago and it has caused me nothing but frustration. As everyone else has said, the attachments SUCK. The adjustable attachment slides to the wrong settings which makes for an inconsistent shave. The worst thing about this product though is that the teeth pull you hair and it hurts! I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s even designed to cut your hair or just rip it out. I seriously could not even complete a single stroke without it pulling my hair out. Do not buy this! I just threw mine in the garbage. I&#x27;d rather look unkempt than use it again.</li>
    <li> Received the trimmer installed batteries and nothing.  Tried another set of AA&#x27;s and got the same result.  Dead on arrival is not a way to endear a product to me.</li>
    <li> You really need a two battery unit to keep the juice flowing.  I switched over from Wahl&#x27;s one battery travel unit.  I do use rechargeable AA&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t like fixed rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> Pros: Great price, plenty of accessories, worked really well when it did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Was noticeably cheap when I opened up the packaging. Initially thought it was DOA but turned out it was just the batteries. After 3 weeks it died completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side the Amazon return/refund policy is awesome.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work worth a lick. The only good thing was it only cost $11 but its still a wasted $11</li>
    <li> it works pretty well.  couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  i use it to keep the &#x27;burns clean and level.  keep underarm hairs trim, and manscape.</li>
    <li> Does a terrific job of trimming and seems to be well constructed product regardless of cost. I have had good luck with Wahl products. This particular model allows for many trims before needing a battery change and it is easy to adjust your preference and have the consistent appearance you strive for. Easy maintenance as well!</li>
    <li> I tried several sets of batteries and could never get it to turn on. Nothing. Now I see why it was $10. No quality control.</li>
    <li> 1 st it was late by two days, but I did get it opened it up but the batteries would not fit in it I did get the batteries, in it but then it never worked. I would say spend more money and get a better and one that will work</li>
    <li> The batteries comes with this junk was very beneficial with my Panasonic trimmer, this junk arrived dead and never worked.&lt;br /&gt;The usable things was the oil and the batteries. pretty acceptable for anyone have another standby Panasonic trimmer.</li>
    <li> We ordered this to replace a unit that we have been using for years..it works as well as the one we were satisfied with</li>
    <li> SO I RECEIVE THE PACKAGE AND THE PACKAGING WAS OK BUT WHEN I PUT THE BATTERIES IN THE TRIMMER DID NOT TURN ON....... VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
    <li> Trimmer constantly pulls at my facial hair, it doesn&#x27;t cut very well and the guards are fairly cheap.</li>
    <li> My honey really liked this trimmer.  He just recently grew his goatee and was using scissors to trim it.  So I decided to by him this trimmer by Wahl.  Product works great and is easy to use.  I heard no complaints from him.</li>
    <li> A great trimmer at a dirt cheap price. I use this trimmer on my face without a guard for a tight stubble trim. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Had to return this. The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on this were quite uncomfortable and just felt cheap. Not for me</li>
    <li> Received this product and it was defective, would not turn on with multiple sets of batteries.  Returned it and got the model with a rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> This clipper sounds and feels cheap in your hand.  It&#x27;s made of thin plastic and is larger than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it has been holding up and performing the grooming tasks at hand.  It comes with a lot of accessories which I will never use. The battery life is better than I expected and the blades cut fairly well.  It is an acceptable purchase for the money and good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it feels cheap and mine is noisy, it does work well.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer.  There are plenty of attachments (more than any one person probably needs), but it works well.</li>
    <li> Good price for what it is</li>
    <li> it is very small. it work ok. i would have like to buy a larger blade to do more areas.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer long lasting battery charge</li>
    <li> I only wish it was made in the USA</li>
    <li> I like the Wahl beard trimmer because of the adjustability of the head. This is my third one and I keep coming back. I guess it goes without saying that they don&#x27;t last a long time, but for the price and quality it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
    <li> The slide adjustable length attachment is pretty good. I used to have the old rechargeable model until it died after 5 years</li>
    <li> Great product. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Use this on a recent cruise and it worked OK.</li>
    <li> Does a great job but is crazy loud!  Soooooo noisy!  There is no using this in the morning for my husband...unless he wants to wake up our kids and me!</li>
    <li> works fine cuts nice and quick delivery</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of assuming the battery operated was a rechargeable battery.  It runs on AA batteries which means you&#x27;ll get better trims using a wooden block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has virtually no &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to the blades which simply pulls instead of cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and got a $10 more expensive blade that has a rechargeable battery pack and has a higher blade rate allowing for a true cut.</li>
    <li> On time and as expected!</li>
    <li> This is a great battery operated trimmer for the price.  I like the fact that I do not have to pack a charging cord when traveling.  This product is not a high tech fancy model.  It works well and fits my mobile lifestyle.</li>
    <li> My husband used it once, no problem.  Second time it started really vibrating and sounded as if it was going to take off!  I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Been through some stuff with this little razor and it keeps on cutting! haven&#x27;t even replaced the batteries yet! Almost a year! :D</li>
    <li> I purchased this for shaping and it works very well.  I went ahead and bought a different one for trimming.  I like the weight and effectiveness.  I also like the size (narrow).  It makes it easy and quick to keep my beard in shape.</li>
    <li> great product use it all the time and love it. I would recommend it to everyone. great purchase and I was actually able to track the product to</li>
    <li> Yes, I should have read more carefully but who wants one of these where you have to buy and replace the batteries?  Get the one that recharges and also runs powered by the cord Wahl 9918-6171.  Went straight to the trash can, not worth paying return shipping.</li>
    <li> Like all Wahl trimmers I have used it works great and if like my others it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and for $10 it can&#x27;t be better. It did not come with a comb like the box said it should...haven&#x27;t gotten around to calling the company but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d send me one if I called. But it works great.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it works great.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product. It is very efficient, the price is very good and plus it was exactly as descirbed. This product deserves 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Works great. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> SO FAR SO GOOD, VERY ENERGETIC ON FULL BATTERIES.  I LIKE THAT I CAN JUST CHANGE THE BATTERIES IF ITS DEAD AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO RECHARGE IF DEAD.</li>
    <li> Not functional.  Poorly made plastic junk.</li>
    <li> 2nd one.. last one lasted over two years of daily use... good buy</li>
    <li> Simple, and easy to use. I like how small it is, and that it comes with a variety of guards. However, I had trouble trying to get the batteries in and to work the first time. I had to use a new pair of batteries, and even then, they didn&#x27;t pop in just right. But!! It works,  gets the job done, and doesn&#x27;t cost too much ;)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last quite a year before I had to send it back under warranty.</li>
    <li> it works great, and the 3 levels of cutting your beard is a nice plus. the only issue (and its a small one) is the levels/attachments are hard to get off. but thats a small price to pay for the small price i paid.</li>
    <li> This could be a great product or a not so great product, depending on how you intend to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very good at shaping and trimming without the guards. Shaves close and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not very good at trimming with the guards. First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have enough length settings, in my opinion (I often find myself wishing there was something BETWEEN 2 and 3) and the guards are easy to accidentally push to the next setting during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for something to do edging/shaping, you&#x27;ve got a good product. If you&#x27;re looking for trimming to even out length, I would recommend you keep looking.</li>
    <li> I use this little jewel to trim the bikini line. It works like a champ and is reasonably priced. I also like the fact that it is battery powered, no need to charge.</li>
    <li> Perfect for trimming beards, mustaches, and hair. It is compact, easy to use and suites my son&#x27;s needs just fine.</li>
    <li> EASY TO CLEAN &amp; EASY TO GROOM AS A WIRELESS TRIMMER.  I THINK THIS WILL LAST FOR A LONG TIME! &lt;br /&gt;                                              PETE</li>
    <li> Works smooth &amp; quiet with no cord to deal with either. The accessory stand is skimpy and lightweight and slides around easily.  The attachments fall out also...but, if you want a nice trimmer at a great price...pick this up!</li>
    <li> As per my son, too noisy, didn&#x27;t like it, electric would have been better. Took apart to change blade hard time putting it back together.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit primarily based on the reviews in Amazon.com.  The price was reasonable and I was replacing a previous unit that had simply worn out from years of use.  The only complaint that I have/had is that the clip that you slide on and that adjust up and down to adjust the length of the trim was difficult to get on and given it is plastic I fear will break some day.  So far has worked great but I worry that this part may break.  For 15 [...] or so I would recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> This seems to be more solid and well put together than some that cost more. Reliability, very good trimming, and long battery life,along with attachments for length make this an exceptional buy. It seems to be a little louder than some. We have used their dog grooming razors for years, and their customer service to be quick to respond.</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is good.  The only problem for me is that the attachments are very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> My husband is well pleased with this Wahl product.</li>
    <li> Much bette set up than the corded version whose charge stopped holding after about 2 years. I go this as a replacement to that trimmer. I this works just as well, and it portable because the AA batteries as the power source. All the guide combs allow for getting just the right length. The 3 fixed guide combs don&#x27;t fit anywhere on the stand so I have to keep a baggy for those. Not a big deal just a bit annoying. What did disappoint me was that the comb had very sharp teeth that scraped/cut my skin when I used it. I tried filing it down, but it still scraped and hurt. The plastic is stiffer than the comb from the kit I was replacing so I just got rid of this comb and used the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great beard trimmer, just don&#x27;t use the comb.</li>
    <li> GARBAGE !!  I tried to replace my ten year old Wahl trimmer after it fell on the floor and broke.  The old one had served me well.  Although the price of the new replacement was cheap,  the quality was cheaper.  Will not buy another Wahl product.</li>
    <li> This is my second of this model. I got this one so that if one of us travels, there is still one at home. It functions well (but not great) and is convenient to use. The head attachments on this newer one seem more cheaply made than the attachments on our older one - flimsier, thinner plastic and less precisely fitting. But it&#x27;s still a steal and does the job.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to someone , They enjoyed it .</li>
    <li> horrible quality, broke within 1 week of use. Blade is very fragile, you get what you pay for. would not recommend</li>
    <li> Its loud, gets hot really quickly and slows down when trimming. Maybe I got a defective one, but I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with the cordless battery powered Wahl 9906-717. It is light and does an excellent job in trimming.  I highly recommend this product; a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> solid purchase. i bought this item over 8 years ago and is still in working condition. very good quality as always with any wahl product. these battery operated ones are a lot better than the rechargeable ones they last longer.</li>
    <li> My hubby really liked this for his beard.</li>
    <li> Nice little gizmo..I had the rechargeable version but getting sick of all the wires and chargers nowadays. Had this product for about a month or so no issues Its what it says it is a basic beard trimmer and if you think of how long it really takes to trim the batteries should last for a long time..good for the price</li>
    <li> Everything it was claimed to be. Works great!</li>
    <li> Had purchased another brand of razor kit on Amazon. Was unable to contact anyone, FOUND THIS BEAUTY and WHAT A DEAL! The blades are ACTUALLY cut with precision, not STAMPED. Quick and clean trimming! My boyfriend loves it. Should have seen that face he gave me while he trimmed his side burns and such. FUNNY!</li>
    <li> the only bad thing about this is that it&#x27;s battery operated and only 2 size trimmers</li>
    <li> This is a very slim and easy to use product.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Installing batteries is a frustrating chore, because the compartment is too small, which also causes the lid to keep popping off. Also, the product was completely covered with smudge marks.</li>
    <li> Not real impressed with purchase, have to run over skin several times. I guess thats why it was cheap. Do not reccommend.</li>
    <li> No charging..no fuss.  wish it was a little quieter .  batteries last a long time.  attachments easy to use.  good value.</li>
    <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> This little Beard Trimmer far exceeded my expectations. I decided to grow a beard for the winter. Had never done that before......It started getting a bit unruly. So i decided to find an inexpensive trimmer. Well this trimmer is inexpensive, but it does everything I need it to do. It comes with enough attachments to trim everything. Even an adjustable guide that you can change without taking it off. Unless your last name is Robertson, and you shoot Ducks.....This is the trimmer for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he has not complained about it once. I am guessing that he has been satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> 8 years strong, I use it for beard and hair touch up level trimming.  Battery operated, its perfect than just using shears.  Its sharp and fast enough not to snag and pull hairs too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main Cons are:&lt;br /&gt;There is no clear place to store the accessories on the base&lt;br /&gt;The base is nearly useless except for standing the trimmer right side up&lt;br /&gt;Not powerful enough except for touch ups&lt;br /&gt;Cheap build quality, but it has lasted 8 years</li>
    <li> The Groomsman is sharp, handy, and modestly priced, albeit a bit fragile, particularly the extra comb heads and the cleaning brush.  Also, the various grooves in the base does not seem to hold the extra comb heads securely.  Anyway, the little Wahl seems to work for me just fine.</li>
    <li> Yes.Its working really good and i appreciate the packing.I little bulky,but still manageable.Worth purchasing.Till now after the purchase of 2 months i haven&#x27;y faced any issues.</li>
    <li> It does a fine job of trimming and has several attachments for beard length.  I would buy it again if necessary</li>
    <li> Easy to use, cheap, does its job. I have not found any of these things to be all that great, so CHEAP is key. I have paid 4 times this much and gotten no better quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the one I have has to be charged up and unless you keep it plugged in it would not work so I purchased battery operated one and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I love the attachments. Fine tooth blade gaurds are hard to find. I didn&#x27;t realize that this was battery operated. The unit doesn&#x27;t really work and I have found myself taking out the batteries every other use to make a solid connection. I just use the blade guards on my other corded Wahl unit.</li>
    <li> I have used this facial hair trimmer many times on one set of batteries - very impressed w/battery longevity, even w/generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t generally tend to use the black plastic attachments that make it just trim the hair off, I usually just go bare with the shaver blade right on my skin and it does a really good job for an electric shaver vs a straight razor, IMO, then again, I&#x27;ve always been happy w/Wahl products overall.</li>
    <li> Works great, even for those sensitive areas that need a trim...&lt;br /&gt;Hey guys, use it to groom the short hairs...&lt;br /&gt;:))</li>
    <li> This one cuts well, comes with a small tube of oil, is very comfortable to hold and use, and I really like that is is battery powered.&lt;br /&gt;The other unit I had came with a crappy nicad rechargable battery that would fail quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But the only real problem with this one is IT HAS A REALLY LOUD BUZZING SOUND!&lt;br /&gt;If I try to trim hair around my ears, it is crazy loud.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about it otherwise.</li>
    <li> Very Versatile trimmer that cuts more cleanly than more expensive rechargeale units I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;m going to stick with this from now on.</li>
    <li> This a good little trimmer for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable batteries would be nice but it seems to last pretty well since it isnlt used all that much.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is my second wahl trimmer. The first lasted right at 10 years. A fella has to stay with who makes the best. Wahl gets my vote 100%</li>
    <li> Works very well except closest setting is a little too long for me.  But like the fact I don&#x27;t have to worry about rechargeable battery quitting on me, like two of those type of shavers I have owned have done (won&#x27;t sustain a charge).</li>
    <li> Small battery powered unit. A little noisy, but who cares really. Cuts wells and has good attachments. Good for trimming around ears and neckline.</li>
    <li> Great price for such a nice item. Works wonderfully Best one I&#x27;ve ever had and teh price was also the best.</li>
    <li> Great! Affordable, well constructed, I don&#x27;t mind replacing it every 2 years because it&#x27;s so cheap. Travel pouch is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> The guards, where the piece locks onto the blade, are starting to break off. Its an ok razor other than that.</li>
    <li> I really like the product.&lt;br /&gt;Good transaction</li>
    <li> I have used this little trimmer extensively, and have found it to be excellent. I use it for little trims to clean up a bit around mustache.  I considered, but declined to buy other more expense, name-brand trimmers such as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer]] or&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 (Packaging May Vary)]] or&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008KEJ1LM Panasonic ER-GB40-S Cordless Moustache &amp; Beard Trimmer Wet/Dry with 19 Adjustable Settings]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried those other products, so it&#x27;s possible they are really excellent as well, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me worth it to pay twice as much for the name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ The trimmer is pretty light--being almost all plastic, but it fits well in my hand. Notice the little ergonomic raised portions on the case. Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Measured weight: 4 1/2 oz. Length: 6 1/2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ The sound is moderate--not quiet, but not loud. Sort of reminded me of being at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Attractive appearance, but of course, I didn&#x27;t buy it for how IT looks; I bought it to make ME look good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Cutting power is fine. It&#x27;s not going to win any power contests, but you just need a small motor for most trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Blades are plenty sharp. I&#x27;ve never tried to sharpen them (and not sure you can, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ The thing that surprised me the most is how long it stays charged.  I typically just use it for a few minutes at a time, so I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in; nevertheless, it still stays charged for many days. On those occasions when I do need to charge it up, it doesn&#x27;t take very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ I use the little rubber blade cover when I&#x27;m not using the trimmer. The cover has held up fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ I don&#x27;t find the stand convenient--nothing wrong with it, but just don&#x27;t want more clutter on the counter. So I typically just place the trimmer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product. Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[for the record, I do NOT work for the manufacturer, or have any relationship with them.]mer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product.

    <li> First experience purchasing a really bad product on Amazon. The blade fell out after just a few uses, and it was rusted!</li>
    <li> I searched around for something inexpensive to keep my beard in line and came across this item. I have had zero issues with this product and the attachments are useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone not looking to by and expensive beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed great price.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. Charged it once and haven&#x27;t had to charge again. Amazing quality and so inexpensive. Excellent product. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl beard trimmer for 12 years till I dropped it.  I purchased this to replace the one I broke.  The unit itself seems to work fine.  The attachment for the beard is very flimsy and I can see how it would be easy to break.  It goes on hard and you have to twist it to get it off.  Not sure how long it will last.  Fortunately I kept the beard attachment from the one I broke and it&#x27;s very well made.  It also works great on this unit.  Easy on easy off.  Not sure what they were thinking but then again it&#x27;s very inexpensive and it&#x27;s 12 years later.  New and improved???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning this for 2 months it quit working. It makes lots of noise and the blade is moving but it doesn&#x27;t cut anything.  Because you have to cut it out of the packaging you totally destroy the packaging for shipping back.  Thankfully it was cheap and you can just throw it away.. Really sorry I dropped my old one.  It would have still been&lt;br /&gt;working..  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto bello y hermoso lo recomiendo 100% es de muy buen material mucho listo sin novedades dloii cur</li>
    <li> My husband uses it weekly and says it works really well for him.  He has a full beard and moustache.</li>
    <li> Does everything the advertisements say it will do and seems to do them quite well.  Why not a 5 star rating?  The unit is extreeeeemely loud!  If you are going to buy this unit be sure you have some good ear plugs to wear when you use it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice little trimmer. My re-chargeable Remington trimmer broke (stupid engineering to use a cheesy plastic part in a highly stressed application) so I went to Wally World hoping to find a replacement. They had nothing under 20 bucks and many up to $60 or even more--lunacy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on to Amazon where I found this little guy for under 10 bucks shipped. Yes, it runs on two AA batteries (included!) but it seems just as powerful as the Remington and perhaps even more convenient as I only trim the beard once a week and often found the rechargeable Remington to be dead just when I wanted to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the adjustable beard guide to be a bit, what&#x27;s a good word--awkward I guess, so put on the long guide and went right to town on the beard. It works great--no pulling or other inconveniences. The inclusion of a stand (which I can&#x27;t use due to shelf-height limitations) is nice, as is the tube of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want a simple, convenient trimmer w/o useless bells and whistles, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> The Wahl beard trimmer was exactly as described. My husband uses it everyday. Easy to use, easy to store. A great little trimmer.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t work at all for my needs. I had another wahl battery operated trimmer that was very small that worked better than this but eventually stopped working. This barely worked for trimming my easy to trim dog hair day one. Haven&#x27;t used it on human hair, but it should have worked just like the other one.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shaver for the money.  OK, it&#x27;s a bit loud.  But it works as well as a cordless and the battery lasts an OK time.</li>
    <li> I could not get the trimmer to work. I tested the batteries in a flashlight thinking they might be dead. They work fine. I&#x27;m not sure how to return the product &amp; I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;d just like to get my money back on this one. I do not like returning things. Too much hassle &amp; time!</li>
    <li> The attachments were not manufactured well.  When placed on the trimmer, they are so tight, they are nearly impossible to get off.  I can&#x27;t remove them with my hand but have to pry them off.  And of course that means that I broke one as soon as I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly the entire trimmer is made of plastic, so I guess I don&#x27;t expect the rest of it will last long either.  I guess this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact model for about 5 years and it still works and cuts fine. Even if I had to replace it every 2 years I&#x27;d still buy it. It&#x27;s $10. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery operated is a HUGE plus. The batteries last a long time, and on the off chance they die, you can just put new ones in and not have to wait for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the noise is from the metal contact points. It comes with lube so be sure to use it as per the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only recently did I actually take the blade off to clean it. It was showing some light rust because I didn&#x27;t clean or oil it properly, but after some FrogLube it is clean and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it on my beard. Do the math.</li>
    <li> Works the best of any trimmer I ever had.</li>
    <li> actually this item never came so can&#x27;t really rate it.. but it looks like it would have  been ok.. i have ordered other Wahl products and they were all fine..</li>
    <li> My husband was surprised and delighted at how well he could trim his moustache---given that&lt;br /&gt;this product one-tenth the cost of his old trimmer. What a great find!</li>
    <li> Its a bit on the cheap side, however it actually works.  What do you expect for the price. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now, and the original batteries are just starting to slow down.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my husbands older model. However I did not realize it was not the metal model that has a charger. This is all plastic that takes batteries. It&#x27;s a lot noisier and I do not feel the blades are as sharp as on the metal model.</li>
    <li> I needed to do some clean up trimming and these did the job for me. Also great price. And they cut smooth.</li>
    <li> The accessories and shell of trimmer are made of the cheapest plastic.  After trying to put a guide on for the first time, it immediately snapped in two.  In hindsight, I probably should have paid an extra $10 and gotten a nicer trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made and noisy.  But it cuts powerfully.  Decided to keep it.</li>
    <li> I have owned two Wahl rechargeables. I liked them, this is better.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the same kind but rechargeable. The rechargeable battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more. This one comes with the same cheap plastic accessories and mostly-useless stand. It didn&#x27;t seem to cut as close. Well I put the plastic cover (kind of shaped like a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;) on the blade and it was so tight that when I finally pried it off it broke one of the blade teeth. So I took the old cutting parts off my old one and put them on this one and it works fine and shaves closer. It feels kind of cheap, but then it is a cheap razor. If it lasts as long as my old rechargeable I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> This is the second Wahl  Groomer I have had in the past 10 years The last one just quit working So I ordered this one, Same fivestar quality I am very Pleased and I hope it will last another 10 years</li>
    <li> I love the Wahl trimmer...it is good for beard, chest hair, armpits, whatever. It is small, runs forever. I had another that i dropped in the toilet. Don&#x27;t do that....The new one is nicer than the first. A good, handy product for a guy. Lasts a long time on a battery...comes with a charger and brushes to clean it.</li>
    <li> Meh.  It&#x27;s not very powerful and takes many passes to get an even cut.</li>
    <li> seems to pull before cutting</li>
    <li> I like the construction of this unit and wanted to like it but the cons way outweigh the pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) super loud-- have to use ear plugs when near ears&lt;br /&gt;2) sliding, adjustable trim head broke within first six months.&lt;br /&gt;3) often snags and pulls your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) solidly built body&lt;br /&gt;2) cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to spend more and get a Remington or other brand or model.</li>
    <li> Works well. Good value but a noisier than expected.</li>
    <li> Love it and love the price.  You cannot ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud, but is a nice compact size and lightweight. No storage or travel case included. I like not having to deal with a charging stand and cord. Blade cover and attachments stays on nicely. Great quality item for the price.</li>
    <li> The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t even turn on. I chalked that up to getting a faulty unit. The second one I got has worked awesome with no issues. I am really surprised at how long the cheap batteries that it came with have lasted. It cuts great and the batteries last a long time. Great deal.</li>
    <li> I actually like this one better than the rechargeable, multi adjustable thing it replaced - This seems beefier and less likely to have the  little things break.</li>
    <li> Great value and awesome product. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> LOUD! It&#x27;s OK for the price. I only need to use the thing about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;If I get a year from it I think I made a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;Oil comes along too. USE IT!</li>
    <li> GREAT product, as described. FAST shipping, very satisfied. A +++</li>
    <li> Lots of accessories.  Really noisy!!</li>
    <li> it does the job for something so dirt cheap.  almost sad that you&#x27;d pay so little for something that works as well as this little gadget, and then go pay 20 bucks at some farm-to-table restaurant for a plate of fried chicken and collards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have a beard this will work. fairly wide head so doesn&#x27;t take long to run it over your full beard.  i like it not being rechargeable.  just stick in the AA batteries and be done with it.  much better cutting action than the panasonic trimmer i have, but the panasonic has a detachable head and a separate shaving head that is a good idea.</li>
    <li> This trimmer cut like a razor. works very well.</li>
    <li> Does the trick, good size and attachments work very well.  Pretty loud for clippers.</li>
    <li> Great price. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> I travel about 50% of the time, and shave my own head (0) /trim my own beard (3) once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same Wahl Groomsman trimmer for nearly 6 years without issue. It cuts close and the included multi-step trim guide (not an instruction manual, but the way you control the length of facial hair) is pretty great. I use rechargeable batteries with it to keep the environmental impact down, and take it with me all over the world. It continues to soldier on, cutting my hair week after week. I oil it around 3x a year, recharge the batteries as needed (about once every 3 months) and it continues to work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the power switch will get accidentally thrown in my toiletry bag, but that&#x27;s a minor nit on what is otherwise an awesome product. And for the price, if it breaks - who cares...you just get another. :)</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl trimmer in ten years. Great trimmer for the price. The only complaint is the cheap plastic head attachment.</li>
    <li> I have been looking in all the stores for a beard trimmer. This was a rare find , but I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
    <li> I chose this item because I had one something like it, I droped it and it broke. I had to have another one. First time i used it, it performed prefectly. I use it to maintain my hair till I get to the barber shop. I would recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for 4 years and it was ruined in a flood. The batteries last a long time. I use this to trim my Van Dyke style beard / mustache. This one works exactly as well as the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> The blade was not sharpen enough, did not do a good job when I was trying to trim my hair.</li>
    <li> Great Seller of Great products They have everything you need. They Also Get All AAAAA +&#x27;s !!!</li>
    <li> I had a battery operated portable clippers from another manufacturer that I thought was terrific until I purchased this one. It is loud but very powerful, much more so than my last one. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Seems to work okay. Trims my beard just fine. The attachments do not lock on very well though. Sometimes they pop right off in the middle of trimming, leaving a bare trimmer which immediately cuts a patch of beard right out of the middle before I catch it, so then I end up walking around looking goofy for two weeks. I will probably look for a better model with more secure attachments next time I need one of these.</li>
    <li> I used it only twice and then it stopped working.</li>
    <li> i bought this trimmer 6 years ago and it worked perfectly until my wife dropped it and broke the attachment that i always use.  i bought a new one and took out the attachment piece that i needed and attached it to my 6 year old trimmer. i now  have a brand new trimmer sitting in a box until the 6 year old trimmer fails me. my cost for the 6 years was about $.05 per week, not counting batteries that lasted about a year for each set.</li>
    <li> Nice and good product but the accesories does not allow you to cut your beard to a mid size... only too short but it is OK now I use short and it is also fine</li>
