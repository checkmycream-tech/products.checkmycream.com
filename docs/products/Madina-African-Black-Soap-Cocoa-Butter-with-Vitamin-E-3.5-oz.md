    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for my face since 2002... it&#x27;s not over drying and clears a lot of discoloration. Seems to prevent bumps, as I only breakout when I&#x27;m stressed, but the rest of the time my face is always clear. This is a staple in my cabinet and I buy in bulk, so I never run out!</li>

    <li> I did not buy the soap from this seller but I&#x27;ve been enjoying it so much I had to leave a review. I had zero expectations when I started using this soap, and believe it&#x27;s too good to be true!  Every time I use this soap I come out feeling like a new person.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.  It leaves my skin feeling refresh and works with my body&#x27;s chemistry.  I&#x27;m one of those people who would have to do a touch up on deodorant around three o&#x27;clock,  but now I come home workout  and I&#x27;m still fine.  This soap is great, I hope they don&#x27;t change the ingredients or try to alter it to keep with potential market demands.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
