      <li>I would recommend using the line of products for better results</li>
      <li>product won&#x27;t magically get rid of your acne, it&#x27;s a treatment</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;Which is interesting because with the gel texture you never feel like its cleaning</li>
      <li>I must say that I am quite pleased.  </li>

      <li>I LOVE the glycolic wash -</li>
      <li>am purchasing more right now!!</li>
      <li>love it &amp; easy to use</li>
      <li>However, when they see that someone received a product free of charge, many also assume the review is bogus.</li>
      <li>It is excelant and leaves the skin with a nice and fresh sensation.</li>
      <li>Good product, light consistency &amp; one pump works for my whole face.  </li>
      <li>strong to use twice a day</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel it cleared up my skin the way it claims to do or did not see a reduction in fine lines.</li>
      <li>This is worth a try for sure.</li>
      <li>Plus, it makes your skin smooth and it&#x27;s way cheaper on amazon.</li>
      <li>Suprisingly gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>This is the first product in 20 years that has cleared my skin!!</li>
      <li>leaves the skin feeling clean and smooth .</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t clean thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Foam is good especially in shower.</li>
      <li>Good product, but don&#x27;t use daily</li>
      <li>When you use the whole neoStrata collection it is a great facial combination.  </li>
      <li>and this product is mild in comparison to others in my youth.  </li>
      <li>it makes my skin feel super smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend and was pleased to see that my dermatologist sells it in her office.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend peopke suffering very oily skin.</li>
      <li>I use all of their cleansing products (the makeup could go back to R&amp;D for a while in my opinion) combined with eating pollen granules my skin has never looked better!</li>
      <li>then this product could be useful for you.</li>
      <li>Worth a try friends.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I rarely break out during that time anymore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the foam texture as a face wash.</li>
      <li>Now I wouldn&#x27;t call this my holy grail, but I will say that this has made a significant difference in the texture of my oily, large pored skin.</li>
      <li>it morning + night for the last couple of weeks, the claims to fight blemishes, reduce pore size, and smooth away fine lines and wrinkles are true.</li>
      <li>Almost all of the reviews I have seen have all been positive!</li>
      <li>Effective facial cleanser with higher percentage of glycolic acid than comparable products.  </li>
      <li>it truely resurface your skin, I can see the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; on my face after each wash, it leaves your face smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m 35), I don&#x27;t break out because it removes all the dead skin cells that clog up the pores and cause inflammation, and does a great yet gentle job cleansing.</li>
      <li>Such a great way to do your glycolic acid treatment and wash your face at the same time!</li>
      <li>I have used AHA product all my life and this is the first foam</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently since my first purchase.</li>
      <li>I am an avid Obaji user - it takes a lot to get me to move over to another product line.</li>
      <li>That, in addition to the oil only added to the problem and created more severe acne.</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels already after using Neostrata for only one week.</li>
      <li>It tingles when you put it on, do NOT use near your eyes, but I can tell a huge difference in how much of my moisturizer my skin absorbs.</li>
      <li>I used a lot of the face washes you find at the store (nuetrogena, clearasil, clean and clear, etc.)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t break out much, but I have a fair amount of scarring and an uneven skin tone, however with this wash</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that my opinion or review is positive, I just really don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
      <li>Removes all dry skin and leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
      <li>I thought the price would be a bigger issue, but you need so little product to wash with that this stuff is actually quite economical which is nice, because you definitely need to find a good moisturizer and sunscreen to go along with this.</li>
      <li>Really nothing to brag about or recommend to a friend.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this for oily skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gently cleans the skin.</li>
      <li>and I really have not seen any difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a month and it seems to really help with my over 50 acne.  </li>
      <li>Formulated with 18% Glycolic Acid and 2% Lactobionic Acid, even though the potent cleanser is not recommended for sensitive skin, the soap-free, fragrance-free, dye-free, and paba-free formula doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red, irritated, or dehydrated.</li>
      <li>Very normal.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin, which is a good thing.b I have used to maybe twice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s so just starting to notice fine lines in my skin, but this face wash didn&#x27;t meet my expectation.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s less noticeable, and the scar-free areas of my face look so healthy and practically glow.</li>
      <li>Hopefully this is not from an older batch that has been sitting in a warehouse for a while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;***I&#x27;m actually seeing a more even tone, smaller pores, and clearer</li>
      <li>Active ingredients are gentle even on the most sensitive skin and it does not strip everything from your skin or leave it irritated.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use all of their cleansing products (the makeup could go back to R&amp;D for a while in my opinion) combined with eating pollen granules my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product. Really nothing to brag about or recommend to a friend. I&#x27;m not crazy about the foam texture as a face wash. I don&#x27;t feel it cleared up my skin the way it claims to do or did not see a reduction in fine lines. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s so just starting to notice fine lines in my skin, but this face wash didn&#x27;t meet my expectation. It cleans the face well, like any other product on a pharmacy shelf.</li>
    <li> this product is really good on cleansing the skin. leaves the skin feeling clean and smooth . i would recommend this wash to anyone who had an acne problem. it literally dries the pimples and smooths them out. I would recommend using the line of products for better results</li>
    <li> I have used the Face Cream plus for many years, and discovered the face wash about 10 years ago. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently since my first purchase. During that time I was also looking into the Proactiv system, which is great as well, however I obtained better results with NeoStrata. Like the Face Cream plus+, the Face Wash doesn&#x27;t contain any perfumes, unpleasant or overpowering fragrances. Though I have used it twice daily, I typically use it once at night along with the Face Cream, as it can cause irritation to more sensitive skin, as mine has become over the years. As with all products like this, use of sunscreen is recommended.</li>
    <li> Almost all of the reviews I have seen have all been positive! I wouldn&#x27;t say that my opinion or review is positive, I just really don&#x27;t know yet. It has been several weeks, BUT have only used 1-2 times a week BECAUSE it burns like crazy. I am not sure if that is because my skin hates it, if it is normal or what, BUT I do see my Dermatologist in a week or two and will definitely ask her about it and find out if I should continue using or what. Once I get some feedback from her, I will definitely add a NEW feedback or add to this one (not sure what you are able to do to feedback already left). BUT of course everyone is different, so who knows. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> This glycolic face wash is great! Foam is good especially in shower. Good for my skin makes it feel smooth.</li>
    <li> My doctor recomended I use thiis cleasing wash instead of a facial soap.  It is excelant and leaves the skin with a nice and fresh sensation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and have noticed that my skin sort of glows now. It is also economical--you don&#x27;t have to use very much and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Didn&#x27;t clean thoroughly. I went to Mario Badesco.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my Dermatologist for use on my face. I saw no changes at all. I was better off using only water, at least I would have saved some money.</li>
    <li> Suprisingly gentle but effective. I looked at all the options for glycolic washes out there. The others all had sketchy ingreditants. I&#x27;m glad I picked this one. I feel it is the best.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product!</li>
    <li> I like how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; this makes your face feel.  Seems like it gets all the days makeup, dirt, and oil off.  I am a repeat buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> I do not think that this product does all it claims to.  Also no instructions on how to return the product.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular face wash after this. Before using this, I was prone to breakouts during my period and sometimes in-between. My friend is a APN for a dermatology clinic in Houston and recommended I start using this. My skin is so clear, even during my period. I rarely break out during that time anymore. It also made my skin smooth--like it has a dewy glow. I began seeing results after the first week and definitely by week three. It made my skin a smidge red, but that will die down. I use it twice daily as suggested. One bottle lasted me two months, and you seriously only need one pump. I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but it really goes a long way. No complaints at all with this product!!</li>
    <li> This product is working great. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and highly recommend it for acne prone skin that&#x27;s also sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cleared up alot of my clogged pores and isn&#x27;t drying out my skin. I&#x27;m 52. This is worth a try for sure.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best product for oily skin ever. It gently cleans the skin. With the aha ingredient renews the collagen structure. I use it for over years. I strongly recommend peopke suffering very oily skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I used it for 4 months.</li>
    <li> works really good, ordering some more!</li>
    <li> I purchase this item all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using your Smoothing Gel for a few yrs now and literally.....can&#x27;t live without it! Please please tell me if you still do the 8fl ozs and if not why not.&lt;br /&gt;Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;m browsing to see and add further neova products to my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> This is a great compliment to the Neostrata Gel 15, exfoliates well and leaves my face with a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have mila and it helps to exfoliate the skin.</li>
    <li> Seller ships promptly, which is a plus when dealing with online merchants. The product packaging looked slightly different than in the past, but not sure if the manufacturer has updated the look or not. Hopefully this is not from an older batch that has been sitting in a warehouse for a while.</li>
    <li> I have used AHA product all my life and this is the first foam one.&lt;br /&gt;Which is interesting because with the gel texture you never feel like its cleaning your skin.&lt;br /&gt;But foam makes me like washing my face more.&lt;br /&gt;AHA product won&#x27;t magically get rid of your acne, it&#x27;s a treatment and it takes time.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used AHA15 product, so I was worried that 20 is going to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I am at 1 month point, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or dry the skin out. Just like how it&#x27;s suppose to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> This is great product for those who have keratosis.  Use it in the shower to wash away dead dry skin cells and follow up with a glycolic body lotion (like Glytone).  I&#x27;m telling you...it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This face wash almost immediately resolved my problematic combination skin. It evened out the flaky dry patches that seemed to prevent moisturizers and face oils from being absorbed properly. I don&#x27;t break out much, but I have a fair amount of scarring and an uneven skin tone, however with this wash it&#x27;s less noticeable, and the scar-free areas of my face look so healthy and practically glow. I thought the price would be a bigger issue, but you need so little product to wash with that this stuff is actually quite economical which is nice, because you definitely need to find a good moisturizer and sunscreen to go along with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now, it is amazing, it truely resurface your skin, I can see the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; on my face after each wash, it leaves your face smooth and soft. Worth a try friends.</li>
    <li> Trust me...&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and tried all kinds of stuff...&lt;br /&gt;One of the best product!!&lt;br /&gt;I am purchasing more right now!!</li>
    <li> Good product, light consistency &amp; one pump works for my whole face.  This product does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Like exfoliating with a scrub without the irritation</li>
    <li> This product receives top reviews from leading beauty experts. I agree that it is amazing. Active ingredients are gentle even on the most sensitive skin and it does not strip everything from your skin or leave it irritated. Worth every penny, this is the only product I use on my face.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month and it seems to really help with my over 50 acne.  It does tingle with application but my skin is tough and I have used everything on it and this product is mild in comparison to others in my youth.  I do feel it is working to help clear my face up.</li>
    <li> Love this! It will change your skin. My dermatologist friend said she used it so I had to try it. I had acne scars and it&#x27;s helped a lot with that. It tingles when you put it on, do NOT use near your eyes, but I can tell a huge difference in how much of my moisturizer my skin absorbs. This opens your pores and makes the rest of your skin regimen more effective.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, best face wash I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> When you use the whole neoStrata collection it is a great facial combination.  Check out their other products on amazon</li>
    <li> I am an avid Obaji user - it takes a lot to get me to move over to another product line. I started trying the Neo Strata when it was recommended for my son&#x27;s Icthyosis Hystrix; the product line was amazing for him, I thought I would give it a try. I LOVE the glycolic wash - I would recommend it as a part of your skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using NeoStrata Foaming Glycolic Wash as recommended by my dermatologist, for 1 year and I really have not seen any difference in my skin. &amp;#34;Maybe&amp;#34; a tad bit softer but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Thanks for my wonderful cleanser :)</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I cannot say enough about this product!  It truly changed the texture of my skin and I never break out!</li>
    <li> My favoriate product.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 years ago and for a very short time a few months ago I tried using something different and regretted it. Won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> Good product, but don&#x27;t use daily; every other day works well.  Cheaper than buying from my derm.</li>
    <li> Deep pore cleaning without drying out my combination skin. My friend owns a dermatology clinic and uses it every night.&lt;br /&gt;Too strong to use twice a day</li>
    <li> I have received this product last week. The service was prompt. I must say that I am quite pleased.  It does make the skin softer, and though I had anticipated that I might get some bad reactions, nothing of the sort has happened so far after seven days. My breakout has been less. When  wear makeup, I wash first with a different product than use the Neostrata. I am not sure that the foam can take off all the makeup.</li>
    <li> The color range is still somewhat limited. I chose the medium color and use it to highlight as opposed to matching my skin underneath my eyes.  I&#x27;m not overly impressed by this product but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin, which is a good thing.b I have used to maybe twice.  That&#x27;s likely not enough times to really comment, but in using it twice, it hasn&#x27;t struck me as a &amp;#34;must use item&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m applying my makeup either.</li>
    <li> Now I wouldn&#x27;t call this my holy grail, but I will say that this has made a significant difference in the texture of my oily, large pored skin. The texture is definitely refined and much smoother. I&#x27;ll stay with it and see how my face looks at the end of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Such a great way to do your glycolic acid treatment and wash your face at the same time! Otherwise there are other treatments you have to leave on for ten minutes etc etc, who ever remembers to do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks like I&#x27;m in my 20s (I&#x27;m 35), I don&#x27;t break out because it removes all the dead skin cells that clog up the pores and cause inflammation, and does a great yet gentle job cleansing. Not to mention its not pricey.... Thank you Neostrata!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels already after using Neostrata for only one week. Even my cosmatoligist has seen a difference.</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend this for oily skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://ilovemymani.com/2015/05/29/neostrata-foaming-glycolic-facewash-great-for-oily-skin/</li>
    <li> NeoStrata works well for me , if you have sensitive skin it will sting a little</li>
    <li> Effective facial cleanser with higher percentage of glycolic acid than comparable products.  May seem to be on the expensive side, but the container lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Very good product , so good</li>
    <li> Use as a partner product to Trentonin cream. It has a nice scent and leaves skin smoother.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Many people read reviews before making online purchases. Very normal. However, when they see that someone received a product free of charge, many also assume the review is bogus. Nope. Not true, not for me anyway. Yes, I received this product in exchange for my honest review, but let&#x27;s face it...this stuff is freaking awesome!&lt;br /&gt;***I&#x27;m actually seeing a more even tone, smaller pores, and clearer skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it morning + night for the last couple of weeks, the claims to fight blemishes, reduce pore size, and smooth away fine lines and wrinkles are true. Formulated with 18% Glycolic Acid and 2% Lactobionic Acid, even though the potent cleanser is not recommended for sensitive skin, the soap-free, fragrance-free, dye-free, and paba-free formula doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red, irritated, or dehydrated. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this line to me years ago and this is the only face wash I use. I look at least 10- 15 years younger than my peers.  Worth every penny.  The eye cream is great too.</li>
    <li> This is the first product in 20 years that has cleared my skin!! My derm sold it to me and I continued purchasing it here. Changed my life....</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser that I&#x27;ve used for years. Removes all dry skin and leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh. Would highly recommend and was pleased to see that my dermatologist sells it in her office.</li>
    <li> love it &amp; easy to use</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a couple of years now and love it!  I like that it makes my skin feel super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It also  does an excellent job of removing my makeup!</li>
    <li> If you have oily, acne prone skin then this product could be useful for you. I have naturally oily skin and I suddenly broke out with moderately severe acne 2 years back(quarter sized cysts, nodules, etc.). I used a lot of the face washes you find at the store (nuetrogena, clearasil, clean and clear, etc.) and I found that after every wash there would be remnants of dead skin from healing acne wounds. That, in addition to the oil only added to the problem and created more severe acne. This product does its job. It clears away oil, dirt, dead skin, etc. from your face without drying it out (at least for me, most products dried out my skin). That, plus topical medication from the derm, have helped clear up a lot of my acne and have lessened the severity. Plus, it makes your skin smooth and it&#x27;s way cheaper on amazon. (I got it at the derm for $50)</li>
