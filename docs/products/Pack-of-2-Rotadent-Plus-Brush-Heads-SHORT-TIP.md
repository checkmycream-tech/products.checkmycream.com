      <li>This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>Great if they weren&#x27;t defective.</li>
      <li>I recommend buying good quality ones from denMat</li>
      <li>brushes and these fit my brush perfectly.</li>
      <li>so I thought this would be a good buy.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize there was more than one type of Rotadent toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Product is fine I guess.</li>
      <li>They seem to work fine if they are on the brush and are just idly going through a cycle.</li>
      <li>They seem to work fine for a week</li>
      <li>drive mechanism was spinning just fine.</li>
      <li>It is just the heads and not the brush because it is still going fine when I pop them off in the midst of this all.</li>
      <li>but I never had this issue with the original heads.</li>
      <li>If I could give 0 star I will, this thing doesn&#x27;t even worth a star!</li>
      <li>Maybe they dont fit quite right where the head connects to the brush</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The replacement head are exactly as the original ones.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered and delivered quickly.  </li>

      <li>I have a newer model and these were not the right size.  </li>

      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I thought it was just the one head at first</li>
      <li>First it does&#x27;t fit, second</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say whether it was a rare defective part or if the heads from HB are interior quality compared to direct or dentist parts.</li>
      <li>How can I know it doesn&#x27;t fit if I don&#x27;t open the package?!</li>
      <li>probably should have spent more and ordered directly from the company</li>
      <li>and then they start making a loud noise and with the tiniest amount of pressure they stop working</li>
      <li>No trouble at all.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I expected to receive.  </li>
      <li>Fine, But not a really good deal.</li>

<li> One was broken right out of the pack.</li>

<li> The other is still going but doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
<li> Either way, it&#x27;s kind of annoying because I can&#x27;t use them for more than a few seconds before they stop spinning on me. :(</li>
<li> These are very expensive and don&#x27;t work as well as the original ones.</li>
<li> I thought I was saving a little money</li>
<li> For those who say they stop working:  Soak the brush head in vinegar for a few hours.  </li>
<li> This brush head lasts longer than the longer tips, which seem to lose their shape within a few uses.</li>
<li> so these replacement tips do not fit my toothbrush.</li>
<li> 1 of the 4 was broken internally and would not spin.</li>
<li> The brushes did not fit my Rotadent.  </li>
<li> So now I stuck with two useless brushhead, totally a waste of $!!!</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m confused as to what&#x27;s wrong.</li>
<li> They are extremely expensive for what they are.</li>
<li> They made a terrible grinding noise and stopped working prematurely.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there was more than one type of Rotadent toothbrush. I don&#x27;t have the Rotadent PLUS so these replacement tips do not fit my toothbrush. I had already opened the package before I realized it.</li>
    <li> Fine, But not a really good deal. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> These may be OEM but they don&#x27;t last long at all.  The brush stops turning after about a month use.  Unless you have a lot of money, buy a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> One was broken right out of the pack.</li>
    <li> Product is fine I guess.They are extremely expensive for what they are. Have purchased these for about 1.5 yrs. Last time I purchased 2- 2packs. 1 of the 4 was broken internally and would not spin. At this price point that is unexceptable. I know this is not the retailer&#x27;s fault. But not for the fact that my dentist states I should this product I would not buy it.</li>
    <li> If I could give 0 star I will, this thing doesn&#x27;t even worth a star! First it does&#x27;t fit, second, when I tried to return, they doesn&#x27;t allow me because the package is open! How can I know it doesn&#x27;t fit if I don&#x27;t open the package?! So now I stuck with two useless brushhead, totally a waste of $!!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected to receive.  Shipment came on time.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> The brushes did not fit my Rotadent.  I have a newer model and these were not the right size.  Is there anything I can do about returning these or getting the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you do anything about this.</li>
    <li> They are defective and don&#x27;t last even a month. They seem to work fine for a week and then they start making a loud noise and with the tiniest amount of pressure they stop working and then they just break. Buy them if you don&#x27;t mind paying $25.00 for a couple of weeks. I contacted the seller and they said their return policy is 30 days. 15 days to try each brush and then you can&#x27;t do anything about it.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Still working great!! No trouble at all.</li>
    <li> For those who say they stop working:  Soak the brush head in vinegar for a few hours.  Rinse it off.  I found that mine were simply clogged and couldn&#x27;t rotate anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I purchased it through my dentist office. The replacement head are exactly as the original ones. Amazon came through once again. I have never been disapointed by any purchase through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great if they weren&#x27;t defective. I love the rotadent brush but replacement brush heads are outrageously expensive. I thought I was saving a little money but the heads didn&#x27;t last since the drive mechanism was defective. They made a terrible grinding noise and stopped working prematurely. Brush part stopped even though handle drive mechanism was spinning just fine. I got mine from HB supplies. I can&#x27;t say whether it was a rare defective part or if the heads from HB are interior quality compared to direct or dentist parts.</li>
    <li> These are very expensive and don&#x27;t work as well as the original ones. One of the heads stopped working after a month of use. The other is still going but doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace the heads that were getting frayed so I thought this would be a good buy. They arrived on time and perfectly-seaIed so there is no issue with that. I don&#x27;t know why this is happening or if there is a way to fix it but, everytime I go to use one of the new heads, they short out after a few seconds. I thought it was just the one head at first but they both do it now. They seem to work fine if they are on the brush and are just idly going through a cycle. The problem arises when I go to actually use them, it&#x27;s like applying the teansiest amount of pressure makes them freeze up. It is just the heads and not the brush because it is still going fine when I pop them off in the midst of this all. Maybe they dont fit quite right where the head connects to the brush but I never had this issue with the original heads. I double checked that these are made for this model so I&#x27;m confused as to what&#x27;s wrong. Anybody know how to fix this or if these are maybe just defective..? Either way, it&#x27;s kind of annoying because I can&#x27;t use them for more than a few seconds before they stop spinning on me. :(</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and delivered quickly.  This brush head lasts longer than the longer tips, which seem to lose their shape within a few uses.</li>
    <li> These broke after my first use. I recommend buying good quality ones from denMat</li>
    <li> one brush already doesn&#x27;t work. will see how long the other one will last. probably should have spent more and ordered directly from the company</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I use a Rotadent Plus brush for plaque.  I needed brushes and these fit my brush perfectly.</li>
    <li> My toothbrush has not worked right since I replaced the head.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> used them for years and  they do the job</li>
