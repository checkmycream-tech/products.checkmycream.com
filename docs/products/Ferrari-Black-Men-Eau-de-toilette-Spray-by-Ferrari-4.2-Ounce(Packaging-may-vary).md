    <li> The service was ok, it took more days than I expected , the box was not sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall was ok !!!!</li>
    <li> The product is advertised as Black, but it is actually Scuderia. Which there is a distinctive difference in scent, and packaging.  False representation of product being purchased.</li>
    <li> it don&#x27;t stay for even 30 min and also i din&#x27;t like the smell at all. Not what i expected from Ferrari.</li>
    <li> This Eau de toilette is a great product and smells really good. The price is very low compared to the similar ones at department stores.</li>
    <li> First time I tried this , simply superb and mild scent. 100% worth for your money.  No doubt will keep buying the same .</li>
    <li> Nice one! It will be there all day long. I spray it at 11am and it smells good until 6pm. good price.</li>
    <li> Quality product unaltered sealed packaging, and unchanged in its original box. Maintains scent for over 12 hours and the spray does not stain any clothing. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> Good choice, it smells nice and at a very reasonable price for a 125 ml bottle, also you can use the Ferrari logo in your car ...</li>

    <li> Well, the case is 100% original, but the smell is 1000000% fake. You can smell it only 10 min, and it will be disappeared in the air. Even you will forget the smell itself. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> He recibido puros halagos de cada mujer que se me acerca. 100% recomendado, ligero y fresco, se puedo usar a cualquier hora del d&amp;iacute;a y para cualquier ocasi&amp;oacute;n.</li>
