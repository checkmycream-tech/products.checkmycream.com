      <li>Plus my skin looks flawless in pictures!  </li>
      <li>All the freeman feeling beautiful face masks are a must have!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff works really good!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells good</li>
      <li>If your looking for a good peel off mask that works, do NOT buy these.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very refreshing peel-off mask.</li>
      <li>Feel good going on, nice smell, does what it should do.  </li>
      <li>Never got so many complaments in my life!</li>
      <li>It came very quick and smelled great.</li>
      <li>but I still give it five stars because it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a nice mask.  </li>
      <li>Peel-off masques are effective for removing any remaining impurities after cleansing masques, and they prepare the way for a moisturizing mask.  </li>
      <li>these are much cheaper and way more effective!!  </li>
      <li>I first found these peel off masks many years ago at a convenience store and I was happy to see them on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The pomegranate fragrance of this masque is pleasant and refreshing, and it&#x27;s just a lot of fun to pull the mask off one&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>(64$ is the most iv paid for a face mask)</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my skin, almost like a spa experience.</li>
      <li>i just love Freeman products.</li>
      <li>I love pulling this off though</li>
      <li>I did notice that it is not the most moisturizing scrub</li>
      <li>Apply favorite moisturizer . . .</li>
      <li>Be sure to use it liberally so it peels off easily (</li>
      <li>I have large pores and sensitive skin; this product was perfect for me.</li>
      <li>None of the peel off masks are easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but like others have said, it&#x27;s pretty much just like elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
      <li>Love this so much!</li>
      <li>My face is super smooth.</li>
      <li>As an addict of facial masques, I always use a good peel-off mask in my routine of using three or four masques for a treatment.  </li>
      <li>It looks good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but comes out like glue.</li>
      <li>and this mask does exactly what is stated in the product discretion!</li>
      <li>I pretty sure along with the facial ingredients and perfumed additives</li>
      <li>Not quite as good as some I have used in the past but satisfactory.</li>
      <li>the more you use, the longer it takes to dry, so plan accordingly!)  </li>
      <li>After that, I put it on much thicker.  </li>
      <li>so I highly suggest avoiding getting any of this on your eyebrows because they may very well get disappeared.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The mask is very sticky and gel like when you put it on your face and in about 15-30 minutes dries out completely</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually does anything, but it&#x27;s fun to peel off.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for in a deep cleaning mask.</li>
      <li>Takes too long to dry and does not peel off easily.</li>
      <li>those fine lines and not too deep wrinkles disappear especially if you take those ten minutes to relax!</li>
      <li>Once upon a time you could find them at your local market, not so much these days.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face feel so soft.</li>
      <li>Recommended for sensitive and mature skin . . .</li>
      <li>It took it longer to set and dry; but, it was much easier to remove!  </li>
      <li>I love this mask for my dry skin because once it&#x27;s dry it also takes off dry skin flakiness and leaves your skin soft and clear!  </li>
      <li>It acts as a gentle defoliator as well as soothing dry, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>However, the product still spreads smoothly, dries, and peels well despite being a little dry.</li>

<li> My teen has used several other facial masks in the past and never had a reaction to them .</li>
<li> It can be a bit uncomfortable pulling off the mask, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
<li> Dried out and gross.  </li>
<li> I prefer the other Freeman products.</li>
<li> and still there were wet patches!  </li>
<li> I used other peel off masks and</li>
<li> This stuff is so hard to apply, it&#x27;s just a big goopy mess.</li>
<li> the cap was broken when it arrived, so the product is a little gummier than normal from having dried out.  </li>
<li> Apply to cleansed dry face (thin layer) and allow to dry (10 minutes or less).</li>
<li> Not sure why I had such a hard time finding a peel off mask.  </li>
<li> It was so thick on my face that it took over an hour to dry out</li>
<li> It does seem like it takes off dead skin and leaves you feeling fresher, but I don&#x27;t think it gets stuff out of pores like strips do.</li>
<li> may have started to dry out before I got it, because the consistency was very thick and hard to spread.</li>
<li> a thumbs up from me though, because it really does work well even though it felt like evil glue that had no intention of letting go of my face.</li>
<li> After one use my teen broke out very bad</li>
<li> the consistency of this one is so thick that it makes it impossible to apply on a thin layer...  </li>
<li> about it, it made me try and google the ingredients...was disappointed to find the second link was  a list of bad comedogenic ingredients....</li>
<li> This thing was wrong or something...  </li>
<li> The gel has a horrible consistency and it is extremely difficult to remove.</li>
<li> Nasty.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <li> Takes too long to dry and does not peel off easily.</li>
    <li> This thing was wrong or something...  I used other peel off masks and the consistency of this one is so thick that it makes it impossible to apply on a thin layer...  It was so thick on my face that it took over an hour to dry out and still there were wet patches!  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t know if I left it on too long, because it really hurt when I pulled it off. I had to leave it on longer because it refused to dry fully. Bless your heart if you get some of it on those tiny hairs on your hairline because it HURT. It even hurt just pulling it off my cheeks. I now see after having ripped it off my face that it not only grabbed all makeup residue, but it also ripped off that microscopic fuzz we have on our faces ... so I highly suggest avoiding getting any of this on your eyebrows because they may very well get disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;So even though it felt like ripping a giant band-aid off my face, it does indeed work- and well. My face is super smooth. I do have a feeling the tube I got may have started to dry out before I got it, because the consistency was very thick and hard to spread. So I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to be like that or not.&lt;br /&gt;Gets a thumbs up from me though, because it really does work well even though it felt like evil glue that had no intention of letting go of my face. But I won out in the end.</li>
    <li> the cap was broken when it arrived, so the product is a little gummier than normal from having dried out.  However, the product still spreads smoothly, dries, and peels well despite being a little dry.</li>
    <li> I first found these peel off masks many years ago at a convenience store and I was happy to see them on Amazon.  The mask is very sticky and gel like when you put it on your face and in about 15-30 minutes dries out completely and you can pull it off your face in one solid piece.  I love this mask for my dry skin because once it&#x27;s dry it also takes off dry skin flakiness and leaves your skin soft and clear!  It can be a bit uncomfortable pulling off the mask, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Simple to use and this mask does exactly what is stated in the product discretion! Apply to cleansed dry face (thin layer) and allow to dry (10 minutes or less). Peel upward from neck, rinse with lukewarm water and blot skin dry. Apply favorite moisturizer . . . can be used morning or night. Recommended for sensitive and mature skin . . . those fine lines and not too deep wrinkles disappear especially if you take those ten minutes to relax! This mask doesn&#x27;t irate (always do a patch test!!!). It acts as a gentle defoliator as well as soothing dry, sensitive skin. I doubt that it would provide benefits for those with oily  or acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was purchased as an &#x27;add on.&#x27;</li>
    <li> looks like glue, smells like glue, feels like glue, peels like glue....I pretty sure along with the facial ingredients and perfumed additives its made using a type of glue...I didn&#x27;t like that about it, it made me try and google the ingredients...was disappointed to find the second link was  a list of bad comedogenic ingredients....</li>
    <li> This product seemed like a terrific buy. It came very quick and smelled great. After one use my teen broke out very bad and she discontinued use of this product. My teen has used several other facial masks in the past and never had a reaction to them . One day after using this mask she did. I would not buy this product again . I did not give it one star because everyone has different reactions to different products.</li>
    <li> I put this on too thin the first time which made it hard to get off (many little pieces).  After that, I put it on much thicker.  It took it longer to set and dry; but, it was much easier to remove!  Not quite as good as some I have used in the past but satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Not sure why I had such a hard time finding a peel off mask.  Once upon a time you could find them at your local market, not so much these days.  This is a nice mask.  Feel good going on, nice smell, does what it should do.  I think it takes a bit longer to dry than the one I used to use but since I do this on slow evenings as a whole regime I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> i just love Freeman products. This scrub is no exception. It looks good enough to eat. I love the way it feels on my skin, almost like a spa experience. I did notice that it is not the most moisturizing scrub but I still give it five stars because it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a deep cleaning mask. Be sure to use it liberally so it peels off easily (the more you use, the longer it takes to dry, so plan accordingly!)  Be sure to use steam or hot towel before to open the pores, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I used this in conjunction with Biore ultra pore strips, and my face has never been cleaner! I have large pores and sensitive skin; this product was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but like others have said, it&#x27;s pretty much just like elmer&#x27;s glue. I don&#x27;t know if it actually does anything, but it&#x27;s fun to peel off. It does seem like it takes off dead skin and leaves you feeling fresher, but I don&#x27;t think it gets stuff out of pores like strips do. I definitely prefer clay masks to this, but that might just be a personal preference.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing peel-off mask. If you think your makeup remover is getting all of the makeup off, try using this mask. When you peel it off, you&#x27;ll see all kinds of residue that your remover missed.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a good peel off mask that works, do NOT buy these.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good but it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for skin improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so hard to apply, it&#x27;s just a big goopy mess. I prefer the other Freeman products. None of the peel off masks are easy to work with. I suggest using the wash off masks.</li>
    <li> As an addict of facial masques, I always use a good peel-off mask in my routine of using three or four masques for a treatment.  Peel-off masques are effective for removing any remaining impurities after cleansing masques, and they prepare the way for a moisturizing mask.  The pomegranate fragrance of this masque is pleasant and refreshing, and it&#x27;s just a lot of fun to pull the mask off one&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> Love this so much! All the freeman feeling beautiful face masks are a must have!!! Never got so many complaments in my life! Plus my skin looks flawless in pictures!  Not even the most expensive masks iv bought  can compare to these! (64$ is the most iv paid for a face mask) these are much cheaper and way more effective!!  Don&#x27;t miss out!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really good! It makes my face feel so soft.</li>
    <li> The product seems like it has been sitting on a shelf for ages. The gel has a horrible consistency and it is extremely difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, product is as advertised</li>
    <li> Coming out of the tube, it&#x27;s not like the stuff in the packets.  Dried out and gross.  Nasty.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but comes out like glue. I love pulling this off though</li>
