      <li>They&#x27;re good quality (Made in Japan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The good news:</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Most pads are made of  rubber, but the good ones - like Shu Uemura - are silicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, am thrilled with the results.</li>
      <li>The wider rubber pad does a much better job.</li>
      <li>They are much better then the cheap rubber ones!</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find any pads that fit until I tried these!</li>
      <li>Many of us are looking for replacement pads for our Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>These seem to be sturdy and fit into most curlers.</li>
      <li>They still work, but the sponges didn&#x27;t fit end to end.  </li>
      <li>I always have issues finding eye lash curler refills, and when I do, they don&#x27;t always fit.</li>
      <li>better than the original highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I got this to fit in my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, which they seem to think we should keep rebuying instead of just replacing the pads (really?).  </li>
      <li>Tweezerman \\&quot;Classic Curl\\&quot; replacement pads ARE silicone and DOES fit Shu Uemura.  </li>
      <li>These may work great with other eyelash curlers but if you have the classic, old-style, metal eyelash curler, don&#x27;t buy these replacement pads.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>And sure enough, they do!</li>
      <li>They fit and seem to have the same texture, feel and ability to curl my lashes.</li>
      <li>They work really well, will buy again when needed.</li>
      <li>I purchased two of the Tweezerman LTD Deluxe Metal Eyelash Curlers (for home &amp; work) that came with four LIGHT BLUE silicone lash pads from Target at least 3 years ago.</li>
      <li>I like the tweezerman classic curler</li>
      <li>I love it, the wide pads are more gentle than the other common national brands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more subtle, which I like.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like that they haven&#x27;t shown any sign of indentation or cut at the point the upper rim of the curler hits them.</li>
      <li>After searching many stores and the web for a product that could act as a replacement for the insert in my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, I ran across one lonely account of how these little guys here do the trick.</li>
      <li>The material holds up so much better than the other black or white foam types that you find at the drug</li>
      <li>The Tweezerman Classic Curl at my local beauty supply store came with a total of FOUR pads for only $12.</li>
      <li>I change these pads far less frequently!</li>

<li> I imagine those of you with Asian or difficult lashes will be less satisfied.  </li>
<li> The metal edge of the curler itself goes right into the rubber pad, resulting in either crimped or even broken eyelashes with continued use.</li>
<li> bad news is their shape is different, i.e. more plush/full/rounded.  </li>
<li> This essentially means less curl (but also less \\&quot;crimping\\&quot;).&lt;br</li>
<li> Either way, these are far too $$$ to be made this poorly.</li>
<li> My curler just says &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; on it, not sure if it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; as these state on the package</li>
<li> This does not fit the tweezerman curler!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the eyelash curler pads crease within mere days of use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These refills fit my Sephora eye lash curler; however they are so thin that it&#x27;s like having no pad in there at all. I don&#x27;t recommend these and would never buy them again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Durable, fits my metal curler</li>
    <li> I got this to fit in my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, which they seem to think we should keep rebuying instead of just replacing the pads (really?).  They work wonderfully to curl without crimping.  I&#x27;ll keep buying these.</li>
    <li> This does not fit the tweezerman curler! It it unusable as it will not stay put...I should ask for my money back!</li>
    <li> These may work great with other eyelash curlers but if you have the classic, old-style, metal eyelash curler, don&#x27;t buy these replacement pads. They will not stay in the curler.</li>
    <li> These refills were just a tiny bit short for my Tweezerman curler.  They still work, but the sponges didn&#x27;t fit end to end.  My curler just says &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; on it, not sure if it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; as these state on the package and that&#x27;s why there is a size difference.</li>
    <li> After searching many stores and the web for a product that could act as a replacement for the insert in my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, I ran across one lonely account of how these little guys here do the trick. And sure enough, they do!</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my orginal shuimura eyelash curler pads... and this WORKS WONDERS!!! better than the original highly recommend. fits perfectly</li>
    <li> Love the TWEEZERMAN refills that I bought to go with my curler!! They work really well, will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Many of us are looking for replacement pads for our Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  Most pads are made of  rubber, but the good ones - like Shu Uemura - are silicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news: Tweezerman \\&quot;Classic Curl\\&quot; replacement pads ARE silicone and DOES fit Shu Uemura.  They&#x27;re good quality (Made in Japan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is their shape is different, i.e. more plush/full/rounded.  This essentially means less curl (but also less \\&quot;crimping\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, am thrilled with the results. It&#x27;s more subtle, which I like.  I imagine those of you with Asian or difficult lashes will be less satisfied.  As Shu Uemura is no longer sold in the US, this may be the only option short of traveling to Asia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the reason for my low rating is the price of this seller. The Tweezerman Classic Curl at my local beauty supply store came with a total of FOUR pads for only $12. That&#x27;s including the curler! So this seller is ripping you off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of the Tweezerman LTD Deluxe Metal Eyelash Curlers (for home &amp; work) that came with four LIGHT BLUE silicone lash pads from Target at least 3 years ago. I love it, the wide pads are more gentle than the other common national brands. When I finally ran out of lash pads I could not find any refills at any of the retailers listed on Tweezerman&#x27;s website and they did not respond to my email. I figured I would try these since they are made by the same company and say they are silicone. They fit and seem to have the same texture, feel and ability to curl my lashes.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for me! Thanks!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find these anywhere and the silicone pads last forever! They are much better then the cheap rubber ones!</li>
    <li> Love this! Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my Maybelline curler. Couldn&#x27;t find any pads that fit until I tried these! The material holds up so much better than the other black or white foam types that you find at the drug store- I change these pads far less frequently!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the eyelash curler pads crease within mere days of use. The metal edge of the curler itself goes right into the rubber pad, resulting in either crimped or even broken eyelashes with continued use. Either way, these are far too $$$ to be made this poorly.</li>
    <li> I like the tweezerman classic curler, it&#x27;s been my go to curler for quite some time now. The pads last for a long time, so this 3 pack refill would last awhile. It&#x27;s a good investment, I&#x27;ve never been dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I always have issues finding eye lash curler refills, and when I do, they don&#x27;t always fit. These seem to be sturdy and fit into most curlers. I particularly like that they haven&#x27;t shown any sign of indentation or cut at the point the upper rim of the curler hits them. I would recommed them as good value.</li>
    <li> I used another brand curler for years and am so happy to have found Tweezerman&#x27;s version. The wider rubber pad does a much better job.</li>
