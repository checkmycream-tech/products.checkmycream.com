### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is awesome.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product!!!.</li>
      <li>It wasnt the best Ive used</li>
      <li>I have used Toppiks and XFusion for 10 years and they are wonderful products.  </li>
      <li>In my case I ordered Medium Brown and itâ€™s perfect for my darker auburn hair color.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It covers the problem perfectly.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect, the coverage, etc.</li>
      <li>this is a very good product .the</li>
      <li>The Samson Best Hair Loss Concealer refill kits are a great idea, just wish there was an easier way to refill the used canister.  </li>
      <li>coverage  is very good compared to others ,the color is great and the price is right.i would recommend this to all.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>great product....</li>
      <li>very good product, I liked....</li>
      <li>Good product that I&#x27;ve been using for well over a year.</li>
      <li>good price, too.,</li>
      <li>Now that I have developed a working system for this product, I will continue to use it as it provides the best combination of quality and cost of the brands that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>A wonderful product if you kept an old topikk container.  </li>
      <li>I have given up using this one and ordered more of the Toppiks.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a greater chance of it not staying in your hair during rainy and windy weather.  </li>
      <li>and it just makes me feel more confident and</li>
      <li>Always finish with a light application of hair spray (any kind works).  </li>
      <li>and I am very impressed with the way it conceals where necessary.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered it many times and continue to do so.  </li>
      <li>Ok refill for topikk or xfusion.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with thinning hair as a great way to make your hair look fuller and thicker</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>Refills is a great idea - but - only if the refill product is as good as the original.  </li>
      <li>As a note for Auburn purchasers - it is quite light, and you will get better scalp coverage by mixing with brown.</li>
      <li>Does the job and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Instead of being a fine powder, it is balled up in the plastic bag and won&#x27;t come through the shaker easily or at all.  </li>
      <li>The light weight makes you use more to get adequate coverage while the mild static bond allows too much of the product to fall off during combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color is another issue.  </li>
      <li>I use dark brown which is fairly comparable among the better brands.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the high quality products like Toppik or Xfusion, they have a stronger static charge and a heavier fiber.  </li>
      <li>The price is right and the product is just as good as the more popular, expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>always ships SO FAST, and that is a huge relief when you rely on a product, like I do.</li>
      <li>Thank you Samson for making this available at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>so it gives you a more natural look.</li>
      <li>This product is economically priced compared to name brands like XFusion.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;This is an excellent product which I highly recommend - it is equal in performance to more costly products such as Toppik, without paying extra for the packaging.</li>
      <li>I have very thinning hair and it covers it up and shows that I have a full head of hair</li>
      <li>The key is to  make sure your scalp and hair are totally dry and apply very lightly until desired coverage is achieved.  </li>
      <li>a positive note, the shipping and handling is fast.  </li>
      <li>Yeah the product is inexpensive but you literally have to use twice as much because it doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair.</li>
      <li>I have to add that I have to clean up the bathroom with each use but not a big problem...</li>
      <li>Samson&#x27;s dark brown is really more of a medium brown.</li>
      <li>I had to mix it with their black fiber to achieve a better color</li>
      <li>but it was a decent price</li>
      <li>, initially adhere a little better, and stay better looking a little longer, but at a significantly higher cost.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and have not noticed a great difference from the more expensive brands I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>I have used Toppik for years and more recently XFusion and Samson Dark Brown compares favorably and is reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>The fibers are fine and less clumpy</li>
      <li>I have been  using Toppik and many other brand names of hair concealers over the years and was surprised to find a product that was half the price - I gave it a try and am so pleased - that product is Samson Dark Brown hair concealer</li>
      <li>a new standard has finally been set and very very affordable.</li>
      <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve tried but nowhere near the worst.  </li>

<li> Can be a little messy when transferring to your shaker</li>

<li> I end upnusingbmore powder to cover a small area.  </li>
<li> If you are like me, and need some sort of hair powder to fill in the thin spots in your hair, this product is cheaper than the brand-name brands, which I have all used in the past, and gets the job done just as well.  </li>
<li> Samson has a weak charge and is lighter in weight.  </li>
<li> If you have problems with baldness or thin hair, you have to use it.</li>
<li> and I find it works just as well for a fraction of the price since I&#x27;m not paying for unnecessary packaging.</li>
<li> I was wrong!  </li>
<li> Very unhappy with this one.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with this product and frustrated.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is economically priced compared to name brands like XFusion.  Now I know why it&#x27;s cheaper.  It&#x27;s because the quality of this product is inferior to XFusion.  I thought I would save money by buying this product.  I was wrong!  Samson powder doesn&#x27;t dispense evenly and is messy!  I end upnusingbmore powder to cover a small area.  Also the powder isn&#x27;t full-proof when you sweat a lot at the gym. A friend noticed the powder coming down my neck along with my sweat.  It was embarrassing!  Save your money &amp; spend it on a quality product.</li>
    <li> Too dark for me .It was my mistake.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product if you kept an old topikk container.  Does the job and is easy to use. good price, too.,</li>
    <li> If you are like me, and need some sort of hair powder to fill in the thin spots in your hair, this product is cheaper than the brand-name brands, which I have all used in the past, and gets the job done just as well.  I find I can fully fill in the thinner spots and it just makes me feel more confident and masks that I have a thinning hair problem.  Keratin Research always ships SO FAST, and that is a huge relief when you rely on a product, like I do.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product .the coverage  is very good compared to others ,the color is great and the price is right.i would recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> Ok refill for topikk or xfusion. Can be a little messy when transferring to your shaker</li>
    <li> great product....no complaints</li>
    <li> Good product that I&#x27;ve been using for well over a year. I do use a dust mask when applying. I have to add that I have to clean up the bathroom with each use but not a big problem...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and have not noticed a great difference from the more expensive brands I have used in the past. The fibers are fine and less clumpy so it gives you a more natural look.</li>
    <li> I have been  using Toppik and many other brand names of hair concealers over the years and was surprised to find a product that was half the price - I gave it a try and am so pleased - that product is Samson Dark Brown hair concealer and I am very impressed with the way it conceals where necessary.  I have ordered it many times and continue to do so.  The price is right and the product is just as good as the more popular, expensive brands.  Thank you Samson for making this available at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Refilling is the only way to go concerning hair fiber.  a new standard has finally been set and very very affordable.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!!. It covers the problem perfectly. If you have problems with baldness or thin hair, you have to use it. The color is perfect, the coverage, etc.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is an excellent product which I highly recommend - it is equal in performance to more costly products such as Toppik, without paying extra for the packaging. I will definitely re-order! As a note for Auburn purchasers - it is quite light, and you will get better scalp coverage by mixing with brown. In my case I ordered Medium Brown and itâ€™s perfect for my darker auburn hair color.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Yeah the product is inexpensive but you literally have to use twice as much because it doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair. Color is off, you can see the hair fibers in the hair. Won&#x27;t buy again, I&#x27;ll just spend the extra cash on toppik</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6 months as a cheaper alternative to Toppik and I find it works just as well for a fraction of the price since I&#x27;m not paying for unnecessary packaging. I would highly recommend this to anyone with thinning hair as a great way to make your hair look fuller and thicker</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of hair fibers, this one falls in the middle in terms of quality.  I prefer the high quality products like Toppik or Xfusion, they have a stronger static charge and a heavier fiber.  Samson has a weak charge and is lighter in weight.  There&#x27;s a greater chance of it not staying in your hair during rainy and windy weather.  It&#x27;s also not the bargain it appears to be.  The light weight makes you use more to get adequate coverage while the mild static bond allows too much of the product to fall off during combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color is another issue.  I use dark brown which is fairly comparable among the better brands.  Samson&#x27;s dark brown is really more of a medium brown. I had to mix it with their black fiber to achieve a better color match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the shipping and handling is fast.  The package includes information on using and storing the hair fibers. I give Samson hair fibers a marginal thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have used Toppiks and XFusion for 10 years and they are wonderful products.  I am very disappointed with this product and frustrated.  Instead of being a fine powder, it is balled up in the plastic bag and won&#x27;t come through the shaker easily or at all.  It does not stay on your hair.  I have given up using this one and ordered more of the Toppiks.  Do yourself a favor and stick with the two name brands.  Refills is a great idea - but - only if the refill product is as good as the original.  Very unhappy with this one.</li>
    <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve tried but nowhere near the worst.  I&#x27;ve used fibers that go on a little easier, initially adhere a little better, and stay better looking a little longer, but at a significantly higher cost.  The key is to  make sure your scalp and hair are totally dry and apply very lightly until desired coverage is achieved.  Always finish with a light application of hair spray (any kind works).  Now that I have developed a working system for this product, I will continue to use it as it provides the best combination of quality and cost of the brands that I have tried.  The price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> It wasnt the best Ive used but it was a decent price</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used Toppik for years and more recently XFusion and Samson Dark Brown compares favorably and is reasonably priced.  The Samson Best Hair Loss Concealer refill kits are a great idea, just wish there was an easier way to refill the used canister.  I would recommend the Samson product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I have very thinning hair and it covers it up and shows that I have a full head of hair</li>
    <li> very good product, I liked....</li>
