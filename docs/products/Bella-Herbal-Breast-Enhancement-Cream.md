      <li>by hot</li>

      <li>just feel hot and nothing change...</li>
      <li>It really does work!</li>
      <li>Pure garbage.</li>
      <li>Thank you and fast to.</li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews before buying its really BS for them to sell things that expires the year before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now along with oral&lt;br /&gt;Supplement to help speed up the process and it really works.</li>
      <li>and I just don&#x27;t see how others can say it does work when it really in fact doesn&#x27;t work at all,  </li>
      <li>It burned my skin and even with repeated use (I used the whole tube over three weeks)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really  going to show it works.</li>
      <li>But My Boyfriend Said Its Really Working.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone</li>
      <li>In my future purchase I would love to receive the highly informative, must-have &amp;#34;The Smart Women&#x27;s Guide to Natural, Surgery-Free Breast Enlargement &amp; Butt Enhancement&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see full effects; I only used it 1 month.</li>
      <li>I want my money back and fast!!</li>
      <li>Pueraria mirifica works much better than this stuff; don&#x27;t waste your money or your time with this.</li>
      <li>I mean when u put it on your butt or tits  are going to start getting a warm tingling  sensation after about 5 mins or so.</li>
      <li>Makes skin very soft</li>
      <li>than it said, it&#x27;s a pinkish white lotion color and it does get hot....</li>
      <li>Used this for three weeks so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfy with the result so far.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Have been using for weeks and have seen zero results thus far.</li>
      <li>This is due to the fact it feels like icy-hot which wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much as the fact you cannot get it off!</li>
      <li>It burned a little at first, but now its like i&#x27;m just putting lotion on my boobs for no reason.</li>
      <li>When it was gone, I switched to pure pueraria mirifica oil and pueraria mirifica supplements and within a month, I have noticed slight growth.</li>
      <li>but my butt does sit up a little higher &amp; is looking bigger</li>
      <li>I expected for Maybe it a little early to really rate</li>

<li> I expected for Maybe it a little early to really rate</li>
<li> showering 2X daily made my skin really dry too.</li>
<li> and wow What a total waste of money</li>
<li> Well I had gotten 2 orders of this a few months ago being curious to see if this really work</li>
<li> at least 2X a day too see REAL RESULTS.</li>
<li> Just not fast enough</li>
<li> Not what I expected - we didn&#x27;t read the product description carefully enough.</li>
<li> DONT LET IT DRY OUT</li>
<li> Not dramatically, at least not so far,</li>
<li> It was less the money I spent on it that made me mad, as the time I spent using the product and making sure the product was dry before dressing, washing before using the product, ensuring my bra wasn&#x27;t too tight to allow them to grow, not eating starchy foods</li>
<li> With this and only 1 and a half tubes I have gone from an a to a c cup in a few months.</li>
<li> I have felt the warmness sometimes when i put it on, other than that nothing.</li>
<li> I woke up EXTREMELY dizzy which never happens.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
<li> No results, sent expired bottle so not worth it.</li>
<li> Not a good experience, so I&#x27;m cutting it out after just a few uses just to be safe.</li>
<li> It will take time for improvement about a month ir less to start noticing results.  </li>
<li> I think it is not worth.it waste your money on cream</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I use it everyday and see no difference</li>
<li> Wasted money.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste ur money on this!</li>
<li> Not sure if it works or not.</li>
<li> Well the only disappointment was that I never received my guide book that really sucks ...</li>
<li> , so I bought this hoping to at least fill out my bra...</li>
<li> Frustrating.</li>
<li> Was outdated when I received it.</li>
<li> Ill recommend this item.</li>
<li> and I feel like all the &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34; reviews are fake as well.</li>
<li> and it says it&#x27;s supposed to make you numb or</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and really sad.</li>
<li> Cant say im disappointed.</li>
<li> Im really disappointed !!!</li>
<li> This product burns my skin horribly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work like it said.  Have not seen any results.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!!!!!! In a very short time I went from a b cup too beyond a c cup! I just started using this product an I love it. I&#x27;ve tried every cream, pill and never got results like this an I never had a bottom, I DO now!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was outdated when I received it.</li>
    <li> I used for two months, Did not work at all!</li>
    <li> Used for two months in conjunction with Solaray Female Hormone Blend. No results at all. Pure garbage. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> Thought it was going great at first but then found out I waz pregnant and thats why my breasts were growing so I cant give an accurate review</li>
    <li> expired. I should have read the reviews before buying its really BS for them to sell things that expires the year before.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a big change with my breast but my butt does sit up a little higher &amp; is looking bigger so thank you Bella 💜</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all used it every mongering and after every shower until the bottle was gone then saw it was expired by a year</li>
    <li> I used this product with a &#x27;breast growth activating massage technique&#x27; for three months(again, not wanting to give up after the first bottle) , every morning and every night. No results. It was less the money I spent on it that made me mad, as the time I spent using the product and making sure the product was dry before dressing, washing before using the product, ensuring my bra wasn&#x27;t too tight to allow them to grow, not eating starchy foods ( read it online along with watching the correct massage technique), etc etc. Frustrating. Now in order to do something about the sag after several children, my options are filling them with silicone or having skin removed for a lift.</li>
    <li> No results, sent expired bottle so not worth it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast , first time trying but I don&#x27;t feel any numbness or warmth like directions say</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see full effects; I only used it 1 month. This is due to the fact it feels like icy-hot which wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much as the fact you cannot get it off! It spreads like wildfire like glitter, you can wash your hands over and over and it doesn&#x27;t come off. I would wash my hands multiple times, then touch my food and my mouth would be on fire. Even when it touched my clothes and I touched the clothes a week later, it&#x27;d be there.</li>
    <li> I actually think this made my boobs smaller. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just got the cream in the mail today and it expired on October 10, 2014 I want my money back and fast!!</li>
    <li> I expected for Maybe it a little early to really rate</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet... will keep using.</li>
    <li> Wow. This Truly Works, I&#x27;m Anazed</li>
    <li> Product does not work and when I got it the product was out of date</li>
    <li> Came quickly, I it feels like a cream, haven&#x27;t noticed anything just yet but I also just got it. So no results. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results of what will happen.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work want my money back</li>
    <li> it worked  faster then I thought it would, I like this I will buy this again</li>
    <li> ordered this last month still dont have thats really un cool</li>
    <li> Feelings are hurt. Uugh I used it daily like it said but no progress. I thought I&#x27;d see results for my birthday!</li>
    <li> I just got this cream .. I been using it for 2 weeks it feels like ice-hot , so that make me think its working but I have a question do I have to be drinking the pills it&#x27;s just going to work like that ??  Someone reply pls</li>
    <li> Hi there, I have been using this cream twice  every day. I feel burn on my butt and breast sometime  . It tstill look same, not  grow yet . I think it is not worth.it waste your money on cream the cream  is not  enogh . I order twice.nothing  happened.if you keep ordering it. Ok. I  suggest u go to doctor to ask about itand he will help u.it is not abot surgry. Good uck</li>
    <li> I just received the Bella cream that I order here in amazon and when I open it I found out the is already expired. Im really disappointed !!!</li>
    <li> Product works good just give it time to work. Makes skin very soft I see a difference it feels more even. Well the only disappointment was that I never received my guide book that really sucks ...Ill recommend this item. In my future purchase I would love to receive the highly informative, must-have &amp;#34;The Smart Women&#x27;s Guide to Natural, Surgery-Free Breast Enlargement &amp; Butt Enhancement&amp;#34;. Learn the multiple-strategies to increasing your bust and enhancing your butt even faster! I wish there was more reviews with an image like a before and after picture.</li>
    <li> I do not think it is working. just feel hot and nothing change...</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over three weeks and have not seen any results yet. I have felt the warmness sometimes when i put it on, other than that nothing. I&#x27;m not giving up yet though, hopefully it will succeed what it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> Works. Just not fast enough</li>
    <li> This product is a total scam. Do not buy it! I used the entire tube and got no results at all. It&#x27;s not worth the money and I feel like all the &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34; reviews are fake as well. I&#x27;m not recommending this product/brand to ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected - we didn&#x27;t read the product description carefully enough.</li>
    <li> This product expired 2013 .They have a label on it that says good for 3 years. Didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Used this for three weeks so far. It burned a little at first, but now its like i&#x27;m just putting lotion on my boobs for no reason. showering 2X daily made my skin really dry too. I just feel more insecure than i did before about my body. I really don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone</li>
    <li> Not working at all,and itch my skin,do not recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 months.  It does actually work. I had ussues with the shape and size of my chest after my daughter was born.  I went from an A to a almost aa after that.  With this and only 1 and a half tubes I have gone from an a to a c cup in a few months. It will take time for improvement about a month ir less to start noticing results.  I am happy with the results no plastic surgery needed.</li>
    <li> Just got this product. It&#x27;s expired! Not sure if it works or not. Tried it once and it says it&#x27;s supposed to make you numb or something but it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m sure it would have worked if it wasn&#x27;t expired.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference since I used it. It did make my butt softer tho :P lol</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all for me</li>
    <li> ThIs product is absolutely amazing I love it!</li>
    <li> ive been using this products and it feels like every use i see a little change i am a satisfied customer and will most likey buy more</li>
    <li> This product burns my skin horribly. Zero tingly feeling as described. Have been using for weeks and have seen zero results thus far. Cant say im disappointed. Would not recommend or purchase again.</li>
    <li> I Have Been Using It For Awhile &amp; I Don&#x27;t Notice A Difference But My Boyfriend Said Its Really Working. The Only Problem With This Product Is After Application I Have Almost 10-15 Minutes Of A Burning Sensation... I Guess That Means Its Doing Its Job!</li>
    <li> True I can feel a bit of a difference, but just two days after using this right before bed I woke up EXTREMELY dizzy which never happens. I&#x27;m guessing it can interfere with some medications depending on how it&#x27;s absorbed. Not a good experience, so I&#x27;m cutting it out after just a few uses just to be safe.</li>
    <li> Thank you and fast to.</li>
    <li> **Honest Review** The product  came earlier  than it said, it&#x27;s a pinkish white lotion color and it does get hot.... by hot I mean when u put it on your butt or tits  are going to start getting a warm tingling  sensation after about 5 mins or so. It don&#x27;t burn and it shouldn&#x27;t  be more  than you can handle. However it won&#x27;t sting all the ti.e? Sometimes  when  I would  put the bells cream on. It just felt like a moisturizer. But anyways you HAVE to use the product  at least 2X a day too see REAL RESULTS. I ain&#x27;t gone lie I did it 2 when I could remember but trust that&#x27;s the only way it&#x27;s really  going to show it works. Also use after the shower when ur pores are open. This  overall  a good  Product! Don the look  for Miracle results because  u ain&#x27;t gone  get it but it does  what it says.  P.P.s DONT LET IT DRY OUT</li>
    <li> Product was expired when it arrived. It burned my skin and even with repeated use (I used the whole tube over three weeks) there was no noticeable difference (except sore breasts). When it was gone, I switched to pure pueraria mirifica oil and pueraria mirifica supplements and within a month, I have noticed slight growth. Pueraria mirifica works much better than this stuff; don&#x27;t waste your money or your time with this.</li>
    <li> Made my breast smaller and does nthn for my butt</li>
    <li> Well I had gotten 2 orders of this a few months ago being curious to see if this really work and wow What a total waste of money and I just don&#x27;t see how others can say it does work when it really in fact doesn&#x27;t work at all,  don&#x27;t waste ur money on this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 15 and I barely fit into a size A, so I bought this hoping to at least fill out my bra... Nope. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up. I&#x27;m very disappointed and really sad. Looks like there&#x27;s no hope for us small-breasted girls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now along with oral&lt;br /&gt;Supplement to help speed up the process and it really works. I use it as directed on the box once in morning and after shower. I&#x27;m satisfy with the result so far. Still continue using it until I get the result I want. On to my second tube. I&#x27;m also using it on my butt and it works. Recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> My wife love it..Works like magic..</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and see no difference</li>
    <li> It smells good. Just wished it worked faster</li>
    <li> It really does work! Not dramatically, at least not so far, but I definitely see more fullness.</li>
