<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for at home treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely strong and will tingle/burn, but as they say &amp;#34;no pain / no gain&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I tried removing with warm water, but that increases the tingle so now I just use cold water on a wash cloth and then a light cleanse after.</li>
    <li> Good product, I like the price, it&#x27;s not terribly uncomfortable to apply and delivers results.</li>
    <li> Works great, put on for about 20 minutes and peeled little bit works well</li>
    <li> Great peel for my acne prone skin. It got rid most of the little bumps that were clogged pores overnight! Great peel!</li>
    <li> Was not expecting results this fast!</li>
    <li> WAITING TO USE ON SON TO SEE IF IT WORKS</li>
    <li> Am using on my knee, am a kenya woman and i need to know if it works on black skin, i have old scars and black marks on my knee and i have left this on for 5 mins and no sting to itch nothing. Will finish the bottle and see how that goes</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who has sensitive skin, and she really loves how the peel makes her skin look and feel. Will buy again for her.</li>
    <li> Love it! Helps combat breakouts and helps a bit with oil control. Seems to help with wrinkle prevention as well. I have been using it for over a year and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have a cyst under the skin that got swollen.  I wanted to bring the swelling down and later remove the cyst surgically.  I didn&#x27;t like taking drugs that has bad side effects, so I decided to try a salicylic peel.  Since the skin was inflamed, it will sting like crazy but I keeped applying it everyday and peeled off the dead skins.  After two weeks, the swelling was gone and it didn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> This is my first amazon review ever! I just had to write one up because I found this product super effective! The first time around I had the peel on for 45 seconds. I noticed I was glowing right afterwards, my face automatically brightened up, the dark spots were still visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this again a week later and OMG! I felt like the dark spots decreased by 50%. I was sooo happy. Today I&#x27;ve only received compliments at work saying my face was glowing and just totally brightened up! I must say I am happy to look into the mirror again. I&#x27;ve been battling a seriious case of acne for the past 6 months and have tried everything. Nothing else has given me results like this.</li>
    <li> Worked about as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year now and I would say that it&#x27;s an ok product. I am black with adult acne and hyperpigmentation (dark marks). It did lessen the intensity of my breakouts (especially during my periods) and seem to lighten my dark marks. But that&#x27;s all it did, lighten my dark spots (it didn&#x27;t go away). My breakouts  were less frequent and overall I had less bumps. It&#x27;s good because it decreased my extreme dependency on my daily acne treatment routine (cleanse and put moisturizer 2 times a day). Now if I accidently missed a day or 2, it wasn&#x27;t so bad. But while using this product you have to be mindful that you have put on sunscreen on sunny days for the dark spots to lighten. But it can be used on black skin, I heard products like these make dark spots worse but it didn&#x27;t for me. And I felt that during winter times it was to harsh for my skin, therefore I would switch to microderm. treatment (which is &#x27;supposedly&#x27; better to use during winter...still on the fence). I didn&#x27;t like that in order to get the same effect, that I would have to leave it longer and increase the acidity. It just felt to harsh on my skin. I just took a break from it during the winter months (a time when my acne isn&#x27;t too bad) and just made sure not to skip on my daily routine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for my acne problem. I have acne that flares up when my face gets oily from a long day. The acne is type you can&#x27;t pop, seems to be under layers of skin and is red....yuck. I used this stuff before I go to bed. It does burn and my face gets red but it&#x27;s manageable....I apply the stuff for 2 mins, 2 times with a cold wash in between. I wake up with a tight dry face and huge improvement in my acne, and my oil levels over the next few days are great.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, I can use conveniently at home, and every time use it I get results. It&#x27;s gradual but very effective on scars, dark spots and acne.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this product does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Love it! Face felt smoother after 1 application.</li>
    <li> I have been using the gel peel with great results.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into the world of gel peels. I followed the directions and the first usage was really &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34;. I would definitely read through the directions if you are new to using peels. Subsequent uses, I learned the right balance of how much to apply and for how long. Each person&#x27;s comfort level will be different - so I can only suggest using it a few times before making a final decision on usability.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I noticed much in terms of addressing some of my older discolorations (spots, old scars) but I do think that my skin surface is much smoother and some of the finer lines looked to be less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;A small bottle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars - I don&#x27;t have a point of reference for it&#x27;s efficacy... but I am pleased and am glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> So far so good...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only purchased this last week so I might need to come back and review this again but...&lt;br /&gt;so far I love it! Used it once and while it did sting quite a bit,  it left my face smooth and feeling healthy. My acne skin looks better this week but that could be due to a variety of other reasons so I shall return with more details... :-)</li>
    <li> The package arrived ahead of time. I absolutely love this!!! I am not one to write reviews but I had to write my first one for this. I saw a major improvement of the vanishing of dark facial spots around the 3rd week of using the peel. I use a small fan during the application so that I can manage to keep it on longer than a minute.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with moderate acne for the last 20 years.  Some products help for a while and then, it&#x27;s as though my skin develops a resistance to them (including perscription medications).  They just stop making any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, has more dramatically improved my skin than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I use it once every 5 days and my skin is measurably clearer.  I haven&#x27;t have much peeling--just a little stinging when the product was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I just hope it continues to work.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Use this once a month and your skin will be flawless! It has improved my complexion and reduced dark spots I had because it kicked out the dead cells and facilitated new skin cells to make my face smooth and blemish free. I wash this off with cool water and use witch hazel toner and vitamin c serum to hydrate my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really good. It cleared my acne so fast. It burns really bad, but it works. Try it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; Works wonders and my blemishes and dark spots have been deleted :)</li>
    <li> This stuff will burn the sh!t out of your face.  Be careful.  Make sure you read and follow the directions.  If you are a Differin user your skin will be even more sensitive to it and easily burn.  Follow the directions regarding how long to leave it on or how often you can do it.  More is not better.  More is more irritating.  They are not kidding when they say that this stuff is professional grade, it is serious stuff.  And because of that, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t afford to have a dermatologist or an esthetitian do this for me, and I don&#x27;t like people looking closely at my skin anyway, it makes me uncomfortable.  But this product can give a professional level result at home for a very small fraction of the price you&#x27;d pay to walk into a spa or doctor&#x27;s office.  It does hurt.  It is not fun to do.  You do get used to it, that&#x27;s why you follow the directions and build up to longer times.  It will make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so you MUST wear sunscreen all the time once you start doing this, or you can get dark spots (melasma).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does hurt, that&#x27;s what acid does.  It burns.  But this product is not harsh on my skin in ways it&#x27;s not supposed to be.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin stripped-feeling, and within just a few minutes of taking it off, my face feels fine and I&#x27;m glad I did it. I have some redness afterwards, I don&#x27;t do it five minutes before I need to put on makeup.  I do it before bed or in the middle of a Saturday when I&#x27;m not leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing fewer blemishes and my skin looks plumper and more youthful when I do this every few weeks.  My dark spots are drastically reduced.  This product works, so put on your big girl panties and suck it up.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as promised. If you follow the directions carefully, you can have a new face in about thirty minutes time!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife at her request. The product arrived quickly and was well packaged. She has applied this twice and has commented to me that her skin has been much softer and I agree. Her skin looks and feels softer and overall appears more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to use much of this product to get good results, and the bottle will last for a long time if used properly.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is happy with the product and that makes me happy as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions on this product please feel free to ask.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to use on a lesion that developed on my child&#x27;s legs.  I do not suggest you do this without consulting a physician.  I was actually told to just \\&quot;wait it out\\&quot; and the bumps would slowly disappear.  But my boy is a boy and wanted to go swimming this summer.  This product was applied for a minute several times per week to areas and they disappeared in a couple weeks!</li>
    <li> i have not been consistent with it but the little time i have used it i saw a lot of difference.</li>
    <li> Definitily cleared up my skin, will buy in future and would recommend to friends. worked on face and shoulders. I used a cotton ball to apply to skin and left on for time that is specified in package</li>
    <li> I use these acids for my clients. Great for clearing up breakouts</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this product didn&#x27;t work for me but worked for so many others. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I felt ZERO tingling or burning. I tried it several times and even left it on my face for an HOUR. Zip, zero, zilch. No burning, no peeling, nothing. So either I got a bad batch, or my skin is tougher than steel. Good thing there is an excellent return policy!</li>
    <li> Used this because at 31 I am getting strange patches of acne.  This product works as described.  It does BURN !  But I can take it. :)  It helped my acne come to the surface, but caused dryness/peeling in those areas a day or two after using the product.  However, I have not had any NEW breakouts...so that&#x27;s good.  I like it and will keep using it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Have battled varying degrees of hormonal cystic acne (tricky, under-the-skin, painful stuff that leaves hyperpigmentation) and after getting salicylic peels at the dermatologists, I&#x27;ve tried a few brands for home use.  This stuff is thicker, more like a gel, versus many other brands, so it&#x27;s easier to apply and you can see where you are applying. Plus this type gives me less aggressive peeling/burning, so I don&#x27;t need a week of recovery time.  I only do it for a few minutes, so I can use it more often -- that seems to keep the acne at bay.  Afterwards my redness is lessened, and after a couple days of recovery, my skin looks great. Quality stuff.</li>
    <li> Yes, yes. I noticed a difference after the first use. Pay attention if you don&#x27;t like the burn feeling. I did get a slight burn but it has eased after more uses. The best way I can describe the benefit is after you remove it by cleaning it off with cold water your skin looks smoother and tighter. I&#x27;m 36.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I have spent a lot of time on the golf course the last few years and started having a minor issue with sun damage on my forehead and cheeks so my girlfriend suggested I try a peel. I have fair skin and burn fairly easily but never had a problem with hyper pigmentation until the last few years. I bought this product and applied it and felt nothing. I then went over my cheeks and forehead a second time and really slathered it on there and waited a full 10 minutes before washing it off and still nothing. My face did turn very slightly red but there was no burning or tingling and no peeling. I have used it 3 times now in the last 3 weeks, about half the bottle, and see no difference at all. I have read other reviews here saying maybe they got a bad batch or something but who knows. Maybe guys skin is less sensitive from shaving and needs a stronger peel? I don&#x27;t know, but this product did absolutely nothing so I can&#x27;t recommend it, at least not for guys.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great for chronic acne sufferers.</li>
    <li> Love this company.  My face is getting young every time.  I love all their products... : )  Thank you</li>
    <li> Sorry to say the information on this product was misleading and not what I wanted at all.  I should return it.  SD</li>
    <li> Attn. Anyone out there looking for a good safe product or even those who have used peels  before look no further. This is the product.  I use the salycilic peel due to my problems with acne. I saw results immediately.my skin was taught smooth. I also like the additional additives like green tea everyone knows how good that product is for oily skin.  If your new to chemical peeps or some one that has used them before don&#x27;t look any further,this is the product for you. You also can&#x27;t beat the price. It also came to my house in 2 days. I&#x27;m telling you this is the product.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> The peel is amazing! Feel the difference in your skin right away. You need to read and follow instructions carefully though... I have had peels before so I know that my skin wouldnt have any reaction, but if its a first time you should be careful and not keep it for too long.&lt;br /&gt;I am also very happy with shipping time and wrapping.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin with terrible blackheads, some whiteheads and acne, that never go away. There were times when I would not want to look in the mirror that&#x27;s how much I hated my skin. I started using salicylic peels and products years ago, but whatever I&#x27;ve used their effects were very temporary. THIS PEEL is very good and it&#x27;s effects last!!! A week after the first use of this product, my skin was still not as oily as it used to get the second day after using other salicylic peels or products! Just do not keep it on your skin longer than a minute or two the first two uses-otherwise your skin can become red, and flake a bit. Plus, use  a god moisturiser- non oily and and non-comedogenic, and do not go out in the sun for a few days after the peel. THIS PRODUCT will flush out ALL the blackhead, whitehead amd acne causing sebum and bacteria! After, already 3 uses, my skin looks flawless and feels so smooth, I just can&#x27;t believe it. I am so happy with this peel, and would like to thank the people who created such an excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> My teenage son had a Salicylic Peel at the Derm&#x27;s office and our copay was $50 - no redness or peeling but his complexion/pores slightly improved.  I decided to look for a similar product online to use at home.  I chose this gel peel from Perfect Image based on the reviews at the time.  He has used the product at least once a week since mid March and is experiencing continued improvement with his complexion/pores - scars are fading, less oily skin and very few new breakouts.  I&#x27;m ready to reorder and looking forward to using the peel myself.  I&#x27;ll also be buying the pre peel cleanser from Perfect Image to help remove oils from skin prior to applying the  peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an over the counter product so have reasonable expectations and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It peeled my skin, but I don&#x27;t think it made my skin look any nicer at the end of the day. I think the only way to do that is with proper nutrition (more fat, less sugar).</li>
    <li> Very good product it work for acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product/ peel along with others of the same brand, but this is my favorite one! love this peel! I wish they would make a stronger one too!! I&#x27;ve used this peel along with others of the same brand!&lt;br /&gt;Helps keep skin clear and gets rid of pimples quicker! Reduces the redness and size.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me..Will give you a bad cold sore breakout like someone else mentioned so make sure to stay away from lips.. Didn&#x27;t notice any frosting, didnt really clear up acne.. I have used a few other peels and this one is the worst out of all of them</li>
    <li> awesome product. this is my favorite peel to use.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, AFTER A COUPLE OF TREATMENTS I CAN SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY ACNE, MY SKIN NEVER LOOK BETTER. I WILL ORDER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT AND I GOT MY PRODUCT ON TIME. THANKS..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 11 months now. It is my all time favorite product for my face - hands down! I am 41 yrs old and I have combination skin that is very sensitive. i have a few tips about using this product to get the maximum benefits...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is key.  With Consistent use you will see less break outs, less redness, better absorbed serums and moisturizers, brighter skin - glowing skin. I like to use this product once a week after I shower and wash my face. I follow with toner, Mario Badescu vitamin serum, and CeraVe moisturizer (i started using that after reading other reviews on this product). If I use the peel at night I will follow those steps with a thin layer of Aquaphor and go to bed. I always use sunblock during the day. I try not to wear makeup for a day after the peel. I  usually don&#x27;t wear much makeup anyway.  After you use the peel consistently you will find your skin looking more amazing each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say I love this product and your skin will glow I truly mean it. I have never had glowing skin until this product! I have tried more that my fair share of products, including expensive brand names.&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident with glowing skin!</li>
    <li> So far good results. Easy to use. Following the directions is a must.</li>
    <li> I used to take trips to the esthetician in order to get what I could do myself at home, treating acne and other acne scars on my face.  This peel will sting as it is a salicylic acid peel.  I recommend using a bowl and applying it with a clean face brush.  Then rinse off and follow up with a cooling face redness reducing mask or a clay mask.  During the following few days, be sure to apply heavy cream and suncreen at all times.</li>
    <li> crazy facial peel. kills bacteria helps with swelling especially after extraction.</li>
    <li> I used to perviously have acne and after a certain amount of time I was left with scars, a great amount of blackheads, and sudden breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this peel two times a week for 2 minutes each now and I absolutely love it! At first I only left it on for about 30 seconds because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react, but after that I&#x27;ve been slowly increasing the time I leave it on as I get used to it. My skin is starting to peel subtlety now after 3-4 weeks of this peel so I always keep lotion with me, but my face has cleared up so quickly! If I have a breakout or a couple and I use the peel, the next morning their is a significant difference! It might not clear up completely, but it will certainly dry up and heal within the week. This product may seem small but I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months and I haven&#x27;t even made it half way empty, it still looks as if I&#x27;ve just bought it. If you follow the directions exactly, and slowly increase in the time you leave it on, this peel will do you wonders :D&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck to you all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using salicylic peels for awhile now and I&#x27;ve used other brands. I like this brand the most by far. First of all it looks like a very professional product in the way that it is packaged. The quality the product itself is very good as well. The gel form makes it easier to apply and it seems less harmful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product on my face and the results are pretty instant. My husband could tell that my face looks brighter and fresher which I&#x27;m really happy with that. I also used it for a spot treatment when I had a breakout and it helped with it a lot too. The peel made my pimple dry out pretty fast so it wasnt as red as it first was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I highly recommend the product. Fast shipping and it wasn&#x27;t too pricey for the quality that you get. I&#x27;m thinking about buying more products from this company.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great peel! Very gentle, yet efficient, no down time, short recovery, fast acting!  I have got rid of 90% of my problems in 3 peels done 10 days between each. This peel is if you have oily, blotchy, wide pores and a lot of little breakages and blackheads. Due to climate change, stress and probable hormone dis balance, I ve got all above mentioned problems. Now with this peel and few other products - my skin is flawless, radiant and 10 years younger just in 1 month. Peel makes your skin flake only next day, and for only a day, maximum 2, which is easily covered with light make up. I have sensitive skin, although it became oily, it is sensitive and dihydrated. Peel didn&#x27;t make it more sensitive or gave any allergic reactions. No sun and cover yourself  with 100 protection if you go even for a short time(own opinion too).  I would recommend to read instructions carefully and not overdo the peel - better less time, more peels. Own opinion. Now my pores are back to normal, 90% of little pimples, breakouts are gone, oily texture of the skin is gone back to normal, little tiny wrinkles and any sun damage - are gone!  Skin is much lighter, radiant, younger, not oily and pores have minimized.  Love it so much that recommended to 3 friends and they are happy with their results (they bought other peels for their needs but this particular company)</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift along with the post cream. Overall satisfied with the results and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This item worked great for me. I used it to lighten my skin, smooth my complexion and control blackheads forming. I have very sensitive skin so initial use of the product was painful, but worth it. Used for 3 weeks and noticed the difference. Have to remember to stay out of the sun and MOISTURIZING is very important.</li>
    <li> I will admit that I was skeptical about this product, but it was a reasonable price, so I thought I would try. Im not sure that i trusted that the reviews touting this as a miracle product, but it has worked wonderfully for me.  Some background:  I never head a serious acne problem, but I am now in my mid 40s, have had some mild adult acne over the last few years that is probably hormonally related...little acne bumps on my forehead, temples and chin, especially before my period. The first time I used this product I was totally freaked out...within a day after using, I developed some major zits, the likes of which I haven&#x27;t seen in decades...I am talking big teenage red with white pus nasty looking things.  Yuck.  There were about four of them and this lasted about five days.  I was scared to use it again, but I did a month later, and have been using it every 3-4 weeks since then... for about 4 months now.  I have not seen another pimple!  Not one!  The mild acne has totally cleared up, my face is even, non greasy, and I think it has even evened out my coloring which is now a nice fair with just the right amount of pinkish tint.  I have been very pleased with this product and would highly recommend.  I am even considering having my tween use it, as she is now developing acne.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best product for acne and dark spots. A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
    <li> this works great and leaves your face feeling baby smooth, the only advice i can give is make sure you have no open wounds, pimples or any open pores otherwise it will burn the top layer of ur skin and leave u scared purple for a few weeks til it goes away. other then that it was delivered quickly , the directions were simple and it is an est product to use. i would reccomend this to thos who dont want to spend all that money on going to a get a chemical peel. this can be done at home and not as drastic. if you have senistive skin i wouldnt reccomment this for you . personally i loved it and will order again or other products from perfect image. good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have not had the results of others. This product burns my face, leaves red blotches afterward, and has not helped remove any of my white heads, black heads, or acne. For the price I paid and the reviews I read, I was expecting an exceptional product.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my dark spots on my face. After 2 applications of the peel my dark spots are barely noticable. My skin tone looks much more even and it leaves my face feeling very soft and clean. Before I apply the product, I clean my face with alcohol wipes until there&#x27;s no more dirt on the pads. Then I apply it with a cotton ball and use a fan to help with the stinging sensation. I also bought one for my mom and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this! My skin hasn&#x27;t ever &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; but it definitely smooths my skin. It also clears my scars, they are red and uneven. This totally did the trick! I ❤️ It!!!</li>
    <li> When you get those scabby looking spots after a nasty zit, this works wonders in making them disappear within a couple of days. Follow the directions carefully, I bet the few disgruntled reviewers surely did not appreciate how potent 20% of salicylic acid can feel on your skin. I don&#x27;t believe I have sensitive skin, but even I felt a tingle after going past the recommended application time. It was nowhere near pain or discomfort (for my scale), but I can see others with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t follow Perfect Image&#x27;s detailed instructions suffering a few moments of discomfort. It&#x27;s definitely not a gel you apply on large affected skin regions; tackle the noticeable spots first, leaving just a drop of gel. As you see those clear up, tackle the next batch sized smaller, and so on. Eventually you&#x27;ll reach a point where you&#x27;re just taking care of a random blemish/scar here and there. Throughout all of this, keep washing and caring for your skin as you normally would. Don&#x27;t expect frequent high doses of salicylic acid to be the end-all of your skin care treatment, continue to wash your face and affected areas daily. I see this product as the final piece in accomplishing smooth skin, and now can&#x27;t imagine my whole process working without it. With the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel I purchased, I can confidently say that this is a very powerful weapon for skin blemish warfare. I sincerely hope it works well for you too!</li>
    <li> This product was really good for my oily skin. Now, I can to control my blackheads and acne. I used twice per week and the results was fast.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every 5 days for over a month and a half now.  This product did a great job of reducing pore size and reducing the number of new break outs that I would usually have.  I do have pores on my cheeks and chin that never seem to clear and while this peel did a good job of reducing their appearance, this peel still hasn&#x27;t cleared them.  If you have acne that eventually clears over time, then this is probably a great maintenance peel to use to keep your skin clear.  If you have acne that just never goes away, this peel will help, but this peel alone might not completely clear your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had skin issues lately with clogged pores and occasional deep pimples that haven&#x27;t gotten better with any other treatment (differin, acanya, aczone, etc). The only thing keeping my skin fairly under control was a coal tar wash, but that didn&#x27;t penetrate deeply enough to really reduce the deep pimples in size for quite a while, although it helped more noticeably with the clogged pores (not completely though). I got fed up and just searched for the best rated acne treatment on Amazon and this was in the Top 3 so I decided to give it a shot based on the reviews I read...Let me tell you, it was worth it! I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I saw immediate improvement. I know this won&#x27;t work for every skin type, but I&#x27;m glad to say that it seems to be working for me. The directions say that a normal treatment is to be 1 to 4 minutes, depending on your skin and tolerance but to do 30 seconds for the first treatment. I did the recommended 30 seconds, then rinsed my face with cold water for a couple of minutes and let my skin rest. I noticed right away that the oil and sebum in my pores was drawn to the surface (little white dots on my pores), or perhaps my dead skin had cleared to reveal it. Either way, I decided to repeat the treatment and did a second round of 30 seconds and that cleared most of the white spots off my pores and my pores looked somewhat smaller (not a huge difference, but noticeable to me). The treatment itself stung quite a bit, and my skin felt tight afterwards, but it was nothing too uncomfortable or unexpected (after all, it is acid on your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this product once a week and will update my review once I have a more substantial number of uses under my belt. But like I said, I saw an improvement after the first use! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** Now that I&#x27;ve used the product multiple times over the last few weeks, I wanted to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in my skin since I started using the peel. I started off doing two 30 second peels during my initial couple of uses After that I used it for about 90 seconds and have not gone above that time. After each use I had some minor peeling, nothing that you can really consider \\&quot;downtime\\&quot; or major. I mostly experienced the peeling around the edges of my nose/cheek and between my bottom lip and chin. It would appear one to two days following the peel and after washing my face in the shower twice, all peeling skin was always gone, so really nothing to really worry about.&lt;br /&gt;I kept my skin regiment mostly the same and continued regularly washing my face with the tar wash I mentioned previously, but I added the acid peel as a once weekly addition and I started using a new moisturizer, if you can call it that. My sister-in-law recommended rose hip oil as she had heard great things about it and I&#x27;ve been massaging two to three drops onto my face each night before bed. While I still have one major acne spot that is visible, it is healing and has improved drastically and the second spot is almost fully gone, there just a slight pink hue on my skin that is easily covered with a bit of light foundation. I&#x27;ve had one small pimple develop since using the acid peel, but nothing drastic or serious. Overall, my skin looks healthier, it has a nice glow to it, and it seems smoother and my pores are smaller in appearance. All in all, this product has worked for me! :) Can&#x27;t wait to see what will happen once this last major stubborn acne spot is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product countless times since I last purchased but I still have some left. Unlike my other peels that are liquidy this one has a thicker consistency and more is more gel like. Smell doesn&#x27;t bother me. This is some serious stuff, I can never leave it on more than like 1 minute or else my face will get dark and take FOREVER to peel. Yes, your face will peel in small pieces not like thick snake peeling you get with higher percentages of TCA. Overall, using this with several other products has helped me manage my acne and now I know my skin better than ever. It also made me realize how important salicylic acid is in my regime but perhaps in a toner... On the other hand I will not be repurchasing this product because I don&#x27;t like using chemical peels on my face anymore as I&#x27;ve been getting Laser Genesis. Oh and I also do not like that when I rinse the peel of with water it tacks up like shredded white paper. But I&#x27;d still recommend this to other who have severe acne because SA does help a lot</li>
    <li> Really made a difference with rosacea. Knocks it right off my face.  Skin in general looks tighter. And it takes a fraction of the time other salicylic acid products take.</li>
    <li> Great Product! This was my first peel, but definitely not my last. I put it on using a fan brush for about 10 minutes now, but when i first started i could only handle 2 minutes. I then wash it off with cool water, and a drop of cetaphil. Then liberally apply a good moisturizer such as Ceravue, and you will have the softest, clearest skin the next day. Note. this peel doesn&#x27;t actually cause my skin to peel off, so its great cause you can go out the next day because it requires little recovery time.</li>
    <li> Did not help, very smelly like glue, did not help my situation at all, may be for someone else but not for me</li>
    <li> I use this about once a week and my skin looks and feels awesome. I suffer from adult acne and I had a lot of scaring on my face, this helped clear my skin including getting rid of the scaring. I use a cold wet towel to remove it. Give it time and you will see results.</li>
    <li> Not bad but a little pricey for the benefits.</li>
    <li> I thought its a gimmick and I&#x27;ll be mad at myself for wasting the money. Couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong! Skin feels refreshed with no redness or discoloration.  I can definitely see a difference. Love it</li>
    <li> Buy it! You&#x27;ve probably spent wayyyyy more on facial products that didn&#x27;t work anyway, so what&#x27;s another drop in the bucket?! Except.... This actually works. After a month (4 treatments, each 1week apart) my normal &amp;#34;train wreck&amp;#34; of skin is dare I say...nice? Huge difference in even tone and clarity. No more pimples. Pores significantly shrunk or magically disappeared. Fine lines around mouth and eyes hardly noticeable. HUGE brown spot in middle of forehead left from pregnancy almost gone! And with priority shipping it&#x27;s only $34??? Come on people? You&#x27;ve spent that on make-up and baseball caps trying to hide bad skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I will say... On my 3rd application I purposely left it on for aprx 4 minutes. The next two days my skin was noticeably red and brown under one eye and I kinda freaked out hoping I hadn&#x27;t scarred my self for life. Nope! It peeled away in about a week and my skin looked new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a product on the market that I&#x27;ve used that will produce &amp;#34;more dramatic&amp;#34; results quicker, however you need a week to 10 days of hiding out because you look like a hell beast. So this, nectar of the Gods, was much more gracious in that you can pretty much go about your business and no one will tell you are de-leatherizing your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps my beautiful peeps!</li>
    <li> I read the insert directions very carefully, followed them and very happy with the results. I washed my face &amp; neck completely, then used rubbing alcohol on some cotton ball pads for extra cleanliness around my nose and chin.  At 44, I have very few wrinkles on my chin area and almost none around my eyes,never much in the acne area except after a chocolate treat... I decided to use it to reduce my pore size and Wow -- I am impressed. After one use they are almost to nothing! I first applied the gel to my neck, partially unsure of the outcome &amp; mostly because I wanted to start to diminish the discoloration due to --many yrs of the sun.  Left on for 6-7 mins and no burning at all. After about 4 mins of my neck application, I tried on my face. They recommended to start at forehead and move down, so I did.  When I got to the check area, it did start to tingle/burn a little. But it was bearable.  I left on my face for 1 1/2-2 mins total.  Outcome - very impressed... Only downfall is slight peeling around the creases of my nose for the first three days.  Recommend: Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize and no makeup for atleast a day.</li>
    <li> I am a male adult that has battled acne from the time I was a teenager back in the 80&#x27;s.  This is the second time I have bought salicylic acid to use on my face, the first time was a different brand.  The product from Perfect Image is better to me because it was more comfortable on my face, had a much better smell and the bottle it came in was easier to use with the dropper...definitely get one with a dropper no matter where you get one!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very faithful with using, I&#x27;m sure my face would be in much better shape if I did.  When I do use it regularly though, it does help.  Tightening the pores on my nose is where I believe it helps the most.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck all!!!  I wouldn&#x27;t wish acne on anyone.</li>
    <li> My face always gets oily by the end of the day. I used to have to keep makeup remover wipes to clean my face later in the day while I&#x27;m at work. After using this just a couple times, I noticed that not only was my face not getting oily at the end of the day anymore but I actually had to start using face lotion. My acne has gotten a lot better, too. I still get some but it&#x27;s not as bad and what I do get isn&#x27;t the painful pressure ones anymore. Recently, I tried a new way to shave and started getting razor bumps and this stuff takes care of them also. I would definitely recommend this product. There is a little discomfort but I just keep a fan on my face until I wash it off. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and am about to order my 3rd bottle and so far, I haven&#x27;t found any negatives to this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect Image always puts out a good product, I have also ordered most of the their other peels to compare and all seem to do their job, so I would definitely order from perfect image again. the prices are very reasonable in comparison to other companies for virtually the same ingredients.  I have used Retinol and Retin-A so I don&#x27;t get a lot of peeling but they always make my face very smooth and keep the wrinkles away.  Remember people, its really about PREVENTATIVE Maintenance....nothing can really erase wrinkles (get real)....only just make them look less noticeable. To this day, facelifts are really the only thing that can take them away</li>
    <li> First thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that has reduced the appearance of my pores...had to leave it on a bit longer than was recommended in order for my skin to actually peel.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a chemical peel at home. Turns out, it really wasn&#x27;t too frightening at all. First time I used it, left it on for only 30 seconds. It was only barely uncomfortable. I was surprised that some skin actually rolled off when I rinsed the product off. Cool, the peel worked!  My skin was much softer and somewhat lighter. Since then, I now use it on my hands and LOVE the results!  My hands look less dry, less noticeable age spots, and less dull and wrinkly.  I apply two layers of the product on as the instructions say you can, to maximize the results after cleaning the skin with rubbing alcohol first. For me, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any drier than before and I&#x27;ve had no flakiness or redness, but I do moisturizer heavily.  Love this peel!  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Incredible results. Highly recommend. Leaves your skin feeling fantastic. Also very dangerous so be careful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product October of 2014 and still have about 1/4 left. I rarely had problems with pimples as a teen (random small pimples, whiteheads, and maybe blackheads), but during my late 20s (turned 30 last year) I started getting hormonal cystic pimples! I would get them during menstruation a couple of times a year. My skin started becoming more dry and sensitive (I think partly due to birth control pills) and I started getting bumps on my cheeks. I thought it might be Rosacea because I always had soft, delicate skin, but I don&#x27;t that was the case. I tried some products for Rosacea, but it would only dry out my cheeks. Not sure if it was due to hormones or age, but my skin was a bit stressed out. I mean I could hide it with a bit of make-up (was never a heavy make-up person), but I wanted to fix my skin. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for the acne, but it really didn&#x27;t help much. This peel really has helped settle my skin. I think the combination of my hormones getting back to normal, this peel, and me trying out more organic oils (I use almond oil for my skin) has helped my skin immensely. My skin has settled down now and I&#x27;m back to my normal self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get whiteheads on my chin and this product really helps my whiteheads slowly disappear. At first, I used the product every week and it helped my skin a lot. I could tell the difference pretty quickly. Now I use it mostly for spot treatment and once a month I&#x27;d do my whole face. It stings, but you can see your pores shrink to nothing! I have small pores to begin with, but with the peel they seem nonexistent. Be careful, not to pick at the scabs or it&#x27;ll turn into a brown spot. But, it does go away after a while. It&#x27;s a great peel. Pimples go away pretty fast. If I get a pimple I just do a spot treatment and it&#x27;ll be gone within the next few days, depending on the size. Also, be careful not to leave it on too long if you have sensitive skin. It is very potent, so test out your skin. You can leave it longer as your skin gets used to it, but it can be red for the next 10 min. I usually do a full face peel at night. That way I can put on my oils/serum afterwards and it&#x27;ll be nice and soft in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH! Before I forget, I felt my face was purging all the nasty stuff during the first month or so (give or take). I had breakouts, but once it settled down it was smooth sailing from there. And, please, MOISTURIZE! It can be drying. It is a peel after all. I use almond oil and have recently been using a Vitamin C serum. It&#x27;s helps the process. If your skin is dry it&#x27;ll try to create more oil/sebum, so it is best to moisturize your skin. Natural/Organic oils have worked best for me thus far.</li>
    <li> Loved the tingly feeling! My pores look smaller and my face feels cleaner on average already. I use it once a week and am planning on alternating with either the glycolic acid or lactic acid peel from the same company, once I decide which one I want! So basically, so far so good. My skin tolerates it well and I haven&#x27;t had any problems, just follow the instructions and you will be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying it on my my back acne for the first time, I hope I see great results.</li>
    <li> I think this product must have some type of grit ingredient.  It went on very smoothly but instantly I had grit substance on my face.  I have used other products that loosened dead skin cells but they didn&#x27;t have this much abrasive reaction.  I washed my face as directed but I had a very hard time getting the gritty texture off of my skin.  I have been a little hesitant to use it again but after I finally removed all of it ............it did leave my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> It STINGS!!! But my face was noticeably clearer a couple days after I used it. Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long!</li>
    <li> Love this! Not too harsh if left on for a minute or two. I was seeing a dermatologist, prescribed antibiotics and Retin-A, and I *much* prefer this! This peel does a wonderful job of controlling acne and keeping my skin clear. Yes,it will burn, but you will get used to it. So happy! This along with clearzine vitamins and nanocleanese face wash (**do not use when using this peel but rather inbetween...switch to a non harsh cleanser like cetaphyl when using this) have allowed me to only visit my derm when I need to do a mole check.</li>
    <li> I applied this to my skin for a couple of weeks. it burns a little but it did not exfoliate my skin, the marks and blemishes are still visible.&lt;br /&gt;Pass this one up and save your money.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd peel, and my face is looking clear. I did a lot of research and knew that buying this product would safe me money instead of getting a peel done professionally. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product, it is easy to do this on yourself.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really see a different about this product and i have used it for like 5-6 times now. But the shipping was awesome.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  This peel is not too strong nor too weak.  It says to use a couple of times per week but I find I can use every other day and get just the right amount of enhancement.  Shrinks pores dramatically, gets rid of blackheads, even ones that seem to have been there forever, and no noticeable peeling or reddening.  Just nice results!  For reference I am 58, a redhead and have fair freckled skin.</li>
    <li> I must say that for 20% it is strong enough to battle my current acne problems. I might try 30% in the future, but so far 20% is just what I needed. The first time i tried it, I applied small drops on my forehead and cheeks right on my problem areas. I used my finger to apply it. Do follow directions. If you don&#x27;t have the exact products to do a preliminary face wash, just use any face soap that doesn&#x27;t have acne fighting ingredients. Basically, anything creamy and gentle works just fine. Using cotton pad wastes a lot of products since it gets absorbed into the cotton right away, so I used my finger from now on. Applied it to the areas and waited around 1.5-2 minutes before washing it off. It will hurt and you will see white residue which is your skin peeling off. Use cool or cold water to wash the product off, it will help with the pain and will calm the skin. I used it so far around 6-7 times, small amounts to problem spots and even around my neck and shoulders. It works great as spot treatment. Do let your face cool down and dab it with towel, don&#x27;t rub, and after about half an hour apply gentle moisturizer with SPF. Be careful though, I suggest using moisturizer out of a pump (or tube) rather than an open container, since your skin now is susceptible to catching bacteria and your whole treatment will be wasted. You need to use something uncontaminated on your skin, so that you don&#x27;t develop further skin problems.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this peel it is great for slightly blemished skin and also used as an exfoliant.It is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure other people have had good luck with this, but I am not sure it&#x27;s for me.  I have used half the bottle now, about 6 or 7 peels once a week, and I&#x27;m currently dealing with extreme burns around my chin from only 2 and a half minutes.  Until this time I thought it was working alright, though, but nothing I&#x27;d re-order.  I have read other reviews where people leave it on for 5 minutes, then repeat it again right away...I would not have any skin left!  I did this last peel on Wednesday night and it&#x27;s now Saturday night with my whole chin red and swollen.  I will stick with Philosophy Microdelivery peel, that works amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a god send. I have been using it for about a month now to help with the hormonal breakouts I experience on my chin and jaw line and to help fade the terrible hyperpigmentation I have all over my chin from years of picking at my skin (gross, I know). I must say, my hyperpigmentation has improved dramatically and I hardly get any breakouts anymore. I use it once a week and leave it on for a minute and a half. It burns/stings but the feeling is bareable. Within one- two days of using my skin will start to peel. I never thought I&#x27;d be able to get rid of all the hyperpigmentation on my face. It was really bad. I thought I&#x27;d have to go to the dermatologist to get those laser treatments done to improve my skin but this stuff has done wonders and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Although, if your skin is VERY sensitive, I&#x27;d reconsider purchasing this product.. It really really burns when you use it but you can really feel and see it working in your skin. Fanning your face can help relieve some of the burning sensation. My skin is always sooooo soft and vibrant after using the product. I love it!!</li>
    <li> faded my dark spots and acne scars. takes time, but you see beginning of results right away.</li>
    <li> Since my 30&#x27;s (now in my 40&#x27;s) I have suffered from acne. Nothing ever worked. I tried the dermatologist and prescriptions that never worked. I tried OTC stuff from pharmacies and high end products from department stores. Even home remedies. Some would work for a little while then suddenly stop. After searching online I came across this item on Amazon. I read the reviews and gave it a try. This stuff is amazing!  The pimples diminished with 24 hours of use. I use this every other day and my face is crystal clear - zit free! Thank you!  I wish I found this product 10 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help with me with scars or pores. I don&#x27;t know why lot of people says that it almost dissapear scars. I folowed the instructions exactly, but didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well, I had a blemish that cleared up with the use of the product. Usually use this product once a week and my skin feels cleans after the use. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> First Off, I was very impressed that I ordered this peel on a Thursday evening, and it arrived the following Monday (to Chicago from California), all through the USPS! I wish all free shipping was like this! I&#x27;ve tried other peels but I like that this one includes the tea tree, and green tea additions. I will likely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have tried other more harsh peels and so far, this is my favorite due to how gentle it is. I have not experienced a hard core all over peel, but when I reapply the gel on certain areas that I feel need extra help, I do see mild peeling. This gel peel has helped tremendously with blackheads that I was having all over my nose and other parts of my face. I am currently going thru chemo treatments for breast cancer and after the 2nd infusion I experienced horrible cystic acne (and i do mean HORRIBLE) skin breakout on my scalp, face and chest. Even tho it says on the bottle not to use if u are taking chemo, my oncologist said I could use it sparingly. I have been using it nightly and am finally happy with the appearance of my skin again. I don&#x27;t think I would be to this point without this product. My Dr. did also put me on a continuous RX of minocycline 100mg twice a day, which has probably helped in addition, but I can&#x27;t say enough about how happy I am to be rid of the blackheads and I have taken minocyline with no results there. Also slowly getting rid of fine lines without burning my face off. Definitely recommend this product and will keep using it</li>
    <li> it works well enough after two tries. My face doesn&#x27;t peel but it looks better now than it ever has</li>
    <li> I will NEVER use any other product for facial skin treatment other than this!!!! I have seen and experienced the impactful effect of this product firsthand, the key here is PATIENCE no matter how bad your skin is!!! Here is a list of the benefits this product has given me:&lt;br /&gt;It has ELIMINATED ALL the acne on my face&lt;br /&gt;It has SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED the amount of oil my skin produces so I don&#x27;t have that glaring shine anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It has SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED dark marks associated with acne&lt;br /&gt;It has SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED facial lines and smoothened out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing everyone must keep in mind is that we all have different skin types. Mine is the VERY OILY AND ACNE PRONE skin type. How I used this product, I started off once a week application for 3 weeks and then once every three days for 2 weeks then once a week for two weeks. Most other people would probably have to do it differently, but this is what has worked for me, and I have noticed these improvements within 7 weeks. In about another 7 weeks time, I expect that my dark marks will be COMPLETELY GONE and my skin&#x27;s complexion will be ALL EVEN. Just remember to apply moisturizer AFTER EVERY TREATMENT, AND SUNCREEN IS A MUST!!! Now, about the seller, they gave me about a 3 week timeframe for the product to arrive, but it actually arrived in 3 days!!!! Now that&#x27;s my kind of service!!! SIX STARS for the seller, and countless stars for the product!!!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and it burned my face instantly within a few seconds of applying.</li>
    <li> This Salicylic Acid Peel has really helped to clear up my face and give it a nice glow. It went on nicely and didn&#x27;t burn too badly. I didn&#x27;t actually peel, but I did see results. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. I&#x27;ll use it again when I feel a breakout coming on.</li>
    <li> I started having bad/frequent breakouts as an adult and tried many different things and this peel has been the only thing that has really helped! Its clearing up my acne quickly AND healing the old scars. I use it on my face and chest.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this product.  I read the reviews and decided on this one with 20% because, of my sensitive skin and the reviews were right.  This is the perfect product for me and I appreciate everyone that participates in posting their experiences.  I rely heavily in everything I buy now because, of others experiences.  This product has given me baby bottom soft skin from the first treatment.  Yes, it stings a bit but, oh it is so worth it.  My pores have shrunk and my adult acne has drastically gone away.  After using so many products for so long and not really wanting to spend $250 at the doctors with no idea of what to expect.  This is comfortable to do at home with the time length that I am comfortable with.  And yes, I am ordering more today.  And definitely buy the &amp;#34;Taklon Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator for Glycolic Lactic TCA Skin Peel&amp;#34; and a box of baking soda.  I always prepare my baking soda water and wash towel prior to applying so I may remove as soon as I am ready.  Washing this off with just cold water is not enough.  Enjoy the new you.  I am loving it....</li>
    <li> It appears to work well. You must be careful not to burn or dry out you skin. The first couple of applications did not seems as effective as the last. It might be the application thickness.</li>
    <li> I started off by leaving it on for a minute, then 2, then 3, etc. I now can leave it on for about 5 min or so.  It&#x27;s not a miracle product as there isn&#x27;t such thing, but it did lighten up my discoloration on my forehead and cheekbone from sun damage quite a bit. It did take use of nearly whole bottle to see the difference and my redness on my cheeks are still there. Overall, better than any product I&#x27;ve used before and I will continue to use this. Even though many people say lactic acid is gentler, my skin seem to prefer Salicylic. It does get red after I use this, but Lactic Acid feels like needles on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using gel peel. I read directions very carefully and also did the skin test. This works great! I put it on my face for only 1.30 second. In three days, I can see my face start peel. Most of acne(small white head) on my forehead fall off when I wash my face. I cant wait to see after I finish all the treatment.</li>
    <li> I did not really have a chance to fully test this product as it gives me a burning sensation and drys my skin.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like other peeling products.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not noticeable when you have it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t see dramatic results but that just might be because I don&#x27;t consistently use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Quite pricey but it seems to work so its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth giving it a shot if you haven&#x27;t tried it!</li>
    <li> This product works very well to remove dead skin layers loosened by prescription retinol.  I use it weekly and my skin is clear and smooth.  I have shared with my sons who have moderate acne and my mother who is in her 60&#x27;s and have emptied their bottles too!</li>
    <li> It´s a wonderful product. My face gets clear with each application and the acne is desappearing. It´s really easy to apply and it doesn´t irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> Works just like advertised and a must to read all the reviews.  Great coverage by users and usage.</li>
    <li> So far the product seems to meet my expectations.  I have not used it on a consistent basis up to this point, but I am sure it will give me the results I&#x27;m looking for once I use it on a more regular schedule..</li>
    <li> This would be extroardinary if it did not include SD alcohol as the second ingredient.My skin is fairly resistant and turned bright red with each application of this. I believe I had this reaction due to the alcohol. This ingredient does not do anything good for the skin and it is a shame it is listed here and so high on the list. I understand it may have been used in place of a solvent or something but there are a lot more helpful things to choose from if that were the case. Everything else looks good but the alcohol is a big problem and I probably wont buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product along with Lerosett has helped my adult acne.  I have tried lots of products, but these work best.  I have little frosting because this product works in a more gradual and safer way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times and have noticed great results. I have deep cystic acne that was difficult to clear up through any sort of topical medicine. When I break out badly, I&#x27;ll use the product several times a week in order to help clear things up. It&#x27;s worked better for me than anything else out there!!</li>
    <li> LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this peel. Perfect for cystic acne.cleared up my skin after only 2 uses with no down time! I am very pleased with this peel planing to try all different products Perfect Image offers!</li>
    <li> this is awesome i used it on my face and now i have baby skin make sure to put some on ur stronger part o ur face first and then at the end on ur more sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Nice peel, works well with little discomfort. I had some slight peeling, which is normal after my first use. My skin looked clearer as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne and redness every since i was probably about 14 or so. I&#x27;ve tried everything like everyone else. Let me say that i gave this a try and wow it really works great. Now, it does sting like hell after a minute, so i immediately flush my face with cold water for a couple minutes until the stinging goes away. Afterwards i put on a really good moisturizer and my skin has taken a drastic turn for the better. My pores are not large and clogged anymore. Its cleaned out all of my blackheads and taken all of the redness out of my face. I would definitely recommend this product but please don&#x27;t think that if you leave it on longer because you have bad acne that you&#x27;ll get a good result. If you do that you&#x27;ll probably permanently damage your skin. This stuff is serious, but if used responsibly works great ! I prob use this 2-3 times a week and then once or twice a week i use the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay which is also amazing and works great on off days of this product. For the price you&#x27;ll be amazed at what a difference it makes</li>
    <li> I am an adult woman who has always had congested skin (blackheads, bumps, etc... but rarely pimples).  Over the years I have tried almost every product available OTC and many professional solutions including RetinA, Microdermabrasion, and chemical peels at the dermatologists office.  This is the first peel I have found for use at home that is strong enough to help eliminate my congestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use and effecitve but is also not overly harsh.  I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure about this product, as every product I&#x27;ve been trying lately has been a huge disappointment.  I&#x27;m 28 years old and going through a stressful time, and have been struggling with severe adult acne as a result.  I tried proactive, which I think ruined my skin (made it dry, yet oily, and made my acne worse than before).  Anyway I decided to try this after all of the rave reviews, while reminding myself that this was not going to be a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at the end of the first week, so I have used it twice (2nd time was 2 nights ago).  At first my skin got more oily, and some pimples were more pronounced, including my laugh lines (which I guess were drying/peeling).  So for the first couple of days I wasn&#x27;t too sure.  Then I used it again 2 days ago, and my skin looks awesome.  I still have visible spots, and a pimple (but it dried up almost immediately).  It is not a miracle product, but I can definitely see that with regular use my skin will get much better.  I am already less oily, having fewer pimples, dark spots are fading.  I also notice that my makeup and other products are gliding on more smoothly, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have yet to actually peel, although i did notice a little bit around my nose and some dry spots.  The longest i have left it on so far is a minute and half, so next week I will try for 2- 2 and a half minutes!  All in all, i would definitely recommend this product and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It burns. like a lot. but for me it feels good. A good burn I guess! I had some scars on my cheeks and they were largely gone after only 1 application. I can&#x27;t wait to try some more!</li>
    <li> Unexpected.  Had not even realized I was ordering a real peel.  This product is excellent and produces a good peel that can even be done on target spots like scars</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use the product at first, but took all the recommended precautions. This was the first time I ever used this type of product. Putting acid on your skin just seems wrong, but since using it, my skin is much better.  Also, people really notice that my skin looks good.  I had a makeup artist tell me that my skin &amp;#34;was flawless.&amp;#34; I was happy that the product actually works.  I do use baking soda and water to neutralize the product even though it states it can be washed off with water.  I just feel safer knowing the acid is neutralized.</li>
    <li> I have severe acne, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactiv to neutrogena. I decided to give this product a try because the reviews were great. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now, and I am seeing no results, and my skin is actually getting worse (I don&#x27;t think its from using the product, but my skin definitely isn&#x27;t getting any better). Sigh, I wish my acne would stop getting worse and worse. :(</li>
    <li> This product has worked great for my acne-prone skin and acne scars. I like it because:&lt;br /&gt;- the burning sensation and redness when applying the peel are gone as soon as I wash it off my skin;&lt;br /&gt;- a few days later, I can see that my skin is peeling but it is not peeling so bad as to make me feel embarrassed to go out&lt;br /&gt;- it works great on my pimples, even as a spot treatment&lt;br /&gt;- it lightens my acne spots&lt;br /&gt;- it reveals a nice, new layer of baby skin that I never knew I had.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Great product. does what it says</li>
    <li> This product does effectively clean the skin. After you apply it to your skin, let it work for about 2 minutes, but no more than 5 minutes. Then, wash face with cool/cold water for at least 1 minute. Make sure to moisturize afterwards. Anytime you do a peel it&#x27;s very important you moisturize your face.  This is a 20% concentration. If you have never had a peel professionally, or done one on your own, you should purchase a lower concentration. This product can sting just a little if your skin hasn&#x27;t acclimated. Your skin might turn a little reddish, but don&#x27;t be alarm. Remember, this is an acid peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Perfect Image Glycolic Acid peel, too. The difference is that Salicylic acid peels are best for people who are more acne-prone and the glycolic acids for general skin rejuvenation. While I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, I do have combination skin---T-zone area is more oily. I change up my peels depending on what my goal is. However, you want to stick to a skin regimen.  To truly get the effectiveness of any peel, you&#x27;ll need to continue to use it either once a week if your skin can handle it or once every 10 to 14 days. Then, give your skin a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying another one.</li>
    <li> In 2013 purchased this item and didn&#x27;t obtain the skin renewal as other&#x27;s did.  I found it in my cabinet and tried it again. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t need the exfoliation back then, because I experienced the typical burning and peeling throughout the 2 days the followed. The item is not accompanied with instructions outside what&#x27;s on the bottle.  When it says &amp;#34;apply&amp;#34;...apply a thin layer to avoid excessive burning sensation. Leave on for the prescribed amount of time and cleanse with cold water to deactivate the product.  Your skin will continue burning, but no worries, this is normal for me! You won&#x27;t get the peel an aesthetician could provide..but it&#x27;s great for the &amp;#34;in-betweens&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done 2 peels so far and they both improved my skin. I saw an improvement in the texture of my skin with the first peel. The second peel improved the appearance of dark spots and hyper pigmentation. As an African-American woman with dark skin I have to be careful not to cause further damage and pigmented scars. I was pleased with this products performance overall. Don&#x27;t be dismayed if you have some darkening immediately after the peel because it will lighten in a couple weeks. Make sure you apply sun screen each time you go outside immediately after the peel. I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because of the darkening affect before the even skin tone appears. I&#x27;m not trying to get a lighter complexion, I love my chocolate brown skin. I just want it to be even. I did see improvement using this product with patience. I applied each peel about three weeks apart.</li>
    <li> Burns skin off.  Does not tell you in item infomation that it you get cold sores do not use this product!  I read the instructions and decided to try it anyway and sure enough got a cold sore.</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for me. Not only has it improved my complexion, it&#x27;s softened the surface of my skin as well. I have naturally oily skin and I think it&#x27;s reduced my sebum production too but that could have been caused by any number of things. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I saw quite a difference in my skin tone in less than 2 weeks.  It works really well. Smoothes out lines and gives skin a glow. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have moderate acne and acne scars. I have been using Salicylic 15% Peel at home and decided to go up in strength. I tried this because of the wonderful reviews but it did nothing for me. Usually when I do a peel it burns and frosts and I can barely stand the heat on my face, but with this I applied up to 3 layers and kept it on for 10 min (which is the max time recommended) and NADA!!! I washed my  face like recommended before application but still had zero results.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Perfect Image Salicylic Acid (20%) Peel after experiencing some new hyper-pigmentation caused by a few bumps/pimples on my face. Although I do not have sensitive skin, I followed verbatim the application instructions included with the product to help ensure positive results and not shock or damage my skin. While it did take weeks (6+ weeks) to begin to see some distinctive improvements in my hyper-pigmentation, I did in fact see noticeable fading of the hyper-pigmentation and visible improvement in skin texture. After about five months of usage, however, I did stop using the peel simply because it seemed I had reached a threshold on the improvement(s) I would see--I still could see the spots where the pimples had existed and I did not see the spots/hyper-pigmentation getting any better after a few months into using the peel. But these spots were lighter than what they were when I began using the peel, and I believe the peel helped to speed up the lightening of the hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the peel was successful in improving my hyper-pigmentation and helped solidly improve my skin&#x27;s texture. As a 30-something woman with medium brown skin, I had received peels in dermatologists&#x27; offices before purchasing the Perfect Image peel. And I must say that in comparing the results from the Perfect Image peel and the dermatologist peels, I found that the results were very comparable. It was definitely more cost effective for me to use the Perfect Image peel at home just to help give my skin a boost and help reduce (not eliminate) some discoloration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many skin care products for a light case of cystic acne. Perfect Image peels are no cure for my not-so-perfect skin, but after buying this peel, I have implemented it into my routine skin care regime for over 4 months now. The bottle will last me at least a year with a peel on average 2x/month. What I love most about the product is that I can feel it working.</li>
    <li> for some serious acne treatment creams go royalcosmetics.net</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it this long, I have quite sensitive skin so 1 minute is all I can leave it on, and I do not use it daily. Maybe every other or every third night. Keep it closed tightly and I put it back in its box and in a dark place. I am using this for hyper-pigmentation or dark age spots. Mine are mainly caused from to much sun exposure when I was a lot younger. I will re-post after a month or so..</li>
    <li> Everything it promised it would be and more. My sister and I had an at-home spa day and we both tried this, and she is now hooked too!  My face felt smooth for days, and it wasn&#x27;t too harsh on my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older, I have begun to develop acne issues. A friend of mine told me that chemical peels could really help so I did some research and decided to try this product versus going to a salon/spa and paying hundreds of dollars.  I am very glad that I did.  My acne breakouts have greatly diminished and my skin looks much healthier.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This peel formula was exactly what I needed for my hormonal, adult acne. I can&#x27;t believe how fast it works. I have completed 2 peels so far and my skin and pores look 80% better. I have very oily skin and now I must use organic vitamin e oil to moisturize my skin, because my skin is becoming dryer. All my previous dark marks haven&#x27;t faded completely; however, I don&#x27;t have the painful pimples (nodules) on my cheeks. My skin is glowing like I am 25 years old. I wash my face with Palmers Cocoa butter soap before my treatment. I apply the peel with a lint-free cotton pad. I let the gel sit on my face for 3 minutes. To stop the peel process and to remove the gel mixture from my face, I use very cold water and baking soda. After the treatment, I apply organic Vitamin E oil to fade the dark pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I got this about a month ago along with the cleanser that states to us 5-7 days before using the peel. So I was using both of them together and I was not seeing any improvement, my face was breaking out even more. So I decided to use Proactive in place of the cleanser and use the peel once a week. Wow that really worked for me. I am seeing my scars go away slowly and my skin is a lot smoother. This is my first time doing a peel and it really does not burn your face like all the other peels I have researched. What I do is wash my face with proactive in the morning and before going to bed and use the peel on Sundays.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work for me but it didn&#x27;t. It actually made my skin burn and look a lot worse!!  I can only comment on my reaction to it but I was severely disappointed with the outcome. I followed the instructions and made sure to not leave this on for too long yet my skin had a bad reaction. It has been a few months since I used this product and only now has the dark spot left from the initial burn faded away. I hope others have a better reaction with this product because I like the ingredients used. Just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.</li>
    <li> this peel made my skin dry and my skin appears saggy after the use. I guess the peel is not for everybody, let alone the perfect part.</li>
    <li> After treatment, my skin felt fantastic. The instructions were very easy to follow for those who haven&#x27;t done this yourself. Great way to save money.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helped my skin immensely. Did burn a lot the first couple uses, but after that I was able to leave on for a couple minutes. My skin felt refreshed after each use.</li>
    <li> At the age of 43 I find myself still fighting acne, although these days the scars are purple and they take forever to heal.  I&#x27;ve used the chemical peel twice in the past month and I feel like the scars have gone from purple to hardly noticeable.  The first time I used the peel, I left it on too long.  about 3 days later my skin was peeling a lot and I had some rough spots that were red and painful to the touch. My skin peeled big time! I wanted it to peel, but it was embarrassing since I had to go to work.  The second time I used it (3 weeks later), I followed the directions  exactly and I had minor peeling on about day 2, 3, and 4 following the peel.  It wasn&#x27;t that noticeable.  My skin looks clearer - this is a plus!</li>
    <li> This thing is not recommendable for sensitive skin, It burned my face and it didn&#x27;t even clean my acne, so sad!</li>
    <li> I expected this product to be finally the solution for my hyperpigmentation from my acne from all these outstanding reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I put a little bit amount of the peel on my problem areas and soon after I saw frosting formed, which I had expected. However, only after 5 seconds, my skin burned so bad that I had to quickly neutralize my face. My face was very reddened after the peel so I thought to myself that this was normal and would probably go away later. About three days later, some of the redness stayed there and the peel didn&#x27;t really do anything except to make some my areas more darkened. I was really disappointed that my simple skin care(2% salicylic acid and a mild cleanser) was a lot better than this product. Now, my skin looks worse than it was before I had tried this product...</li>
    <li> I have insanely oily skin and this product works great for it.  I use it up to 2x/wk and it helps to keep my skin clear, no or very few cystic acne breakouts, and it doesn&#x27;t over dry it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it this much for everyone, or those with dryer skin, but if you have oily skin (really oily skin) I would recommend looking into this product.</li>
    <li> Best for acne, not sure about anti-aging (as it claims)..&lt;br /&gt;This product does seem to control my acne (with the exception of hormonal or menstrual cycle breakouts, but they have decreased significantly). Yet, it has not eliminated acne. My skin is softer after use and has a slight glow,(by the way, I am in my mid thirties,with fair complexioned,african American skin). I wish I could tell if the product is  anti aging. It would also be nice if there was a milliliter measurement indicator on the dropper tube. Just an fyi/suggestion, definitely thoroughly read the directions prior to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this peel to help with acne, and to help with scars. I love this peel, it definitely helps control my acne much better. I feel like the combination of salicylic acid and the peel which help my acne products absorb better, but I have seen much improvement in the last month. I just finished using the peel and at first, I was a little scared of doing a peel myself but this peel is has been great on my sensitive skin, just a slight tingling. I this it is best to start with a mild peel like this peel, because it gave me some confidence in doing these peel because I know it works on my acne, and It was not too rough on my skin. I am going to be definitely trying a higher strength peel from perfect image.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to try this product because I had no idea what kind of results to expect or how it would effect my skin.  I have moderate to sometimes severe adult acne and have tried SO MANY products to treat this condition.  This is absolutely one of the best treatments I&#x27;ve found.  It not only helps to treat and heal active breakouts, it also slowly removes the terrible red marks that are left long after blemishes heal.  Also, it helps to smooth out and improve overall skin tone and texture and remove acne scars.  This product is very strong so be cautious when starting treatment and follow the directions carefully.  I have slowly worked my way up to using this 3 times a week and am really starting to see a big difference in my skin.  Overall, I think this is an excellent product and a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of the reviews for this product I decided to purchase. I get the occasional hormonal or post-chocolate breakout but for the most part I have clear skin. I&#x27;ve recently had a terrible cystic acne breakout allover my chin. I&#x27;ve tried all my usual &amp;#34;go-to&#x27;s&amp;#34; and nothing has helped. As soon as it looks like it might be getting better, more appear. I tried this acid peel, only on my chin, last night. I have fair, sensitive skin. It didn&#x27;t burn that bad with a 1.5 min application. I prepped with the cleanser first &amp; I rinsed with COLD water. Day after results so far are as follows: inflammation gone, redness reduced, no new spots appearing, scar from one that had healed looks a little better, all current spots look to be drying out. I&#x27;m really pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a horrible burn and maybe more breakouts right after from reading the reviews. I&#x27;ll try to give an updated review in a week. So far so good and I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with cystic/nodular acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> Watch for possible contamination. I have not used the product so I can&#x27;t comment on effectiveness. The reason i&#x27;ve been unable to use is because I&#x27;ve received two bottles and BOTH had a bunch of white, rod shaped crystal-looking things floating in otherwise clear fluid. Amazon refunded my first purchase and the second one arrived with the same weird stuff growing in it. I&#x27;m afraid to use it on my face because the description does not mention that there would be any particulate matter floating in the gel. The first bottle had significantly more in it than the second, but both look alarming. Both bottles were sold by Perfect Image, LLC through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#34;ve emailed the seller to check their quality controls. I did not open or break the seal on either bottle, so the problem seems like a manufacturing issue. Number on bottom of bottle is 319201 expires 10/15. I will update the review when I receive a product that I can use.</li>
    <li> I have really bad acne scarring from the severe acne I used to have as a teenager. The acne went away, but the scarring and redness stayed. I decided to try this product out because of the reviews and I really had nothing to lose. I followed the instructions exactly and WOW! my face brightened up and the redness went away. The second time I did it again and my face definitely got lighter and the acne scars are not as noticeable anymore. Even my pores shrunk. Overall, my face looks smoother.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, this product does not dry out my face or cause it to peel. It does not burn too bad for me. I feel if I fan it it causes it to burn worse, but that&#x27;s my opinion. I guess I should go for a higher percentage. Maybe my skin is more resilient from all the products I&#x27;ve had to take when I did have acne.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this every week or even twice a week since my skin doesn&#x27;t peel! It really does wonders. I feel like my face improves every time I use it. I highly recommend this product! When I finish with this bottle, I might just get a higher percentage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It has now been 4 months using this product and I believe it has helped tremendously with my acne scars. The redness on my skin is definitely reduced, I look okay without make up and not like a person who broke out in a rash. When I finish this product, I will probably go for a stronger concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months: Now I&#x27;ve been using the product every week for 6 months and my face looks really smooth. My acne scars are barely noticeable even under harsh lights. I&#x27;m almost out of the product and I will continue to buy from the same company but I might get a higher percent. My face isn&#x27;t noticeably peeling, but sometimes I find myself rubbing off a small layer of dried skin when I&#x27;m in the shower, which shows me that it works! Overall, very happy with this product!! I&#x27;ve been using this with a retinol serum and I believe the combination helping tremendously with my skin. I can actually see my skin color and not just red! I barely put on make up now because I feel I don&#x27;t need it!</li>
    <li> I started using this product once every 2 weeks. Once my face was accustomed to the burning sensation, I was able to increase the usage to once a week. This is a great light to medium peel that definitely helps calm breakouts.</li>
    <li> I used to go to a spa for this type of treatment.  I&#x27;ve done extensive research on fragrance free products as I suffer from Eczema.  I used if for a couple of months w/o any irritation.  My pores were smaller and skin was smoother.  I even received compliments on how soft my cheeks were by my husband!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it claimed it would. Not going to blame the product maybe I was expecting too much. But not even a little.</li>
    <li> My Skin for some reason around 35 changed and I begin to have acne.  I did the chemical peels to help remove the dark spots on my skin..tried several different products and everyday had to use concealer to try to hide all the dark spots. Last week I came across this product and read the reviews and ordered it...the first time I tried it ...that day I did not notice anything but the next morning...my skin was clearer..  When I went to get my hair done..I got all kind of compliments that my skin looked great...since then..I have seen a huge improvement..and using less concealer!  I like the natural look and now..I just use a little concealer...I am happy!  This is much cheaper than all the money I have put out.....Diva Back In Effect</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly to clear up blackheads and get rid of old acne marks. I&#x27;m of Sicilian-Irish descent, so my skin is very oily yet very fair, meaning every red mark I&#x27;ve ever had remains FOREVER. This stuff has been amazing in not only getting rid of those marks, but also clearing up the massive amount of little blackheads I had all over my t-zone.</li>
    <li> I have used this on over 10 different people suffering from pimples or acne and we all experienced good results after using the peel for over 4 sessions. Its simple to use and it does wonders, it dries the face pimples, open pores, and gives you better radiance.</li>
    <li> I am impressed by the product!  My first time using a chemical peel turned into a great find!  It made my skin glow!  I had so many people ask me what was I using on my skin!  I only leave the peel on a couple minutes and rinse off with lukewarm water.  You will have a tingling or burning sensation. Use a good moisturizer after peel.  Also it lighten areas on my face I had due to hyperpigmentation.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I needed, when my skin looks dull or I am having breakouts, I can put this on for a few minutes and my face looks and feels great. Of course it doesn&#x27;t take blemishes away immediately but it does dry them out. I have never had a problem with it drying out my skin. One small learning curve...apply to cheekbone/under eye area (not close to eye) last. The skin is thinner there and I actually had a little burn going on! But when I do that last, I wait about 2 minutes and everythng is perfect. I also cleanse with the Perfect Image pre-cleanser. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product has helped me tremendously with my acne scars. I would recommend it to anyone with the same problem.</li>
    <li> I am using the peel slowly as it is the first time I&#x27;ve tried anything like this.  So far it is working well.  As others have mentioned, moisturize, moisturize, and moisturize.  I am already seeing a difference and have only used it lightly about three times.</li>
    <li> ...and after methodic use (spot treatment) on the larger original flat wart and on the smaller new ones for about 2 months...I actually saw the warts flake off and one day it simply wasn&#x27;t there.  I had read about this as a possible use for flat warts but experiences others had (using other salicylic acid products) left me with little to no hope. But I had to give it a try and I am so glad I tried this product.  At first I only saw flaking of the wart (bigger one which was more raised gave off the most obvious flakes).  It sort of peeled off like a piece of thick weird looking skin.  I applied with a Q-tip and sometimes with a small brush so as to not go where the skin was healthy (as I was applying 3-4 times a day).  It was obviously impossible to stay exactly \\&quot;within the lines\\&quot; and when the product touched my good skin 3-4 times a day, the result of that was that my healthy skin peeled off (along with the gross wart skin) and revealed a tender reddish skin underneath. I knew that the red skin left behind was still healthy, since the remaining wart never showed reddening from this product. I used the red/brown lining (of where my good skin got too irritated) as an outline of where not to go with the product.  I started applying this in the morning with a healthy coat, and reapply 2 times during work (I worked in room with no sunlight and darkly lit so not having a sunscreen was not an issue) and then after I got home and removed makeup.  I would sometime wear it over make-up if needed or if not I would wear make up and spot remove the make-up and apply the acid.  It would look shiny in those areas but no one I worked with ever noticed or cared.  It would sting a little but I got used to it and enjoyed it as it made me feel the darn wart was being killed off. The first sign of real improvement happened maybe 3-4 weeks after using this.  The edges of the wart were getting closer to each other as if it was shrinking.  Even before this happened the height of the wart (I know its called flat but its a raised flat) was getting smaller with the peels. And at least this was one positive thing I noticed after 2-3 days.  The improvement seemed to just lag at that stage until, like I said before, the wart began to shrink.  I have now stopped using the salicylic acid on my warts and they have not come back. I am so happy to have found this. And I would pay the price for this product anytime. Hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> I love it,  used twice so far skin looks and feels so much better. I didn&#x27;t think at home peels would work but it does.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have oily skin and I tend to get acne pretty bad. it still make your skin flaky for a couple days after use. But after that many of the acne bumps are faded or even gone. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin. If you have sensitive skin or really dry skin, this may not be for you. Follow directions or you can cause your skin to to have a similar effect to a mild sunburn. After use, it&#x27;s a good idea to use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am almost done with this bottle and am just as pleased with the results as when I used the 15% TCA bottles. I do feel more stinging with this product and get less visible peeling, but I do flake for several days and it does improve my skin, just in a slightly different way. I am looking for a stronger peel next! Love the cleanser and have used it for a year with great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked and pleased at how great this product worked. I was skeptical to buy it because so many products have done absolutely nothing for my face. I&#x27;ve never really had acne but I get occasional bumps, especially in my T zone. My skin easily scars. Bumps leave behind hideous dark spots. I mainly bought the product to reduce the appearance of dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a few peels I can honestly say this product is great! My most problematic dark spots have already drastically faded and it&#x27;s only been a week! I&#x27;m so happy to have  found something that is producing fast results. It doesn&#x27;t peel my skin or burn, so I will use it every two days.</li>
    <li> It did nothing to me at all not strong at all you may need it if you wanna dilute it with strong TCA like 50 % tca cuz it is soo strong</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy Perfect Image products. I have used the salicylic acid chemical peel and cleanser. I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin. I used to pay to get professional chemical peels and microdermibrasions, but not anymore. I will continue to use Perfect Image and will try out a few of their other products and peels!</li>
    <li> When I tryed this product it burned so bad I couldn&#x27;t leave it on it turned white soon as it touched my skin!</li>
    <li> I saw a small difference but did not remove my dar spots or scars. Used the whole bottles and was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very good and I was pleased how fast I reciwved my product and would recommend this site to anyione! I live this site</li>
    <li> I carefully followed directions. I used this product 3 times in one hour exactly according to directions.  It was useless</li>
    <li> I still did not know how to use it. I just use it. And this is my first time try this, because I saw a lot of guys use it so I just try. I have a very oily skin, with a lot of blackhead, so I want to improve it. I just try it 30s and I saw a lot of blackhead they are come out of my face but can not clean because the blackhead still stay on my nose. Do anybody know how to use it? Can you tell me in detail</li>
    <li> This is powerful stuff! It cleared up the white spots on my face quickly. It works much better than Differin.</li>
    <li> There are so many positive reviews for this peel that I REALLY wanted to love it too.  I have used it 5 times so far, but will not use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so the first two times I used it I left it on for 20-30 seconds.  It tingled a bit, but not too bad.  There was no peeling at all, and I noticed that there was no noticeable improvement on my skin.  I never had any peeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next few times, I experimented with 1-2 minutes.  I had a little peeling with one minute, but no improvement.  I worked my way up to 1 ½ minute, and my poor chin and nostril area (in the crease by my cheek) burned like crazy and peeled/scabbed over for like a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no happy medium, and after the last time, I&#x27;m done with it.  It was really painful.  I will pass the rest to my mom, maybe she&#x27;ll have better luck!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for approximately 6 months and it has made a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin. It leaves my skein feeling smooth and exfoliated each time I use it.</li>
    <li> I am lucky to have good skin, but I use this every once in while for clarity on my skin and it works wonders on making your pores so small or close to invisible.  My son has some acne and it has cleared it up a little bit, but not as much as I hoped for.  It does tend to dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten a peel at a dermatologist so can&#x27;t compare but I have been impressed by this product. Its easy to use and can be done in ten minutes. It definitely leaves skin tighter and brighter. It has helped prevent future acne but not sure if it gets rid of prior scars.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I went on an overseas trip for six weeks. The trip was stressful, and while I was travelling my skin broke out TERRIBLY - I felt like a teenager again. When I got back to the US, my skin was a mess - lots of pimples, blackheads, bumpiness and light scarring. I almost went to see a dermatologist, but remembered that I had this peel that I purchased about 6 months ago, and decided to try doing twice weekly salicylic peels and see if that helped. Wow! After the first peel my skin was softer and more even-toned. I kept going with frequent peels for about a month, then switched to once a week, and then to one a month. My skin is looking fantastic now. Much less oily, a lot of the scarring is lighter, and I haven&#x27;t had a hideous breakout since I started my regimen. It took a while for things to clear up completely, and I also stopped using anything but very basic moisturizer and soap on my face, but the peel definitely made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Works great if you follow the instructions. I don&#x27;t use it more than twice a month. I can see how it can really burn your face if used too much. It really clears up blackheads on my nose by exfoliating the dead skin. Blackheads haven&#x27;t disappeared completely but has been reduced.</li>
    <li> I was so afraid to use this product and was I ever surprised. I have very dry skin and my make up was starting to look cakey.  I used this for one treatment and I noticed how much easier my make up applied. I am also noticing that my splotchy red cheeks are less noticable.</li>
    <li> I never tried peels at home before. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I used the product as instructed and my skin improved greatly within 5-6 days after using the peel. I have very large pores and they visibly reduced after using the peel just one time. I will keep using it and definitely recommend it to anyone with large clogged pores and oily skin.</li>
    <li> I had this on my face just a few seconds and it burned so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  Washed it off right away.  Thought it would be worth a try after reading all the good reviews.</li>
    <li> This Perfect Image Salicylic Gel Peel is phenomenal! Definitely helps keep my breakout-prone skin clear and smooth. I was so surprised about how much \\&quot;grime\\&quot; was really on my face when I first used it. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This product is certainly great at controlling adult acne, and definitely better than most other products I&#x27;ve used at controlling my breakouts.  Immediately after the peel, my skin is definitely firmer and brighter.  I would suggest rinsing the product off with excessive cool water because it does sting around the sensitive areas (lips and nose) as the product notes in the insert.  Also apply repairing lotion after to help with the irritation if you still experience it.  I use this twice a week before bed and have had great results.  Overall, extremely happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this peel to deal with my menopausal skin issues. After 30+ years, I have acne again, plus every other skin problem associated with aging. Have to say that this peel has helped tremendously! I&#x27;m less oily and my breakouts are fewer, plus it also dries out any pimples that just wouldn&#x27;t budge with other products. Unlike many of the other users, I really haven&#x27;t experienced too much stinging, but my skin is probably tougher than most. I was terrified to use it at first, for fear that I&#x27;d burn my skin and end up with a bright red, raw face. Not so! Instead, it&#x27;s tighter and my pores appear smaller. Problem areas do flake a bit the next day or so, but that&#x27;s the whole point, right? It&#x27;s important to read the instructions and follow them exactly to get the best results.I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends and they&#x27;ve had great results too.</li>
    <li> My skin appears clearer, more evenly toned from use. Very good product for the price. Use according to directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 49 year old white woman prone to pre-menopausal (hormonal) acne. I used this product exactly as directed four times on my face and 2&amp;#34;x3&amp;#34; area near my ears, on my neck, where I had oddly darker skin. I hoped to decrease the acne outbreaks and help the skin look more even. This product did both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use I tried four minutes and was getting the &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; mentioned in the instructions. The product stung, but not terribly. I washed all the product off in a cool shower followed by very mild cleanser and more rinsing. I looked like I had a slight sunburn. I applied very mild non-clogging medicated lotion three times a day. Two days later I had tiny whiteheads along my jaw, but none of the big zits I had been getting, and slight peeling. On day five I used an exfoliating pad for sensitive skin (&amp;#34;Buff Puff&amp;#34;) and was left with slightly red skin that was still pink the next day, but perfectly clear. Not a pimple in sight and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that removing the outer layer of skin helped my acne medicine work better, because my slin cleared up quite a bit after that first use. I tried the salicylic acid again two weeks later, for 2-3 minutes because that was what my skin could stand. I experienced only a slight &amp;#34;sunburn effect&amp;#34; and my skin looked slightly clearer in a day. I&#x27;ve tried it twice more, same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chief benefits have probably been to remove some roughness in my skin texture and, I believe, the improved absorption of my acne medicine. The darker patches on my neck, left over from pregnancy 9 years ago, have not changed. I thought the product claim that it would speed skin renewal would reduce the darker color, but it has not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost, I recommend using the product fairly often but leave it on for a short amount of time, to get the effectwithout the bad side effects. After four uses I have half the bottle left. It&#x27;ll probably work out to $2.25-$2.50 a use, which is pretty great.</li>
    <li> I have acne. I am 34 years young and have recently had a breakout that has NOT stopped flaring up for 6 months. I am currently in school getting my license to be an esthetician and I can not say anything bad about this product. In fact, after only using this 2 times along with my prescribed topical, in less than 2 weeks half of the post inflammatory hyperpigmentation I HAD is almost invisible. I&#x27;d say after a few more applications, I will be flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I have been receiving compliments on my skin again which does wonders on the self esteem. Just to let people know my experience, there was a slight \\&quot;stingly\\&quot; feeling upon application. I only left it on for 1 minute. I had a few active lesions and a ton of marks. The active ones dried out completely in 48 hours and scabbed over. It took about 3-4 days for the entire \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; process to finish. I&#x27;m left with smooth, more clear skin. I can&#x27;t wait to be 100% clear!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product and excellent customer service! Customer for as long as I live&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and I have just tried this peel. The moment I applied it my skin started burning and itching so badly, also I noticed frosting on my chin, so I removed it as quickly as possible. While removing the peel you feel particles of your own skin washing away, leaving brand new skin, which feels so good. Didn&#x27;t notice any significant change though after the first time, but the overall complexion is definitely getting better. Also, I have a lot of blackheads on my nose, and while removing the peel I saw clearly the blackheads washing away! Will try this peel later on and will update the results. Do not be afraid, I didn&#x27;t have any redness  the next morning.</li>
    <li> With the problem of pimples on the face markedly decreased the problem is very fast but does not eliminate mud buried.</li>
    <li> used this for a month with no improvement at all</li>
    <li> This product works for me!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even leave this product on for 20 seconds and I had to wash it off due to burning. I mean, I can take a burning, but this is comparable to the fiery wraths of hell opening it&#x27;s gate all over your precious virgin skin! My skin felt pretty smooth afterwards, until... I woke up in the am. Skin bright red, peeling, and raw. Ouch! So raw it actually began to bleed. I could literally peel my skin off, &amp; I walked around with a bright red circle around my mouth for about a week. Did it work? No amazing results for me. So not worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent for clearing the skin. This product will clear up a pimple in record time. It will dry the surrounding skin so use sparingly and moisturize afterward.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had occasional acne for a few years now which has thankfully subdued as I&#x27;ve grown into adulthood but I bought this product at a time when I had some scars to heal from previous acne. It works very well, you can definitely feel the tingling. After a few weeks of use some scars have shed off and given way to better skin. I also use this product for spot treatment of acne spots I feel are about to come up or are currently active as it tends to work better at killing them faster than typical over the counter medicine. Took off one star because it doesn&#x27;t do much with the pores on my nose so even though it clears up some blackheads I may have, it leaves most of them intact.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin...so I tried to choose a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; introductory peel.  I am very pleased with this product and will be ordering it again! I have about two Tx&#x27;s left for now. I do jot use it weekly as suggested.  As I said, sensitive skin...so I generally use it every 3-4 weeks.  It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth and looking radiant.  One caveat.... Ouch!  It DOES burn!  Especially the first few times you use it...tho this may only apply to me bc of my sensitive skin issues and this being my first chemical peel.  I will order this one again, and then maybe next time take a step up the ladder in the severity/effectiveness of the next peel.  For what it&#x27;s worth I will choose another product from the same company...the shipping was fast, packaging was great and most importantly...excellent instructions were included w/my order-which was of tantamount importance to a facial peel noob like me!</li>
    <li> It would be nice if there were a variety of levels available and the distinction made about each one before ordering. My daughter got one that showed no level I thought I was ordering the same thing and got level 2. I feel I could use a much stronger level, I don&#x27;t get much tingle while leaving it on the entire time and if I apply more layers I use up the product very quickly!</li>
    <li> not sure if gel is better than non-gel. but it does peel after a few days. nice clean simple packaging design. very professional looking.</li>
    <li> Ok mild peel, leave it on for two minutes, mild peeling,more like flaking...</li>
    <li> Works Magic, My skin looks better than ever!!!</li>
    <li> I am an RN, who helped open a medi-spa which gave me years of experience with peels and skin rejuvenation.  I also have a multitude of skin problems: adult acne, melasma and aging skin (55 y/o).  Since leaving my home state, I have moved south, toward the sun and away from my access to medical grade skin products.  This peel is fabulous and performs as well as medical grade (serial peels), I have used 3 bottles so far (0ver 2 years).  Great product!</li>
    <li> As a former Accutane user -- and veteran of many professional chemical peels -- I appreciate this simple and effective option for excellent skin care at home. Worthwhile and well-priced; would buy again.</li>
    <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using this properly but this felt way too harsh on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure how I ever felt comfortable putting acidic chemicals all over my face, perhaps it was the desperation to lighten my scars/clear my skin, but it honestly only made my skin burn and pretty red. There was one peeling session where it actually made a couple of my scars darker and redder which lasted for like 3 days! Sure it felt smooth and tight for a while, but it isn&#x27;t worth the pain and harmful side effects for me. When the skin did finally peel off the scars looked a little bit more sunken in and worse. After about 4 or 5 tries I felt that all these unnatural chemicals were doing more harm than good on my face. I&#x27;m sticking to natural peels and do it yourself toners and such.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! as described!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old female who has always suffered from embarrassing breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried anything and EVERYTHING to clear my acne (washes, scrubs, vitamins, diets, cleanses, ect.) and nothing has ever worked even though I eat healthy and drink nothing but water every day. I purchased a Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel  from Amazon a while back and had no idea how this would change my life. My skin is flawless! It cleared all of my breakouts and even softened the scars. I recommend that you do NOT do anything over 20% to start with, and pleeeeease do your research before doing one on yourself at home (youtube is very helpful). In my experience, despite the name, my skin has never actually peeled and has just been soft and supple immediately after the peel. It is important to moisturize your skin for several days afterwards and to only perform a peel no more than once a week. Be patient, because it may take time (until the 3rd or 4th peel) to see dramatic results. Acne is a very personal and devastating thing to deal with, so I encourage everyone who suffers as I did for so many years, to give this a try. You have nothing to loose.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;For me, 90 sec and 4 treatments works well in 1 session. My skin never peeled but it did feel smoother &amp; better.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about this but love it. Easy to use and is working for me. Would purchase again when I need more.</li>
    <li> The peel made a significant improvement in my skin tone after a few months of usage. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and produces great initial results.  After using the whole bottle (lasts me a few months) i feel like my skin has gotten use to the product and isn&#x27;t reacting to the 20% as before, but that&#x27;s expected.  A short hiatus will fix that.  Overall, I recommend this product and would buy again from the same company.  Secondly, the corresponding face wash is also very effective; used together, you will definitely see a decrease in blemishes.  Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize ;)</li>
    <li> This is a good product, does not leave a huge amount of redness and my skin feel smooth and blackhead free when i&#x27;m finished. I would recommend using a PH balancer afterward.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year.  I typically use it once a month just to freshen my face up.  As soon as my skin starts losing it&#x27;s glow, I use this and it always refreshens my skin.  It&#x27;s easy to use as long as you are careful.  Great product...highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading some recommendations on a beauty blog, I decided to order the 20% salicylic acid peel. It&#x27;s has natural ingredients, which I like. I have a lot of post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation from an unusually bad bout of adult acne, and this has seemed to help peel my skin in those areas and fade them faster. It also is good when used as a spot treatment, but should be used with caution as it is pretty strong. It will cause peeling for a couple days, but it is a peel after all, so that is to be expected. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months...every 2 weeks...started with 2 min...then 3...then 4...now 5...that is my max....it does burn a little...after splashing with cold water...I can feel the skin balling up while rubbing my face...it immediately stops the burn and looks like baby skin....I follow up with Philosophy Hope in a Jar...I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have the kind of fair skin that shows every red spot and blemish, even with makeup. I had an extremely bad breakout on my forehead that got infected and consequently left terrible red spots and scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 months, the scarring and redness had barely gotten better, even after using Mederma scar cream, Proactiv Dark Spot Corrector, tea tree oil, aloe, you name it. I found this peel and decided to give it a try; I have always been scared of peels, but was so desperate I decided to take a chance. And I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this peel twice a week now and my red spots/scarring have gone down about 80% (after only two weeks of usage). My biggest fear about this peel was that I was going to end up looking like I had a bad sunburn for a week and that it would hurt. Not only did this peel not hurt, but you can see the results immediately afterwards-your skin will be glowing! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I get deep inflamed cystic pimples on both cheeks as well as some really tiny bumps as well. I have tried a lot of different products but it always seems like the products that work take months to actually give results (i.e. Retin-A, Differin, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I feel like I have finally found a product that gives results immediately! I have used this peel three times (once per week for three weeks). The first week, I brushed it on and only let it sit for 30-45 seconds because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react. It did sting, but not that badly and I didn&#x27;t experience any peeling afterward. The second week, I left it on for a couple of minutes, and I only brushed the peel onto my left cheek (I wanted to see the difference between my left cheek and right cheek after only treating the left side). It was amazing! Within a day or so, my left cheek started peeling and within a couple of days after that, it was SO much clearer than the right cheek. The active pimples went away and the scars that normally take weeks to go away had already faded significantly. Two nights ago, I used the peel on the other cheek, and today it is peeling like crazy. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks after a couple more days! The peeling skin isn&#x27;t attractive by any means, but I can live with it because it only lasts a day or two and then MUCH better skin is revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and even though it will probably take me a while to use the whole bottle, I will definitely buy another one when I run out.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a spot treatment for stubborn pimples and it helps dry them up and speed up recovery. Every month or so, I use it on my entire face for a nice peel. Your skin will definitely peel the first time, but gradually tolerate it more and more with every use. My skin is pretty stubborn and my skin still peels after almost a year of use, though much less than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely the best product I&#x27;ve found for drying up pimples, so I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE. It burnt my skin completely. I would return it if I had not thrown away the packaging.</li>
    <li> okay so I bought this product to get rid of my acne scars before high school starts basically.&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews and questions saying to apply alcohol into a cotton swab and applying it to your face before using the product for it to work deeper and better into your skin, and I have and it feels like it would do a better job than using nothing at all when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;the first time I use that I used the alcohol remedy and I didn&#x27;t see peeling at first much though I did feel a little ting of pain mostly on my cheeks than on my forehead and chin.&lt;br /&gt;the third week that I&#x27;m using it so far I see and feel peeling once I wash it off, but I dont leave it on for 2 minutes I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything when I leave it on for 2 minutes I leave it on longer.&lt;br /&gt;the second time in the first week that I used it I left it on for about 3-4 minutes but saw little peeling.&lt;br /&gt;now that it is that 3rd or 4th week I leave it on for about 9 to 15 minutes and see the amount of peeling that im satisfied with though this may sound gross but yeah. I don&#x27;t go into the Sun much as said in the reviews and answered questions and arguments that sunscreen probably doesn&#x27;t work and all but I dont go outside very much just In case and if I do I use a hat or something. however it will burn and Sting once you wash it off if you leave it all for like the amount that I leave it on at least. but for me it is worth if it takes away my acne scars before school starts at least I don&#x27;t care about the pain I paid this amount of money knowing this wasnt going to be easy so im paying the price physically painfully, and no I do not get redness on my face like others that they have when applying it for too long which surprises me in a very pleasant way. I wash my face with Proactiv plus step 1 and then apply this product and after that I use the acne scar remover from proactive and hopefully it works I will update further notice by the way. Ive seen my acne scars appearing less redor pinkish almost less noticeable btw this is like my 4th week. Also, ive seen my pores decrease in their size like others have said. But I have not applied lotion because then a zit appears that always leaves a mark even though I leave it alone and treat any way I can for it to not leave a scar. Any lotion I should use that won&#x27;t help acne? Anyway I love the results im seeing so 5 stars lol</li>
    <li> Use it. 3 times weekly.  Smoother skin!</li>
    <li> I am definitely a fan of this prodcut. It lasts forever and works as spot treatment for sudden breakouts.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; to your skin. You have to let it sit there a bit. I mostly peel at my chin only for some reason!</li>
    <li> Love the product. So easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great. Helps with acne.&lt;br /&gt;Clears skin up, peels dead skin right off. Received product right away.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few months ago....and I love how it evens out my complexion and reduces pore size.  So easy to use.  Been able to build up my tolerance to 4 minutes and I generally don&#x27;t even peel after that.  I use it 1-2 times a week and I can really see the difference in skin tone and texture.  Wish I had known about this when I was a teenager....would have made a huge difference in the way my skin looked!!</li>
    <li> I use this weekly - I don&#x27;t recommend more often as you start getting a sandpaper texture from the acid. But used reasonably, it really helps!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality of this product and affordable price too!  My skin looks better than ever and I recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I was desperate to find something that would help my teenage son.  His acne was scarring his face.  The dermatologist said the best way to prevent scarring was to prevent the acne in the first place.  But how???? I didn&#x27;t want him to take accutane.  Other things he tried weren&#x27;t working, then I found this on amazon.  I bought it  and he has been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I apply it to his face every week.  He sits, with a fan blowing on his face, while I apply it and he waits to rinse it off.  Having cold air blowing on his face dramatically helps the burning sensation.  The directions say to leave it on no longer than 10 min.  We leave it on about 8 or 9 - depending on if any skin starts to &amp;#34;frost over&amp;#34;(this is explained in the directions - definitely read the directions).  Leaving it on this long, and using the product once a week, is definitely a more aggressive route, but it is working!!!!!! On day 3 or 4, he wakes up and his face needs major peeling: 10-15 minutes peeling skin off with a tweezer, followed by a good face scrub.... and he is good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I layered it extra thick on areas where he had scarring and the scarring is becoming less and less visible over time.  He has been using it for 5 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His face looks soooooo much better!!!!! Twice, however, his face looked so good that he skipped a week and the acne came back.  Lesson learned.... weekly treatments keep the acne from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very grateful to have found this product.  Easy to use and tremendous results.</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad, oily skin.  After using this product for a month, my acne went from bad to moderate.  It&#x27;s great for spot treatment of pimples, but not so good for acne scars and skin discoloration after the initial bump goes away.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the results, but did not have as much success with it as other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from hormonal acne since I stopped using birth control pills and been looking for something that really works. I have been using the 20% peel for the last one month and I have seen a dramatic change in the way my skin looks..the number of acne pimples have decreased and the scars are decreasing. I use the peel once a week, and other days I add a few drops to my mud mask which I apply on my face everyday. I also add a little to the night moisturizer that I use everyday. So far am loving it....very soon it appears I will have great young looking which has started to show up. I would highly recommend it to anyone with oily skin that tends to break, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product had a decent amount of good reviews so I decided to go for it...its my first time ever trying a peel and I am suffering from major hyper-pigmentation. It took a few trials to see results but I am liking it. Slowly but surely I am beginning to see my face coming back again.</li>
    <li> Works better than I had hoped, especially for a do it yourself product!! Can burn pretty hot while being applied, do fan yourself as instructions say!!! After its done peeling off, which can be slightly unsightly, your skin looks fresh and brand new! Totally worth the slight discomfort! I now use it fairly regularly and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> just started use it, can&#x27;t tell a lot,but looks like it work</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  At first, I thought not strong enough. (I have gotten professionally done before and the peals are really intense can&#x27;t leave the house status)  When done right this peal is effective but still allows you to go to work with a nice light weight sunscreen to calm down the flaky pealing skin .  I didn&#x27;t feel it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; as bad as some of the YouTube videos that I watch posted and I didn&#x27;t frost over even with 5 swipes on my face.  I am 42 with olive skin and I have use this product  3 times now and already feel and can see a difference with my face and neck having less line and skin feels tighter.</li>
    <li> Does not turn my face too red after use. Use gradually. 30 seconds first week then 1 minute the next. And so on. You will feel a burning  sensation during use. So have your cold water running and ready for when you are done</li>
    <li> Can feel the burn and softens skin! Very nice!</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed using this product. The first time I tried it I could only leave it on a short time but, as time has passed and I have continued to use it, my skin tolerates longer exposure. This product leaves my skin so soft and I really think the treatment is similar to what I could find with a doctor or a high-end spa. I am seventy years old and I can see a real difference in my skin since I started using this great product. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make a difference in their skin care.

    <li> Love, love this product. I am  with acne-prone skin , always on search for product help me withi this problem. this is it. Easy to use, easy on my skin/ on some degree/. Great result, Most important, enjoing doing myself this peels.</li>
    <li> Good Product, love it it brought the best result to me , and i could remove my zip in about 30 days</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever. I am an African American woman in my late 30s  with oily skin and severe acne,  that I  have had since my teen years. I was pretty desperate one night as I searched for yet another product that I  thought would fail me. I have tried it all...proactiv, murad,  numerous over the counter products, antibiotics, dermatologists  and 500 dollar retin A topical treatments and nothing has worked until now.  I&#x27;ve used this product for two  months about once a  week and have seen dramatic results. I  still may get a  pimple here and there if I consume dairy products,  but I have many days where my skin is flawless and now for the first time in  over 20  years I  feel comfortable leaving the house without make up.  All I can say  is  Thank God!!!,  my prayers have been answered.  And I  am thankful  to those before me that took the time to write a  review,  which made me want to take chance on this product.  This really works!!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t eliminate bleakheads but definitely improved them after a few times of use. I like to use less strong AHA products in between the applications of this one. Like Alba organics acid peel and just giving a try to Be Natural organics.&lt;br /&gt;Also skin looks so refreshed after this glycolic peel! Just be careful with the time of application.</li>
    <li> This is the best treatment i have found for my chronic chin and neck acne. The peeling has not been a major problem for me. It has done little for my discloration.  However its keeping the acne at bay and that is enough for me.  I use now as proactive and on the spot treatment.</li>
    <li> Good to use. It works.</li>
    <li> Wow it works like a charm!! Got results in less than a month..Easy to use!! Can see the clear skin changes with in a month for black scars left by acne!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that I could try without literally injuring myself in the process! This is a great &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; at-home peel. I apply with a foundation brush. I try to do once a week and have gradually built up from about 3 minutes to 5 - 8 minutes. Distinct burning sensation when first applied but typically settles down after about a minute. I rinse with cold water. Leaves my skin red for about 30 minutes after finishing the process but haven&#x27;t had any real issues with flaky areas, etc. Leaves my skin soft and smooth. Still waiting to see if it has a long-term impact on some light sun/age spots? I will definitely buy again but will probably move up one step in strength now that I know what to expect.</li>
    <li> gently exfoliates after three applications.  skin glows at 74.  no down time and burning was tolerable after 3 min on.  will buy again</li>
    <li> Excellent peel for at home use. Perfect amount of concentration to be used safely at home. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was so afraid to use this product because of all the mixed reviews and how strong people said it was but after using this a few times i will say this stuff has made a small (positive) difference! I started with just 30 seconds and now have gone up to 3 minutes, I have surface scars from acne that left some marks around my chin/jaw line. Sometimes after I rinse the peel of my face I re-apply more onto the problem areas for another 1-2 minutes. The first use I had some pretty bad peeling for about a week but now I only get mild peeling for a few days... I&#x27;m seeing a big difference in breakouts and a small difference with the scarring but I have hope that I will continue to see improvements. I know this will take time and I&#x27;m very pleased with what I&#x27;ve seen so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does BURN... the first time I could barely stand it but my skin has gotten used to it especially when I focus on something else (like watching TV etc.) rather than staring at the clock waiting for the time to pass...</li>
    <li> This stuff burns the crap out of my skin. I tried it several times all with the same effect. I can&#x27;t leave it on longer than 20-30 seconds. Therefore, I saw no benefit and am scared to ever try it again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I will go to a professional for this type of treatment.</li>
    <li> I have to say it really works. I apply it to new red acne spots and leave it for 30 seconds (since it really hurts somehow beyond that) and wash it off. I can see the redness fades right away and the next day it becomes very light. Last year I had a serious break-out and used tons of skin care products and my face was still full of dark spots, for a whole year. They disappeared within two months after I used this Salicylic Acid 20%. I strongly recommend this to you if your skin type can handle more irritative products and you want to deal with your scars or spots fast. However, if your skin is more sensitive, please consider before you take the hurtful risk. I think to have a healthier diet and have more vegetables will also help. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in December of 2013.  I have used the product many times and am now posting my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with the bottle formed crystals in the bottom within a very short time of using.  They do not affect anything unless you accidentally suck them up with the dropper and they tend to scratch just a bit lol.  The product for myself yields very little effect.  I have used the product for up to 10 minutes with minor reddening and thats about it.  I have used other 20% salicylic acid peels in the past and man, you can hardly have them on your skin for more than 3-4 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very thick due to the added oils.  I feel the oils, while buffering the skin, may be the root cause of the diminished effects.  I can not of course prove this it is merely an observation.  After a few weeks use (2 applications) I barely felt any dry skin or any &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; or any effect really.  I did  Also get the 20% Glycolic acid and it seems to be a good product as it works effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long since purchased the product so I felt no need to contact the company.  As others may have indicated it may be a bad batch.  I might try it again and see but I am very skeptical, and at 35.00 I have no desire to spend that amount with little effect or results.  Perhaps another product, as I do believe the Glycolic acid is a decent product.  However it too is weaker than most rated solutions.</li>
    <li> It helps clear my breakouts but it does hurt a lot when you apply it.  The longest i can leave it on for is about a minute.  I see results within 2-3 uses and i tried it on a friend and it helped them too.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product.  It is very easy to use and the directions are clear which is important to me.  I noticed a beautiful difference the very first time I used it.  I only left it on for 2 minutes the first time as this was my first home peel.  I have increased that time a little bit as per the directions.  I have used this about 3 times and the results are great each and every time.  Very reliable and consistent product that does exactly what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I was cautiously optimistic when I began using this product 6 weeks ago but wanted to wait until I had used it sufficiently before I wrote a review. I suffer from moderate to severe cystic acne and have for the last 8 years or so. Now I&#x27;m in mid twenties and it&#x27;s progressively getting worse and beginning to scar. This product does help but not as much as I had hoped. It helps surface my nodules once they&#x27;ve hardened (by peeling the top layers of skin it brings the hardened pore closer to the surface) so that other topical treatments like diluted tea tree oil can be more effective. But beware: use this sparingly and be sure to let your skin regenerate in between uses otherwise you might end up with scabs or brown spots where you burned your skin. And DO NOT pick at the peeling patches, instead gently exfoliate a day or so after. If you remove the peeling skin too soon, you might scar as you haven&#x27;t given your new skin enough time to form properly. It helps with my already formed cysts but doesn&#x27;t seem to keep them from forming and I can not use it often enough to do much.  I applied with a q-tip on problem spots.  It is not the miracle for me as it is for some.    UPDATE:  This is now an integral part of my routine. I now use it more as a spot treatment than a full peel, though I will do a full peel every few weeks. I apply some of the gel to a Q-tip and apply directly on a clean and alcohol swabbed cyst and leave it on until I begin to see it frost or hurt. If you are new to peels I really do suggest that you begin by timing per the instructions and add 5 or 10 seconds each time until you know how your skin reacts. Ten I gently wash with cool water. Once dry I apply my normal nighttime products, omitting anything particularly harsh for that night and MOISTURIZE! For me, this method helps kill the bacteria in the cyst and can help with the pain and inflammation. I only wish I could use this more often (once every 3/4 days) for it to be more effective.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Have used it for 5 times now and can see visible difference. Good product would recommend it to friends for sure.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve purchased several products from this line and am so very satisfied with the quality and results!!!  i&#x27;m a skin care product &#x27;junkie&#x27; and have tried EVERYTHING.....these products deliver significantly positive results at a fabulous price!!!</li>
    <li> I use it pretty sparingly, but this combined with a new cleansing routine has reduced my facial blemishes to almost nothing. Plus, it evens my skin tone, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and really makes my skin look healthier in the long run. I would recommend it to anyone who has skin blemishes or uneven skin tone but be careful if your skin is sensitive...it&#x27;s not something to just play with. It does burn, but you definitely know its working. Just be sure to test it before you go full on.</li>
    <li> Seems OK. A little thick with the gel though.</li>
    <li> This is pretty effective at what it claims to do. It is more specifically designed for active acne rather than the hyperpigmentation or discoloration left behind. When I use it, my skin feels dry for a few days and is a little flaky. After a week my skin looks better. I always use it when I have active acne on my face and it definitely stops the acne from getting worse and starts to calm it down. The only thing I would say is don&#x27;t buy this if you mainly have hyperpigmentation. It has not been as effective for the discoloration, and I would recommend the glycolic acid or lactic acid peel if you specifically have discoloration and uneven skin tone rather than active acne.</li>
    <li> As a teen, I had perfect skin. After 10 years of being on bc pill, I decided I wanted to stop putting chemicals and hormones in my body, so I stopped all hormonal bc. Immediately afterward, my skin had a melt down. Big zits, little zits, white heads, black heads, and huuuuuge cystic zits. I&#x27;m 25 and I am sooo sick of having bad skin.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used this product, I left it on for 2 minutes. My face was so smooth and it only peeled around the edges of my nose, about 3 days later. But my acne seemed to get a little worse. Like it was purging all that built up gunk. Now I use this peel once per week, and I think it has helped. It has especially cleared up my cystic acne. I will definitely keep using this regularly and maybe advance to the 30% version next.</li>
    <li> This works great, be careful to follow the instructions properly.  Do not use more than twice a week if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Salicylic acid can be difficult to use, no matter if you are an experienced dermatologist , but this peeling from Perfect image is combined with green tea , protecting the Patient skin, bringing great results like a facial treatment , improving acne and bringing shine for skin ! It&#x27;s really perfect !</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. I have used 3x, once a week for 3 weeks and I am getting ready to do my 4th application. My skin is renewed, no more bumps, clogged pores or dry skin. Fine lines are virtually gone. I do have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, so I only leave it on for 1 minute and rinse with cool water. Before the peel, I wash my face with a Vitamin E glycerin soap by Clearly Natural. After I rinse the peel off, I immediately apply Eminence VitaSkin Calm Skin Arnica Masque. Let that sit for 10 minutes, rinse off and for my moisturizer I apply Eminence Fire Thorn Treatment. About 2.5 days later the peeling begins and lasts for about 4 days. I noticed that on my skin, frosting only occurs on those areas of my face that have the most damage. My forehead, nose, hairline and jawline do not peel. My cheeks and around my mouth are the areas that do peel. Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> This peel has done a great job of fading my melasma spots, post pregnancy.  I also insisted my husband try it to clear out any blackheads on his nose, so reluctantly he did.  :)  Definitely tingles but he beared through it and could really tell a difference after!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I wish I could post a before and after picture. I have African Nubian brown skin and this stuff works much faster than any fading cream. Burn and discoloration is normal only for a minute or 2. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, but it works!! I used it as recommended and it works! I would definitely recommend this product if u r looking for a skin peel. It stings a little for the first minute or 2. But that&#x27;s just the product doing it&#x27;s job. Just make sure to moisturize after n by the next day, u will start peeling.</li>
    <li> I have a Mediterranean background, so I am prone to oily skin and breakouts.  I used this peel with excellent results.  If you don&#x27;t notice a difference when you use this, you may want to go for a higher acid content (30%), but I recommend using this first and see what results you get.  If you have sensitive skin, you might want to start out with a 10% solution and if you can tolerate that well, then move up to this 20% solution.  I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but I have persistent breakouts and I wasn&#x27;t finding any skin care products that really made a difference until this.  I recommend using the whole bottle, which is about 10+ facials, and do the peel every 2-4 weeks before you give your final verdict.  Your skin regenerates every 4 weeks, so if you don&#x27;t see immediate results, you will over time.  Most of the problems you see on your skin go much deeper and these peels only remove the top layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions carefully to get the best results.  I highly recommend cleaning your face first with an astringent to get surface dirt and oil off your skin, or a cleanser that is also an exfoliant.  You won&#x27;t necessarily feel anything when you put the peel on.  The first time I used it, I felt some tingling and then a little itching, but after a couple of times, that was almost non-existent.  I did have some flaking - it wasn&#x27;t bad, and after a couple of days, that stopped too.  My skin was a little red after using it, so that made it hard to see a difference in my skin, but after a few hours, that calmed down and I did notice my blackheads were gone and my pores were a little smaller.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  I look much more refreshed, and my skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is good for breakouts, this is not a cure for acne, so if you have a problem like I have, you will have to keep doing the peels to keep your skin clear.  To prevent acne I use [[ASIN:B004LJ0ZK6 ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]].  There are several different acne pills/supplements available that work well but this is easily the best one that I have ever used. It prevents acne in addition to clearing skin.  After taking the clearzine supplement for awhile, my breakouts are rare, and then the salicylic acid peel takes care of it quite nicely. I like looking in a mirror now.</li>
    <li> I think this i an O.K. product, it worked to get rid of some of my problem blackhead areas like my nose and cheek. However, i must warn you all that this product BURNS; yeah the directions and the nice readable pamphlet tell you \\&quot;hey this may burn sensitive skin.\\&quot; Therefor I had anticipated a slight warming sensation or even a hot flash type of feeling. Nope. The burn is VERY intense and starts as soon as you put it on your face. I would compare it to the worst sunburn that you can imagine; okay maybe not the absolute worst but close. Its not an unbearable burn but if you are not expecting it, you&#x27;ll panic like i did the first time using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the burning, i would recommend this to anyone who thinks that they need it. However, i will be sure to warn them about how intense the burning really is.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had a pretty bad breakout because of makeup that i&#x27;ve finally gotten under control but my skin is left with scars and uneven complexion. i picked this up as my first ever gel peel. it initially clears up the skin (after 4 times of use) but my skin erupts in breakouts that last for a few days and dry out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i havent seen a very significant change yet.</li>
    <li> did what it said it would, cleared up skin from both white heads and blackheads, but did make my skin peel some and very sensitive to light. All as expected, will buy again</li>
    <li> Great Product i love the way it makes my skin glow after use. But i do recommend for beginners to follow instructions! For your first time use it for 30 seconds then progress to a minute then so on. But great seller and i will buy from this seller again and this product when i run out! Lol Hope i helped!! :)</li>
    <li> This product is great at drying out and clearing up breakouts quickly. I use it as a full face peel for scarring, about once every week or two, and a spot treatment, as needed. I am happy with the results and will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> After the first use, my skin looked fantastic. I used to get chemical peels at a medspa for $125 per month but this gives the same results for a much lower cost!</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle! It helped me get rid of annoying, embarrassing acne blemishes on my face and back. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Works great! Shrinks pores immediately</li>
    <li> I purchased this to see if it helps with actinic keratosis.  So far, so good.  It may not have gotten rid of my actinic keratosis, but it helps with the flair ups and seems to calm down the irritation and redness more quickly than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It is not too harsh, burns a tiny bit, but not bad at all.  It makes my skin dry and flakey, but that&#x27;s what is supposed to do.  I just make sure I moisturize every night.  I will continue to use it and monitor my actinic keratosis. My hope is with continued use it will get rid of some of them completely.  I went though a medical treatment called Picato, which was HORRIBLE and didn&#x27;t even work.  So I wanted to try this.  I will post again as I continue to treat.</li>
    <li> Great product. I definitely noticed a change of skin texture for the better. I have been applying it once a week and lately my skin has not only cleared up but also looks and feels much smoother than it has been for a while</li>
    <li> Works great! Make sure to read the long instructions included and follow it!</li>
    <li> It is one of the best peelers out there. For those suffering from cystic acne, this is great as it can penetrate the pores. I tried the peelers of other companies, but this was the most effective for me. Just FYI, I am a black female in my 20s.</li>
    <li> I have been using the gel peel with great results.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of the Perfect Image products for some time. I have tried a variety of the peels and compared them to other brands.  Not only are the gel peels easier to use (no dripping), they are also more effective. For me, at least, the &#x27;tingle&#x27; begins within 5 to 10 seconds after application so I feel it working. It is easy to rinse off with soapy water to neutralize the acid. My skin looks and feels clearer, healthily rosy (not burnt) and firm. A very good buy for a a product that performs according to the description.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review after six weeks of use the product 4 times, 90% gone so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as manufacture claim.&lt;br /&gt;Have some sun damage on my head that is where I applied the product, after the maximum time allowed per the manufacturer, right after rinse it off, my skin puffs up slightly from the irritation of the product making the skin look wrinkle free so my initial reaction was positive, that only lasted a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;When I look at my skin now six weeks later it does not look any different.</li>
    <li> I used the peel several times already. I have oily/combination skin an prone to get blackheads. I used it 3 times on my nose over the last 10 days and I just looked in the mirror and all my blackheads are gone! Quite remarkable actually. I will keep using.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really helps to keep my skin clear. It does tingle at first but your skin gets used to it over time.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, prone to stubborn breakouts, mostly blackheads and cystic acne.  I love this product because you are getting a professional chemical peel at home.  This peel, while my face was a bit inflamed directly after use, shrinks my cystic acne, as well as gets rid of layers of skin that were clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any facial treatments, you have to be careful and use as directed.  Start slow as the directions indicate, and gradually increase how long you leave the peel on and how frequently you do it based upon how your skin reacts to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background on my acne skincare...I have oily skin that I would consider tolerable to most topical treatments. For example I use tazorac and benzaclin and have been for years with minimal dryness/peeling on face, and still have acne.  I was doing this face peel once every other week however sometimes my face needed it weekly to keep my acne flare ups in check.  Also, I did use this product in conjunction with being in the sun, I think the directions say 2 weeks of no sun exposure.  Obviously try to use it when you havent been in the sun, but I&#x27;d give it a few days and it was fine (over the winter months).  I do have a freckled complexion anyways though, and havent had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So follow the directions, and then see how your skin reacts.  The peel does burn, sometimes worse than other times it seemed like...but its a quick easy peel that really benefits my skin and tones down the inflammation of my acne.  I still have acne, but I&#x27;ve tried just about everything except accutane...and this is one product that I am very, very pleased with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my first acne peel at a salon for ~$30.  Dont waste your money, buy the bottle for $30 and get 20 peels instead....I will be buying another bottle, love this stuff!  Finding this on Amazon.com is a godsend!</li>
    <li> This review is for Perfect Image Salicylic Acid Gel Peel 20%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne. Even after becoming an adult, I would always have at least one pimple, sometimes huge cysts. Things improved after I started taking the pill but I would still have some acne, huge pores, rough skin and incredibly oily skin. I mean, 30 seconds after applying matte power for oily skin, my face was already sticky. To make matters worse, my skin is very sensitive so any pimple would be noticeable for months, years even. I tried everything, including Accutane (2 rounds), which did help. The worse thing was the oily skin mixed with the dry patches due to all the crap I used to control those pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years after my last dose of Accutane, I would still get the occassional pimple. I accepted that my sugar-free, milk-free, organic chocolate bar would ALWAYS give me pimples. Anyways, I was hopeful but I didn&#x27;t expect any major change. Was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing hurts like a son of a bitch. I couldn&#x27;t keep it on my face for more than one minute and thought I couldn&#x27;t use it. Eventually, I managed to leave it on for 2-3 minutes every 2-3 weeks. But that turned out to be too often and now I use it every 4-6 weeks. I literally haven&#x27;t had a pimple in forever. My always-covered-in-bumps forehead looks normal, and the pores, although still big, look cleaner and smaller. The sebaceous filaments on my nose, cheecks, chin, etc. are invisible. My horribly oily skin doesn&#x27;t look like a wet fish anymore. My skin looks smooth for the first time ever. I can even meet with friends wearing nothing but tinted sunscreen (SFP 100 and UVA/UVB protection) and a little powder (my skin is still oily). I honestly dunno if this will work forever but I hope it does because it really changed my life.</li>
    <li> Salicylic acid is a key ingredient of any anti-acne skin care products, as it&#x27;s known for all, it&#x27;s been clinically proved to fight against acnes for many years.&lt;br /&gt;And perfect image salicylic acid gel peel is a complete pure chemical peel I have ever been used. It&#x27;s completely safe sealed and it comes with a clean dropper so people can exactly know how much quantity of gel you should use each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after 3 months of using it, I could see a brilliant result on my face, I can&#x27;t say all my acnes were gone since I used it, but I can definitely say it helped a lot, at least 70% of acnes were diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not not only used for whole face peel, but also just for acne. And it will disappear after few times of peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone! I know acnes is a pain in the arse, but as long as you choose the right product and take much more care of face, you&#x27;ll have the most beautiful one!</li>
    <li> Well I tried my first application two days ago and have noticed some slight changes in skin tone and acne (I am 32 with slight to medium adult acne).  I was able to leave it on for about a minute but it did sting like hell!  The skin around my mouth and chin did start to turn red, but after washing with cool water for about a minute, it went away.  It did dry my face out, but not too bad.  I used an alpha hydroxy, non-oil, non fragrance face moisturizer afterward.  So far I am please with the results.  I am going to try another application in a few days.  I will update my review after doing so.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I am somewhat lazy when it comes to skin care. Oh, I follow my morning/evening routine religiously and use sunscreen daily, but I cannot force myself to do masks, peels, etc. regularly as they usually take a lot of time. And I am a quite busy person. This peel appeared to be a perfect choice for me: it is easy to apply, not messy, and most importantly very fast to use. The entire procedure (application, neutralisation, and after peel care) takes me only 7-10 minutes from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;I found this peel also to be quite effective. It made my skin look brighter and more radiant. My pores shrinked visibly and are perfectly clean. After two months of use (once a week) there is not much improvement in acne scars. I might switch to other peels to treat those.&lt;br /&gt;There is no downtime for me, except higher sensitivity to sun and sunscreen products. Therefore, I prefer to do it on Friday or Saturday evening. The peeling with this product is not very visible, so I can use it even if I have some important event in the middle of a week. My skin does not look dry, patchy, or irritated. However, everyone&#x27;s reaction is different, so it is better to do a patch test first and allow one-two days in case you have a stronger reaction to this peel.</li>
    <li> I really like this peel.  I have combination-to-oily skin and using this peel even once a month helps control breakouts and heal blemishes that already exist.  I&#x27;ve found that when I use it, I have a significant reduction in the amount and severity of blackheads.  It also makes blackheads much easier to extract.  I highly recommend this, but you have to follow the directions to the letter!  After using this peel, I baby my skin for at least five days - no harsh cleansers, minimal makeup, and I use German Nivea cr&amp;egrave;me plus my regular moisturizer at least twice daily so my skin is well-moisturized.  If you have sensitive skin, this is probably too harsh for you, but if you have skin that tolerates acids well, this can be a real lifesaver for your complexion.</li>
    <li> After 3 months of use, the product seems to be working.  I would recommend using a good face serum following each treatment.</li>
    <li> The product works great and has helped my skin a lot, the shipping was fast as well!</li>
    <li> This peel helps clear my acne. I apply the peel every 2-3 weeks and love it. After I remove the peel I apply a combo of EVOO and tree tea oil to help with the drying. Yes, your face will be dry and may peel but worth it in the long run. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I will accept no substitutes from this point forward. I have tried dozens and dozens of peels over the years, and I have spent a small fortune. Each one promised the world. Some were good, but most were bad. They all cost more than $35!&lt;br /&gt;This SA peel is a miracle for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I have the beginnings of wrinkles, especially around my eyes. My pores are so huge that I am sure you can seem them from the Space Shuttle.&lt;br /&gt;This peel has worked wonders on evening out my skin tone. I find myself petting my face afterwards because it is so smooth, too!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any diminution in my acne but I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase either. I think my acne disappears 1-2 days more quickly than before, which is nothing to sniff at.&lt;br /&gt;My partner has commented on how good my skin looks. This is the only thing different I have done!&lt;br /&gt;Even on my sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t had any major irritation. Indeed, I can still use my topical Rx tretinoin a few hours after using this peel.&lt;br /&gt;The gel texture works for me. I like that it sits on the cotton pad instead of just absorbing into it. The gel texture helps with this.&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble: I wish it were in an air-tight pump.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this peel 1x/week for the past 6 weeks and the bottle is only 40% gone. That&#x27;s a lot of bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;What are you waiting for? Add it to your cart!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar and I love this stuff! I don&#x27;t use as often as I did with my first jar (I use once every 2 weeks or so) but I&#x27;ve increased to 3 minutes per session. Keep away from your dry spots though because you&#x27;ll peel for a few days. I just moisturize with a little vitamin E at night to balance it out. I started using it on my chest and back as well and it&#x27;s really cleared and smoothed those areas out.</li>
    <li> Bought this because another reviewer who had cystic acne recommended it. It&#x27;s everything she said it is &amp; then some. Did the peel yesterday &amp; the top layer of my skin is peeling off today. I can&#x27;t wait to try it in another 2 weeks. I can already see fresh new skin underneath (that&#x27;s like 3 shades lighter so women of colour be aware that this will lighten/bleach you in a serious way). What&#x27;s more: the huge cystic acne outbreaks have ceased - overnight! Blackheads have also completely dried up. They&#x27;re all disappearing. I know this is going to sound extreme, but this serum is what&#x27;s extreme. Omg. I could&#x27;ve saved years of torment &amp; money at my dermatologist if I&#x27;d found this thing sooner. The last time I had results like this I was on 3 face medications &amp; a super antibiotic that made me sick for 3 months. Buy it!!! I can&#x27;t scream that enough.</li>
    <li> My skin may be too sensitive for this, I didn&#x27;t think it would be.  30 seconds was even too long for me to keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;My few dark spots I had showed up more after.</li>
    <li> I know this review is long but bare with me!! No I am not going to give that scientific method crap or try to sell you on something! Just a regular guy (18) that is dealing with acne! Trust me! I am in complete shock!!! I found the answer! I finally found what I&#x27;ve been searching for for years!!!! I sound crazy haha I have tried everything, proactiv, skin ID, African black soap but especially home remedies; toothpaste on face, potato on face, lemon on face, honey on face etc... It sucked! A few years back I went to the dermatologist and I did this procedure that included salicylic acid. Didn&#x27;t think anything of it back then! Moved away for college, that meant no more dermatologist!:( I broke out like crazy!! And if you have acne you know how insecure it makes you! You wake up every morning and look at yourself ok the mirror and think \\&quot; why do I have acne!!!!\\&quot; It&#x27;s stressful! Plus I&#x27;m a server at a high end restaurant so I HAVE to deal with people!! Anyways! I needed to find something to help my acne because how am I supposed to meet new people with all this crap on my face?! So I decided to look up the acid and read the reviews! Make sure you read reviews people!! They&#x27;re the things that can change your life! I ordered it, yes it burns but just fan it out! It felt exactly like the acid that I got at the dermatologist! I would follow the instructions until your face gets used to it! Then you decide how you feel and when to use it! The peel was minor! I didn&#x27;t really peel extremely! So it wasn&#x27;t noticeable! If you accidentally burn your face just put some moisturizer or aloevera cream, and it&#x27;s gone in a few minutes! My acne is a combo of black heads with the big red ones that fill up with the white stuff! So gross! Oh then the bastards leave huge, dark scar marks!! It&#x27;s only been about a month and holy crap! I am impressed! Scars are reduced, barley get acne now...Literally, skin is super soft! My scars don&#x27;t get all purple/red when I&#x27;m out in the sun! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! I have it on as I&#x27;m writing this review! Haha I can&#x27;t wait to go back home to show my family the difference!! I&#x27;m so stoked!! Wooooo Hooooo!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things that help me! Omega 3 to reduce redness! (Pill form) Lots of water! It turns out dairy is a huge contribution to acne, so I had to drop that:( it was the hardest thing to stop eating because I&#x27;m a HUGE cheese lover! I eat it every here and then tho! Of course I dropped sugar, soda, candy bars etc.. ( I dropped sugar a few years back so in used to it) I guess gluten also contributes but I don&#x27;t really know what foods those are! I&#x27;ll do some research! But dairy!! Didn&#x27;t think it was that bad! Even without the acid I saw some improvement when I would stop eating it! And wash your face with a cleanser! I bought some scrubbing brush gloves and just used those! I know it&#x27;s hard to constantly cleanse your face but make it a habit! Don&#x27;t think you don&#x27;t have time to do it! If you have time to pick and pop pimples you have time to wash your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said not trying to sell you on anything but might as well give it a try!</li>
    <li> Can see and feel smoother skin. Start by  trying less for a shorter amount of time to see what what amount and time works for your skin type.  But no doubt my skin looks and feels better with twice a week use than anything else I have used.</li>
    <li> i am very meticulous when choosing products to apply to my skin.  I take very good care of my skin care needs by getting facials on a regular basis, by using exfoliating products, as well as applying an spf 30 before going out in the sun.  Although I keep up with these preventative steps in order to keep my skin looking young, I do occasionally happen to have annoying acne spots that appear every now and then.  I don&#x27;t know why or how, I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s just a mixture of my oily skin and built up oil that has been clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;fter following the instructions very carefully, I applied the product to a gauze pad as indicated in the instructions and spread it evenly all over my face from top to bottom.  I did this for 3 minutes then washed my face with cool water.  Afterwards, my skin felt great!!  The next day I had no redness, the 3rd day slight peeling.  The next week, however, my skin was actually pretty clear.  My skin felt smooth and no more acne...Yay!  I am going to continue to use this product as long as it achieves these results, and will update if anything happens to change...so far so good!!</li>
    <li> Just used it I saw results. I have really bad hyperpigmentation, that&#x27;s why I purchased this product. I definitely need to use it more than once to eliminate all of the pigmentation on the skin. Make sure you purchase moisturizer because it makes the skin extremely dry.</li>
    <li> I must share this review with you guys.  I am an individual who suffers from extreme hyperpigmentation and must say that this is the best product that ever worked effectively.  I tried prescription medications, but they were to expensive to maintain.  I&#x27;ve tried other products as well which led to a dead end and a waste of money.  This product, \\&quot;Perfect Image\\&quot; each week and removed the hyperpigmentation that was so embarassing too me.  The hyperpigmentation was so bad that it appeared as if I had a beard.  Perfect Image is gradually evening my complexion which is what I&#x27;ve always wanted and it&#x27;s working.  The best product ever!</li>
    <li> Skin type: very oily, blackheads white heads and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only washed my face with the face wash once before I went to bed last night and this morning. Already, I&#x27;m seeing results!!! My skin is so resilient and stubborn! My acne won&#x27;t clear up for anything!!!! Finally, desperate, I bought this chemical peel. I wear a lot of cover up and my face is so oily that the makeup wears off by mid-day. Today, I kept checking my makeup in the mirror and it looked like I had just applied it!!! Even now over 12 hours later! My skin is more even toned instead of rosey patches and my cheeks have cleared up a considerable amount! I&#x27;m amazed! I really hope these result continue! I&#x27;ll write another review after I finish the process. I&#x27;m so excited to have a clear face for the first time in years!</li>
    <li> Yes it works very well! It burns a lot so please be aware of this. Also it takes some time like all good things, and afyer a few weeks or a month you will notice a huge difference in your skin! I may even like this better than retin A.  It seems to shed my skin and gives me a youthful appearance.  I have noticed my sun damage has lightened and my scars have diminished.  It also makes me look younger! :-) I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Second time buying it.</li>
    <li> This peel is simply amazing. I have extremely sensitive and oily skin, after using the peel only a couple of times the vast majority of my breakouts have gone away. Perfect Image you have a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several chemical peels over a span of eight months, and so far, Perfect Image&#x27;s Salicylic Acid gave me spa-like results, without the burn. This past Tuesday was my first time using the product, and upon application, I noticed that my acne had completely disappeared.  The only reason why I gave it four stars, is because I was looking for a stronger and more potent product to remove my longstanding acne scars. However, this company&#x27;s products are to be used weekly so as to produce greater results over time, unlike other chemical peels that require once a month, or bi-weekly use. So chances are that they will disappear after continued use, but patience is key.  Either way, I am satisfied with the results and will update you as I continue using the peel each week.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using such a product and it&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;ve had very oily skin my entire life, and even after 1 use, the oil was gone, even one and 2 days later.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 or 4 times per week for 10 minutes at a time, and I do see some slight peeling and flaking of skin, but nothing bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be using this for probably the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> It made my face more softt, and made some of my wrinkles around my eyes, and on my forehead less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I never had acne before until my twenties. It seemed to start right after I started taking biotin for my hair and I started getting huge zits on my face. They left many marks and I felt embarassed by the scarring. So I turned to makeup (which is costly an d annoying when it melts) which I never had to wear before to cover my scars. I started using this product and I hardly ever get acne anymore and my scars are fading as well. It is not as harsh as other peels I have tried. I love it.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product for all people with acne, but you have to be consistent and use it over time. Be careful with the sun, since your skin is way more sensitive. Worth to try it!</li>
    <li> it helped for a little but my acne came back not too long after using the peel. it was a okay peel though</li>
    <li> My normal but medium scared by acne and with freckles skin looks so healthy after first use! I started with the !st Level Perfect Image Peel and I loved it. I use it more often than this one but it is a great in between exfoliator, lightener and rejuvinator. This Level 2 Peel is much stronger and I use it once every 2 weeks. It is a great alternative to Salon Treatment at home. Safe affordable and better results! I spent 200+ on microdermabrasions with peels but the results were not as great as with these peels. I love these. I wish I knew about them earlier. My skin is so smooth and it feels very gentle and the scar marks/scars are lighter and freckles are lighter too! I am saving money, time and do it myself which I love as I do not like anyone touching me. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I use it to get rid of blackheads, it works but it burns my face extremely bad! it feels like my face is on fire.</li>
    <li> Gives just enought sting to know it&#x27;s working but not overly strong.  Will make your zits go away quickly!! Hasn&#x27;t left my face peeling like other salic acid peels.  This one is alot better for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> this was my first time trying this chemical peel..I have really bad acne scars, dark spots, hyper-pigmentation and occasional acne and really really oily skin.that being the reason i brought this chemical peel in the first place. The first time i used the peel, the next morning, my face felt much smoother. the peel will actually dry the pimples as soon as you put it on. I did not experience any bad peeling of the skin which was good for me but within a week i was seeing my skin clearing up. I used it weekly. Initially, I felt a little sting when applied but i would stand in front of the fan to cool the burning and it really helps.  the fourth time i used it, i was able to tolerate it more than i could have before. I even layered the peel to enhance its effectiveness. I can see the scarring n my face gradually fading and my pores are much smaller. My face feels a lot smoother, it not as rough as before. i still have a flare up with pimples but that is due to my hormones. Overall, it is a really good product and i would recommend to anyone, whether you are suffering from acne, scars, wrinkles it is worth giving it a shot!!!! Both the quantity and the quality are excellent. After my fourth use with layering once, the bottle is ¾. i hope that by the time I am finished with the first bottle, i will see even more results. if you have acne that is caused by your hormones or even due to some other biological/ medical problem (me- I have PCOS), please do not think that using the peel will cure your acne it will assist with clearing your face for a while. However, if you treat you skin really well and avoid too exposure in the sun and use a moisturizer with SPF, you will be sure to see tremendous results and a decrease in break outs.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best products out there. I have used it several times and the results were better than I thought. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have severe sun spots on my forehead. I tried a lot of anti sun spots creams but nothing worked. This product improved a lot my sun spots and I expect it to continue improving further. My overall skin looks much smoother, brighter and with less visible pores. I was scared of putting acid on my face but this proved to be very safe. In fact, I see the improvements on my skin but do not get any redness or flaking. Will definately continue to use this 2x week for a long time. If you are on the line...just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> This is a good entry level gel peel for me and my mom. I&#x27;m Asian in the late 20s and my mom is in her early 50s. Both of our skins are the typical oily type (thank you, mom) and I had quite a few acne and acne scars here and there. After using it for 3 months (stopped for a month between sessions), I can say that my skin was improved quite a lot. Now I see less breakouts and the color of those scars got a lot lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my mom and I have sensitive skin, she always leaves it on for &amp;lt; 5 minutes and I only keep it on for &amp;lt; 1 minute. My recommendation of using this product is: know your pain limit, don&#x27;t leave it on for too long, and use hydrate mask for sensitive skins afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this Chemical peel, it has done wonders to my oily, acne prone skin.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and my oily skin looks so much better.  I also had a lot of blackheads and acne, now that problem is gone.  This product does wonders and I like everything about it except for the stinging part.</li>
    <li> i have ordered two bottles of this product and am ordering a third, i have never used anything that made my skin feel as clean as this peels leaves it.  you leave it on for a few minutes, yes it burns but not horrible, you wash it off and put on a good moisturizer after wards and your skin feels wonderful, well atleast mine does.  i use it once a week and it makes my skin much better than just washing it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally tan skin (bi-racial, very alike to Halle Berry&#x27;s tone), and I suffer from acne and acne marks here and there. I bought this on a whim and believe me I was scared because the thought of chemical, burning and peels near by skin scared me out of my shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it out on new and old acne scars (spot treatment with q-tip) -- I don&#x27;t use it on my whole face. I use the q-tip and rub it around the area where the acne marks are. This might sound weird, but I actually use it about 3-4 times a week and it&#x27;s been perfectly okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My steps are: I wash my face with Clinique foaming cleanser, pat dry with towel (never rub), and dab the liquid on. I leave it on about 1-2 minutes -- yes it does burn a little, but it&#x27;s more like an irritating tingling itchy sensation and is tolerable. I see the white stuff forming, and I rinse off a lot with cold water and pat dry. The night that I do it I don&#x27;t put anything on my face. Sometimes in the morning it is red and very dry, so I just use a little bit of Clinique toner and put on Clinique lotion and sometimes sunscreen. DON&#x27;T peel it. Just let it go away on it&#x27;s on, and it does it&#x27;s on thing. During this time, I wear a hat at all times because it&#x27;s Spring now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES work. I had a pencil eraser size acne scar, pretty dark between the middle of my upper lip -- and it was gone in 2 treatments, but that was a fairly new one. I use it on the areas around my cheek, chin, and neck, and it is slowly fading. I have gotten compliments from my co-worker that my skin even looks brighter. Yes, sometimes you will look red and dry, but I don&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s working. it takes time and be patient.</li>
    <li> If you know how to use it, then it&#x27;s a great product.  The money you save by doing this at home is fabulous.  I hsd tried other more expensive peels and masks. Hands down this is THE BEST!  Being in your 40&#x27;s and getting adult acne is humiliating. But it happens to many of us.  This has reduced facial lines on my forehead, around my eyes and cheek/mouth area. I have received compliments from Doctors ,  family and stranger&#x27;s. I would definitely keep this in stock.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I have not been disappointed by any product I&#x27;ve purchased from this company.  This peel is strong and you should read the directions, but the power is in your hands--you can wash it off after as much or as little time as you like.  I have found it to be great for helping with breakouts (including on your back, etc); it does not do as much to clear out existing blackheads and the like.  It will leave your skin a bit dry, so make sure to moisturize afterward.</li>
    <li> First time buyer with decent results.</li>
    <li> After just using the salicylic acid peel for once, my skin have become a lot smoother and the comedones cleared up a lot, cheap price with good results!definitely recommend this to anyone that have oily skin,clogged pores and acne.</li>
    <li> Love this peel and Perfect Image, the mfg. They have wonderful products and an excellent array of them. I always get my syuff on time and in good shape. This peel is a good one to start of with. Maybe even a 10% Salicylic acid. I like the gels as they are easier to control and I can apply them with a taklon brush. Do follow the instructions as this IS an acid. I like that it also contains green tea and tea tree oil. Antibacterial and anti oxident. If this is your 1st time to use, keep a bowl of baking soda in water to use as a neutralizer if needed. Also I recommend a skin test on a small area before slathering all over in a full treatment.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months back. I loved that it had green tea and tea tree oil as well as a high SA. Ive used it a few times a week and it always cause my breakouts to lessen and clear up. It also lightens any acne scars that have accured. It&#x27;s become my favorite product because I love a applying it and watching my ance burn!</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and clean your face with alcohol and your face will be amazing! I started with 5-7 minutes for the first 3 weeks, and experienced rapid clearing of acne and some peeling. For the fourth month, I did 12 minutes and had extreme peeling (where I wouldn&#x27;t even go outside). My skin has NEVER been so clear. My skin isn&#x27;t really sensitive, but the stinging/pain during the short time the product has to be on the skin is totally worth it! Your skin will be dry and flaky, so make sure to use a very moisturizing lotion. This peel was unlike most of the other peels I have tried in that my skin actually peeled and I got great results. When you first start, you might experience significant peeling (like a sunburn), but live through it if you want to see results! I have been using this salicylic acid peel for about 3 months now (once per week for 3-5 minutes) and my skin is better than ever!</li>
    <li> I apply this to my face after cleansing 2 nights a week to treat my seb derm patches and it literally takes them AWAY! It leaves my skin soft and beautiful. Been using for 4-5 months, and am about to puchase more!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good at-home peel to help control adult acne that developed a few years ago while pregnant with my first child and also to revive generally dull looking skin and some hyper-pigmentation around cheek bones.  After reading the reviews, I decided to try this peel from Perfect Image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this peel for the last 4 weeks, 2x per week.  The results are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;-Acne on chin and forehead (my problem areas) reduced by 80-90%.  The acne on my forehead is gone now and very little on my chin area.&lt;br /&gt;-hyper-pigmentation greatly reduced, very happy with results.&lt;br /&gt;-skin looks more vibrant and brighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this peel and will be trying the other peels as well.&lt;br /&gt;After applying, it normally took about 4-5 days for the skin to naturally peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with leaving the peel 1 min, then 2 mins, then 4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I applied Cerave lotion to minimize dry, tight skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel worked as described and I didn&#x27;t experience any negative side effects.  I would highly recommend this peel to anyone looking for an at-home peel.</li>
    <li> I use it about every 5 days, and it works great, clears my face up (which is important since it is acne ridden), and since I can&#x27;t make it to the dermatologist every week to get a chemical peel this is really convienent. Just make sure you start at a short amount of time, and gradually get to about 10 minutes. Although the next bottle I buy will probably be 30%.</li>
    <li> The product works well for some conditions, but a stronger product is needed for others. Frequent use may not be optimal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair, with redness/blotchiness in my t-zone, and this works well for clearing/evening out my complexion if used over time, over my entire face. I also have dark/reddish spots that I will use this on, leaving it longer than I would for the rest of my face. This has gradually faded the spots, but they do come back so I need to keep using it. This also seems to minimize the wrinkles on my upper lip. My face peels for a few days but after a week looks pretty good. Nothing will work miracles, but this stuff does seem to leave a brighter, more even, younger-looking complexion.</li>
    <li> My daughter has acne, I used other products from Pefect Image and they really worked, so I decided to purchase their sample pack.  Inside the sample pack it had Salicylic Acid, so we decided to try it.  I first cleansed her face with their deep cleaning gel, then I used the Salicylic Acid. I was worried about putting it on her face for too long, since she has such sensitive skin, I was right, it only took a few seconds before I could see the ice peeks on her face. I made her rinsed her face immediately, and then we put Aquaphor on her face to retain the moisture so she wouldn&#x27;t scar.  This really worked for her, her skin looks so much better.  I really like Perfect Image products, I use them on my own face and look 10 years younger, according to my husband and children.  I would highly recommend that you do test spot on your face first before doing your whole face, I did burn the side of my face and had to really work hard to fade that scar out.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that could finally get rid of the small pimples on my chin that have been there forever.  This is the only product I have ever has success with.  Just an FYI, your skin may breakout when first using, but that is just the skin shedding the upper layers.  Keep with it and you will be rewarded with consistently clear skin!</li>
    <li> This product is really helpfull for acne and acne scars. I mostly only used it on my body (back/chest) because my face can&#x27;t support this or i don&#x27;t have the time to for the healing time. I would only suggest that you keep in mind that there is a down time know as healing time which only applies if you put it on your face however it is worth it if you have the time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomed this to everyone who has acne and/or acne scars especially people who have body acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once/twice a week since August.  I&#x27;m in my mid-50s, and it has definitely made my skin smoother, especially my forehead.  The skin on my cheeks looks much softer, too.  It is strong- so put it on for only a minute the first time.  Work your way up to longer amounts of time.  Now it&#x27;s just a part of my weekly routine and easy to do - the first application made me a bit nervous though!  Will purchase more - and want to try some of the other products, too.</li>
    <li> I love this peel!!  It gives you a glowy look and smooth skin.  I have recommended this to many of my friends!</li>
    <li> The purpose I wanted to use this was for reducing age spots, as my doc recommended I use salycylic acid for them, as well as an actinic keratosis (I had asked him to burn or peel off the spots but he wouldn&#x27;t and referred me to the S.A.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it was very gentle, and I felt no burning whatsoever. It&#x27;s weird because others here are reporting burning sensation, frosting, etc. I didn&#x27;t. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I already regularly use prescription retin-a, so my skin is &#x27;tougher&#x27;? or if it was an irregular batch? (a few other reviewers mentioned the same thing too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say it would be excellent as a cleanser or to unclog pores, since the salycylic acid is one of the most effective for that, and this product supposedly has a decent percentage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using [[ASIN:B000GCLTT8 Compound W Wart Remover Fast-Acting Gel: .25 OZ]] !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, good old Compound W! It has 17% S.A., the mfr does not recommend use on the face though, which is odd since all the other S.A. products here are for the face -- my guess is because of the strength. I would never put it all over, just on individual sunspots on keratosis. For me it&#x27;s working and definitely frosts! Again it takes time, just like anything, not an instant fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Perfect Image product is a good one for declogging pores and acne, and it seems quite gentle.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Burned my whole entire face causing scratches and redness and red marks everywhere! Probably wouldn&#x27;t recomend it to teens with sensitive skin, considering I&#x27;m one myself...</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve gotten 8 peels out of this small bottle already and I still have enough left for another 2 -4 peels.  It&#x27;s the perfect starter peel because it&#x27;s not too strong but it really packs a wallop!  My friend has been raving about my skin, so I gave her a peel.  Her skin is very aged, and after just one peel at 8 minutes,  I could see a big difference.  Her wrinkles were less deep, and her skin color was much improved. Personally I am up to 22 minutes without too much discomfort but I always exfoliate aggressively the day before using a quality scrub.  I intend to use this peel twice a week and when I don&#x27;t, I see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the suggested cotton pads application method, but there&#x27;s too much wasted product left on the pad.  I bought one of the peel brushes, but this gel product doesn&#x27;t work well with the brush; it&#x27;s too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s how I use this product: I exfoliate the day before, and right before the peel I apply alcohol with a cotton pad until the pad shows no oil/dirt on the pad.  Then I rinse my face with cold water.  I set the timer for 8 minutes(smart phone app-Stop Watch), expecting to reset it a couple of times, and then I apply the gel with my alcohol-cleaned first 2 fingers. There&#x27;s no lost product this way and it&#x27;s easy to tell when you&#x27;ve not applied enough product on a particular area of the face.  I also do my neck at the same time in the same way, and I frequently do the backs of my hands. Rinse in the sink with cold water when you&#x27;ve reached the length of time you&#x27;ve chosen or when your face is too sore.  Rinse again and again because it&#x27;s easy to under-rinse which you&#x27;d like to avoid. Then air dry your face and apply Hyaluronic acid to your face. After that, I apply Argan Oil which soaks into your skin. Quick caution: during the peel, avoid the under eye area, any deep creases around the nostrils or nose-to-chin lines, and the upper lip.  I&#x27;ve never had a professional peel, but I can assure you that you will see a difference the first time you use it.  Avoid the sun for a day, and use sunscreen pretty regularly because the peel does reveal that beautiful, fragile, new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a 50% glycolic peel from this company because I am so pleased with this product.  I was afraid of damaging my skin, but I shouldn&#x27;t have been.  I am Scandinavian, so my skin is sensitive and I&#x27;m very fair complexioned.  In spite of that, there has been no peeling or flaking of my skin after the peel.  This gel peel seems to be more of a very  aggressive exfoliant, at least at this strength, than a super serious peel.  As I said, I love this product and recommend it for anyone like me who has never had a peel before.  Your skin will look amazing, without too much discomfort and very little down time.  Highly recommended!u will see a difference the first time you use it.  Avoid the sun for a day, and use sunscreen pretty regularly because the peel does reveal that beautiful, fragile, new skin.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical of at home peels because I&#x27;ve only gotten them at a salon/medicenter. This peel was awesome. Helped with complexion and pores. My skin looks great. Be cautious in the sun though. :)</li>
    <li> Was really hoping this would be my miracle cure but it didn&#x27;t do anything. My skin is very oily and acne prone. Maybe someone can guide me through it. I used it as it says but my acne doesn&#x27;t improve at all.</li>
    <li> I have battled acne for 20 years now.  At 32 my skin isn&#x27;t as bad as in my teens but I am left with hyperpigmentation.  I have almost used this entire bottle and haven&#x27;t noticed much of an improvement.  Usually leave it on my face for 7 minutes and I do feel a slight burning sensation when washing it off.  After applying moisturizer my skin is super soft.  I like using this product and hoped it would have helped my skin issues.  I might try a stronger peel next time.</li>
    <li> Great product, atlhough if you aren&#x27;t careful and leave it on too long it can cause peeling.  However if you follow the directions carefully it is great for acne prone skin.  It has helped reduce my blackheads and breakouts in my T zone.</li>
    <li> In addition to using it as a peel I also used it like a toner and would apply before bed and would leave on.  I proved skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about once a week for the past couple of months.  I bought it to deal with a stubborn breakout on my upper chest that nothing would clear.  It didn&#x27;t work overnight, but after a few applications, the skin is much clearer.  I also use it on my face.  It definitely helps to clear pores, but there are still some blackheads that won&#x27;t go away.  It burns a lot for the first couple of minutes, but after that, I can easily tolerate it for ten or fifteen  minutes with no trouble and no ill effects.  My skin rarely peels afterward.  Occasionally I get slight peeling in the corners of my nose and mouth.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in lines or wrinkles, but for dealing with acne or clogged pores, it is effective and worth a try.  Don&#x27;t expect instant results, but with a little patience you will likely see signifi ant improvement.</li>
    <li> I have adult hormonal acne on the lower half of my face. This kind of helped, but no more than using the Equate version of proactive. This stuff is not worth the sting. I&#x27;m going to finish my bottle, but after that, I am trying a glycolic peel instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product 4 times and haven&#x27;t seen much results. I honestly don&#x27;t think enduring the burning is worth it for such minimal results. But then again I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times so maybe I need to be more patient.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. It burns, but it doesn&#x27;t peel you skin. I used the for the first time, I felt softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;Then, Second time, 6 days after/ 2 minutes maximum, next day I woke up with small burns in my face (gesture lines). i dont know how to clear them. sh!tttttttttttt. Product no recomended.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many months now and found that it works for preventing acne outbreaks.  I purchased it based on the many positive reviews it has received.  I have had problems with acne for decades.</li>
    <li> Be very careful!! My face is not sensitive, but this burned &amp; irritated me for 24 - 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it top quality, i&#x27;m very satisfied with it, i keep it in my stock, since i own a spa i use combined with facial cleansing to treat acne breakouts, i highly recommend it, when used for professional treatments this is the best you can get, read the instructions tough and use it carefully.</li>
    <li> Works great for a peel.  Face started to peel in about 2 days after application.  Can&#x27;t say that it completely erases hyperpigmentation, but hopefully longer use will lead to clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, works great as a peel</li>
    <li> After 3 years of dermatologist visits, my son&#x27;s acne was still problematic.  I refused to put him on Accutane.&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, I purchased this peel for myself, but after I saw how it gently improved my skin, I had my son try it.  I wish I had before and after photos, because his acne is gone! (He used it faithfully 2x/week for 3 weeks and dried his skin out.)  I am sold on this and will purchase it again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of months now. Use around one time per week. Despite good facial hygiene, I&#x27;m still breaking out. May be a slight decrease in the number of pimples but really hard to tell as my face has always gone through cycles.</li>
    <li> All I can say about this product is that I love love love it!!!!  My skin is in better shape than it has been in years.  This is a wonderful peel and I think it is better than most peels you get from a dermatologist!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product only twice and only on my nose to help with my large pores, it works very well and the stinging is minimal.  I will probably use it all over when Im a little braver.  I have used the glycolic acid peel before and it burned really bad.  I will keep everyone posted on the results but i&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
    <li> It really works. It&#x27;s was shipped to me fast.and I use it.this can help you clean acne.thank you,really appreciate it</li>
    <li> I had been thinking of doing a face peel for a long time so once it arrived I was both excited and cautious.  My first application was cautious since I do not have the ability to take time off from work if my face started a great amount of peeling.  At first it felt like the burning was strong so I left it on about 3 minutes and removed it.  In the following days I experienced only a small amount of flakes, no deep peeling.  I was relieved but wondered if any benefits were achieved.  I continued to do weekly applications and with the gained knowledge that nothing radical will happen and getting used to the sensation I was able to leave in on for longer periods of time, I am up to 10 minutes now.  I have noticed some of my darker “age/sun freckles” have surfaced and some others have lightened.  It also seems some of the pours have gotten smaller.  I will move up to the 30% on my next purchase.  But I do like what I see.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that different people have different sensitivity so my suggestion is to start slow and learn what your skin experiences.  Also another word of caution:  I made the mistake of not tightening the cap on the bottle one time and I feel that may have lessened its strength.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of skin care products and of all the at home peels, I like this one best so far. I may try other peel products from this brand as well. I have dry and oily skin as well as keratosis pilaris. This product cleared up acne quickly by drying it and several days later peeling off. I originally looked at the peel for my keratosis pilaris around my eye area and the majority is gone now. Wash your face before and be careful of your eyes and mouth. It may sting a little and make your face red before washing off. The first time I used the mask I didn&#x27;t moisturize enough and my skin was very dry and flaky the next day so I apply a lot of coconut oil and shea butter then wash off after it&#x27;s had time to absorb and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since. I&#x27;ve used the peel 4 or 5 times and my skin has much fewer break outs and my keratosis pilaris is better. I would recommend using this along with the skin regimen that works best for you.</li>
    <li> This works wonders for clearing up my skin. I usually just use it before I shower and exfoliate and then moisturize well after. It causes my skin to peel a little a few days later and my skin clears up within a night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried out other salicylic acid peels in the past but this one has been the most effective and easiest to use. The dropper allows for more controlled applications and the tea tree oil helps balance out the peel.</li>
    <li> Works good, glad I got it. My skin did not flake or peel afterwards either.  Will be using this from here on out.d not want to see or wait for any frost, that just doesn&#x27;t sound good. I reapplied on my worst areas because they were pretty bad. I rinsed with cold water and kept an eye on my face. I could see it getting better and better. I couldn&#x27;t believe every time I looked in the mirror how much nicer my face kept getting. My husband was even impressed. My whole face became one solid tone, my acne was disappearing. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work that fast or that good for the first time. I&#x27;m so glad this helped and I will definitely be using it from now on. I gave it 4 stars only because my skin has not fallen off yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how bad that is going to be yet. I still would prefer that over nasty acne and pimples staring at peoples faces,lol. I think this product is best for people who have bad skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once since receiving it but what a difference! I struggle with breakouts and oily skin. After one use my skin is less oily, supper smooth, and much clearer. It is very important to follow the instructions for pre-cleaning and post moisturizer use to decrease the burning sensation and protect the skin. I will definitely continue to use this product and others from this company!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product!.  Follow  the directions exactly and you will see quite a difference for the better in your skin immediately! This peel really did the job!</li>
    <li> I live in the Northwest and find that my skin acts up during the fall/winter.  My skin produces more oils during this time of year and ends up in breakouts.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a similiar situation.  There is a burning sensation with this product, so be careful and listen to your body (read the directions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CYSTIC ACNE- THIS HELPS!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product easy to use, follow the directions and the results are great. I will order this item again, may go with a higher % if available.</li>
    <li> I have a bad case of acne scarring and this really helps. It&#x27;s not as painful as most peels but just as potent.</li>
    <li> Ok i had this hideous sun spot in the middle of my forehead. It just popped up one day. Makeup wouldnt cover it. People would try to wipe it off as if i had something on my face and it was completely embarrassing. I used this for 3 nights straight until it started to peel. i had a small scab for a day or 2 but it took the sun spot completely off!!! Very Very happy.</li>
    <li> Burned a chunk of skin off that took forever to heal and ironically left scaring when the point of this product was to get rid of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this peel for about 3 months now and it&#x27;s definitely helped keep my skin clear.  I use it once a week and leave it on for about 3 and a half minutes.  I put it on with a fan brush, rinse with cold water, and follow with pure aloe vera.  I also only use it on the lower part of my face where I tend to break out - cheeks, chin, and around my jawline.  I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin with my new regimen.  I think it&#x27;s probably important to use it on a regular basis as it&#x27;s designed to help skin turnover so dirt and bacteria don&#x27;t get trapped.  I will definitely be purchasing another bottle soon!</li>
    <li> To me this stuff is better then lactic acid, but it burns skin a lot so can&#x27;t really hold it on for too long so be careful not to burn your skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this Salicylic Acid Peel for some time now and I find excellent results with patients with melasma and acne. This formula is somewhat stronger than that of the glycolyc acid so it has to be manage with care.&lt;br /&gt;I find the Perfect Image peeling products to be of an excellent quality with excellent results.</li>
    <li> This works great for me.  i used this on my son&#x27;s face when a new pimple is emerging and it dries up quicker. I also use it in my toes where i have a darken calluses, it works like wonder.</li>
    <li> The peel is working good on my mild acne. I&#x27;m using it twice a month and it&#x27;s not too aggressive but it does exfoliate better than any other peels I tried yet! Giving 4 stars, well, cause it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t clear my acne or anything like that, just a good peel.</li>
    <li> It works for my acne.</li>
    <li> I will often get break outs in multiples versus the one or two that can be easily handled.  When this happens, I apply this with a fan brush over the affected area and sometimes, as soon as the next day, I will begin to see a reduction in the appearance of acne.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...BUY THIS</li>
    <li> Ok, so facial skin is a sensitive tissue, I mean issue. I&#x27;ve tried this product twice so far. Each time it actually made my skin better. It&#x27;s like it is erasing bad layers.&lt;br /&gt;Which in essence what this solution does - it dissolves upper layers for you.&lt;br /&gt;I follow up with Argan oil and it feels like baby skin. Hold your puns.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of pointers: first time I tried it - I left it on for 3 min. Even though instructions and some reviews say to do less time. While it did some effect, I was left wanting more. I had to wait while my skin recovered of course and just recently tried again.&lt;br /&gt;This time I left the solution on my face for close to 8 minutes and kept adding more on my skin throughout. Then of course cold shower on my face was imperative.&lt;br /&gt;My point is that you will find your sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;I do get compliments on my skin now that it&#x27;s unobstructed.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for my acne and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a true cemical peel. I use it once a week and it has helped with my break out so much. It does burn and you must follow the directions. Make sure to wash it all off with cool water. My face did peel a bit around my mouth and nose. I left it on too long the second time I used it and peeled for several days. Make sure to only use as directed. My skin is fresh feeling and looks much brighter and overall healthy. Make sure to use a good moisturizer too, after you use this peel.</li>
    <li> I chose the 20% gel peel so it would not be too irritating on my skin. I have been battling acne for more than 10 years now and salicylic acid dries up the cystic acne pretty well. Spot-treating the large blemishes for a few days helps, and I really like the tea tree oil and the green tea extracts as an extra kick to reduce inflammation. Overall-great product, and fast delivery. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Fantastic peel for acne prone skin and dark spots/scars. I have sensitive skin and this does tingle but it does the job, your skin will dry up some in the next two following days, just use a good oil free moisturizer. I noticed a big difference in pore size and acne scars lightening after a few weeks use.</li>
    <li> This works wonders for clearing up my skin.  I usually just use it after I shower and exfoliate and then moisturize well after.  It causes my skin to peel a little a few days later and my skin clears up within a night.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly according to instruction. I researched several products and my results are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have seen some changes in my skin--but not as much as I would like.  I have only used this 5 times, so maybe with a little more time, the Gel Peel will earn 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It takes about seven days from the day you use the peel to the day the peeling is complete, so allow a week and a half if you&#x27;re using it before a special occasion. I usually apply it on a Wednesday or Thursday so that most of the peeling takes place over the weekend. Don&#x27;t apply right before walking out the door, as you&#x27;ll have an hour or two of redness. Over time, definitely calmed and evened out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Simply amazed on how this product helps clear my face up within a week.... I will definitely buy this product again...</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this peel. Worked great on my skin. Diminished my acne significantly. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now.</li>
    <li> I used like the instructions said for 30 seconds the first time. I waited 3 weeks before using again.  I just recently used for 2 min then another 2 min pass then a 1 min pass and made sure to cleanse face with cold water for a few minutes. I know it worked because i felt it burn each time. I put my regular face lotion on directly after and went to sleep. I woke up next day saw a tiny bit of peeling but used mild face wash and moisturizer as directions say and didn&#x27;t use make up for 24 hours. The day after I woke up my face wash starting to really peel around nose mouth and chin. Within a few hours.my skin blew up I mean zits and blackheads everywhere when before my skin was pretty much clear. It has stopped peeling so much but the breakouts are getting worse ares the days go on. I, have no, idea what is happening but it&#x27;s terrible.  I don&#x27;t want to leave my house. I&#x27;m scared to ever use aging idk if it&#x27;s a purge? Does that happen from this?</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me so far. So I am not buying it again. False promises.:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went through the entire bottle, and can report that it definitely works. It hasn&#x27;t cleared all of my acne, but I would estimate about 75%. It&#x27;s a good price, so I don&#x27;t really have any complains. I&#x27;d recommend trying it out.</li>
    <li> I had previously used expensive cosmetics to treat keratosis pilaris on my arms,they showed minimal or no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read an article about gel peels to remove the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several times since, then no harms(it stings a little but not that much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t say that I have clear results, but the skin seems smoother.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, but over time I was able to work up to good application times. I notice a significant difference in my acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd application and have noticed some small change on my skin. I still have blackheads and brown spots. I&#x27;ve read some reviews before purchasing this and many complained about the burning sensation. I can say I had very minor burning sensation. Nothing unbearable or even uncomfortable. Not sure if I&#x27;d purchase this again but, il decide when I finish the bottle and see if I notice my brown spots going away.</li>
    <li> Read many of the reviews and was looking for something that would minimize my pores.  I have oily skin - even though I&#x27;m well past the teen years - and it works exactly as I was hoping.  Will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I can see the benefits to my skin; about half way through bottle, use about once a week, very mild peel (but I&#x27;ve done a years worth of professional peels).</li>
    <li> This product definitely seems to help.  I bought it for my son and unfortunately he doesn&#x27;t use it consistently but he did for about the first week.  In that time, I noticed a definite difference in the cystic acne on his neck and back.  It was literally overnight that I could see skin peeling and after the second use the cysts underneath the skin had gone down considerably.  Definitely follow the enclosed instructions - because of the immediate results we saw, I could see where you could overdo it with this product if you go crazy with it.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my back acne tremendously!!! Please make sure you read the instructions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the tiniest dab on areas that are starting to break out.  It works wonders to quickly clear up the area quickly and help prevent the area from growing worse.  Just be careful you don&#x27;t put too much on otherwise it can cause some burning.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a short period of time. So far I don&#x27;t see any results in the appearance of my skin. I do know that you have to be very careful or mindful of time. It burns if kept on too long. Stick to directions closely.</li>
    <li> I use to spend alot of money getting Peels at the Spa but this product works great and makes my skin so smooth! I have never burnt myself either which is great because I was worried that I wouldnt know what I was doing and that I would. I would deff say it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this product helped tremendously with acne and pores, can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that was stronger than an OTC peel that would help with my acne. This is it! After my last pregnancy my skin looked like I was 15 again and while that may be a dream for others it was a nightmare for me. I was left with unsightly pimples all over my face and nothing was drying them up. I starred using this peel and after the 1st tx my pimples were smaller the next day and I had little to no oil even after a 10 hour shift. I continued to use the peel every week with better and better results. I now only have to use this peel once every few weeks and that is just to help control my oiliness. Will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> The words &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; in the same sentence is naturally a little concerning. However, this is a fantastic product at both preventing future and treating active breakouts. I have used a lot of products over the past decade, and this is without question the most effective product I have ever used. For many, I think this gel peel may give you relief that other products have not been able to provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for acne, ingrown hairs, and clogged pores, and currently use it as both a preventative full face skin peel, as well as a spot-treatment. I don&#x27;t have very severe acne, but whenever my face breaks out or I get an inflamed pore there was NOTHING sold at local drug stores that did the slightest thing to speed up the healing process whatsoever. I have tried all sorts of products with all sorts of active ingredients (including products with lower concentrations of salicylic acid), and none worked well enough that I could justify the cost for future purchases. I even tried a few ProActive products years ago as well (which has worked really well for a friend), and even that did not do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salicylic acid gel peel is the first product I have used that I can say without question is effective in treating my acne and speeding the process of healing. But not only does it speed healing, but it REALLY speeds the process up. I decided to try treating part of my face with this gel peel, and the other not treat: I was really happy to find that the area treated with this gel peel healed well over twice as fast as the part of my face without. This stuff makes acne go away in 2-3 days where as with any other treatment it was more like a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I started using this for a full facial peel to prevent future outbreaks. Believe it or not, I only need to use it every 2-3 weeks and that stops 90% of the issues I was having from ever even occurring to begin with! It even works well for things like ingrown hairs or pores that are really angry at me and get all nasty. Even better, my skin itself looks healthier. I do not know if it is just the stronger concentration of salicylic acid, or if it is a combination of the ingredients, but I do know that this gel peel works and it works FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can probably guess, this stuff DOES burn quite a bit compared to the products you find at a pharmacy. It&#x27;s not a pleasant feeling, but it is tolerable, you adjust to it, it&#x27;s a pretty short duration of being uncomfortable, and it results in a big benefit for many...spend a few minutes using this stuff, and you can enjoy the remaining 99.993729% of your day with much nicer skin. Acne, ingrown hairs, and clogged/inflamed pores are uncomfortable in and of themselves, and this product fixes that issue for me. Occasional usage of this and I have almost zero skin issues and don&#x27;t have to deal with acne 24-7 when I have a breakout. How many other products have I used that I can say the same about? None. So the tremendous benefit for the few minutes of discomfort to me is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff, and it has a ton of uses. As salicylic acid speeds &amp; stimulates the process in which skin replaces blemishes with healthy skin, this product is very versatile and capable of treating a wide range of issues. If you have skin blemishes that standard products are not treating as effectively as you would prefer, this gel peel is worth giving a try.

    <li> I have used this product once a week for the past three months. I have had problem skin for years, very oily and frequent break outs. I purchased this product for the scars the acne leaves since I heard it works great for this purpose. While it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated the scars, it does peel some skin off the scar, and has made them almost invisible. Not quite gone, but barely noticeable anymore.    For past six weeks or so I have also been using the treeactiv oil for a spot treatment for any new breakouts that I feel coming on, crazy how well it works to stop pimples from fully forming; [[ASIN:B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605; All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]].    I have been applying it every night and lately my skin has not only cleared up but also looks and feels much smoother than it has been for a while.    The combination of these products are working wonders for my skin, and for the low cost, it would be my first recommendation for anyone with skin problems.</li>
    <li> total trash!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and even though you might notice differences after a week or two, your face will be completely trashed after several times of using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this peel has worked for others, but here&#x27;s my experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smother the gel on my face, first on my cheeks since that&#x27;s my area of concern, then I wait about a minute, and rub a little on my forehead. I wait for 30 seconds or so, then I was it off with some cold water. It burns quite a bit and there is some visible frost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next two days my skin is noticably tighter and dry. After those two days, I will start to peel. The peeling is extremely noticable! My skin literally flakes off for a good two days. After that, my skin is AMAZING. Super smooth, clear, and glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really realistic for me to do this once a week, since for four days after the peel my skin looks like crap, but the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four starts instead of five due to the excessive peeling and dryness directly after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> This product really works.  It helps speed the healing of existing acne/blemishes (that are not open) and also helps to prevent acne/blemishes.  It is very strong, follow the directions which are very good, and when in doubt, leave the product on for less time rather than more time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for in home peel. It works!  My skin looks more smooth and it helps on discoloration as well. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This another great product from the Perfect Image company, we have used it for a long time now in our spa combined with facial cleansing and it really does a great job cleaning the pores and treating acne problems.</li>
    <li> Super peel! I use this once a month during my &amp;#34;visitor&amp;#34; and my skin looks great! I usually leave on for 7-10 minutes and follow with a heavy moisturizer.</li>
    <li> if your skin is rough, you&#x27;ve got to try this stuff!  it removes the layer of dead &amp; dying skin on your face.  be careful... 30 - 60 seconds is enough!</li>
    <li> I have had professional peels done before and this one definitely compares in results for 1/4 of the price. I have always had combo/oily acne prone skin that cleared up in my late teens early 20s but seems to be making a reappearance now at 24 bleh,&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t getting major breakouts or cystic acne instead it was more of a congested skin issue with lots of clogged pores which eventually resulted in some scarring because I cant help but pick at my face. My first use I left it on for less than a minute and within a day I was peeling slightly but not so much that I couldn&#x27;t wear make up ( just looked like my skin was dry) after 3 days my skin looked better than it has in a long time! it faded a lot of my scarring instantly and my pores are noticeably smaller, overall my complexion appeared more even and radiant. since then I&#x27;ve had some more breakouts in my trouble spots (mostly around the jaw line) but I know this is the salicylic acid bringing out all the gunk that has been trapped in my skin, the same thing happened when I had professional peels and is to be expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did one more treatment and left it on for around 4 minutes and I am definitely peeling a lot more now! excited to see the results as I keep using it...side note I use pure organic coconut oil on my skin in between to soothe and moisturize. I know it sounds strange to put oil on acne prone skin but its a natural anti-bacterial, anti inflammatory, and also brightens skin</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and all of the sudden I have been struggling with trying to get rid of this acne that has been just stuck all over my chin and jaw line. First I had went to a doctor and they suggested birth control and she prescribed me a topical antibiotic. That didn&#x27;t work. I have been looking for something to help with my acne and not have to spend $60 on facials. I have tried proactiv, demalogica, neturogena, scurbs, mudpacks, home remedies you name it I probably tried it. I came across this on amazon read everyones review and it works. My scars lightened up and my pimples dried up and now I am on my way to a clear face again. I have only used it once so far and I combine it with the pre cleaser wash which helps dramatically as well. I am so glad I have found this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne scars since teen years. Oily skin and breakouts here or there... I read the reviews on this chemical peel and decided why not try it... I used it a few times since receiving it in the mail and I absolutely love the results this far. I noticed my skin is bright.. My pores have shrunk tremendously and I love it. I can only imagine how great my skin will look in a month!! I also have very sensitive skin so instead of leaving it on for 1 minute I do 40 seconds. Awesome product will order again. Signed: One thrilled customer.</li>
    <li> I really like this peel. It has done wonders. I&#x27;ve been a repeat customer, and my skin looks like it did when I was a kid. I&#x27;ve gotten many, many, &amp;#34;oh, your skin looks really nice!&amp;#34; All I can do is smile....</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dark sun damage correction look somewhere else. almost done with the bottle and and no change at alllll!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a relatively light sun damage area on each cheek so I decided to use this product as it advertise:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Controls Acne Breakouts &amp; Evens Skin Tone appearance by reducing Discoloration caused by the sun or other UV light damage. Sheds off multiple layers of dead skin cells, resulting in a healthier looking appearance.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;been using it twice a week along with sunscreen protection, and I really tried to be realistic and give it time but it really didn&#x27;t improve any discoloration . the skin did very slightly peel a day or 2 after but no change.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all of the positive reviews and am now writing my first Amazon review (out of hundreds of purchases) because of how much I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always struggled with acne and finally did a 30 day round of antibiotics about 6 months ago to stop breakouts. I bought this because although the breakouts had slowed down, I still had horrible acne scars and a giant scar on my forehead from an accident. I&#x27;m getting married in two months and was looking for anything to help reduce the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product FAR exceeded my expectations as I literally have completely clear skin (including scars!) after three months of consistent use. It does take time and dedication to a strict regimen but this product really does work! I used 2x/week and used rubbing alcohol to clear my skin first. I started with 30 seconds and increased by 15 seconds with each application up to 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Both times that I tried 4 minutes, my skin peeled and was irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to anyone looking for help with adult acne scars! Stick with it and I&#x27;m sure you will see drastic improvement!</li>
    <li> This is not 20%, it is not effective at all. The product also leaves slimy film on my skin which is hard to wash off. I get much better results with 10% peel (not gel) which I have been buying from a different seller. It has fewer ingredients and doesn&#x27;t cost as much. Tea tree oil and especially green tea caught my eyes here, I though I would try something better. I think all the extras are messing things up here. I see a tremendous difference between the two. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I use less potent 10% peel, it&#x27;s always working great, and sometimes I do need to be careful, it&#x27;s actually more potent. This one (&amp;#34;20%&amp;#34;) does nothing positive for me - yes there was some reaction, a mild tingling, pinkish skin probably mostly due an alcohol content. I am not liking the result, my pores got larger, skin turned super oily and just bleh... it&#x27;s supposed to do the opposite. Returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had blackheads on my nose and nothing has ever been able to get rid of them.  The Salicylic Acid Gel Peel is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that works.  It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes a few minutes a couple of times a week.  It does burn a bit, but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.  The only negative is it does seem to dry out the skin on and around my nose more than normal, but that&#x27;s nothing a little lotion can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> This works very well if you have one of those bigass pimples.  Apply it overnight and the next day it will dry and shrink.  Don&#x27;t use this everyday though because it will make your facial skin really sensitive from ultra violet rays.  I suggest, base on my experience to only use it maybe 3x&#x27;s a week for mild acnes.  If you have a severe acne, maybe u can use it everyday, but warn you though it will sting, so if you don&#x27;t have a good burning pain tolerance, stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Conclusion, this product gets the job done and i am happy i bought it and gave it a try.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for about a year, once every 7 days, my acne is almost gone. I have suffered from acne for 7 years and finally have clear skin. My skin is almost clear and my acne scars have reduced tremendously. I would recommend the product to anyone suffering from chronic acne.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a spot treatment for my cystic acne. It helps to clear the cyst fairly quickly, within 3 days. I have recommended to many of my friends who also love the product!</li>
    <li> I have used the salicylic peel about 5 times now, once per week. My skin definitely feels smoother. It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my acne but In a little over a month there is a noticeable improvement. I have received multiple compliments on my skin as well! It helps my make up go on more evenly... Still getting some hormonal breakouts but this is improved and they seem to heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it may be too early to tell but I&#x27;m pleased so far :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update two months of use: Definitely breaking out my skin. I spoke with an esthetician and she said you should not use this product more than once a month or every two weeks tops...my skin had become really irritated and I broke out terribly...finally starting to improve. I&#x27;m going to keep using it but try once a month and see if this is less harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> The only product that worked....Amazing?</li>
    <li> I would strongly recommend this product if you&#x27;re struggling with acne and the dark spots/ scars it leaves behind. Ive only used it once and already acne I already had is smoothing out nicely and dark spots are greatly reduced. Very good product that you can use at home without the expensive esthetician. Wash you&#x27;re face 1st, I used Cetaphil gentle cleansing bar. Then wipe your face with a cotton ball and 91% alcohol. Then use the peel with a cotton ball rinse with cold water and repeat up to five Xs but no more than. Then use a good moisturizer. You will not be able to get out the mirror for real!</li>
    <li> I have tried to clear, shrink, and stop the blackheads on my nose. Please note; I have read on the internet that basically nothing works- now that doesn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing Obagi, Peter Roth, Clinique, and countless other expensive products. I do not have the funds to get salon peels, microdermabrasion, or facials either. I have heard that getting regular SALICYLIC chemical peels would reduce the amount of blackheads and pores. I read all of the product reviews for the \\&quot;at home\\&quot; peels. This was not the most expensive peel, but it did get high ratings. The peel was packed very minimally; no fancy box (as shown in the picture)- but the bottle was sealed with shrink wrap and had DIRECTIONS...read those! They were extremely helpful for first-timers like myself. I cleaned my face as directed and only kept it on for only ONE minute (it stated that first time users should only keep it on for 30 seconds). I knew it was going to tingle (the directions had stated that) and I washed it off with cold water (as directed). OMG! The same day it appeared as if all of my blackheads on my nose were gone. I&#x27;m three days after (as I&#x27;m writing this) and still, this morning, while using a toner- the blackheads are minimal and the pores are smaller. I will wait another 10 days and use the peel again. I think with regular use; I may have found a way to NO MORE BLACKHEADS on my nose. Its a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Follow directions and no issues will happen. Slowly introduce this peel to your skin and you will be happy with the results.  I have noticed a huge difference in complexion; pores are smaller and much less breakouts. I had some drying and peeling around my nose after the first application,  but it wasn&#x27;t bad, a little lotion and it wasn&#x27;t peeking after a day.</li>
    <li> All it&#x27;s done is make pores more visible and face very very oily.  For the cheek area, it is smoother</li>
    <li> I use this about every 2 weeks on average and it definitely helps keep my skin clear. I&#x27;m 30 years old and have had acne for the past 20 years, which I recently found out was due to PCOS. This is one of the only things that I found effective in temporarily clearing my acne before my diagnosis. Depending on how long I leave it on it can dry my skin out and cause it to peel for up to a week. It also is the only thing that helps clear cystic acne faster. Last time I ran out I didn&#x27;t buy more right away because I hadn&#x27;t been using it very often, but I started to notice a difference and other acne products are just like placebos to my skin. I just apply and apply them and the acne clears in its own time regardless. With this I can tell the healing is sped up significantly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful so be careful. But, it works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, but still prone to breakouts, and this is awesome!! I have used it for over two years now and been very pleased. I previously tried a couple other brands of salicylic peels and they worked okay, but not as well as this one has... I think it is the tea tree and maybe the green tea extract that makes the difference. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I suffer from rosacea and wintertime seborrheic dermatitis,  but you would never guess it by looking at my skin since I started using this peel.  It has immediate anti - inflammatory effects,  with noticeable decrease in redness, and consistent less redness over time.  Bumps are decreased and plugs of sebum pop out after use. I use it once or twice a week and gradually increased the time left on my face without any negative effect.  I will use this forever (I&#x27;m 61 now) and am so happy I found it. I use this in conjuction with Murad products, which are quite helpful but work better for me in conjunction with this peel.  Even if you have sensitive skin you should give this a try.</li>
    <li> After using 3 - 4 times, the skin actually get worse. I have a very sensitive (oily) skin with mild acne. I used the product the way it described. It was leaving the mark of acne on the face. I am not recommending this product to anyone. I regret after buying this product. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective product. I was suffering from over sized pores, dull skin and blackheads that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of. I gave my skin a break from all cream and retinoids for 2 days prior to using the peel to avoid sensitivity or a reaction. I washed my face and dried it thoroughly then placed about a pea size amount onto a cotton ball. I swiped it gently starting with my cheeks then forehead, nose and chin then made a 2nd pass on my upper cheek problem area again. I only waited 45 seconds from the first swipe and there was mild burning but nothing terrible. I rinsed it off with lots of water. My skin looked immediacy fresher, some very mild peeling in my chin the following day and about a 30% reduction in blocked pores of any kind. I will use this every week and update this review  but so far it&#x27;s done exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My &#x27;problem&#x27; areas were the the first to actually peel. My skin has been feeling much softer since I started using this and I&#x27;ve not had any new breakouts. Has really helped clear up some of my old acne scarring, and also sped up the healing time of my acne. My blackheads have also been reduced after only three weeks of using the product. I look forward to seeing more results from this stuff. So far, I am LOVING it. I also allowed my mom to try it out and she was really impressed, she had actually just broken out and it was the first experience she had where her cystic acne cleared up on its own within just a few days. Definitely test a patch of your skin first and don&#x27;t go over the suggested time on your first or second use. BE WISE ABOUT THIS, ITS ACID! It does burn, and the cool water rinse after helps a lot. DO NOT use a washcloth, at least with my experience... it made it hurt haha. Stick with your hands and ice cold water, its refreshing after the burn.</li>
    <li> Wish my skin can take the strong ways of the peel but it cant not good for sensitive skin check out my youtube channel tosee ehat other products ive tried ryecarterlove</li>
    <li> I was a little scared to try this product but I did, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 36, still break out, and have some acne scarring on my chin so really wanted to find a great product to help with these issues. I did a lot of research and decided to try this product since it has such great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried it twice so far but it has changed my skin for the better.  It looks younger, firmer, my pores are smaller, I see some of my scars fading, and there has been a huge reduction in breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on Accutane, tons of antibiotics, I have used every product out there and nothing, and I mean nothing, stops my breakouts anymore.  I use Retin A too which doesn&#x27;t even work like it used to, so I haven&#x27;t used it in weeks.  Of course living for years with acne, I&#x27;m waiting for it to come back any day now so we&#x27;ll see . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you read all of the product directions and follow them.  I left it on my face 2 minutes the first time and 3 minutes the second time and I was fine.  You can do more than one wipe of your face during each session but be careful with that as my skin wasn&#x27;t quite ready for that and it burned like hell and peeled a great deal after I did an extra wipe the last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, love this product!  I&#x27;m going to purchase some of their other products today!</li>
    <li> For me this peel is a life saver. I have tried many things and spent lots of money. If you have an adult acne this is the best way to treat it. Read the instructions and use it carefully, you will be satisfied...100%. Dont freak out day or 2 after, it&#x27;s going go better. Add on time by the time you used it. It will take time to clear out completly( good diet helps) but it will.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after coming back from a facial and seeing the results of a light peel on my acne-prone skin.  The product does sting but it&#x27;s bearable and really helps with build-up.  I put it on small areas of my face at first to get used to it, and that worked well. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Made my skin really dry.</li>
    <li> For the purpose of giving your face a new look, it is great. It does burn, can&#x27;t get around that. But it does what it says, and I would recommend having lotion nearby after using it to apply and cool down your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for years and this is the only thing that thoroughly cleaned out all of my pores, smoothed out the texture of my skin, and healed my acne scars. I am very impressed with this product and it does wonders. I also have their Lactic Acid 50% which was my first purchase. Shipping was prompt and the item was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I keep using it and it didn&#x27;t work I still have the spots on my face :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in the last two years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I only leave it for five minutes once a week and my skin looks very smooth - I recognize it when I do make up!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I guess this is a nice product for those that can tolerate high concentrate of beta hydroxy acid like salicylic acid. Just remind you it would be very irritating for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have (moderate) acne-prone oily skin. And most acne-prone skin is also sensitive. I did a batch test twice and nothing bad happened. When I started putting the acid gel on, my face burned immediately so I removed the product within 30 second. Part of my chins got red, hurt, peeled and turned into scabs. I gave second try a week later but my skin cannot stand this peel. So I got back to my 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide Treatment + 2% Salicylic Acid Treatment which are effective but much more gentle.</li>
    <li> Ok so i&#x27;m new to peels and this was my first one, my main goal with it was to get rid of my hyperpigmentation, it helped to fade them slightly but not enough to satisfy me, it&#x27;s not to strong either.The first time iused it i was able to keep it on for 4  minutes without any irritation,and this was with alcohol prep to strip my skin of any oils.The best benifit of it is that i havent had ANY major breakouts in 4 weeks! Iwhich is a big deal because i have extremely oily skin. but if your going to buy this i would also suggest the salactylic deep cleansing wash also.</li>
    <li> I am a man in my 20&#x27;s and suffer from acne breakouts once on a while.  I use this peel to control my acne, smoothen my skin, and even my skin tone. For those trying Salicylic acid peel for the first time, here are a few pointers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Start gradually, use sparingly, and do not exceed the time specified. If you are not gentle, you WILL irritate your skin and cause the breakouts to worsen. Don&#x27;t use on sensitive under eye skin!&lt;br /&gt;2. For the first few treatments, just wash your face with mild facial soap that removes oil, apply the peel, and time carefully. Rinse thoroughly afterward. Don&#x27;t peel again for at least another week.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you have really oily skin, then use rubbing alcohol to remove oil from skin but do so very gently and quickly. Don&#x27;t drench your face with alcohol and only use on the oiliest spots. Quickly rinse your face with water, let dry and start the peel.&lt;br /&gt;3. Because the peel basically burns the top-most layer of skin; it will look dry and patchy for the next few days as it dries and sloughs off. DON&#x27;T use any facial scrubs. Too much exfoliating WILL irritate and cause problems. Use either the peel or a scrub but not both.&lt;br /&gt;4. Be patient, you WILL see your skin look smoother, and more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The tips are only meant for people with similar skin conditions to mine. I don&#x27;t know how it will effect your skin if it&#x27;s very sensitive, or you suffer from severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I don&#x27;t know how this product is stabilized, but i am pretty sure it&#x27;s light sensitive so store in a dark place.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 2x a week for over a two months now and my skin has never looked better, less break outs, smaller pores. My skin glows, I&#x27;ve never been happier with the results. I use a fan brush to apply the product to my face. I l eave it on for 4 mins and wash off with warm water. That&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> I have acne prone combination skin. The first time I used this peel, I thought it was fantastic and I was so glad I found it. It seemed to stop the acne breakouts for a bit and got rid of my flaky dry patches. However, as I continued to use it, my skin stopped reacting as well to it and it seemed to start just triggering irritation. Now I&#x27;m afraid to use it again. I followed the instructions, but maybe my skin is just too sensitive. Maybe I didn&#x27;t realize how sensitive it was. I will probably give it some more time and then maybe start using this just 2-3 times a year or so. Be careful not to overdo it!</li>
    <li> I like this peel a lot it leaves my skin so silky smooth i would however like it less strong it is a bit on the strong side and i am afraid if i am not careful with it i will burn myself this is something i fear with all peels but this the most, it does work great a tiny bit for a person with sensitive skin goes a long long way, i would suggest testing it on a part of your face not so visible to see if you have a reaction because of how strong it is only 20 seconds is the best start time to 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product 100% free to review this also means no shipping payments). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
    <li> This chemical peel is amazing. Please do not leave on for more than a minute. I did peel a lot because my skin was terrible. But I can almost see a beautiful face again after only a month.</li>
    <li> This product works on removing the outermost layer of facial skin, however there is s learning curve on what amount of time is best when left on the skin. If left too long, dryness and peeling occurs, but if left on just right amount of time( for me it&#x27;s 5 min), a healthy glow and skin tightening occurs</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding! This has been a godsend for my skin. I highly recommend this product to help with breakouts and overall complexion. Make sure to follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a month now (once a week), and while I can&#x27;t say it has totally revolutionized my skin, I have seen improvements in its overall appearance. I have also received compliments from friends and family members who have commented on how nice my skin looks (and have now orders the product for themselves). I will definitely continue to purchase products from Perfect Image and continuing using as part of my facial routine. I have had professional peels in the past, so wasn&#x27;t overly worried about sensation and what to expect. In fact, I find this peel somewhat mild and wouldn&#x27;t mind to try one of the stronger peels. I even do spot treatments on blemishes .. works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great peel, apply Friday ready for work Monday mild enough so u don&#x27;t look crazy but strong enough to produce some peeling</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough great things about this peel.  It is gentle while being super effective.  I started using it for 2 minutes as I have done glycolic peels in the past and now I am up to 4 minutes.  I do this every 4 to 5 weeks and my skin is baby butt smooth and my laugh lines are almost completely gone.  Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> this product works wonders. I was very cautious when buying this product because I thought it would be too strong for my face but it was perfect! it cleared my pimples and I didn&#x27;t had any bad reactions. I have clean clear skin now and I am proud to be in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product caused dark spots on the right side of my face and did a great result on the left side.But to be honest ,I think I used it incorrectly while I was putting it on the right side,but I like what I see right now and I noticed that the dark spots starting to fade away with time.Definitely I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Be patient.  If you follow the directions, you will be very favorably impressed with the appearance of your skin.  It saves spending big bucks at the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 20s and recently went off B.C. -- I was then left with &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34;.  After trying TONS (literally) of things I found this gel peel to be incredibly helpful at getting my acne under control!  My face is mostly clear today but I still use the gel peel about once a month or so to help reduce the size of my pores and keep my skin looking young :)  So much better than paying tons of money to the derm!</li>
    <li> Excellent product----in two weeks I see a visible improvement on blackheads----caution, this is not a casual OTC product---serious medicine---read, read, read the instructions and you will be well informed---fail to do that and be prepared for peeling skin and a strong burning sensation</li>
    <li> Easy to use with the applicator, does the job. It is good product for people with acne.I would reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what it did for me. My pore size are still the same and my skin is worse than ever.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of peels and this is one of the best, and MUCH more affordable than other methods. This has helped clear up my existing acne by drying it out and the best part is that it helps fade the dark spots left behind by pimples - I haven&#x27;t found a better product for this and you see results immediately. You can add layers for a stronger peel if needed, which is great.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience using a peel.  I have oily skin and am constantly trying to reduce the size of my pores.  Those with dry skin, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend this product.  Since it&#x27;s winter time, I have a few dry patches and I find that those get very irritated and start to frost quickly.  To combat this, I place a small amount of petroleum jelly on those areas prior so that they don&#x27;t get the peel on them at all.  This product is (very slowly) reducing the size of my pores on my nose and to either side of it, but I find that I must use it very consistently-- the results will disappear without repeated use.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for other areas of my face.  As my skin is oily, I think I will go with a stronger peel after this bottle is finished; I see that this brand makes a 50% peel so I think I&#x27;ll try it next time.  This was a good product for a beginner such as myself because I felt nervous and didn&#x27;t want to burn half my face off.</li>
    <li> Love that this is a gel. It stays on better than another liquid peel I tried. Both my teenage daughter and I have trouble with acne, mine just never stopped unfortunately. This peel is so much cheaper than paying what they charge at a salon or spa. The bottle is good for many peels. Both she and I have used it for full facial peel and for spot treatments. You just have to give it time to work. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Customer Service was very informative when I inquired about multiple things. I had used this product for a month now, and is very effective. Just about 2 days ago, I had this huge piece of dead skin peeling off my chin (it was not pretty haha) which is proof that the peel had done its job. I had a moderate case of acne on my face. I strongly recommend you follow the instructions for the most effective treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my way of applying the peel -&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a lotion, sunscreen, and a cleanser. I bought the following products in a Rite-Aid (much more expensive than Amazon, fyi)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Deep Cleanser (Cleanser) - http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Clean-Facial-Cleanser-Normal/dp/B000052ZB4&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion (Moisturizer and Sunscreen) - http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Ultra-Gentle-Soothing-Lotion/dp/B0054MSBZA&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: Your face moisturizer should be non-comedogenic and oil-free. It doesn&#x27;t say in the product description above, but since I bought it at Rite-Aid I could read the packaging and can confirm that it is both non-comedogenic and oil-free.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I recommend doing this right before a shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash your face with a non-AHA/BHA cleanser twice as your first step, and wash off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &#x27;Clean&#x27; your face with Isopropyl alcohol on a cotton ball. Be VERY careful as to how much you put on the cotton ball. Do NOT by any means simple douse it in alcohol and practically smother it all over your face. It WILL burn your eyes, and it WILL cause you to cough violently from the fumes if you don&#x27;t do it carefully (I had learned this myself...firsthand, unfortunately). I do this myself in front of a fan to prevent myself from inhaling too much of the fumes. I clean my face twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Get ready for a shower. You&#x27;ll need to wash off the chemical peel from your face. I have no idea how some people don&#x27;t have problems washing the peel off their face. Maybe theyput their face in the sink and try to wash it off that way, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It got my clothes wet and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough. So...I went half-naked and took off my shirt after the alcohol step. It&#x27;s much easier to get in the shower after a peel and wash it off that way (with cool water). Don&#x27;t forget to take off your pants/shorts and underwear right before you get in, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. As for the actual application of the peel, putting too much in one spot on a cotton ball is not recommended, as you&#x27;ll waste it all on one spot. you should spread it out as much as you can so that it can be used on your entire face. I do it from top-to-down (as the instructions suggest), but by the time I reach my chin there&#x27;s little to no more of the chemical peel left on the cotton ball, so I have to put another few drops and quickly apply it to my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I left the peel on for about 25 seconds the first time. The second time maybe 40 seconds. The third maybe 45 seconds. And the fourth 60 seconds. After the burning sensation starts, I immediately start up the water and get ready for the shower. I don&#x27;t wait for any &#x27;frosting&#x27; to occur since I&#x27;m a &#x27;better safe than sorry&#x27; person. I also apply it twice on my nose, cheeks, chin and t-area for another 30-60 seconds. They&#x27;re my problematic/oily areas as I have combination skin that need to be done twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Soak your face in cool water for maybe a minute or two while standing in the shower to thoroughly remove the peel. Afterwards, you can shower normally if you want (I mean, why not?). Do NOT rub/wash your face with a cloth. Your skin will be very sensitive. You should instead just pat your face or eyes dry when needed, no rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. After you finish your shower, you&#x27;re done! If you&#x27;re like me and you used to use a cloth to wash your face, you have to stop and use the cleanser instead. I use it twice in the morning, and twice at night before bed for 6 days after the peel. Be sure to moisturize your face after the cleanser because it will be very dry and the skin won&#x27;t be able to heal effectively if it&#x27;s not moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. You may or may not have noticeable peeling depending o if you followed the steps I stated above correctly, and how much/long you applied it on for. If you do have noticeable peeling, I strongly recommend you not to pick the flakes/dead skin off, no matter how big they are. They are still attached to your skin, and it will come off in time when new skin has fully developed under the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Do NOT pick, rub, or irritate your face with your fingers/hand. Your hands are very dirty and it will clog your pores. I had done this mistake on my third peel, and I can say that my acne had started coming out again. Whatever urge you may have, even a small scratch on your nose, resist it. It will help you in the long run. This is a habit that you should get used to, as it is probably one of the most effective things at the growth/spread of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Exactly a week after the initial peel, repeat steps 1-6. When applying the peel again, let the sensation of pain be your guidance as to when you should start washing it off. As I said, I recommend starting up the water and shower immediately after the intolerable burning starts. Better safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;I can say that my face&#x27;s complexion had improved, and that redness had indeed reduced drastically back to a &#x27;normal&#x27; color. Acne isn&#x27;t as fierce as it was initially (as long as I keep my hands off my face) My t-area (above the nose, between my eyes) had drastically improved. But don&#x27;t expect a chemical peel to be your miracle worker. Chemical peels will probably lessen your less-desirable features such as acne by maybe 50-90%. There can be a chance of it peeling off your entire face and giving you shiny new baby cheeks, but I highly doubt such things, even for a deep chemical peel haha. (And for the record, I think this specific peelwould be classified as a medium chemical peel, not a deep one)</li>
    <li> Very high quality peel. The 20% is very mild for someone who regularly uses salicylic acid wash, but still gives a significant improvement in skin tone and texture. Has helped with breakouts alot! Perfect Image is probably the best quality peel line you can find; equivalent to $100 peels at the Derm.</li>
    <li> I have not used it on my face but tried once on my daughter&#x27;s face.  Her face peeled for a couple of days after the peel and after that her face seemed to look smoother.</li>
    <li> Before i used this, i had lots of blackheads and whiteheads due to wearing foundation and not properly cleansing my skin. Aside from not using foundation anymore, i used this product once a week then twice a week for about 3-5minutes before washing off with cold water. I don&#x27;t experience peeling after. Now my skin looks better. Less red spots and i don&#x27;t usually get comedones anymore. But i just noticed that whenever i stop using this, comedones start again. I guess i just have to use this forever.</li>
    <li> i used the peel once, then made a review, a 3-star review explaining how it did not help me! BUT...i repeated the application 1-2 times a week, and it almost completely has cleared up my acne! I have noticed that i used to have oily skin, but now i never have oily skin, have touse moisturizer sometimes, but i dont care! My skin hasnt looked this good since i was a child! By the way, i  had moderate acne on my chin, that started turning cystic, and this STOPPED it! I am nineteen, and female, and i love this! It DOES hurt though!</li>
    <li> I had a bad sun burn on my tights, my skin look so horrible and dark on just that area. I used his product to help get my skin back to normal. I used it a few time and my embarrassing uneven skin problem was gone.</li>
    <li> This gel peel is a strong substance: it makes big difference and brings long lasting positive results. This gel suppose a careful approach; so, it is necessary to read instruction carefully and attentively. Skin becomes healthy and clean, smooth and bright!</li>
    <li> This product really gets the job done. The peel I received was great and made my skin look healthier and brighter. A great product!</li>
    <li> Started working the first day.only use a little quantity cause it will dry you like crazy before it starts pealing off</li>
    <li> If you have ethnic skin, please seek a dermatologist or Estheticians advice.  This could damage your pigment.  I am fair complexion and it works really good.  Smooth it on sparingly at first to get used to it.  Your skin may feel like its on fire.  Too much, too often and you will start to peel.  Normally this is a sign that its has worked in removing your dead skin but you dont want to peel too much.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this peel b/c of the gel base.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out like the more liquid versions do.  Strong as a face peel, but I wish there would be a 30% formulation that would be more effective on my back.  Helped my body acne clear up significantly (using it once weekly), but switching to 30% from another brand was even more effective.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with acne for about 6 years. I finally have gotten a handle on it, but I have blackheads and large pores everywhere! I wanted to go get a peel done by a professional, but I just don&#x27;t have the time. I purchased this about a month ago and have been using it about every 3 days. The direction recommend to use the peel once a week, but I use it about every 2-3 days for 8-10 minutes and slather moisturizer on afterwards. WOW. What a difference. My skin looks younger, brighter, smoother, and clearer! I now wear less than 1/2 of the amount of makeup I used to. If I feel a breakout coming, I just apply the gel peel and when I wake up in the morning I don&#x27;t have to worry about a pimple. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product works as described. Got a little peeling but my skin after was soft and smooth. Most of my darker marks faded quite a bit. It isnt 100% clear but close to 95% so I am very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but for ME, I have to do 2 layers to see results.  Even when it starts that familiar burn, I still don&#x27;t get the same results as my husband does when he uses it.  Guess our skin types are just that different, but there are still results regardless (mine just aren&#x27;t as pronounced as his).</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I have struggled with acne since I was about 12 years old. Using this product regularly has made an ENORMOUS difference in my skin. It&#x27;s soft, radiant, and almost always clear. It does tingle and sometimes still a little bit while it&#x27;s on, but it is most definitely worth it!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Stuff burns like a mother. Can&#x27;t leave it on for more than 30 secs. Works really well though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a thirtish, have sensitive combination skin with blackhead on nose and oily forehead. I tried glycolic acid (20%) peeling but my skin appeared red and raised. However, after trying this 20% salicylic acid on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t turn red nor raised. The blackheads come off after few days of use and the skin peeled a bit (on chin area) during first 2-3 times of use, and my skin looks clear after the blackhead and dead skin came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 2 months. I use it on my forehead and nose for 5 min, cheek and chin for 3 min (becos these areas are more sensitive to me), with a cosmetic gauze. During peeling, my skin is feeling a bit sting at the first few times but it is gone now when I use. I do it once a week and now I don&#x27;t have to put heavy makeup to hide my blackhead. So happy!!</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described.  If you have not had a professional facial peel or are unfamiliar with what the actual benefits and capabilities of a salicylic peel are then you should not consider your opinion or review informed or valid.  I&#x27;ve had the procedure done professionally and the results with this brand are the same.  As simple as it may sound the way the product is packaged with the squeeze top bottle allows you to control the exact quantity of peel you&#x27;re applying allowing for consistency every time and the most cost-effective usage of the product.  I received the order quickly and without issue.  Positive experience overall.  Am considering purchasing other peels in their product line.</li>
    <li> I like this peel for my mature but oily skin. It stings a little at first but i have a small fan blowing on my face. I have worked my way up to 10 minutes . Afterwards my skin is smooth and less oily also my pores look smaller. i would recommend this product. But start out slowly. and not if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once so far because it is summer time and I have had much exposure to the sun. But the one time so far that I have used it I have noticed that my acne subsided and usually I will have a breakout during that time of the month but I did not have that a week after I used the peel. I think that If I keep using it I will see significant results.</li>
    <li> I suffer with adult acne and currently use  la roche on a daily basis which really helps. I thought I&#x27;d try this for a little booster and so far so good. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and I seem to get pretty good results. I hasn&#x27;t taken all the acne away but I&#x27;ve found it makes it just a little better, which for me, make it worth it!</li>
    <li> WOW. The first time I used it, I had it on for 1 minute. The burn/tingling sensation was very mild probably because I have very strong and treated skin. Instantly after I washed it off, the cysts on my face were less infected and swollen!!! The next day, the cysts were smaller and healed faster. The redness faded away within an hour and I didn&#x27;t even peel the first time. I get really bad cystic acne by my jawline and NOTHING has given me instant results like this!!! I put it on my acne scars and my skin looked noticeably better. Obviously, it wasn&#x27;t all gone after one use but it was still pretty incredible!! I wish I could use it more often!! I really recommend this to people that have cystic acne, acne scars, or the terrible pigmentation that bad acne leaves behind. Be patient, and the results will be rewarding! It&#x27;s super easy to use too!</li>
    <li> You have to continue using it over and over, but at the end you will see some results, the pores in my nose are 50% smaller after 4-5 times of use.</li>
    <li> Sadly this did nothing for me except cause extreme pain and made my face break out even more without any sign of it fading. My face peeled really bad after using it a third time (2 weeks apart) so I&#x27;m giving up on it.</li>
    <li> This is terrific!  It is the only thing I have found to get rid of my teen&#x27;s blackheads!</li>
    <li> Great chemical exfoliation and does a number on breakouts. I use this twice a week and it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking radiant. It does exfoliate well but the skin feels soothed after, too.</li>
    <li> I have been trying all kinds of stuff to try and get rid of these pores on my nose. Big pores, blackheads, distractions, please don&#x27;t look at me close up, whatever you want to call them. Everything I use makes them looks &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; immediately afterwards, but then in another day or so they are filled back up with crud! My diet is good, so maybe it is just my genes? Go me! Anyways, this product was my latest attempt at fighting them. I guess my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive as others. Every three days I leave it on my nose for a minute, that is usually when it is about to turn frosty. I know the box says wait a week or two? Yea I just don&#x27;t see that working for me. I have been using this for a little over a month. It definitely burns, and shrinks my pores for a brief amount of time. Sometimes I feel like it is just trapping in the gook I couldn&#x27;t get out. After a while my nose will flake for a bit, but everything still looks the same. So, I am still looking for that miracle cure for large blackhead pores that constantly fill up with gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I freaking hate my nose. If anyone is a skin scientist or something, any suggestions would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> Works much better for me than costly laser treatments I&#x27;ve by dermatologists. I use it every 7-10 days. Noticeable improvement after 1st. use. After several months THIS: Fading of sun spots. Smaller pore size, especially on nose. Skin is MUCH smoother. Even deep wrinkles improved. Many fewer blackheads. Many fewer breakouts. Overall skin color more even, brighter. Really makes my skin glow. I apply it with a wide, flat foundation brush. Quick, easy, cheap! Burned a bit the first couple of times, but cool water fixed that. ADVICE: Sensitivity will vary user-to-user; proceed with caution. Don&#x27;t over-scrub before using. If you can, stand in front of a table fan while gel is on - much more comfy that way! Pin hair off face. Do treatment wearing nothing but a bath towel, because you will get water everywhere whilst rinsing. Have cool water running so you can rinse immediately as needed. After rinsing pat dry gently. I slap on a ton of coconut oil after rinsing, then blot off extra oil with a tissue.  I can feel dead skin rolling off as I rinse. Yay! SO much better for me than costly Rxs such as Finacea and Retin-A. Just be careful while you are learning, but do consider giving it a try. I can&#x27;t believe how great this for me!</li>
    <li> I am a 55-year old male who has dealt with skin problems since adolescence,most notably acne and folliculitis (in-grown hairs as a result of shaving more commonly known as &amp;#34;razor bump&amp;#34;). Over the years I&#x27;ve found products and adopted methods to keep both of these conditions under control, all of which have helped to abate outbreaks but none that has kept them completely at bay. I had heard about gel peels, in particular with salicylic acid, as a treatment for both acne and in-grown hairs and decided to have a professional treatment done. I was told after the initial treatment that I&#x27;d need several more to gain the greatest benefit, but at more than $100 per treatment the cost was prohibitive. It was then that I decided to investigate products that could be used at home and ran across the Perfect Image Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel.  I was somewhat concerned that this treatment would not be as effective as the one I had professionally done.  And though I had some idea as to how to use the peel, I was REALLY concerned that in doing it myself I might do more harm than good. After having used the Perfect Image Peel I can say that my concerns on both counts were unfounded.  Not only was this peel as effect, if not more so, than the one I had professionally done but it was also easy to use.  While I give this gel my strong recommendation I also recommend to read the directions carefully and to go slowly with its use. The first time I applied the gel I had to remove it within a minute or so as the stinging sensation was quite intense.  But with subsequent applications I&#x27;ve been able to work my way up to keeping it on for a full ten minutes without a problem or incident.  For me applications every ten days seem to work best.  The results after nearly a dozen applications have been amazing.  Not only have my breakouts of both acne and in-grown hairs ceased but with each application the condition of my skin has improved with some reversal of past acne scarring having taken place.  Go slow...but by all means give this gel a try.</li>
    <li> My skin is very prone to blackheads for some reason and most of the time I have tiny bumps all over my face that are little blackheads forming (gross). I read online that chemical peels can help by peeling off the top few layers of skin to unclog pores. Now, usually I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of things and have a tendency to have pessimistic expectations, but I wrote this review because I am STUNNED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two uses, I can barely see any bumps on my face. I was sitting at my desk the day after I did the first application (about 6 days ago) and as I went to brush my hand over my face in frustration, all these little blackheads just fell off everywhere. As disgusting as that sounds, I was so happy. I washed my face after that and could actually see the blackheads being washed down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any kind of discomfort or \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; of my skin, only a slight tingle. I rinsed it off after about 5 minutes and that is the only time my face felt a little burn, but a quick application of aloe vera soothed it instantly. It is VERY important to moisturize when using this, because my skin did get dry around my chin and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied and the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it has only been a week and my skin becomes immune to certain treatments after a while but so far I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am prone to blackheads so I do not wear a lot of makeup, but nevertheless, my skin looked blah.  It took me a long time to find out that it was the result of a lot of dead dry skin on my face.  So I bought the Perfect Image cleanser and have used it every other night.  I tried it every night but my skin got too dry.  So this is right for me.  Then I bought the peel.  I was a little reluctant since some of the reviews state that there would be a burning feel.  I did feel the tngle and the burn but it is not painful.  I leave it on now for about 3 minutes and then rinse well, pat my skin dry and apple the after peel moisturizer.  It really &amp;#34;calms&amp;#34; the skin.  I love these products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect anything miraculous in a short period of time. It took a month to see any sign of difference. But it does work if you&#x27;re patient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1month and it has made a difference in the appearance of my skin. It leaves my skein feeling smooth and exfoliated each time I use it. This product is easy to use and effecitve but is not overly harsh. I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Over the last month my blemishes have decreased. Note to users - use this product as directed and don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
    <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this product for the money.  Works well for oily skin.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It did nothing on my face, no skin peeling, no clearing up of age spots.</li>
    <li> great product- every time i use it my skin feels completely soft and baby like...would recommend this highly-but not to people with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Seemed to do the trick for me and doesn&#x27;t cause too much pain</li>
    <li> Perfect Image products are what I try first.  I mistakenly order Salicylic Acid 20%, and it is too mild for my skin to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is Perfect Image TCA 12% and Hydra Repair Wrinkle Cream.  TCA 12% is very mild also, it does not really shed my skin like stronger ones. However, I really like it since it tighten skin nicely for 2,3 days.  I use Salicylic Acid 20% when I use TCA peel when I have acne to clear. It seems to help a little. I do not have wrinkles and use Hydra Repair after using stronger peel.  It moisturizes very well, and it is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in at home peel heaven! My first at home peel experience and boy am I glad I save the money and didn&#x27;t go to a spa!  Easy to do at home and with more control. Love this product so much I&#x27;d venture to say I&#x27;ll be a devoted customer for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my scars are fading away or blending with my skin better.  It stings while it is applied to your face, but once washed your face should feel better.  The redness however will stay for about five minutes and slowly disappear.  I, personally, use 1mL onto a clean disposable cotton pad.  Moreover, I never do a two layer peel, and I use this product once a week usually on the weekend at night.</li>
    <li> This peel is great and all, but try not to overuse it. The first time you apply it, you may feel like your skin can handle it pretty well; but be warned, the second time around, your skin may not react like it did the first time, and it could end up over-drying your skin and sucking out ALL the natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second piece of warning: It&#x27;s fine to let the peel turn into \\&quot;frost,\\&quot; but get the tap running as soon as it happens. If you let it be for more than a minute, the said frost can take quite a scrubbing to get rid of. And, when you do get rid of it, you may not like what you see on the mirror. The resulting redness will last a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mildly sensitive skin, and this is my story.</li>
    <li> Definitely a very strong product and does what it claims, &amp;#34;facial peel&amp;#34;. The burn was unpleasant but the new skin that came through after a few days of peeling was nice.</li>
    <li> My first time writing a review online. The peel was very powerful. I left it on my face for 10 minutes and washed it off then apply my moisturizer. The next day my face starting peeling and new skin appeared. It really cleared my spots and blemishes</li>
    <li> Works really great and leave skin feeling soft. Should only leave on no more than 2 minutes it will start to burn.</li>
    <li> I am reading about this product for my daughter. In reading some of the reviews I noticed many who have adult acne are trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this is helpful to you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing to let those of you who have suffered with adult acne and cysts that I too was in your situation.  My cysts were awful and all over my face and especially neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago my dermatologist in FL said Accutane was the last option. We moved to TX before deciding whether to take it.  I went to a new Dermatologist who put me on Spironolactone. (A prescription medicine with VERY little side effects.)  After 30 days I returned to the Dermatologist who was impressed that all my cysts but 1 had healed. After about 2 yrs on the medicine I could discontinue taking it and my acne and cysts didn&#x27;t come back. I was thrilled!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since a couple of months, yesterday when i used it after a week. I have bad marks on my right cheek, they look like burn marks and look horrible. I need to get rid of these marks asap. Please help anyone.</li>
    <li> I have long suffered from cystic acne and an over-production of candida cells and have added this gel peel to my skin care treament.  I use this product once a week to help strip my skin of the excessive candida cells and clear my peels.  I have noticed that my acne has decreased and that my acne scars have faded slightly within the month of use.</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;over forty\\&quot; skin that is beginning to show signs of aging. My biggest issues are enlarged pores, small wrinkles and discoloration. I used this product the first time, leaving it on close to 5 minutes. Immediately after my skin felt tighter and super clean. I assumed that the results would be gone by the next day but I was suprised at how firm my skin still felt. I have used this 4 more times since then, a few times using a second swipe. There is a huge difference in my facial discoloration and a large change in the appearance of my wrinkles. Unfortunately I have not noticed much of a change in the size of my pores but I am hoping that will come in time.</li>
    <li> This gel peel is definitely a money saver versus paying a high price at a spa or salon. Be careful the first few times with applying this peel as it is very strong especially if you have sensitive skin. As another reviewer stated your skin will peel and/or flake the next few days afterwards. I would recommend this only if you have oily/breakout prone skin. For wrinkles I would suggest going a little lighter with the glycolic acid gel peel.</li>
    <li> Week 1 Initial application (1 min)-stings something significant, no noticeable effects    Week 2 First (full) application (2 min)- stings hard. after washing my face with acne face wash after rinsing peel off with cold water, I saw that the pinkish patch of collective acne scars betwixt my eyebrows damn near faded away. that sting was doing something. Less noticeable affects around the face. Happy!    Week 12~Been using this once every week. Entire scar patches have nearly faded (85% gone). theyve been replaced by new breakouts, but those new blemishes fade away with 2-3 applications. i still have acne, but i&#x27;m happy knowing i can remove 85-90% of the blemishes to look like normal, usual skin complexion.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I was having problems getting with still getting occasional cystic acne even though my prescription regimen had helped a lot.  Once I added this to my regimen I would say it pushed me to 99% clear which was a big turn around for having acne/adult acne most of my life.  I&#x27;d highly recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> It burns my face its really unpleasant.  I now use it on my hands, guess my skin is just too sensitive!</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical when I bought this product but I&#x27;ve been impressed with the results.  After using it 3-4 times a week my skin is much smoother and more clear. Once I left it on my face for slightly longer than usual and as a result my skin had a light peeling about two days later. It works and is more affordable than a dermatology treatment.</li>
    <li> I must admit this product is really good. It is strong though. It burns and you can clearly see your whiteheads/blackheads floating on the pores. You can gently rub them away. DO NOT use towel/face wipe. Just use your cleaned finger tip to gently rub them(white/blackheads) away so you won&#x27;t damage your burned skin. It helps reduce the number of acnes and cystic acnes. Make sure you can take the burn feeling before you use it on your face.</li>
    <li> Worked ok, very strong.. but didn&#x27;t provide the results I was looking for. Easy to use, but it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clear my skin up&amp;#34; by any means. If anything it made the surface a little smoother, but cased white patches and extreme dryness. I had a ton of breakouts afterwards, and then my skin went into overload and started to become super oily, because it threw the PH balance of my skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using a ph balancing serum with this, such as orgmetics ( clear cell line)  to help get provide moisture back into the skin and get the ph re-balanced after doing something like this.</li>
    <li> Helped to clear up my face after several weeks of using.  It is drying, so make sure you have a good lotion on hand afterwards.  As the instructions indicate, I wash my face twice, use rubbing alcohol wipes twice, and then use 1 ml of the peel for five minutes.  One other reviewer suggested washing off in the shower, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that as it really does help to wash off with cold water and I couldn&#x27;t stand in the cold water to wash it off and the warmer water didn&#x27;t feel great on my freshly peeled skin.  I did try ten minutes once, but it really dried out my face.  I also stopped using it across my upper lip as it appeared to darken the skin there and no woman wants her upper lip to give the illusion of a moustache!  I would highly recommend this product.  I am in that embarassing group of women who never have acne and then have a child and have acne in their late 20&#x27;s because of hormones.</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars for a few reasons. First of all, I followed the directions exactly. I didn&#x27;t feel any burning on my face at all, even after two passes. Maybe my skin is not that sensitive. I washed it off with the cold water, and noticed my skin had turned purple on my cheeks. This went away in an hour or so. I didn&#x27;t expect results right away, and didn&#x27;t touch my face. After the fifth time using it, my skin had started to flake and peel off. However, that was it. My acne still persists, and so it didn&#x27;t really clear up my skin. It did lighten some of the scars I had, and so this is why I&#x27;m giving this three stars. It didn&#x27;t really do all that it could, but it did something.</li>
    <li> Everything my face needed!</li>
    <li> be sure to follow directions on package. first time using I didn&#x27;t leave it on long(only a minute or so) afraid of harming my skin. over time with your experience with this you will notice great results. my dark spots faded with 2-3 treatments. my oily skin has become less oily especially in this warmer weather. breakouts are now a rare occurrence other than monthly or stress related. a lot cheaper than what my derm was offering for one treatment ($150) and this small bottle lasts for months.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about it. If u use as the manual tells u to do, you will do a great peeling. It&#x27;s normal to feel a burn on your face.. Dry sky and it peeling off for a couple of days after you do it for the first time. Don&#x27;t worry, in a few days your skin will be amazing. I loved!</li>
    <li> Nice, strong stuff. I highly recommend it for hormonal chin acne. Every time I feel a sore spot that may be about to break out, I dab some of this stuff and it is usually gone in a couple days.</li>
    <li> I use it every other week.</li>
    <li> This helped my skin after the first treatment!! Amazing!</li>
    <li> Age: 29&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: oily/dry, mixed; cystic acne; moderate scarring&lt;br /&gt;Color: yellow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I would like to recommend the following review for other advice and instructions; it is what I have been using as a guide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.0 out of 5 stars Effective Product September 3, 2012&lt;br /&gt;By Rong D. Tan&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to start out by saying that I was super paranoid about trying this product. I have never had a professional peel (too poor, just a grad student); groupon sucks in my area so there was no hope of that ever changing; and I was afraid of burning my face off and making everything worse. However, I recently went through a super stressful, prolonged time in my life and whatever control I&#x27;d gotten over my acne was lost and I now have lots of scars and have been struggling with new cystic outbreaks. I read the reviews and thought I would try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, the tea tree oil smell is very strong; I swear it smells like eucalyptus too but I don&#x27;t have the bottle near me so I can&#x27;t say for sure if that&#x27;s also an ingredient; if I remember correctly there are several herbal ingredients listed besides tea tree. Anyway, if you are sensitive to smells this might not be the best product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this now for a few months. I have been using it about twice a week for about three minutes. I don&#x27;t like to go longer than that because I still feel like my face might burn off if I do; however, I have had no lasting ill-effects with this approach and length of application thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not tell anyone I was trying this product, in case I burned my face off and had to call into work for a few days and didn&#x27;t want people to know it was my own d*mn fault. So, a few weeks ago someone actually commented that my skin looked much better and that my scars seemed to be faded. I had not changed anything else in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this person wholeheartedly, soI take it that it is working. I would not have said that I had noticed a significant difference in my scars, but since this comment was totally unsolicited and unprepped, I think it is worth noting. I did notice that this product helps control my cystic acne. Not much else does. I was previously using a glycolic acid peel of 12% but this seems to be doing a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds like a broken record, but I do have to emphasize the sunscreen caution that goes with using this product. Two reasons for this: first, the public health one. Using this product increases your susceptibility to the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, which can cause skin damage in the first place. Use an SPF of 30 or higher that is water resistance and UVA/UVB protective, EVERYDAY when using this product, EVEN IF IT&#x27;S CLOUDY or you don&#x27;t plan to be outside very long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason is hypocritical based on the above first reason, I admit, but educational nonetheless. I said earlier I had not noticed the scars fading much although my friend mentioned it out of the blue. However, as I write this I am on vacation. I have been lax about sunscreen (hypocrisy, I know!) BAD IDEA!! My scars stand out so much more now than before!!! I am not using the product here but now even as I get a little tan, the scars are standing out soooo much more, so I guess the product really was doing something to fade them, and now I have to backtrack when I get home. Not to mention the other health dangers of being sloppy about sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there is my review; I know some people have questioned the sincerity of some of this brand&#x27;s reviews, but I assure you I am a real person and that my story about being stupid about sunscreen is real. Hope this review helps some people, whether deciding to use this product or maybe just sunscreen :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that this product lasts a REALLY long time. I bought it at the end of October and I just realized (in March now) that I have still not run out of my first bottle, although I started using it only once a week in January. I also lost my brush and started using those cotton pads from Walgreens, which I think absorb and thus waste more product. But I still have a lot of acid peel left. No idea how much longer it will last.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from cold sore DO NOT USE. I have used other peels and had no problems, so I ignore the warnings in the instructions. Shortly after using the peel I got the worst out break of my life. I had a massive sore, 3 times the size that I usually get. It was very painful and I had to go to the doctor for treatment. It took weeks to heal... The peel itself was fine, results were as expected. It was my fault for ignoring the clear warning from the manufacture. I write this as a warning to others who might be foolish like me. NOT FOR THOSE WITH COLD SORES!</li>
    <li> Have been having some acne breakout. I only use it once, already see the difference. 2nd day is very dry, I use aloe for the redness. 4 th day my face sees great, most acnes are gone</li>
    <li> This stuff didnt do a thing for acne/acne scars for me. I did everything by direction with no effect at all. There was a slight sting on a few areas of my face but that could have because of the rubbing alcohol. Not sure if this is watered down or what. Ive never used any of these acid type products before and dont think I want to waste money on something that does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt give a bad review if I was to get a replacement to test in case it was just my batch but they give you a short return policy that doesnt give you enough time to test the product when I know it takes time for results. I was only a few days short of the policy.&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I want to say is I have sensitive skin and heard reviews of this saying it burns really bad and so on but didnt do a thing to me. That is my reason for saying it could be just a bad batch but I will never know because Im not going to risk paying for this again for it to just happen again without any results.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It didn&#x27;t give me amazing results or even good results. However, I DID see some improvement after the breakout I received from it went away. I did it on a Sat morning. Then again the next Sat morning and kept my face SUPER moisturized after the second time - this is when I noticed my face respond better to it. Again, it&#x27;s not a miracle product but I would recommend having it as a routine skin care product in your skincare regime; little improvement is better than nothing. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experence any peeling. I have acne scars and acne prone skin.  Kept it on for 5 minutes, still nothing. My skin felt and looked very dry afterwards. Maybe I need to try a stronger strength.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a 4-5 weeks and I am SO happy to say that THIS FINALLY WORKED!!!! I&#x27;m 24 years old and have been battling acne since before I was in a teenager - first the forehead, then the chin, and now on the sides of my jaw. Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve been getting TERRIBLE cystic acne on my jawline - painful, itchy, red, and really not fun to look at! I had been going to a dermatologist every now and again, which helped some, but once my insurance changed and costs went up, I really just was not in the mood to be spending HUNDREDS of dollars on acne treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe 4-5 weeks. I normally have pretty sensitive, oily skin - dries out, but my forehead is always shiny. And, as I just said above, I was really looking to beat my cystic acne on my jawline. THIS STUFF WORKS! However, I do recommend that you use the cleanser (http://www.amazon.com/Pre-Peel-Salicylic-Deep-Exfoliating-Cleanser/dp/B007004PZO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1365526427&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;perfect+image+cleanser) both before you perform the peel and throughout the week - the combination of the two really seems to be what&#x27;s doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely be gentle on your skin - this stuff can sting, but it seems to get better after the first few tries. The first few times I used this, I actually noticed that it would make my skin WORSE at first because it would bring out all the bad stuff to the front of my face and cause me to break out even more! But, I believe I read something like that in the comments, so I decided to keep going with it. I started out doing the facial cleanser once a week a few days ahead of the peel (ex., Monday) and then doing the peel on a Friday or Saturday. I will admit, I only go 12ish hours without wearing makeup instead of the recommended 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started increasing both my peels (I&#x27;m now at two a week but only do my cheeks, forehead and jawline since my chin gets dried out REALLY quickly)and the frequency with which I&#x27;m using the cleanser. I&#x27;m using the cleanser every other morning and doing the peels twice a week. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with the results already! Although my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, I&#x27;ve gotten rid of almost ALL my painful, itchy, unsightly cystic acne, which is exactly what I was looking for... and at a FRACTION of the cost of what I would&#x27;ve paid at my dermatologist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note - I use more than recommended in the peel, and have been using it twice a week, and I still have more than half the bottle left, so this stuff will definitely last you a WHILE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you have a good moisturizer on hand! You will definitely see some dry skin, so I may suggest avoiding your drier areas.</li>
    <li> After trying it a couple of times I do feel that my skin gets cleaned and it is a very distinct burning feeling from the gel. I will continue using this although I must say I have not too much experience with the product so far.</li>
    <li> The product came on time. I&#x27;ve used it twice. So far it&#x27;s really good at drying out. Zits. It doesn&#x27;t burn to bad. I was expecting something a bit more dramatic. But it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ll give an update in a few weeks. I hope it fixes my acne scars.</li>
    <li> It worked, after 5 applications, my face was notably brighter with my pores significantly smaller then before.10/10</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30s, and struggle with hormonal acne.  A few months ago,  about 10 or so zits popped up on my face. I was so horrified with these 10 zits that I immediately ordered this peel and went full nuclear war on my face. At the time I also used the clarisonic twice daily at top speed for two minutes. I didn&#x27;t experience and irritation or redness from the peel, just the tiniest bit of flaking. I noticed my congested pores really starting to clear up, but I was still breaking out. Because there wasn&#x27;t any redness or irritation, I figured I could ramp it up a little. I started to use the peel every 5 days or so. My skin started to look a little better, my pores were tighter and frown lines started to become less noticeable. I still had zits. I took it even further and used the peel every 3 days; some of the other reviewers were doing this and it seemed like a good Idea at the time. Big mistake. Almost overnight, the pimples multiplied drastically. I don&#x27;t know why I counted, but in my shocked and horrified state, I found 81 pimples on my face. Pustules, nodules, and deep cysts all around my jawline cheeks and chin. Severe disfiguring acne. It has been 3 months since I used the peel and it&#x27;s not much better, but improving slowly. I am currently using a gentle cleanser and Differin gel from my doctor. I went from mild/moderate acne to one of the most severe cases I have ever seen. People stare. There is no makeup in the world that can cover this mess. I had over exfoliated big time and stripped my skin leaving it vulnerable to infection. Even if it&#x27;s not causing peeling or redness, that doesn&#x27;t mean you need more. Lesson learned. I will have permanent scarring from this brutal breakout. I will never try this product again, but my own impatience is likely to blame.</li>
    <li> Burns your face severely if you don&#x27;t put on moisturizer .</li>
    <li> I surely must have got a bad bottle, because this did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased 20% salicylic peels from other companies, and let me tell you, those peels really sting and burn after just 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle, but this does not work period. The instructions say 1-2 minutes. The second time I applied it, I left it on for a whole 30 minutes and did not feel the slightest tingle, sting, or burn. My skin did not turn red. My skin did not peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this truly were a 20% salicylic acid peel, I would probably be in the hospital with severe burns for leaving it on 30 times longer than the recommended time. It seems more like 2%.</li>
    <li> Completely impotent! Very painful sting that almost left a scar on my face. Users please be careful before purchasing skin products online!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty awesome, it really evens out my skin tone and makes my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s. The thing is, though, that when I turned 23 I developed some pretty deep cystic acne and the breakouts were getting way out of control. I searched Amazon for a high rated acne product and this was at the top of the list. I read every single review and decided to try it since I was running out of options. I&#x27;d tried tons of drugstore products as well as prescription topicals and nothing worked. Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t do anything to help the acne because I believe it was forming too deep under the surface of the skin so topicals weren&#x27;t effective much. After trying oral antibiotics with little success, I decided to go to the last resort, accutane. 7 months of that completely fixed my skin and took away all the oiliness that was clogging my pores all day. Now, everything I put on my face works dramatically better than when I had that insane amount of oil and acne, and this product is doing a great job at helping to fade red post-acne spots and does help keep my skin clear (it&#x27;s completely clear now for the first time since I was 12 - now 24). So in my experience I would recommend it for milder non-cystic acne or occasional breakouts of small pimples on the surface of the skin. However, for those of you out there suffering from deep cystic acne or very out-of-control breakouts, I really recommend talking to your doctor about going on accutane. This product works great for me now though, the brand is great, the stinging doesn&#x27;t hurt much and I plan on purchasing another peel when I run out of this one. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> It makes me break out..</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel to help reduce the size of the pores on my nose.  After 40+ years of blackheads and a facial rash that is the equivalent of \\&quot;dandruff of the face\\&quot;, my skin was pretty sad.  My daughter&#x27;s wedding was coming up and I needed to clear up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this peel.  I can leave it on for a full 5 minutes with no problem.  There is a slight sting, oddly enough, when I take it off.  I put a heavy moisturizer or squalene oil on my skin when I am done. My skin is getting smoother, and healthier looking. It is even clearing up the red skin from the rash. (I wonder if that isn&#x27;t the influence of the Tee Tree Oil).  Don&#x27;t misunderstand, I was not instantaneously transformed.  I have been using it for a few months now, once of twice a week.  I plan on continued use for great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I am 54 years old, fair skinned, with freckles and age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my 24 year old daughter and it did an amazing job of clearing up old acne marks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff  works like magic I have this in 50% pretty strong also bought this 20% which I regret  getting cause I have no use for it anyone interested in buying it for  $32.00 including shipping  please get at me it&#x27;s brand new &amp; seal, rosibel1991m@yahoo.com  it&#x27;s the place  you can get at me ,thank you</li>
    <li> Good peel. It does after time get less effective if the product sits for too long in the bottle. I had mine over a year and it expired I believe.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested me to go online and find my self a glycolic acid product to do peels at home so he says i don&#x27;t pay him for something like this (great doctor or what...). So I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I used it only once but i already feel this product works! I have very sensitive skin the tingling and stinging was strong. I just left it on for 2 min I could not take it for longer my face was red plus some white frosting had started to form (which according to the directions you have to rinse it of with cold water immediately). So I rinsed it off and my face was RED! I was scared thinking what have I done to my self. I applied some aloe vera gel to sooth my skin and went to bed. The day after...wow! My skin is so soft and shiny clean. The white frosting has dried and I already peel. I have very good faith that this is going to be really good for my skin with regular use. I plan to do once every 10 days avoiding the sensitive areas where white frosting formed (always the area around my mouth gets irritated with whatever I do). So give it a try is cheap and effective. Great results the day after you use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after I bought the Perfect Image 30% Glycolic Acid Peel.  Both are great products.  I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal acne my entire life.  I&#x27;m now 27 and I have finally found something that works for me.  I will definitely repurchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> I am often critical of skin care products given so many failures in the past. I have used the product for 3 weeks now and have a much clearer complexion and even smaller pores. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for the past 3 weeks. I am still using my everyday face wash [[ASIN:B001MA7QFO Topix Benzoyl Peroxide 10% Wash 8 oz bottle]] to help keep the blemishes away. I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a brush [[ASIN:B002CKYZMK e.l.f. Cosmetics Foundation Brush]] to spread the product evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Obviously your skin will be more sensitive so I would also recommend a face lotion with a high spf to use. I am very fair and use [[ASIN:B001E96QL8 Aveeno Active Naturals Continuous Protection Sunblock Lotion Face SPF-70, 3-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been roughly 6 weeks since I began using this product and I am not blemish free but am very close to it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tend to write reviews but this worked so well for me that I feel compelled to write something. First off, I have adult hormonal acne triggered by stress for the past 5 years that I&#x27;ve spent an arm and a leg for: benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, differin, oral contraceptive pills, tea tree oil, tumeric, numerous and expensive face washes/creams/gels...Nothing was effective for my nodules and cysts. Didn&#x27;t want to go on accutane. Thanks to the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only thing that gets deep enough in my clogged pores to combat nodules and cysts. I started with 1 min the first week and gradually increased by 30-sec increments weekly, up to 4 mins max. Depending on your skin&#x27;s sensitivity, it can sting quite a bit, but over time, your skin will start to tolerate it. I also used a calming moisturizer after washing off the peel. Your skin will slough off 1-3 days after using the peel. The new layer of skin feels so soft, you will want to caress your face. Be sure to use sunscreen every day even if it is cloudy. It did take about 1 month for noticeable results. After 3 months of usage, my skin is now clear without a single cyst. I use it once a week to help diminish scars and as needed for spot treatment. It doesn&#x27;t decrease my skin&#x27;s oil production but whenever I feel a pimple starting, I use a q-tip to put a dab on the pimple and leave it on for 3 mins. Usually by the next morning, inflammation and redness are greatly decreased and two days later, the pimple is gone. It&#x27;s a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works as well for your skin as it did for mine.</li>
    <li> good product if you use it carefully, it works well with me and it helped me to reduce my acne&lt;br /&gt;always wash it with cool water, because warm water will make it burns more</li>
    <li> Watch out...this stuff works!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I recently had a bad outbreak from no where and my acne has never been this bad before. Not only do I have pimples, white and black heads, I developed cystic acne as well. OMG I was livid due to the fact that I tried every thing to get rid of this acne, to no avail. After my first use of this peel I left it on for five minutes then reapplied the peel to enhance the peel and left that on for another five minutes. For the next couple of days my skin has improved a WHOLE lot. almost all of my pimples have diminished but I was able to rid my face of the cystic acne as well !!!!. I am one happy consumer and will be purchasing more of this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Alright I don&#x27;t want to go on about my life here but all you need to know is that acne has made my life a lot harder than it needs to be. I didn&#x27;t start getting acne until about junior/senior year in high school. It progressively got worse over the years when I turned 19. My face always had more than one pimple, and not just big nasty red looking dots on my face. But I really had a problem with whiteheads! Those have to be the worst, they look really nasty and if you pop them they come back with a vengeance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne got so bad I started looking for chemical peels in seek of completely restarting my skin so to speak. I came across this chemical peel and decided to give it a try. Upon using it for the first time I had already been expecting a burning sensation. Applying it over my face was not easy especially with the unique chemically smell it reeks off, but right as I lay a thin layer on my face, it burned really bad! I immediately drown my face with cold water for a couple minutes until the burn wore off. I forgot to mention my face is super sensitive to really anything but since I put a really thin layer I thought I would be fine. I applied two or three times in the month to build my tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this peel hardly did anything. If anything it made my skin super oily after using it. I did notice some acne scars did fade a bit but it wasn&#x27;t worth the burn. If your face is not sensitive and want to face your acne scars I would then only recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this priduct for about 6months and it works.&lt;br /&gt;My acne is gone and acne scar has been fading away. And my skin color is brightened.&lt;br /&gt;This is not harsh but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel some time ago and this weekend, I used it up for the first time.  I washed and cleaned my skin with cleanser and I used toner.  I have a small needle roller, which I used on the skin as a part of the weekly routing for skin.  After that, I put toner on my skin again and used 0.5ml of the peel solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a little but of peel on the cotton ball and started applying it on my forehead, cheecks, nose and chin.  Shortly afterwards my skin turned red and I felt a little bit of tingle, but nothing too uncomfortable.  I left solution on my face for 5 minutes, and I rinsed it out with water, trying to avoid my eyes.  I applied toner again and then moisturizer.  Skin soaked in moisturized much quicker than I normally experience it.  Skin looked radiant in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This solution has chamomile and green tree as main ingredients.  Bottle came in carefully sealed and instructions were detailed and to the point.  This bottle can last a long time.  Manufacturer recommend using this peel every 7-10 days.  It will definitely become a part of my weekly skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Gel makes it easier to apply and stay on your skin. It was my first time using this product that&#x27;s why I picked only 20%, next time I&#x27;ll get a stronger one. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty good, a noticeable improvement in skin texture. Not very harsh though, never really noticed any peeling even after leaving it on for an extended period. I do notice my skin seems much clearer and smoother so its doing its job without being overly obvious...</li>
    <li> So is there any down time with this peel???</li>
    <li> What can I say about this peel?  It is a quality product for a reasonable price.  When used according to its directions I experienced a significant reduction in my breakouts and smoother skin.  It even faded some of my sun freckles.  I have fair/medium sensitive skin and I gradually worked my way up in application time. I applied it to my nose and forehead first and let it sit for awhile before I applied it to the more delicate areas, such as near my eyes or my naso-labial folds.  Beings that it is a peel I did experience a few days of flaky skin (especially in the previously mentioned sensitive areas), but nothing that a good facial moisturizer couldn&#x27;t handle.  The momentary annoyance was worth it for me.  I would recommend it as a nice beginner peel for combination/oily skin.</li>
    <li> It works great! Already suggested this product to family.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has a bad acne problem. I have been using this peel on her at least once a week. The results were amazing after the 4th peel. I would highly recommend this product for those with acne problems. I also used it a couple of times on my own dry, aging skin, and after the first peel, my face was smooth and glowing.</li>
    <li> So far this product is working very well for me. I did my first peel and left it on for about 3 minutes. I didn&#x27;t notice too much change for my face immediately. I have done professional facial peels before, so on my next peel I left it on for 10 minutes with 2 layers of the gel peel. Thus far, my skin has shown a lot more improvement and more peeling(which is what I wanted)! I also combine the peel with the Perfect Image-Salicylic Deep Exfoliating Cleanser-Enhanced with Green tea, Vitamin C Facial toner, and Triple action Vitamin C Serum to smooth out my skin. My pores are a lot smaller and my problem areas are not so problem anymore. My skin is not perfect yet, but It looks way better then before. Only has been 3 weeks since my first peel. Also, if you do experience a lot more dryness, make sure you use a good moisturizer after you wash your face everyday. You do not want your face to be really dry, sometimes that will make you breakout more if your body is trying to re moisturize your dry skin with more oil.</li>
    <li> Does this help with acne scars ? Can anyone recommend any acne scar products ? Please</li>
    <li> Didnt work as expected.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this stuff!  After just leaving it on for 10-30 seconds every 14 days, I decided to leave it on for 20 minutes....just to see what it would do.  It finally did the job!!!  3 days after my 20 minute session, my skin started peeling off, over and over again and began revealing really smooth skin and the pores began to draw up smaller!  Great product!</li>
    <li> It did not work on my sunburn scar. It made the area redder and darker. I DO NOT RECOMMEND it.</li>
    <li> I have a psoriasis problem on my upper arms. I&#x27;ve used numerous other products over the years, some worked ok, others did nothing for me. I noticed the products with Salicylic Acid worked the best, so I went shopping with that info, and came across this great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid is the main active ingredient in many skin care products, from acne to dandruff, but usually only at 3% or so. Wart remover is only 17%. So I saw this was 20%, and thought \\&quot;hey, that&#x27;ll work, let&#x27;s get it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it a few days after ordering, and used it the next day. I saw immediate results. The redness and itching went away. I use it about twice a week, and will continue to use it as the condition is chronic. I&#x27;ve also used it for spot treatments on my face. I&#x27;ve had a wart on my hand I&#x27;ve been dealing with since I was a kid, it&#x27;s working great on that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got an application brush which is great. You can use cotton balls, but I think the brush just more efficient, less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend [[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]. It&#x27;s a hydrating cream you use AFTER the peel. It helps a lot. I use it on my face regularly too. I&#x27;d likely use this even if I stopped using the acid, it&#x27;s just a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative worth mentioning is that it IS an acid... so don&#x27;t leave it on too long. It does produce minor fumes to. One of the spot treatments was near my nose, I wear glasses and the fumes irritated my eyes a bit. I took the glasses off and closed my eyes, it was fine then. Just something to be aware of. there&#x27;s all kinds of warnings about the avoiding the sun and exfoliates for a day or so, that&#x27;s a good idea, and also where the above mentioned cream helps out a bit.</li>
    <li> I must admit I had a bad irritation after first use, because I cleaned my face with some alcohol before application( as recommended in attached product info). Second time I only used a gentle face wash an then the peel and it turned out to be a better way of managing this procedure . It cleaned my skin very well, I used it only once, because it&#x27;s way too sunny for the chemical peel now, so I will wait until fall to try it out more.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t right for my skin. It dried it out the more I used it.</li>
    <li> I was dealing with some bad acne scars around my chin area and purchased this in hopes of diminishing those scars. It definitely made a big difference after about 5 uses. I would only do one peel a week as my skin was quite irritated by this stuff.... so definitely do it at night when you don&#x27;t plan on leaving the house again :) The product is pretty harsh so I worked my way up to leaving it on for a full 60 sec. I know they have a lower % peel, which I probably should have purchased vs going straight to the 20%. Overall I was extremely happy with this stuff and would definitely order it again.... I&#x27;m thinking about giving some of their other products a try since they all have super good reviews!</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel about a week ago and used it twice for 2 minutes each time. After the first time I used it I already saw significant improvement of my skin. In the past I used Accutane for my skin treatment and most of my acne came back after I stopped taking the medication, the gel peel has given me similar skin to when I was taking Accutane.  The only problem with peeling is the burning sensation and you do have to be carefully not to leave it for too long as I believe it can actually damage your skin. Just follow the products directions.</li>
    <li> This is a fantasic product. I have been using it for 8 weeks now and for the first time in over 20 Years I actually don&#x27;t need antibiotic lotions from my doctor to control my acne. As well as being spot free my face also has an even radiance to it too, which is an added benefit. I highly would recommend this product. It is without a doubt the best beauty product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the best take-home Salicylic Acid peel I have found. It&#x27;s a very light peel, perfect for inbetween visits from my esthetician. Perfect Image did a great job providing instructions and packaging the peel. Do exactly as the directions say, and you should receive great results. Also- great cost for the product!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about two months now. it definitely leaves your skin feeling shine free the next day</li>
    <li> I love this product and recommended it to friends. I have acne and some scars and this peel has helped so much. I should use it more regularly, but my acne has improved greatly, much better than with any of the medicines and products I have tried. My skin feels so smooth and new after using it. Of course my skin does peel, but I use Aveeno naturals moisturizer and my skin doesn&#x27;t peel too much. I will definitely continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Having battled with my bad skin since being a teenager (now in my 30s), I was looking for something to help with acne AND fine lines. This is it!!! It doesn&#x27;t sting as bad as other peels I&#x27;ve used and I don&#x27;t get any redness. The smell is a little funky but goes away after you rinse. Very gentle and effective!</li>
    <li> I have never seen a product get so much positive feedback so I knew I had to try this. I have only used it once but I was truly amazed by how well it worked. I had immediate skin improvement; it was like I had brand new skin. Now I understand why people pay so much to get chemical peels at spas.  I seriously recommend this to anyone with black heads, acne, or even acne scars. This product is a miracle!</li>
    <li> I use the product once a week and I have noticed a visible reduction in the blackheads on my nose. I tried glycolic creams, Benzoyl peroxide, and even retin-a... All of these are somewhat effective, though I&#x27;ve seen the best and most permanent results with this product.</li>
    <li> I got this about two months ago and I&#x27;ve used it about 7 times here and there. Sometimes I&#x27;d stay on a good schedule of every 5-7 days, but I haven&#x27;t done a peel since December! So its been way too long, and I broke out more, and picked and popped my pimples more (gross, sorry) So now I still have all the hyper-pigmentation and scarring that I was trying to get rid of in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been so hectic with my routines, I am going to pretend like I&#x27;m reviewing this based on my experience last night when I did my first peel in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed a change of skin texture after I washed the gel off my face with cold water. It&#x27;s smooth, refreshed, and pretty much all my blemishes were decreased in size with just that one use. My scarring faded just a tiiinnnnyyyy bit. But not very noticeable. And thats just because it was only the first peel, and only 10 seconds after I was done. With repeated use, this will definitely get rid of or at least tame your breakouts/scars/markings. As far as pain goes, depending on how intensely you wash your face, its not that bad. I try to avoid using any exfoliating masks a couple days prior to the peel. And the day of, I wash my face with a little less pressure on the hands. I sit for about 5 minutes fanning my face with a birthday/greeting card (works well cuz its sturdy and produces a nice amount of wind) and I just have a little tingly feeling all over for the first couple minutes but then it goes mostly away by the end. Make sure you wash with COLD water!!! It will calm down any redness and probably tighten your pores. It does sting a little bit more when I was my face off though, thats probably just your raw skin reacting or something. It says to wipe your face with alcohol before the peel, so I just wet a pad with water and then add some rubbing alcohol on and spread it around my face and let it dry. Don&#x27;t really see a difference since prior to the peel i wash my face thoroughly with Cetaphil and Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil Wash...but if they say it helps, then i guess there&#x27;s no harm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really great product, you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose as long as you&#x27;re cautious and smart about using it. Don&#x27;t freak your skin out with too much, and test your skin first! The company Perfect Image seems to be really nice and helpful too! Apparently I&#x27;m getting 40% off my next purchase for doing this!!! Try it out!</li>
    <li> This product really works to clear pores.  I&#x27;m using Perfect Image about twice a week and noticing that my skin is more clear.  Follow the directions and use a timer to avoid frosting.</li>
    <li> I love how quick and easy this peel is to use. I use it about once a week and it seems to be working. It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up my post-pregnancy acne, but it think it is definitely helping. It does leave my skin quite dry the day after I use it, but the dryness goes away pretty quickly with plenty of moisturizer. I would recommend this product and am trying to get my husband to try it as well.</li>
    <li> This Salicylic acid peel works just as it says. I love how if you need immediate treatment, it will give you the results you are looking for! Again What a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months and it works. I will keep using this. My face is more clear.</li>
    <li> I love reading reviews to help me determine should I make a purchase or not.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing this review... hopefully my story will help some other poor soul struggling with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 34 years old, for the first time in my life I was starting to experience acne... I couldn&#x27;t believe it - adult acne!  I was mortified by the consistent outbreaks of pimples on my cheeks and forehead and the scars &amp; dark spots they would leave behind.  I tried everything from changing my diet to taking skin vitamins to using food items from the fridge and pantry to scrub my face... nothing worked!  I started to feel horrible about myself.  I decided to research the best solution for pimples and blackheads and salicylic acid always seemed to surface in my research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Olay blemish control salicylic acid acne cleanser as a daily face wash hoping it would correct my skin problems.  It help the problem a little bit but wasn&#x27;t aggressive enough keep the acne away completely.  That&#x27;s when I decided to try a peel.  After reading the reviews of Perfect Image Salicylic Acid Peel I decided it would not hurt to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the product immediately after it arrived at my door. I made sure to follow the instructions to the T.  Initially I did have a little tingle or slight burn when used it but I fanned my face really fast to keep it cool.  I lasted 5 minutes with it on - I guess I have a high tolerance.  I&#x27;ve used it very week for 8 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since!  The dark spots are completely gone, and my confidence is high again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this peel to anyone experiencing acne, especially adult acne!  I would recommend a weekly routine of using the peel to get maximum results.  Good luck and I hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> I love this peel...Not at all harsh but still has GREAT results.  Smoother skin, clears breakouts, softens fine lines, and leaves me with glowing skin!</li>
    <li> I had originally given this product 5 stars. I used it a few times even though it burned like heck and I could barely leave it on for 15 seconds. I would do my forehead, chin, nose all separate so I could stand the burning. My skin began peeling so bad around my nose and chin. I had to apply moisturizer 15-20 times a day to help soothe the pain. I have permanent scars from the chemical burns I received. I threw this product in the garbage</li>
    <li> If your like me, you actually read the reviews and you write reviews also.  It does assist me in purchasing a new product.  I have tried (for some time now; I&#x27;m 48) to clear, shrink, and stop the blackheads on my nose.  Please note; I have read on the internet that basically nothing works- now that doesn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing Obagi, Peter Roth, Clinique, and countless other expensive products.  I do not have the funds to get salon peels, microdermabrasion, or facials either.  I have heard that getting regular SALICYLIC chemical peels would reduce the amount of blackheads and pores.  I did alitlle reading (I love Google) and determined which chemical peel I needed to shop for and headed to Amazon.  I read all of the product reviews for the &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; peels.  This was not the most expensive peel, but it did get high ratings.  The peel was packed very minimally; no fancy box (as shown in the picture)- but the bottle was sealed with shrink wrap and had DIRECTIONS...read those!  They were extremely helpful for first-timers like myself.  I cleaned my face as directed and only kept it on for only ONE minute (it stated that first time users should only keep it on for 30 seconds).  I knew it was going to tingle (the directions had stated that) and I washed it off with cold water (as directed).  OMG!  The same day it appeared as if all of my blackheads on my nose were gone.  I&#x27;m three days after (as I&#x27;m writing this) and still, this morning, while using a toner- the blackheads are minimal and the pores are smaller.  I will wait another 10 days and use the peel again.  I think with regular use; I may have found a way to NO MORE BLACKHEADS on my nose (please note, I do not have acne nor pimples- just a very oily T-zone which always produced large pores and blackheads only on my nose).  Its a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> It makes wherever you put it darker and a little crinkley too at first. Once your skin peels though the new skin is lighter and softer. Like the scar or dark spot might not be completely gone,but it lightens it for sure. If you keep using it no doubt the scar will go away completely. I use it on my knees and my acne scars and even a few scars I had from cuts or falling and they all got lighter. I even had a really bad breakout that left a bunch of acne scars. I&#x27;m black, but I&#x27;m not that dark so the acne scars stood out big time. Used this stuff for maybe 4months and now all the scars are almost completely gone. Most of them are gone. Just like the massive pimples that left big dark scars are still kind of visible, but ot really. I hate how it peels my skin, but the results are worth it. I also use the other peels by these people, I feel like all of them do the same great job so you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.</li>
