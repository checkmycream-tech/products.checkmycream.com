      <li>This product works really well on curly hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I get compliments everyday on how pretty it is and healthy.</li>
      <li>I normally style my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>I can actually go out in public again :)</li>
      <li>It really keeps my curls in place and soft</li>
      <li>Just for the fun of it, I used a larger amount and styled my hair curly</li>
      <li>I should throw out all the other stuff I haven&#x27;t used since I started using Enjoy.  </li>
      <li>My hair can&#x27;t live without it in the Florida humidity.</li>
      <li>It holds my hair style in a very natural way and let&#x27;s it bounce.</li>
      <li>Different than there mousse because it is a softer feel and actually gets better the next couple of days</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s soft not crunchy and makes curls very pretty unlike other products that make it frizzy.</li>
      <li>It controls, yet leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>If you use too much, it can become flakey after several hours.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of naturally curly hair, almost to my bottom</li>
      <li>Recently I watched a video where they used a butter pat size dollop (which is twice what I normally use) to make the model&#x27;s hair curly.  </li>
      <li>Then, I spritz a very lit bit of spray gel on it and let it air dry.</li>
      <li>I bought one from a near by beauty salon and it comes in the same bottle as the one being advertised but not the one shipped to me.</li>
      <li>Long lasting, effective even on my thin, flyaway</li>
      <li>, if you use too much of it, it will weigh your hair down.</li>
      <li>But this order, it is much heavier and gave me stringy, slightly crispy curls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Did they change the formula with the packaging? I used to love this when it was in the all orange bottle. It left my weirdly wavy/curly hair soft with no crunch whatsoever. Was so happy with it. But this order, it is much heavier and gave me stringy, slightly crispy curls. No beuno. The smell is great and it&#x27;s still miles better than drugstore junk, but I am no longer in love with Enjoy. So sad.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do my hair without this product.  It gets my hair to do whatever I want it to.  The 2 bottles came fast and in good condition.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and now I use it but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Then my husband said, &amp;#34;Check on Amazon.com!&amp;#34;  He was right and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Love how my hair looks and feels!!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that is uncontrollable without this lotion. It controls, yet leaves my hair soft and shiny. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this so much that I have told urged my friends, to purchase this product and they have. Also they have love it also</li>
    <li> Artive on time. Product is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I am wondering as to why the bottle is completely different than what is displayed? I bought one from a near by beauty salon and it comes in the same bottle as the one being advertised but not the one shipped to me. Please explain. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have fine, medium-curly hair. This lotion is my favorite product. It takes the frizz, helps retain moisture, and does those two amazing things without weighing my hair down. It also smells good, which is another plus. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Hair lotion. Fantastic idea! When you need every hair in place, this is what you can use. It works without feeling gross.  Long lasting, effective even on my thin, flyaway hair.&lt;br /&gt;A tiny amount is all that is needed to do the job.  If you use too much, it can become flakey after several hours.</li>
    <li> I just love it. It really keeps my curls in place and soft too!!!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use this for a long time. ;)</li>
    <li> Have used Enjoy Shaping Lotion for years, and love it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my hideous perm. I can actually go out in public again :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Its about half the price here than it is at the salon so that is Great!!! I have naturally curly hair and I use this strait out of the shower to get rid of all the frizzies and it helps keep my curls together without getting my hair all crunchy like mousse would.. One bottle lasts a while too I have hair down to my butt and I use about a nickel size amount every morning and the bottle lasts about 6 months for me..</li>
    <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve found this shaping lotion, I haven&#x27;t been able to go back to using anything else. I love how it defines my curls without making them look &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. A side note though, if you use too much of it, it will weigh your hair down. I have a lot of naturally curly hair, almost to my bottom and I only use a quarter size of product to run through my hair while it&#x27;s wet. Then, I spritz a very lit bit of spray gel on it and let it air dry. My spiral curls look perfect when dry.</li>
    <li> Great for straight hair - doesn&#x27;t make it too stiff.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and had a difficult time finding a product that would keep the shape of my curls without weighing them down or making them crispy. This is it. My hairdresser introduced me to it and I no longer need 4 different products to maintain my look. I generally use a leave in conditioner and then ENJOY shaping lotion.</li>
    <li> This is really a nice addition to my styling products. Gives my hair body and shape. I have long layered hair. Different than there mousse because it is a softer feel and actually gets better the next couple of days....I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday....too drying. Enjoy products are the best. My hair is highlighted heavy blonde. I get compliments everyday on how pretty it is and healthy. Days a lot about Enjoy. Use there conditioning mist....or works. I don&#x27;t use anything else. Thanks for your time....Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.  During hot humid months, I put a layer of this on after Salerm 21 B5 Silk Protein and follow with Oiudad Tress FX bell.  Light layers.  My curly hair loves it and I get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever tried.  It adds volume to my thinning hair and I can go longer between washes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the somewhat greasy look it gives your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down. It&#x27;s creamy so it doesn&#x27;t make my curls \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or stiff.</li>
    <li> Love this.. My hair can&#x27;t live without it in the Florida humidity.</li>
    <li> Great product, same quality as what I buy in the salon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, thank you ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use anything else on my wavy hair with such good results!</li>
    <li> This product works really well on curly hair. It&#x27;s soft not crunchy and makes curls very pretty unlike other products that make it frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have used Enjoy Styling Gel before and that is why I purchased it again.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. This defines the curls without leaving them crunchy.</li>
    <li> I have a cabinet full of product for my curls.  It took me a while to find Enjoy and it is just the best.  I should throw out all the other stuff I haven&#x27;t used since I started using Enjoy.  The Shaping Lotion provides enough control without making my hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> I ENJOY MY HAIR VIA THIS BRAND EVERY DAY.  It&#x27;s all about staying stocked up at a great price!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product for curly hair</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. It holds my hair style in a very natural way and let&#x27;s it bounce.</li>

    <li> Mom loves her soft curls!</li>
    <li> I put this in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower. It dries in my hair, allows it to curl, my hair doesn&#x27;t fizz, but my hair is not crunchy.</li>
    <li> I love this product -it was recommended and it is good for natural curly hair</li>
    <li> Great product-arrived promptly</li>
