      <li>They fit!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found good reliable replacements for a decent price.</li>
      <li>I needed this to fit my curler which I love.  </li>
      <li>So true!</li>
      <li>These are a bit softer more plush and domed than the original pads.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole new curler and these fit the shu uemura perfectly.</li>
      <li>fit is fine and slides in easily&lt;</li>
      <li>They fit the shu uemera</li>
      <li>In sephora they only sell eyelash curler, happy to find these</li>
      <li>refills don&#x27;t fit Shu Uemara eyelash curler as described in the product offering.  </li>
      <li>No longer available at my Macy&#x27;s as a 2-pack</li>
      <li>I bought these refills because a lot of reviews said that if fit into Shu Uemura eyelash curlers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been buying the cheap drugstore refills for my Shu Uemura curler and they always pinched.</li>
      <li>I bought these because a reviewer said they fit her Shu Uemura eyelash curler, and she was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I discovered that they were no longer available.  </li>
      <li>I have a Shu Uemura eyelash curler, and searched everywhere to find refil pads to fit.</li>
      <li>These fit</li>
      <li>Still, though, would recommend this to those who want to keep their original Shu.</li>
      <li>Shiseido refill vs original Shu in mine (~ 5 yrs old):&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Plus, they arrived super soon which was a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>I do feel these pads are superior to U.S. brands (Revlon, La Cross, Sally Hansen etc.)</li>
      <li>true to size and fits well</li>
      <li>Not bad at all price-wise in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Price right, fit&#x27;s into Shu Uemura lash curler and does what it needs to do.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original Lancome curler head, but it works pretty well</li>
      <li>I have has the old more tubular shape.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Otherwise, worth it.</li>
      <li>You need a firmer rubber insert for both Shiseido and Shu Uemura eyelash curlers and these are the right ones.  </li>
      <li>They definitely fit and have a decent firmness to them.</li>
      <li>To my luck they fit the eyelash curler and are of good quality, a nice hard rubber with a tight fit.</li>
      <li>Shell out for the real deal if you can, but if you need a quick fix, these do the job.</li>
      <li>I got them quick, and they are reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>since it&#x27;s such a great curler, why do they want us to replace the entire appliance every six months, which is what I was told when I called their customer service.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t even curl very much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheapo refills f/ the drugstore, but the rubber is softer and more likely to fall out of the groove on the curler.  </li>
      <li>I hot it for my wife.</li>
      <li>I find them pretty overpriced.</li>
      <li>need to squeeze one more time halfway down to get more natural</li>
      <li>but it gives a less acute curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are a knockoff, the real thing has the word \\&quot;Shiseido\\&quot; stamped on the bottom</li>
      <li>it was too much of a hassle to return them and pay the shipping.  </li>
      <li>My eyelashes are stick straight.  </li>
      <li>Two stars because they were not broken, otherwise one star.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I believe this is the real product.</li>
      <li>The refills are a bit pricey, but really hold up and do the job.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased, and happier with this purchase than with the prospect of replacing the entire curler just because the tiny strip needs replacing.</li>
      <li>Got these refill pads because Sephora or any other place no longer carries my favorite eyelash curler of all time Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler or the refills.</li>
      <li>Fit perfectly in my Shimura eyelash curler and saved me a ton from not having to buy an entire new curler because they are so expensive!</li>
      <li>and it was more average.</li>
      <li>They are not very pliable, kind of stiff and cheap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a Shu Uemura eyelash curler, and searched everywhere to find refil pads to fit. These work perfectly! I got them quick, and they are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> These are a knockoff, the real thing has the word \\&quot;Shiseido\\&quot; stamped on the bottom and these don&#x27;t. BUT they do work well and the price is good.</li>
    <li> This fits the Shu Uemura eyelash curler perfectly.</li>
    <li> These do indeed fit perfectly in the Shu Uemura curler, but this is very overpriced! I just picked up 3 packs of 2 pads in Tokyo for 105 yen each (just over $1).</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly in my Shimura eyelash curler and saved me a ton from not having to buy an entire new curler because they are so expensive!</li>
    <li> I have been using my Shiseido eyelash curler for years. At the time it was the best curler, I believe that it was in Instyle&#x27;s best 150 beauty products. It is the best one that I have ever owned. I was unable to find a set of refills in town so I purchased some from the drug store. It was the worst experience ever. It pinched my eyelids and only lasted for a few weeks.  I believe this is the real product.</li>
    <li> These have to be the BEST refills out there.  Plus, they arrived super soon which was a huge plus.  Buy these -- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because you have to hold it tight forever and it doesn&#x27;t even curl very much.  I liked the idea of a wider curler for bigger eyes, if only you didn&#x27;t have to press so hard and they worked!!</li>
    <li> These are great and can be used to fill she-emura eyelash curlers.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is authentic but I bought it and it was more average.</li>
    <li> Bought these refills to use in a Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  They fit perfect and are the right firmness.  I&#x27;ve tried cheapo refills f/ the drugstore, but the rubber is softer and more likely to fall out of the groove on the curler.  You need a firmer rubber insert for both Shiseido and Shu Uemura eyelash curlers and these are the right ones.  I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the cost.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;d been buying the cheap drugstore refills for my Shu Uemura curler and they always pinched. These are so comfortable and they curl perfectly. I won&#x27;t be buying anything but these from now on!</li>
    <li> It is a very good refill !!!</li>
    <li> Since Shu Uemura no longer sells in the U.S., I bought these refill pads for my eyelash curler, hoping they would suffice. They definitely fit and have a decent firmness to them. The pads do not fill the entire space of my eyelash curler though, so I have to angle it to reach my outermost lashes. I do feel these pads are superior to U.S. brands (Revlon, La Cross, Sally Hansen etc.) but these are definitely not better than the Shu refills. I find them pretty overpriced. Shell out for the real deal if you can, but if you need a quick fix, these do the job.</li>
    <li> The refills fit my Shu Uemura lash curler perfectly. They&#x27;re a bit pricy but still significantly cheaper than having to spring for a new curler (not to mention the waste). Thanks to all the other reviewers who pointed this out!</li>
    <li> These are very expensive curler refills, so I was on the fence about buying them. I also made a mistake and thought they were for Shu Uemura, which I realized when they arrived that they are not. To my luck they fit the eyelash curler and are of good quality, a nice hard rubber with a tight fit.</li>
    <li> I needed the refills for my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, but I couldn&#x27;t find the refills in retail and department stores. So I bit the bullet and purchased online. These refills fit perfectly. I only gave it 4 stars because of the price. Otherwise, worth it.</li>
    <li> Shisedo eyelash curler is by far the best curler I  have ever used. I was delighted to find these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for refills</li>
    <li> Perfect refills for the Shiseido eyelash curler and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall</li>
    <li> shame on shu uermura for not selling the refills.  I believe people would not buy the curler if they knew this.  since it&#x27;s such a great curler, why do they want us to replace the entire appliance every six months, which is what I was told when I called their customer service.  they know the curler would last forever and they would be losing money just selling the refills.  shame on Canada for allowing this type of business practice.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers here, I cannot get the Shu Euemura eyelash curler refills at Sephora so I tried this as an alternative. I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 months so far and the rubber has soften a bit which is actually fine with me because it was a bit hard at the beginning. Will repurchase again if the Shu Euemura ones are still unavailable.</li>
    <li> They fit the shu uemera but they don&#x27;t have the same feel or result.</li>
    <li> Fits in the Shu Umera lash curler perfectly.</li>
    <li> I got confused when I ordered.  I wanted Shu Uemura refills.  These fit okay but not perfectly.  But will do.</li>
    <li> I have a Shu Uemura eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;This may be a 5 star product if used in its own  Shiseido curler.&lt;br /&gt;The  Shiseido refill vs original Shu in mine (~ 5 yrs old):&lt;br /&gt;  shorter by ~4 mm so it does not completely fill the groove,&lt;br /&gt;  stiffer (checked both websites: Shiseido is rubber vs Shu Uemura is silicone)&lt;br /&gt;  shape is different; this has a rounded top (shiny) with a narrower squared off base (matte)*&lt;br /&gt;  fit is fine and slides in easily&lt;br /&gt;*Shu website states \\&quot;upgraded silicone pad in a new mushroom shape provides a protective, stay-put edge for improved safety and optimum curl\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested both.&lt;br /&gt;This refill gives a  sharp 90 degree skin-tickling bend if done at the base of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I need to squeeze one more time halfway down to get more natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;My old Shu pad is splitting at the end so it is not working as well but it gives a less acute curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure who changed the shape first.&lt;br /&gt;The Shu pad I have has the old more tubular shape.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that silicone may be softer thus less tendency to break and possibly a softer curl??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I wish I would have  just purchased a new Shu Uemura curler for $20 vs refills for $4.99  plus $5.99 shipping fee.</li>
    <li> I only paid $7 for these replacement pads. They came two in a pack. Not bad at all price-wise in my opinion. They say they&#x27;re made of rubber but it must be high-quality rubber because other than it being a bit softer, I couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference to my original Shu Uemura ones which I think are black silicone. When you lay the Shisedo ones next to the Shu Uemura ones, they are a bit shorter. We&#x27;re talking milimeteres though. And when I put one into my curler, I honeslty couldn&#x27;t tell they were shorter. Seemed perfect. These are a bit softer more plush and domed than the original pads. Just barely though and not at all noticeable unless you are looking at both in a side by side comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they&#x27;re a bit thicker and squishier, I had to work a little bit to get them on the curler. But once I got them on, they didn&#x27;t budge. The curler works as good as it ever did. I&#x27;m so glad to have found good reliable replacements for a decent price. See my pics. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Fits well and works great. I&#x27;ll buy them again, especially considering you can&#x27;t find them anywhere but online.</li>
    <li> These seem great! I bought them to refill my Shu Uemura eyelash curler after my other rubber piece tore and they fit nicely. My eyelashes continue to curl upward, so I guess they are doing their job. Not much to say, but they fit and they work. There you have it.</li>
    <li> When I went to purchase the shu uemura refill I discovered that they were no longer available.  I read the reviews on the Shiseido refills and decided to give it a try.  These refills fit perfectly and I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad I needed the refill.  It works like new again.</li>
    <li> After reading the comments here, was not sure this would fit my beloved Shu Uemura curler; turns out, these strips are slightly shorter than the original, but they are long enough to fill the trench in the curler, and stay in place. So far, I&#x27;m very pleased, and happier with this purchase than with the prospect of replacing the entire curler just because the tiny strip needs replacing. The other difference between this and the original is that the ridge on this strip is not as high; that is to say, you will have to squeeze the curler harder to get as sharp a curl on your lashes, because this refill has a lower rise than the original. Still, though, would recommend this to those who want to keep their original Shu.</li>
    <li> I hot it for my wife. Get it 4 less sent it right away and she loved it. Was a good price as well</li>
    <li> I bought these because a reviewer said they fit her Shu Uemura eyelash curler, and she was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit PERFECTLY... what a great find..</li>
    <li> great product a little pricey but great quick shipping !!!</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all with the Shisheido eyelash curler.  It is no different from the Revlon and Maybelline curlers I have had in the past, but costs much more.  It curls eyelashes exactly like they did, which wasn&#x27;t that great.  My eyelashes are stick straight.  This curler does not curl them as I would like.  Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> bought this because apparently the Lancome curlers used to be Shiseido. It fits my Lancome curler I bought in 2013. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original Lancome curler head, but it works pretty well</li>
    <li> I hate paying so much for refills that won&#x27;t last long at all. The alternative is to use  when rubber gets too &amp;#34;squished down&amp;#34;  and metal edges of curler cuts lashes off.</li>
    <li> Love my sephora eyelash curler and these refills are cheaper than in dept. stores</li>
    <li> Great packaging. Price right, fit&#x27;s into Shu Uemura lash curler and does what it needs to do. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it and I didn&#x27;t have to step inside a mall to just purchase an overprice version of it.</li>
    <li> Only so so, I really had to heat them up with the hair dryer to try &amp; soften them up.  I would not buy again.  They did curl, but rubber too hard. rubber? silicone? I have no idea.</li>
    <li> I bought these refills because a lot of reviews said that if fit into Shu Uemura eyelash curlers.  However, it was too small for my Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  It did not fit the bed of the curler on length nor thickness.  It was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and great pricing, thank you!  I received my order within 2 days of purchase, really happy with quick turnaround.</li>
    <li> Fits the Shu Uemuera eyelash curler. No longer available at my Macy&#x27;s as a 2-pack so this was great.</li>
    <li> I recommend this who already have Shiseido curler. it is money saving product!  Not many beauty company has refill and this quality in this price</li>
    <li> These refills fit my Shu Uemura Eye Lash Curler perfectly.  Made as same material as the two that came with the curler.  Will not purchase a Shu Uemura Curler again when needed.  Will purchase a Shiseido.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Pricey but great replacement for my Shiseido Eyelash Curler.</li>
    <li> In sephora they only sell eyelash curler, happy to find these so I don&#x27;t have to buy another $20.00 curler. Good choice.</li>
    <li> I needed this to fit my curler which I love.  The refills are a bit pricey, but really hold up and do the job.</li>
    <li> My favorite refill! Fits my Lancôme eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> These do not fit my original Shu Eumura as described by other reviewers, these are too short. They are not very pliable, kind of stiff and cheap. Will not buy again. Two stars because they were not broken, otherwise one star.</li>
    <li> I was looking for refills for my shu uemura eyelash curler and saw that someone else bought these for the same purpose and reviewed it and it worked for them. i can attest that it does work! i didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole new curler and these fit the shu uemura perfectly.</li>
    <li> true to size and fits well&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can buy a refill and not have to get a whole new curler. thanks</li>
    <li> Use these in your extremely expensive Shu Uemura eyelash curler and never have to buy one again! They fit!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Did not fit my shiseido eyelash curler!  I didn&#x27;t return it due to the cost versus the hassle.</li>
    <li> refills don&#x27;t fit Shu Uemara eyelash curler as described in the product offering.  it was too much of a hassle to return them and pay the shipping.  won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> Rubber refills are not a fit, they are too short.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it worked well with my Shu Umera eyelash curler.  I will definitely buy again.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A great refill for the Shiseido Eyelash Curler! I can&#x27;t live without it and I can never go back to any other eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> Got these refill pads because Sephora or any other place no longer carries my favorite eyelash curler of all time Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler or the refills. Shiseido refills fit perfectly into the curler and its been awesome to be able to use my eyelash curler again with the proper refill pad!! My lashes look lovely! Must purchase if you are looking for a great fitting refill pad for the no 1 eyelash curler! So true! Amazon sells the curlers which ship from Japan. Do it! :)</li>
