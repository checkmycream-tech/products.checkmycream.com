      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>With our third on the way, you better believe we&#x27;re stocking up on this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>I grabbed some and buttered up Jade&#x27;s bottom and within one or two days, she was as good as new!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the BEST for dry, winter tootsies!!!  </li>
      <li>My friend who gave it to me... had mainly bought it to let me sample the stretch mark cream she loved...</li>
      <li>I used 1 tube of Palmers Diaper Rash Cream for my 1 month baby and it was great: no rash, no other side effects.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best diaper rash cream in existence.    </li>
      <li>Silky smooth and smells</li>
      <li>The stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>We started using it again with each change and he&#x27;s been rash free ever since.</li>
      <li>I tried every cream available, corn starch, hydrocortisone cream (per pediatrician) and even let baby go diaper free.</li>
      <li>Does a great job at allowing the skin to heal and protecting from further rashes developing.</li>
      <li>how well I care for myself, keeping clean, hydrated, and wearing clean athletic wear</li>
      <li>but I actually liked the previous Smooth Application version better.  </li>
      <li>smell is like coco butter and it eliminates rash and chafing quick...</li>
      <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of powders and cremes to relieve the pain and reduce the issue but most everything I found didn&#x27;t work for more than a tiny amount of time.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well or how quickly it clears up an existing rash</li>
      <li>Each time we ran into a food that lit up our babies&#x27; bottoms, we tried rash cream to give them some quick relief.  </li>
      <li>Enter new born baby Jade :)  </li>
      <li>Many websites still picture the old version but deliver this Creamy Application version.  </li>
      <li>It helps her skin clear up better than anything else.  </li>
      <li>Now our youngest is 2 and on the rare ocassion</li>
      <li>This is such a nice creamy bottom butter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great on those little newborn scratches too!</li>
      <li>I tried Desitin when my son was first born and rashes started right away.</li>
      <li>I opened it and started using it first....</li>
      <li>and when I finally found a store I had to stalk them to make sure I got one, because they would run out the day that the tubes came in.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>I actually had purchased this stuff many years before having a baby.</li>
      <li>I apply it at most diaper changes, especially at the first sign of any diaper rash.</li>
      <li>I was relieved to find it here on Amazon and made sure to pick up 2 tubes to have around for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works very well...</li>
      <li>The old Smooth Application has a blue label while the Creamy Application has the pinkish label.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite for everyday, non-rashy butt cream.  </li>
      <li>the next day she good no more rashes.</li>
      <li>Bottom Butter rubs into the skin nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave me with a mess on my hands, and clears up any redness by the next diaper change.  </li>
      <li>Butter\\&quot; was in a Palmers \\&quot;new mom\\&quot; sample bag that a friend gave me at my shower.....  </li>
      <li>I kept searching stores where I live out west and never found it...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m stocking up to give as gifts to my new mom friends.</li>
      <li>My kids skin is very sensitive and burts</li>
      <li>Works wonders for my baby&#x27;s super sensitive skin - and we have tried EVERY SINGLE product on the market, including &amp;#34;handmade&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It had a less sticky texture, yellow color, and better scent than this new version.  </li>
      <li>I put a layer on plus sprinkle some baby powder every night in my 10 month old&#x27;s diaper before putting her to bed.</li>
      <li>and we have not had any problem thus far with diaper rash...</li>
      <li>, I still end up with very sore, red, swollen, and chafed skin between my legs and around my bottom.  </li>
      <li>Until my daughter was 12 months old</li>
      <li>I use this for a moisture barrier on an adult with incontinence issues.  </li>
      <li>Within a week diaper rash was completely gone.</li>
      <li>It absolutely solved my problems and I was so relieved to find something that actually worked.  </li>
      <li>It is so creamy, but not messy or smelly.  </li>
      <li>After I apply it to baby&#x27;s bottom, my hands always feel soft too.</li>
      <li>i put this on twice a week the scar completely gone</li>
      <li>When we used to use Desitin on my daughter, we noticed that the rash never seemed to clear up completely.  </li>
      <li>bottom butter is the only product I can use and it is gentle enough to use at every diaper change.</li>
      <li>(she&#x27;s only 2 months old).  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a mess and is very much like a lotion but works well.</li>
      <li>By the time our boys were about a year and a half old, they would calm down after being wiped if we said we were getting the butter out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received this as a gift when my son was born, along with several other varieties (Desitin, kiehl&#x27;s, etc) Palmers is definitely the best. I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find it on store shelves! Bottom Butter rubs into the skin nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave me with a mess on my hands, and clears up any redness by the next diaper change.  My son is immediately soothed when I put this product on. Also smells great! I&#x27;m stocking up to give as gifts to my new mom friends.</li>
    <li> I love this bottom butter, I have used it with both my kids as a diaper rash cream preventative. I mix 1 tube of bottom butter along with vaseline and it works great. They never get diaper rash b/ I use this every time I change their diaper. It has a nice smell as well.</li>
    <li> Palmers diaper rash cream is the only one I&#x27;ll use on my little one.  It helps her skin clear up better than anything else.  It also feels and smells really nice, so I don&#x27;t mind using it every day.  (I call her my chocolate baby, because it smells like chocolate.)  I&#x27;m never going back to those goopy zinc-based ointments that always seemed to make her skin worse.  I just wish it were easier to find in stores!</li>
    <li> The best baby ointment ever!!! Works wonders for my baby&#x27;s super sensitive skin - and we have tried EVERY SINGLE product on the market, including &amp;#34;handmade&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My kids skin is very sensitive and burts bottom butter is the only product I can use and it is gentle enough to use at every diaper change. It has a pleasant fragrance and easily wipes off. I have used it for all three of my children and I will also use it on the forth. It clears up a red bottom in hours. Love it</li>
    <li> Hands down the best diaper rash cream in existence.    Better than that stupid &#x27;Boudreauxs Butt Paste&#x27; or whatever.</li>
    <li> I actually had purchased this stuff many years before having a baby. I can&#x27;t remember what I bought it for now, but it had been sitting around in the bathroom drawer for maybe 5 or 6 years.  Enter new born baby Jade :)  When changing her diapers, I noticed she was developing some diaper rash around the folds in her legs and also her bottom. She also had \\&quot;neck cheese\\&quot; and some redness in the folds of her baby neck.   I remembered I had this Bottom Butter and that people had said it was the best for diaper rash. I grabbed some and buttered up Jade&#x27;s bottom and within one or two days, she was as good as new! The stuff is fantastic. I apply it at most diaper changes, especially at the first sign of any diaper rash. As mentioned, it works great around the folds of her neck as well (she&#x27;s only 2 months old).  Does a great job at allowing the skin to heal and protecting from further rashes developing. If you have a baby, you need this stuff. No ifs ands or [red] \\&quot;butts\\&quot; - sorry, couldn&#x27;t resist :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried A+D Ointment and Desitin, as well as a few other organic options.  Once I discovered Palmers Bottom Butter, it&#x27;s all I use.  Until my daughter was 12 months old I rubbed some on her at every diaper change and it kept her from getting rashes. At one year old it seems that she only needs it once in a while when the skin looks a little tender.  I rub the Bottom Butter into her skin and it heals the skin usually by the next diaper change.  There&#x27;s no medicinal smell, just the lovely scent of cocoa butter, and it&#x27;s not greasy.  I would never use any other product on her - it&#x27;s perfect.  And as an added bonus, it&#x27;s not animal-tested.</li>
    <li> The best for your baby care!!!</li>
    <li> I tried Desitin when my son was first born and rashes started right away. The Desitin didn&#x27;t seem to help at all. If anything, I thought it might be the cause of them (we were changing his diaper often, so he wasn&#x27;t sitting in anything for any length of time). A friend recommended Bottom Butter so I tracked it down on Amazon. My son is now 18 mo and I use it with each diaper change. Since we started using this, he has only had one almost diaper rash (some redness that happened when we started not using it at each change). We started back on the bottom butter immediately. The redness was gone by the next day. We started using it again with each change and he&#x27;s been rash free ever since. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the medicinal smell and isn&#x27;t goopy is a nice bonus, too. I am constantly recommending this product.</li>
    <li> As a pro athlete, I find myself in chafing situations that are downright uncomfortable, and often enough flat-out painful.  No matter how well I care for myself, keeping clean, hydrated, and wearing clean athletic wear, I still end up with very sore, red, swollen, and chafed skin between my legs and around my bottom.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of powders and cremes to relieve the pain and reduce the issue but most everything I found didn&#x27;t work for more than a tiny amount of time.  I even tried those \\&quot;slick\\&quot; skin coatings that are supposed to keep you from chafing and had basically no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 6 years ago, I came across Bottom Butter in a small store on a trip down south and gave it a try.  It absolutely solved my problems and I was so relieved to find something that actually worked.  I took that tube with me on all of my training trips, or when I knew I would be walking or standing for long periods.  I kept searching stores where I live out west and never found it...as in NOBODY carries it nor had they heard of it.  How this could be is beyond me as it actually works!  I was relieved to find it here on Amazon and made sure to pick up 2 tubes to have around for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like coco butter and it eliminates rash and chafing quick...in short, Bottom Butter flat out works.</li>
    <li> I used 1 tube of Palmers Diaper Rash Cream for my 1 month baby and it was great: no rash, no other side effects.  One tube will last approximately one month.  Beside the results it also smells very nice, like coconut cookies.</li>
    <li> Both our boys had food allergies that always hit twice - once on the way in, and a horrible rash on the way out.  Each time we ran into a food that lit up our babies&#x27; bottoms, we tried rash cream to give them some quick relief.  Nothing worked better or faster than Palmer&#x27;s Bottom Butter!  Some of the other products (A&amp;D ointment, Desitin, etc.) made them cry as though it stung when applied.  By the time our boys were about a year and a half old, they would calm down after being wiped if we said we were getting the butter out.  It&#x27;s perfect for winter chapped cheeks, too!  Now our youngest is 2 and on the rare ocassion he gets a rash, he asks for the butter.  With our third on the way, you better believe we&#x27;re stocking up on this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other diaper rash creams but I always keep coming back to this one. I like how it smells and how thick it is. I put a layer on plus sprinkle some baby powder every night in my 10 month old&#x27;s diaper before putting her to bed. Desitin is still better for treating rashes but this one works great for preventing.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in drugstores, but it works for adults very well, especially for summer rash.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It is so creamy, but not messy or smelly.  It works to clear up even a bad rash overnight.  When we used to use Desitin on my daughter, we noticed that the rash never seemed to clear up completely.  We finally realized that it was the actual cream that was making her have a rash.  As soon as we stopped using Desitin, it cleared up.  Palmer&#x27;s Bottom Butter is our go-to cream when she gets diaper rash.</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be part of a gift basket for an expecting friend.  I overlooked adding it, so just kept it for myself.  Since I don&#x27;t have kids, I cannot speak to its value related to its intended use, but...&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my feet and it&#x27;s the BEST for dry, winter tootsies!!!  I use it after a shower and apply again before bed.  My feet have never been softer and it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> The diaper rash cream has two different recipes. This one does not have zinc but there is one that does have zinc. I meant to buy the one with zinc but got this instead. I preferred the one with zinc.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice creamy bottom butter. Silky smooth and smells oh so good. It&#x27;s great on those little newborn scratches too!</li>
    <li> It works very well...had a scratch on my hnd that left a lil scar...i put this on twice a week the scar completely gone</li>
    <li> The bottom was red so I used it. It didn&#x27;t work for my baby, it caused more severe rash.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market</li>
    <li> My baby had recurring diaper rash that would go from red to raw in less than 24hrs. I tried every cream available, corn starch, hydrocortisone cream (per pediatrician) and even let baby go diaper free. Nothing seemed to take care of rash or even make it somewhat better. I tried this cream and within one day I noticed a difference. Within a week diaper rash was completely gone. I use daily now for preventive reasons and haven&#x27;t seen a hint of diaper rash since!</li>
    <li> This diaper rash cream is difficult to find but I love it! It is great for the leg rash that often results from cloth diapering.  It mostly rubs into the skin, unlike most diaper rash creams.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a mess and is very much like a lotion but works well.</li>
    <li> I used this on my daughter and always had great results, I put it on one day the next day she good no more rashes. Works very good and I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they don&#x27;t compare to palmers! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Palmers Bottom butter or as my family calls it \\&quot;Butt Butter\\&quot; was in a Palmers \\&quot;new mom\\&quot; sample bag that a friend gave me at my shower.....  I opened it and started using it first.... when I ran out...  none of the other rash creams added up and I missed it terribly....  It was SO hard to find.... and when I finally found a store I had to stalk them to make sure I got one, because they would run out the day that the tubes came in.  It smells SO GOOD and we have not had any problem thus far with diaper rash... She is 11 weeks.  Everyone who changes her comments about how they like it, and ask me how I found out about it.  My friend who gave it to me... had mainly bought it to let me sample the stretch mark cream she loved... when I mentioned it she didn&#x27;t even know it had the diaper rash cream.....</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this for quite sometime.  A friend of mine had used this for years &amp; then it seemed to have vanished off the shelves.  She doesn&#x27;t have a computer &amp; I told her I&#x27;d try &amp; track it down....I was very happy to have found this for her.  Although, I have had no experience with it, my friend was thrilled to have gotten it.  On behalf of her, I thank you, Amazon, you came through again!</li>
    <li> Dont settle for the nasty creams at your local pharmacy or Babies R Us. This stuff is where its at when it comes to clearing up baby butt rashes. Its seriously and overnight fix. Even the worst butt rashes with our two babies lasted less than 48 hours after we used this, while crap like Desitin took a week if it resolved the issue at all. We are so glad we found this!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite for everyday, non-rashy butt cream.  It smells delish! And it goes on slightly damp skin so I don&#x27;t have to wait for his butt to dry after using wet wipes.</li>
    <li> I use this for a moisture barrier on an adult with incontinence issues.  This a good product but I actually liked the previous Smooth Application version better.  It had a less sticky texture, yellow color, and better scent than this new version.  Many websites still picture the old version but deliver this Creamy Application version.  Be sure to ask before placing your order if it matters to you which version you use.  The old Smooth Application has a blue label while the Creamy Application has the pinkish label.  The application type is written on the box under the baby picture.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every night ever since mu son came home from the hospital a year and a half ago :) It doesn&#x27;t have the bad smell some others have</li>
    <li> This stuff is so hard to find in stores, it makes me crazy! I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it and hope they will for a while. This is one of the few diaper creams that does not sting my poor baby&#x27;s rashy bottom. If I apply Desitin to his bottom with a bad rash, he&#x27;ll scream and twist away from me. Using the Palmer&#x27;s never hurts him. I don&#x27;t know how well or how quickly it clears up an existing rash but it does seem to provide a good moisture barrier nonetheless. It also smells great, like cocoa. After I apply it to baby&#x27;s bottom, my hands always feel soft too.</li>
