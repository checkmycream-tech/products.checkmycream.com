<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, but I can already see and feel a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it morning and evening.  I am very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
    <li> I read all 500+ reviews. I am sincerely stumped. I have used this product for  over a month. There is no irritation and it feels fine but I have seen no improvement. No glow. No reduction in pore size or sun spots. Great company. Great service and follow up. I even bought a second bottle while it was on sale because I was so sure it  was a miracle. I have received no compliments on the appearance of my skin. Clearly I will continue to use it and hopefully will be able to give it a better review in the future.</li>
    <li> The lines on my face have softened considerably. I experienceded no drying. Used it twice a day for the past few weeks. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any results..had no smell and consistency of water..I use other vit c serums with results</li>
    <li> I have to use it some more to give a proper review.</li>
    <li> Nice adjunct to daily routine.</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin really benefited from using this. I am 57 and needed a fresher look to my skin and this did it. Really like this and it is so reasonably priced through Amazon. Great customer follow up to answer any questions or concerns which I had none except compliments.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Does not irritate my sensitive skin or dry it out.  Lines, wrinkles and dark spots have faded away.  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve been looking for something to supplement my dr. Perricone products when I run out and don&#x27;t have the hundreds of dollars to renew my supply right away. So I did some research and ended up with some products that I think I might be switching to permanently. This product is one of them. This serum really hydrates my skin and has it looking very good and much younger. I will be replacing my Dr. Perricone &amp;#34;Blue Plasma&amp;#34; with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite so far to all the other Vitamin C serums i&#x27;ve used and i have used at least 8-10!  It&#x27;s not greasy asorbs quickly, feels cool &amp; refreshing, and i do notice a difference when i use it at least 1-2 times day.</li>
    <li> I have used it for only two days.  I think I will love it after using it longer.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product!  My 35 year old daughter has even started using it, wanting her skin to look as good as her 63 year old mom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, make sure to put this on before your moisturizer, let it dry, and then apply moisturizer. It is definitely making a difference in my skin - I feel like it&#x27;s brighter and the tone is more even.</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful. It does soothe and make your skin feel great. With this price, I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Have used it now for only 2 days, and have had no problem with it</li>
    <li> Just started using this product.  I have very dry skin and no wrinkles (yet).  Day one I noticed my skin  seemed much smoother and softer, which is a plus for me.  I would rate this product  5 stars but i have only used it 3 times.  I plan on using this product  daily.</li>
    <li> So far I have not seen any difference in my skin. I am disappointed that this serum has no  orange smell like the other vitamin c serums I have purchased in the past. I have compared it to my hyaluronic serum and it seems exactly the same as what I already have. It also tends to pill when used below other  day and night creams even after letting it soak in  and dry. The packaging is nice as it saves the product from breaking down and eroding like some c products.</li>
    <li> I received the serum yesterday and tried it out this morning. I was a little nervous about the strength of the serum and my reaction to it so I tried a small amount at the beginning. There were no nasty side affects so I smoothed it over my face being careful not to get it near my eyes and was surprised at how quickly it absorbed into my skin. So far, so good. I really hope this works because the Vivete serum I&#x27;ve been using for the past year is way to expensive. Thank you ~ Norma</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week and really see a difference. Diminished wrinkles and smoother skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see further improvement. I&#x27;m 64 years old and have used many other creams. I suggest you follow the advice to use a moisturerized after the serum dries.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I feel like I look 10 years younger!</li>
    <li> 2 Weeks of use and I can see a definite improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> Serums are definitely the way to go and this is one of the more potent of the serums that I&#x27;ve tried so far.  It&#x27;s strong to the point of stinging if used on a freshly microderm abrased face.  None of them stung on a freshly exfoliated face so they are all gentle and good for sensitive skin...but this one is a bit more potent.  It also yielded faster and better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came with an invitation to access a free e-guide book at the time of writing this review.  You are directed to go to a website to download a pdf e-book which seems to be a good combination of detailed instructions on how to use their line of products and more in depth details on secrets to younger looking skin.  I was afraid it would be gimmicky, but it actually has really good information that I was grateful to have.  Not that you couldn&#x27;t find this stuff by spending some time and googling it for yourself, but it was definitely nice to have it all put together nicely in one place.  I like how this company dedicates the time to really educate and help their customers.  They are quickly earning my trust as a skin care provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, problem skin and this product has been perfect for me.  They recommend that you use a moisturizer afterwards, but I just use another serum and I have enough moisture on my face.  I&#x27;m sure for dry skin you really would need to but for my super oily skin, the serums are enough.  I love this product because it&#x27;s clean, fresh, potent, good value for your money, and I saw results within the first week.  My dark spots are fading, skin tone is evening out, acne is kept at bay, fine wrinkles smoothed out and pores are getting smaller.  Seems like a lot, huh?!  That&#x27;s why I love it!  My skin just seems to drink up this serum and is freshly nourished, better able to repair itself and is not so damaged from the sun, makeup and abuse it goes through on a daily basis - which caused all the other problems.  I absolutely love serums and they have now replaced my other products in my skin care regime.  They are clean, clear, don&#x27;t leave a residue, not oily and very nourishing for my skin.  Unlike other serums I&#x27;ve used, this one feels very slippery when I first apply it - but I massage it into my skin and soon it is all gone, leaving no residue, oiliness/greasiness.  My skin does feel a bit tight after, so I apply another serum for light moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is packaged well and the pump works well, delivering a proper, small amount of serum reliably.  I love the clean look of the bottle and it really reinforces the whole clean and clear theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product and this company.  It is so nice to be able to replace my Proactive/Proactive Plus products with these serums which are much more natural, healthier, cleaner, doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t bleach my face towels, and have no harsh chemicals.e now replaced my other products in my skin care regime.

    <li> Just started using this product - so I am not sure about it effectiveness.  But got it very quickly.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin dry, if I&#x27;d known I was supposed to buy other products to make this work, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. Not very good for sensitive skin. Too pricy.</li>
    <li> This made my skin glow. I noticed a difference right away. I have combination skin &amp; it didn&#x27;t make my skin dry but I used moisturizer after applying triple action vitamin c &amp; hyaluronic acid. The seller contacted me &amp; sent advice to use with tips for skin. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Did not see a difference it was like putting water on my face . There was no tightening effect whatsoever . I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars at a plastic surgeon office and saw results immediately . This does not live up to what it&#x27;s suppose to do !</li>
    <li> This serum is a clear gel. It goes on smooth and is absorbed very quickly. I don&#x27;t know if I have seen much difference after using it for a month, maybe a slight decrease in wrinkles overall. This product is a bit pricey, but it has not made me break out like some other products have. I would recommend this product if you have money to spend.</li>
    <li> great service and I love the serum~!!!</li>
    <li> Great product does what the manufacturer says will do. I saw a significant improvement in my skin in 2 weeks after using.</li>
    <li> About the same results as any other product....you think you see changes and then you don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> love this serum.  NOT sticky at all.  My skin is oily so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> A quality product but you need to follow the instructions. When you receive the product it will give you instructions to download an ebook. I did this so that I could find out more about the product. It told me not only about this product but also about the company&#x27;s other products. Now I will be giving a complete review of the product and my dealings with the company. The company was very polite and concerned wanting to make sure I received my product and was happy with it. Now the product warns that it can be very drying. So it instructs you to work up from one pump to what your skin needs. It also tells you to use a moisturizer and as long as you do this you will not have a problem with drying. I followed these instructs and no problems what so ever. I am very sensitive to perfumes and loved that this product had no odor at all. I have sensitive skin and had no bad reactions to this product at all. No redness, drying, tightness, flaking, nothing. My skin felt smooth after applying it and my pores looked smaller. Also redness from old acne scars didn&#x27;t seem as red. Now I&#x27;m writing this review after using this product for nearly a month. Please keep in mind different skin tones, textures and genetics will all factor in how your skin reacts to this product. You may get results faster than I did. Because of my sensitive skin I was reserved in the amount I used slowly building up to 3 pumps.</li>
    <li> i stil use it i have to see the results</li>
    <li> Really helps with face and neck.</li>
    <li> I bought this after looking at many different serums. I finally settled on this brand because it seemed to offer the best blend of ingredients I was looking for. When the package arrived, I was pleased with the shrink wrapped bottle that prevented any leaking during shipping and the size of the container. It was more generous than I was expecting. I&#x27;ve used the serum now daily, since my skin needed the extra attention and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry, or tight, and I can see an improvement in the delicate skin around my eyes already. This is a good product, and with as little as it takes to get results, even used daily this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I am lot sure, the bottle is all white, I can nothing inside means probable light is blocked as it should be. Good price but too early to state results</li>
    <li> This serum feels amazing!! I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my face and try it on! Instantly my pores appeared smaller and skin felt incredibly smoother and tighter. Looking forward to seeing results in a few days time!</li>
    <li> Love this will buy again soon as i need more thanks</li>
    <li> This product has improved my skin a lot.  It&#x27;s decreased my fine lines around my eyes and made the texture of my skin softer and even-toned.  I use it morning and night.  It also goes on under my makeup with absolutely no gumming up like other products I have used.  A little bit goes a long way and it absorbs perfectly with no sticky or greasy feeling.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good hydrating serum for daily use, didn&#x27;t notice a big change in complexion though.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I tried this product but I was very pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I have very fair skin, the kind that gets sunburned when I&#x27;m in the car for 15 minutes without sunscreen. With that being said, this tended to make my skin pink when I applied it for a little while, not sensitive or painful but pink to look at it.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the results. I feel that my skin is more hydrated and smoother, by a lot. I&#x27;m using this product with an exfoliator and drug store moisturizer. My skin is a lot smoother both to the touch and to look at and is something that I would expect from a higher priced product.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product, for me, is that it turns my skin pink. I&#x27;m so fair though that any product that has ingredients that could trigger something, do. However, the pink only lasts for a bit and is easily covered with makeup if I need to go out the door before it dissipates. This is a product that I would definitely buy again, especially since the product spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t take more than a pump to use on the entire face and neck.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after two days! Does cause a bit of drying but keeping your face moisturized does the trick.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice so far and I am shocked at how great my face looks and feels. My pores are reduced and my face is very smooth. I&#x27;m very excited to see the results as I continue the use of this great product.</li>
    <li> I have received and used for four days.  There is no irritation and the serum absorbs quickly.  I am following instructions and using a moisturizer after applying the serum.  It is too soon to tell the improvement but it does seem to &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> This seems like a great product so far.  Nonirritating and dries evenly without an oily feel.</li>
    <li> Really see a difference in my skin with this product!</li>
    <li> I heard about this from a friend, but was told that it was very expensive. I was happy to find it on Amazon for so cheap. I can already see improvements in my skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks now. If you&#x27;re like me I suggest you get this and say good bye to wrinkles and uneven skin tones. The pump system is great also.I think you can control how much you use, which helps it last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this Serum, it&#x27;s clear and goes on smoothly and keeps my skin looking youthful. It says it can dry the skin out, but I&#x27;ve been using a moisturizer with it and haven&#x27;t had any issues with dryness. I think it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> So far this product works wonders for my dark spots left from years of persistent acne. I have tried many products and some work but not as well as this. Can&#x27;t wait to have an even glow for my wedding next weekend.</li>
    <li> great serum and dry quickly and leave great feeling and sure after a month i will leave my feedback and result</li>
    <li> Looks like it working in combination with the derma roller</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and looks clearer after just a few uses!  Definitely noticed less fine lines around my eyes and mouth; and even my pores are smaller!!  I am very impressed with Triple Action Vitamin C Serum. The bottle is a nice size--will definitely last a decent amount of time. you only need a small amount!  The smell is not overpowering either--but rather pleasant!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was afraid this was going to smell bad, as some serums do.  I was pleasantly surprised it is fragrance free.  So far so good.  Just a small amount of tightness around the eye/crow&#x27;s area when I applied it but nothing too bad.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was initially hesitant to purchase this product. I must say that I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, twice daily. My skin looks brighter and feels smoother. Hopefully with continued use I will see even better results.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum  + Hyaluronic for about two weeks and seeing some reduction in fine lines and a more even skin tone.  I have ordered 4 more of the products from VoilaVe and am anxious to try them.  My only complaint at this point is that it takes so long to get the product.  Amazon does NOT even ship my order for at least a week after I place my order, and that seems ridiculious to me.</li>
    <li> just finish the bottle seen some improvement don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again</li>
    <li> My wife has purchased this product on line three times and originally purchased it in Hawaii.  She loves it and says it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this serum to me, and when I tried some of it, I saw that it slipped between my fingers like silk!! It goes on so smoothly, and with a satiny finish.  The next morning, my skin felt nice and soft, and had a kind of glow that I hadn&#x27;t seen on it.  Definitely recommend this product, and I think that the price justifies it. It smells good too!!</li>
    <li> This made my skin feel smoother than ever before! Love this</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how well it works.  However, it feels good when it goes on and so far I have not had a reaction (I have sensitive skin).  Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glides on really easy, like a gel. Absorbs quickly, no burning sensation, skin feels taught but moisturized. Seemingly worth using a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month and haven&#x27;t seen a change.</li>
    <li> This is just what the doctor asked for. I decided to give this a try after poor results from some other brands I have tried, mainly because it made my face dry. A friend recommended this to me, so I thought why not, I have nothing to lose, fast forward two month, I am loving the cream. It really makes my skin feel tighter and bright, I received some great customer service and actually talked with a human not a machine, they answered very promptly, Nice to do business with a real American Company. I will be buying a few for my friends for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, and I believe it is good, but it doesn&#x27;t work with me. Unfortunately after three days I quit trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always has sensitive skin, especially in the areas around my nose and mouth, which has made me try on several different products with no harsh chemicals. I really like this serum because it has no odor and no color, and it absorbs in the skin pretty fast. I used it as directed, one time a day, one pump to cover my face and applying moisturizer right after. At first I felt an itching sensation around my nose and lips, but it eventually stopped. I used my daily moisturizer cream afterwards. Later in that day I realized I had two big red spots on the sides of my mouth, and the skin around the area was dry. I applied more moisturizer and try the serum again the next day. Unfortunately the redness didn&#x27;t stop. At this point, I completely discontinued the use of the serum for three days and I still have dry skin around my mouth. In other areas of my face, like my cheeks and forehead, the serum did make the skin feel smoother and look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Wife says she loves it</li>
    <li> This product has quickly become my favorite skin care product. I definitely get this again and recommend it highly. My skin feels so relaxed. I  wish they had a moisturizer as well as I have very dry skin. I&#x27;m starting to think that I don&#x27;t need a facelift after all...</li>
    <li> The bottle itself is large enough for several months and I do like that what&#x27;s left in the container seems air tight as that&#x27;s important with keeping the Vitamin C effective. Shipping was fast. I have very sensitive skin but this does not break out my skin. It is a serum and can be used morning and night, and I do need moisturizer over it. Makeup seems to go on well over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update once I&#x27;ve used for several months.</li>
    <li> So far there is a slight but noticeable difference in my wrinkles. Definitely worth trying out yourself!</li>
    <li> Just started using it, no change yet....</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS AS DIRECTED FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS AND I AM AMAZED AT THE DIFFERENCE IN MY FACE.  MY SKIN IS SMOOTHER AND MORE EVEN TONED.  ABOVE ALL, I HAVE SEEN ABOUT A 50% DECREASE IN MY &amp;#34;AGE AND WISDOM LINES&amp;#34; AKA&lt;br /&gt;WRINKLES!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but can already see a difference. My skin feels smoother and pores look a bit smaller. It&#x27;s easy to use, the serum has little to no smell and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy. Have only noticed a slight lightening of age spots but will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but, I am so pleased with it, I could shout!!!! It has helped diminish some of the lines around my eyes, and my skin tone is balanced out. In fact, people have commented that I am glowing !  I love the fact that my pores seem smaller. I started seeing results almost immediately, and so did my friends and my family! I would recommend this product to anyone as part of their daily skin care regimen, and I intend to keep it as part of mine!</li>
    <li> I am a 60 year old woman.  As the years go by I have noticed that my skin is dryer, has less elasticity, and looks dull and sallow.  I keep looking for that magic product or products that will help my skin look better.  I am a cancer survivor which has made me more aware of what I put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a hyaluronic product to draw moisture to my skin.  After reading many review on many products I decided to give this one a whirl.  This is a surprising product.  First, this is a US made product which is a huge plus.  It is paraben and alcohol free.  The serum is thin, one pump easily covered my face and neck.. There was no burning or stinging and no odor.  I kind of questioned whether the serum would be effective.  To be honest the results kind of snuck up on me.  After a week or two of use I suddenly became aware that my skin looked fresher and brighter - noticeably brighter and just healthier. Upon closed inspection, I found the fine lines around my eyes seemed diminished as well.  I used the entire bottle, applied it twice daily in the AM and before bed under my night time moisture.  Results were:  my skin was  brighter and fresher , had diminished fine lines, and felt smoother and softer.  I did not find that it impacted my age/sun spots but it may have lightened my skin over all  I wish it had tackled those darn spots.&lt;br /&gt;Here was the real test.  As I often do; I decided to try something else - I think it&#x27;s that grass is green syndrome.  Within about two weeks I noticed that my healthy looking skin was gone!  What!?!  The Triple Action C worked for me and I am going back to it ... as soon as I finish off this other stuff.</li>
    <li> Has been good for my skin tone and fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> i have used 2 bottles of this serum... it works great and overnight... i am in my mid twenties and i had started developing frown lines.. but this serum has completely removed them... i am really happy with this serum..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but Im so thankful for this product. The first time I bought it was last year. I was using it with mico needling and a few other new products. My face was looking amazing but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure it was the serum that was causing the dramatic results. A week ago My aunt asked if I needed anything from Amazon and out of despair I asked for this. My face was at its worst. It looked as though every pore on my face was clogged. I had developed cyst acne 1 almost an inch wide. I would wake up with 5-6 new white heads every morning. My face was just covered in them! Pimples, cysts, and blackheads!!! All of which were very painful. I had scabs everywhere from having to open them up bc the pressure was to much. My plan was to get this then go to the dermatologist for some real medicine. After the FIRST night I woke up and it was almost a miracle!!! Everything was noticeably better by 30%, size of pimples, blackheads, REDNESS!!! The Diminish of redness was probably the most noticeable part. This product works so well for me; instead of dreading washing my face I&#x27;m excited too! I can&#x27;t wait to wake up each morning to see what My skin looks like! This product has saved my skin and I&#x27;ve used everything even Acutane (although that worked well it destroyed my large intestines) I have crohns and I&#x27;m sensitive to medicine developing some sever life treating reactions. I&#x27;m so grateful to have found something natural, good for my skin, safe on my body, that gives great results!!! Thank you Viola V! I&#x27;m so grateful for this products results I&#x27;ve been telling everyone! I just may even put it up on my IG account as well!</li>
    <li> Love this serum awesome The best product , awsome results Will continue to use it It saved my skin on my last trip in Jamaica 😍</li>
    <li> I used several C Serums but I keep going back to this one, Triple Action Vitamin C Serum &amp; Hyaluronic and thats because the product works.  My face looks much brighter and clean. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best facial serum I&#x27;ve ever used and I intend to keep on using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week, after trying the Rosehip oil, since I was so pleased with that. I have tried MANY C-serums, the best of which was when I simply made my own. I decided to try one more brand, and glad that I did. After one week my skin looks fabulous! Much smaller pores, much clearer and smoother complexion all around. I&#x27;m giving away my unused other brands, this is the keeper!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast ship and well packed.  Am using this for the first time but so far am well pleased.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help speed up the healing of PIH (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation) from acne.&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 months and all of my PIH is almost gone. I had several (more than 20) marks on my face (cheeks and jawline).&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of this will go a long way.  It is very thin consistency, a bit thicker than water.  I did not have any drying to my skin with this product but do also use a moisturizer after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My skin looks less tired and saggy after just one week. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the feel but to early to tell if working</li>
    <li> Fills nice on skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too early to say I really, really lije this product. After only a couple of days, I&#x27;ve been told that I&#x27;m glowing. The first time I used the serum my skin felt a little dry but I just applied coconut oil after to add some moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it twice a day.  It is clean and light.  Pulls the skin tight and makes the crinkles around eyes less obvious.  I will buy this product again. It&#x27;s a good one.</li>
    <li> This product did make my face feel &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; but I have not noticed much difference with clearing up dark spots, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this an average rating.  Because I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a vitamin c serum with better packaging.  Since it&#x27;s not supposed to be exposed to air and light, I felt like the dropper bottles were a waste of money.  This bottle keeps the serum protected so I know the serum is good to the last drop!  Plus my skin is brighter and clearer!</li>
    <li> The stuff works great.  Skin brightening and tightening almost immediately.  Good stuff and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Havent noticed any difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin C ingredients.I liked it.Got a great discount and am very happy.I am adding that after using it for a month I still like it.I am experimenting with different vitamin C serums and I am still using this one.I know my skin is not getting any worse and that,for me,is a big deal so it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I was specifically looking for something non-oily for the spring/summer months.  In addition, I&#x27;m getting married in 3 months and want my skin to look it&#x27;s absolute best.  I am very pleased with the results I see so far and plan to continue to use this product.  My skin looks fresh, rejuvenated and shiny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seems to be okay I have only been using for a short while I will update after bottle is gobe.</li>
    <li> As a physician with special interest in wellness and preventive care, skin care is one of often asked questions by my patients. There are many skin care products out there that are doing quite a decent job to help tighten up the skin and reduce the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; of wrinkles, in another word, providing cosmetic result, and are usually selling over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Those that claim to have therapeutic result has to be able to &amp;#34;do something&amp;#34; to the skin and they usually contain ingredients with a Vitamin A derivatives (such as retinoic acid) which increase skin turnover and ehnance the collagan.  The mildest forms are allowed to be sold over the counter, the more potent forms are all prescription only.  It&#x27;s oaky to start with the milder form and work your way up to more potent forms as guided by your physician.&lt;br /&gt;I have known Vitamin C as a topical agent to nuture our skin for some time but in no mood to spend a fortune for myself or recommend that to my patient. I came across this product while researching on Vitamin C topical and figure it worth $20 to give the products a chance.  A week into the process, I found it does give the apperance of tightening skin.  I use a small amount of this as a beginning foundation in addition to a mixture of retinoic acid and moisturizer, both of which, I have been using for a while.  I will continue to use Vitamin C topical and gives feedback to those that show might show interest in following it.&lt;br /&gt;And... please don&#x27;t forget to apply a strong SPF facial cream during day time, as the sun is the one that did most of the damage to our skin besides aging in the first place.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. I have seen my fine lines disappear and skin tighten from aging.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product so far. I love this serum. I have recently reordered this, and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, I have not noticed any changes as of yet. :-(</li>
    <li> I have been needing a Vitamin C Serum. After some research I was led to this product and I determined that it would be best for my face. I have been using it am and pm on a clean face and following it up with a moisturizer after it is completely dry. The texture is great, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue on the face. No smell which is a huge plus. Good sized bottle and I am impressed with the results!</li>
    <li> Am seeing a lightening in dark spots and a more even skin tone</li>
    <li> Using for a month now and not sure it&#x27;s done anything for me. I use it first thing on my face, when coming out of the shower, it dries quickly when you put it on.  Then I use the Rosehip Oil then St Ives Facial Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again, but figure it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. It works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for one week and can already tell a huge difference in my face, eyes and neck. I would give this product a five. Highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use about 2 pumps (about twice what is recommended) but this serum has almost completely eliminated my brown spots and in conjunction with my spf15 moisturizer has made me look almost 10 years younger!!  its light and not sticky like some serums can be.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I noticed a significant difference in my skin within one week of using the vitamin C serum. My pores are smaller and the texture of my skin is smoother. The serum is light and absorbs quickly into the skin. I expected it to sting (so that I knew it was working), but it had a pleasant feel and I saw the effects within days! Once I realized it should be used along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for maximum effectiveness, I started using that as well. My dark circles are gone and my skin is more hydrated. I notice a drastic difference if I stop using them for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying these now to try while they are offered at such a huge discount. I would love to become a loyal customer, however, if the price is increased above $45, I will have to discontinue use and find another excellent product that is affordable.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I did a lot of research on topical Vitamin C and did a lot of comparison of Vitamin C products before I ordered this, as I am not a person who falls for hype, and there&#x27;s a LOT of hype when it comes to skin care products.  I felt pretty confident when I ordered this, and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know that while I&#x27;m 58 years old, I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. My dermatologist says I have the skin of a 40-year-old (Now if she&#x27;d kindly lend me her body, I&#x27;d be grateful!). My siblings say I finally inherited some GOOD genes. Whatever the reason, I want to keep my skin looking good. This product is a great start. It absorbs quickly and effortlessly into my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate. I don&#x27;t know that this is recommended, but I even use it under my eyes without inflammation. So while I can&#x27;t say I had a huge decrease in the appearance of wrinkles, I CAN say after a week of use, I noticed my skin seemed clearer and more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle didn&#x27;t last me as long as some commenters have indicated, but that&#x27;s because I use this on the back of my hands and my neck, and I use it twice a day without fail.I just ordered my second bottle. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried Voila Ve Triple Action Vitamin C Serum to daily moisturize my skin and to prevent from getting wrinkles.  Youth doesn&#x27;t last forever, but I&#x27;m working hard to maintain it for as long as possible.  The bottle is attractive, and with just one pump, it dispenses the right amount of serum to cover my entire face.  My face feels refreshed and smooth.  I like that it came with a free e-book and delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + HA delivers as promised.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple other vitamin C serums in the past and was disappointed.  This product is unique in that it delivers non-sticky AND non-greasy moisture.  The serum didn&#x27;t sit on the top of my skin but actually penetrated into it.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find a serum that actually sinks into your epidermis.  If the serum doesn&#x27;t get below that top layer of skin it&#x27;s useless.  Not only does this serum provide the moisture to keep your skin soft and supple, it also gives your face a nice healthy glow.  I&#x27;ve noticed that use of this serum has diminished or lessened the look of fine lines around my eye area.  I also use the serum on my neck.  I don&#x27;t think this product has fillers like parabens in it because it didn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause me to breakout, like the other couple other vita-c serums I tried in the past.  I&#x27;m happy I finally found a product that works.</li>
    <li> I used VoilaVe Triple Action Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum  daily,I also have sensitive skin  and works well with all types of skin. The serum will not clog pores &amp; does not contain parabens or alcohol. After the first wash I was able to see my skin brighter! It diminished my lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for awhile and I like that it does not clog my pores. A lot of the times I will use products like these and I will get a ton of breakouts when I first start using it. That didn&#x27;t happen with this serum!!</li>
    <li> The delivery was agreed days I feel satisfied with the good product entrega..muy me is of great help for what I practice</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of vitamin C serums and lotions over the years, and this is the only one I can give a positive review on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for several days now, and my face feels great!  This product gets immediately absorbed in to your skin and makes your face feel soft and refreshed.  My face feels less dry (and I live in the Rockies, so our air is quite dry)!  I felt minor tightening, but nothing uncomfortable and the fresh dewy appearance of my skin is such a huge bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With other vitamin c serums the products felt sticky and sat like a thick layer on top of my skin.  This product was completely opposite of that.  It was smooth and absorbed immediately.  With those other products sometimes they had an unpleasant odor, others had very strong scents.  This product had no noticeable scents, which I find particularly nice as I don&#x27;t have to worry about mixing scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my experience with this product is very positive and I am looking forward to how my skin continues to feel as we get thru this cold dry winter!  I will most definitely keep using this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for producing such a high quality product that makes my face feel luscious!!</li>
    <li> aftwr using two times day for about 2 weeks I note that fine lines are less noticeable. I wil check back n another two weeks. Rhanks</li>
    <li> This is the first time purchasing a product like this for me.  I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s now, and happened to notice that I&#x27;m developing some &amp;#34;crows feet.&amp;#34;  I spent some time doing some research, and found this product.  It was well reviewed, and seemed like it would help with what I wanted it to.  It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but my skin is noticeably softer, and feels smoother as well.  I&#x27;ll continue using this and I&#x27;m looking forward to more great results.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this serum.  I have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.  This is a full size bottle - no little trial size! - and it is working for me.  No breakouts and it feels really nice and light!!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, absorbs quickly with no flakes and hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin even in the winter. Yes I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product a week now and so far I can not see any effect on the lines or dark spots. I think my skin feels a little bit smoother thought and I like that there is no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have waited a full 4 weeks to write this review. I am mixed race American Indian, Italian, Spanish and it has been very hard to find a product that my skin likes and works on it. After 2 weeks there was a reduction in poor size which has lead to less blemishes. At week 3 there was a lifting of the skin above my eye and the marionette line around my mouth. That was a great surprise since that made me crazy. I love the product, easy to use, no odd smell or sticky feel. I am hooked. Thanks VoilaVe!</li>
    <li> Really noticed results with this serum, especially after  the first week of use. It evened out discolouration and really refined skin texture, my skin looks plumper and is glowing! Better than most serums on the market and great value too.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle of this because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  After only 3 weeks, I am seeing improvement in the skin on my face and my chest area.  My skin has more brightness and clarity, and my lines have softened a little bit.  There is a dewiness to my face that I&#x27;ve never had.  I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.  I have sensitive skin, but have not had any problems with it.  You only need to use a tiny bit twice a day to see improvements.</li>
    <li> I like the moisture this product gives. However,  I don&#x27;t like how thinish the liquid is. I wish it was a little more consistent . I will continue to use the product and see how it develops.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> VoilaVe vitamin C absorbs into your skin without causing any reddness or stinging. I even put it under my eyes then I apply Bliss Youth As You Know, night cream or day cream. I love the way it feels right after I do my microdermabrasion. The price is very reasonable and it does not cause any break outs. It does take about 15 days to notice a difference in minor wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great product, will take time before I see how effective it is but the texture and feel on your skin is awesome. Great under make-up application, helps hold mineral powder to skin without causing it to clump in areas. Light and non-oily.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels on my skin.  Refreshing not oily.  And I think my skin is brighter after using it.</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin C Serum!!</li>
    <li> Have not used this long enough to see results...Hopefully soon. Smells a little odd...</li>
    <li> I read a out triple action Vitamin c in a magazine. The Beauty editor was touting its benefits.  I researched the product. And Vola Ve was the top rated brand. I highly recommend this terrific product. I actually bought one for my dear friend.  Try it, it works!!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C is working great for me. My face is smoother. I had bumps on my face and they are almost all gone. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and my friends have complimented me on my skin. My lines on my forehead are less visible. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!! Will be buying this Vitamin C again!</li>
    <li> I have been using VoilaVe vitamin c serum for several days now, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with its performance. First of all, I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a large bottle when it arrived! I use this serum every morning and every night, and I can already see that my two sun spots on my face are lightening. My skin is so soft and smooth and feels like velvet. After removing my makeup every evening, my face is very tight and dry and I despise using oily lotion on my face. I struggle with adult acne and I can NOT use oily products. This serum makes my face feel moisturized and soft without the overpowering oil that most facial lotions have. If I could give this product ten stars I would. I am overjoyed to have found such an amazing product at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It did tighten my skin to look pretty good was a little drying but with some cream applied after it dried, it was better</li>
    <li> I use this first and then a moisturizer and it feels really great.  A great item at a great price.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;The company delivers spectacular customer service! They follow up to ensure customers are getting desired results. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at the actual size-I was expecting something much smaller.The tiny age spot on my cheek is still there after 1wk of use but I feel confident that the product is working,however I think it&#x27;ll take a little bit of time to see actual results\\&quot;. Product is easy to apply and it feels like the skin absorbs it immediately which is really great! Will post an updated review in future after 4 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back with an update after using this product for more than 4wks. I had so much hope in this serum and originally bought 4 bottles so I will have enough to last me for months. I really wished it would work but unfortunately, there&#x27;s no improvement to my skin. Instead, it has made me develop wrinkles on my forehead and my facial skin feels scaly and sandy...really rough almost like sand paper. I&#x27;m in my forties and prior to using this didn&#x27;t have wrinkles but wanted something to keep me from wrinkling, brighten my skin and help remove the really tiny age spot on my face. After almost 2 months of use, the age spot is still there and my face didn&#x27;t brighten at all. What I can conclude from this experience is that this product is not for everyone and especially not for me and for those that honestly think it works for them, that&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Wont buy this again, it really dried out my skin and I saw no difference at all even after using 2 bottles. If you really want to see a difference purchase Dr.Denese serum, that is the best stuff on earth! I immediatley noticed my skin was softer and smoother without that oily feeling and pores did not clog, please save your money, this is truly a gimmick.</li>
    <li> I have yet to see a big difference although I see my pores are less visible.</li>
    <li> This is my first try at using Vitamin C serum.  It goes on smooth, easy, without any odor.  After using this for only 4 days my pores are less visible.  I have always taken good care of my skin and look forward to using this serum for added benefits.</li>
    <li> This is my second order and will order again when it&#x27;s time to refill. I love this product. It really delivers what it promises. My husband and I are hooked.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 6-8 weeks and I&#x27;m finally seeing results (or at least I think I am). It is very easy to use and should be used twice a day.  My problem is that I am a smoker and studies have shown that smoking is not good for your skin..I would recommend this product to a non smoker.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a short period and results really show up after four to six weeks though I like&lt;br /&gt;The feel of it and will recommend it</li>
    <li> Works great and no irritation from it. I have sensitive skin so I always worry about that. I really like the seller too. I have purchased other items from them and always great.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It is not at all greasy and it is very lightweight. I put it on daily and after a couple of weeks it seems like my skin looks better- more youthful with a little glow. My skin does not like most moisturizers or vitamin serums for the face because they clog my pores and make my face sweat, this feels like I am wearing nothing, and for a decent price.</li>
    <li> My skin is greatly improved since using this serum. I love the results.</li>
    <li> When you look up what the best skin care is for aging, you get a very expensive Serum! So I looked around for the 2 ingredients that this really expensive serum was, and Voila -Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid are both in this affordable product. Very happy with it, and I&#x27;m on my second order! Actually I am on my third order. I really like this product and will continue with it!</li>
    <li> &amp;quot;LOVE IT&amp;quot;!!!!&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; I know there,s a million product&#x27;s  out there that claim you gonna look 15&lt;br /&gt;in aweek!!!&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Not gonna happen&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;...&lt;br /&gt;Now if your looking for a great product??That really help,s make a difference!, Look no&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;further&amp;quot;..I started using Triple Action about a year ago..I&#x27;m  more then impressed with the results. .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50,s, and no I don&#x27;t  want to look 20! I just want to look healthy and the best I can.&lt;br /&gt;My photos are on Instagram..under&amp;quot; Bert Bell&amp;quot;..&lt;br /&gt;Warmly: Bert Bell...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Been using it over a year--and it really works.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, no irritation, its light. you can put your make up on after apply it. I using it more than 2 years. I think Vitamin C works better for Asian skin more than Retin A.</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended by a friend... I have been using it for about&lt;br /&gt;10 days and waiting for the same wonderful result she had...  I&#x27;ve already ordered it&lt;br /&gt;for another friend... and telling others about it.</li>
    <li> loved it. cannot afford right now</li>
    <li> Extra benefit. This is amazing on wasp\hornet bites, and better than things made for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Since using the vitamin C serum, my skin tone has improved drastically. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective and reasonably priced face serum.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but when my other one is gone I will - can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> Started using this a few moths ago. I am not very good about washing my face or applying this daily, but my skin is definitely brighter, smoother, and younger-looking. Will keep ordering it! At first I did notice my facial hairs were not as coarse, though that effect is somewhat limited.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum has everything I was looking for!  20% strength (versus some that are only 10 or 15%), 3 different variations of Vitamin C allowing it to remain stable - and therefore effective - longer (shelf life is 2 years!), the airless, double layer pump, not only keeps air and light out (two killers of viable Vitamin C), but you&#x27;re sure to get ALL of the product from the container making it more cost effective than others, and the Hyaluronic Acid, which provides moisture to the skin.  I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks now morning and night, and have experienced NO irritation, NO breakouts, NO dryness or flaking (I always apply a light moisturizer over the serum).  The product is made right here in the USA and after purchasing, I received an email from Susan, the Co-Founder of VoilaVe, thanking me for purchasing the serum and welcoming any feedback or questions I had.  That to me shows the company has integrity and a genuine interest in their customers.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum for about a year now and I love the product.  I have seen dramatic changes in my skin from using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other vitamin C serums among other things in the past and nothing works like this one. Starting out, I had combination acne-prone skin. I was even on multiple prescription medications for acne but they were all so drying. I started using this (so far it has been 2 weeks) and I can&#x27;t begin to tell you the difference it has made. My face has completely cleared up, the dryness went away, and I am GLOWING! This little bottle packs a huge punch.</li>
    <li> Light weight, orderless formula. Feels good on the skin. Isn&#x27;t oily. Apply before moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Just bought with the pure Hyraluronic Serum and used together creates a stunning look and feel!  I just received Belotero injections around my eyes and folds(pure Hyraluronic Acid) and these two products just enhance the outcome of volume and hydrated skin!  Thank you!!!  Do NOT get fooled by other overpriced prducts; these two are the BEST.</li>
    <li> I am the queen of , &amp;#34;if they tell me it will get rid of wrinkles, reduce fine lines, make you look younger, more rested, etc. I am buying it. Well, let me tell you it is all they promised and more, I can now go without foundation.....blush, mascara, eyeliner, and off I go.  WOW - and WOW.  Thank you Triple Action Vitamin C Serum - thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  It does not burn like other Vitamin C products I&#x27;ve tried and it has somewhat soothed my light case of facial rosacea.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any film on my skin either which I&#x27;ve also noticed with other Vitamin C serums.  So far I&#x27;m very, very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> my skin is smoother and lines have softened is just 3 weeks of twice a day use. I plan to continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does what it says. It&#x27;s not overly greasy or anything. Hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts and has made my skin softer.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Already noticed reduction on fine lines and red spots.&lt;br /&gt;Skin tone is even and I&#x27;m loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll surely keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum...after a week it is feeling really nice...soft but firmish...</li>
    <li> ive been using like it says and i dont really see a differance.  i was expecting so much more. :(</li>
    <li> I am 28 years old. I have not noticed any improvements to my skin other than giving me acne so I discontinued the product. I ended up giving my bottle to my mom. She really loves the product because of how it makes her face feel and she has noticed slight improvements under her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service! Susan contacted me directly via email and asked for my feedback about the product.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference after a month. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have always used serums on my skin in order to fight free radicals and wrinkles, but I was very interested to try a Vitamin C serum.  This product worked perfectly!  It went on very easily and has no fragrance, which is great.  After a few days of using it in the morning and evening, I could already see a difference.  My skin was smoother, clearer, and I had less fine lines around my eyes.  Also, I use moisturizer at night, but during the day I didn&#x27;t need to use any, because this product really sinks in and does a wonderful job moisturizing.  As an added bonus, there is a web address for a free ebook about the Eight Secrets to Younger Looking Skin.  Although the ebook was a freebie, it had excellent content, including a detailed section about which chemicals to avoid when choosing skin-care products.  All in all, I thought this serum was a bargain, considering all of the benefits it has.  Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few times, but I really like it.  It absorbs and makes my skin feel like velvet.  As far as effectiveness, I have to give it a little longer trial time, but I believe it will be a positive experience.</li>
    <li> Thank you for giving me the opportunity to thank you for marketing this absolutely wonderful product: Triple Action Vitamin C Serum which I received a few days ago.  I already noticed a remarkable difference in my skin - so much softer and glowing.  I just love this serum and will definitely use it in my daily moisturizing routine.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this stuff! I have previously tried individual serums of all 3 key ingredients and did like each of them... This made it SO much easier since they are combined in this one lotion and it saved me a lot of time. I did read that if you use too much that it can cause dry skin but so far i havent had any issues with my skin being dried out. I love the way it makes my skin feel and look. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new facial treatment!</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a multi-function serum for so long! Can&#x27;t wait to receive this product!</li>
    <li> The bottle leaked all over and the box carrying it was even wet. As yet I haven&#x27;t checked to see how much of the serum I lost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks with Hyaluronic Acid Serum and my skin is really soft, I love the way it feels. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s smoothed out my skin tone or makes me look younger but, I&#x27;m going to keep using it.I would and did recommend to my sister,</li>
    <li> buy all three its worth every penny and then some. see the difference almost instantly.</li>
    <li> I do like this product.  It has the components in it that I have been looking for.  A little goes a long way as well.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;It does have all the important ingredients my Dr. recommended I use.</li>
    <li> I liked it but just wasn&#x27;t enough to find out if it would really work.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I&#x27;ve had a rash on my cheeks for about two years... I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and it has been gone since I started using it. My skin looks flawless. I use argan oil afterwards every morning. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Goes on very easily, does not dry out.  Having only been using a short while.  I am 68, so have wrinkles.  I&#x27;m sure I have to use it longer to see any results.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price</li>
    <li> I love this product! I especially love the lightweight feel of the serum, and the fact that it&#x27;s clear in color makes me feel assured I&#x27;m not putting anything on my skin with dyes or perfumes. As soon as it soaks in, I can&#x27;t even tell I have anything on my skin; it&#x27;s wonderful! I can already tell my pores are smaller and my fine lines are less noticeable. I follow the serum with my spf &amp; oil free moisturizer. Voila!</li>
    <li> Lately I have noticed that my face has started to look dim. I don&#x27;t really know how else to say it, but there was just something off about my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I researched and found out that vitamin C could be just the thing I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product because of the high reviews. After trying this serum I am convinced that it could help anyone who wants their skin to feel smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is the fact that it goes on so smoothly with no bad smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been really enjoying this product. It has served several purposes for me. I have always been self-conscious about my dry skin particularly on my face. This serum is very lightweight and moisturizes my face well. Only two small drops of liquid from the pump are needed. A little goes a long way. It is unscented and non-greasy. That is very important to me in a facial product. It goes on smoothly and leaves no residue. Another plus in my book. In the mornings after I wash my face and allow it to dry, I apply the serum. Then I apply my makeup. The serum enhances my foundation allowing full coverage. In the evenings, I wash my face again and allow it to dry. I apply the serum and enjoy the slight sensation the product produces as it does its job. As a 40+ woman, I am aware of how my skin is changing. I really feel like the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum is working well and giving my face the nutrients it needs.</li>
    <li> After watching a Dr. Oz special on anti-aging regimens, I began a search for a pure vitamin C serum. I found this and based on the reviews decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I love about the product:&lt;br /&gt;- I noticed a difference almost overnight. My pores seemed a bit smaller than they did the day before, and I&#x27;ve noticed over extended use (at least once daily for almost 2 months) the &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; skin on my face tends to come off easier during exfoliation. Since I began using this product, I&#x27;ve received compliments on my complexion (which almost never happens because I suffer from acne), and my skin overall seems a bit tighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;- Although the amount is only 1 fluid ounce, you literally only need one drop/pump for your entire face and neck. So far it&#x27;s been lasting and I use at least once in the morning every day, and sometimes at night.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not smell or leave any kind of residue on my face whatsoever (no grease, no oil, nothing to make you feel like your pores are clogged). Once it dries, you forget you ever put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick tip:&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to moisturize after it dries. Especially if your skin is prone to breaking out and you have any kind of anti-acne treatment (face wash, cream, etc.), you want to be especially sure that you&#x27;re moisturizing because by itself this can dry out your skin if overused or if used with any acne treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery/Packaging/Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;-Delivery was rather quick, it arrived before the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;-Packaging is nice, it looks and feels like a quality product before it&#x27;s opened.&lt;br /&gt;-Customer Service is great. They have followed up with me on several occasions (without my initiating the conversation) just to see how I&#x27;m enjoying the product, to provide me with some tips, and to ask that if I enjoy the product to please leave a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;Normally if a vendor asks me to leave a review, I&#x27;m a little turned off by it, but this company seems like a relatively new company that sincerely believes in its product.  I feel confident that if I was having any kind of problem with their product, they would be very quick to resolve the issue.  Moreover, after using the product for nearly two months, I sincerely believe in this product too and that is why I&#x27;m taking the time to leave this review.  Oh, and on a cool little side note, after your purchase the vendor emails you a discount code for a percentage off on your next purchase from them. I know I will be using it on my next order when my current bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence:&lt;br /&gt;Seeing positive reviews always helps my decision when I&#x27;m stuck between items, so I hope that my review or rating has helped someone else make their decision to try this product. I would check with the vendor if you have any questions, because they are very, very responsive and enthusiastic to get the word out about their product and to help customers in any way they can.relatively new company that sincerely believes in its product.

    <li> I have been using this along with Ultima Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a little over 2 weeks. I am seeing a difference in my skin tone and the deepness of my wrinkles. Also my pores look smaller. I hope the improvement continues to get even better. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different Vitamin C serums and while it&#x27;s not a miracle, this Vitamin C Serum works great.  I have extremely dry skin and my skin is not near as dry as it was a couple of months ago.  I do believe this serum performs just as well and probably even better than a $100 serum I&#x27;ve purchased from a high end store.  The other serum never helped with my dry skin.  My skin is extremely soft now and my foundation seems to last longer and I don&#x27;t have to use near as much foundation as I once did.  My only concern is will the product remain stable when you get toward the bottom of the bottle.  Vitamin C serums have a tendency to break down fast and then stop working.  I will definitely re-purchase this one because I feel you get your money&#x27;s worth on this one under $30 versus $50-$100 for other brands.  Susan does contact you from time to time which is hard to find in this day and time.  Most companies never reach out to you asking how the product is working for you.  Please don&#x27;t expect this or any product to be as good as any injection or plastic surgery.  I would also say you will need to use this product 6 months - 1 year before you might notice softening of some fine lines.  After all, no one gets wrinkles overnight and you&#x27;re not going to erase them overnight either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by this, it works fantastic at fading facial scars!!! I also love that there isn&#x27;t any citric acid in this, which is a hard thing to find when your allergic.</li>
    <li> Something is not right with the reviews on this product. There has been much made in the press lately of people buying 5-star reviews. I know Vit C and I know hydraulic acid. This is like water on your face. There is simply no legitimate explanation for the overwhelming number of five-star reviews. I am reporting this to Amazon.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this wonderful product!!  The difference it makes for my skin has been exciting.  It&#x27;s smoother, firmer and more even toned.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> After one application, my skin looked more vibrant and my face looked less tired.&lt;br /&gt;Also, little red splotches I&#x27;d had for two months disappeared overnight - couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> My face looks clearer and brighter since I used this product. Great under make up. I will purchase it again</li>
    <li> I am using this in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am impressed with the results so far after only 2 weeks</li>
    <li> not only did the product help my skin but I recieved 2 emails and a phone call checking up on it&#x27;s performance. I have never had that happen before with any other product bought on amazon so I was really pleased with the support from the company. just ran out so I am back again to purchase my second bottle. I reccomend this to anyone with dry skin or acne prone skin of which I have both.</li>
    <li> I started to use the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum about a month ago, I love it and it works.&lt;br /&gt;My friends asked me &amp;#34;what did you do to your face? It looks so good, and you have no more lines!&amp;#34; When I told them I use the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum, they were amazed. You don&#x27;t need to put too much on, just a bit. If you want to get rid of lines, wrinkles and to look younger, I would recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I just purchased from amazon because it was a great deal; however,  I have used before and enjoyed how moisturized my skin was.</li>
    <li> It has hyaluronic acid, but I&#x27;m not sure how much Vitamin C it has. It doesn&#x27;t taste sour, doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, and it hasn&#x27;t gone bad yet (yellowed) as all Vitamin C products eventually do. My skin is pretty sensitive so I&#x27;d expect some tingling, redness, peeling, but nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll finish the bottle as an expensive moisturizer, and will make my own vit. C serum from here on out.</li>
    <li> Absorbs easily, but watery. Good to use after an aggressive facial.</li>
    <li> A little early, yet.  But I&#x27;m trusting its claims and applying prayers of faith, as I use it.  Jesus took every consequence of all of our sins on His body and I&#x27;m using it to get rid of those tiny lines caused by my former smoking habit.&lt;br /&gt;In a sense, it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;Faith Serum.&amp;#34; :)  Stay tuned...</li>
    <li> I did receive it, and although it is too early to tell ....I will say that I notice that there is itching of the skin in some places where I use this formula..but I am going to continue for a little while longer in hopes that it will work on some of these wrinkles...(I bought 2 because it got such great reviews, but we will see......I said it is ok, but I only did that so that this would enable me to send this review....but so far have not seen any improvement</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 45 year old mother. She has visible wrinkles around her eyes, and she has tried many skincare products before. None of them were effective. I was given a discount for this serum, and maybe this may help my mother out. She started using this serum three days ago, applying twice a day. Nothing has happened so far, but i will update in two weeks with results.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product. I feels good on my skin and absorbs immediately. I like the way it controls my oily skin and I can use it with my regular moisturizer. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I decided to order this serum. After a 2 hr online hunt for the perfect serum to use with my Derma Roller, I found this. It was everything I was looking for. My face feels smooth and lifted, and being 44, those are important things. It only takes a drop, so a little goes a long way. My suggestion is to use this product after Derma Rolling your face and neck, it makes the serum more absorbent, and the rolling stimulates the production of collagen and the elasticity of your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Triple Action Vitamin C Serum.  The first one lasted a long time (since September &#x27;14) since one only needs a few drops at a time and the bottle is well designed to keep the product fresh and to give you every last bit of serum. This product is strong: take the manufacturer&#x27;s advice and increase your usage gradually.  This serum will, over time, improve the skin&#x27;s appearance.  P.S.--I purchased both bottles with my own money.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of using vitamin c directly on the skin.  It is very nourishing.  My skin is damaged by the municipal water -specifically the poison, non-body useable mine waste fluoride in the water.  I was hoping tat is serum would help repair the damage.  Unfortunately, it burned my skin.  I still use it on the tougher parts of my neck and like the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that Im so happy I found.  It does what it promises...  I love it !!!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this product.  It actually works and I&#x27;ve tried many things.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works.  I am 62 with the usual sun damage and some wrinkles.  This product has actually reduced the appearance of the wrinkles. I have tried many other products but none have worked except this one.  I just use one pump in the morning and one pump in the evening.  I can&#x27;t say it has lightened the sun spots but at least they have not gotten any darker.</li>
    <li> My skin feels soft moisturized i love it ^__^ i will continue using it!</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin C serum by VoilaVe. It glides on easily, absorbs quickly and completely and really seems to have help improved the texture of my skin. It leaves my face feeling smoother, moisturized and it seems to be working to reduce the fine lines in my skin. I really like the way the serum is dispensed. I feel I have more control and less of a mess than you do when using serum from a dropper type bottle.</li>
    <li> I was recently recommended by my dermatologist to look into a Vitamin C serum to help with my dry skin. I tried the clinical route by using creams he prescribed but they either didn&#x27;t work or made my skin more dry. That was when he recommended we try the natural mineral route. I looked through several different serums on Amazon when I cam across this one. I ordered the product and received it within 2 days! I have been using it for a week now and already have a SIGNIFICANT difference in my skin! It has a very light scent and glides on so smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy and absorbs fairly quickly. I use it before bed after a shower. By the morning my face looks so much brighter! It evens out my complexion and even helps my horrible Rosacia!!! I can&#x27;t believe I did not know about this product sooner :( Friends and family have also noticed the difference in my skin and a classmate even asked me if I was pregnant because I was radiating! LOL. This product really truly works. I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product</li>
    <li> I love how lightweight the serum is. I really feel my skin was much better after using the Vit C</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of this serum and have noticed my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> I used this serum for my over 60 face and it works well for anti aging. Use it with a vitamin C moisturizer and you get good results. I will continue to use this,</li>
    <li> I use a lot of VoilaVe products. I have been very happy with each and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I supplement my face routine with the vitamin C serum which keeps my skin looking healthy and bright.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with any of their products. They work. Your face will thank you by looking awesome.</li>
    <li> I am now on my 3rd bottle of this wonderful vitamin C serum,  It has done wonders for my skin, every morning after cleansing I use this product a few drops  only does face and neck, glides on and dries quickly, then I apply my moisturizer...my skin is so soft and glows with radiance..I never want to be without this vitamin c product it is the best I ever tried!</li>
    <li> As always the product was received well within the promised time frame. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few months now and have noticed better texture and color. I will definitely continue using it. Very happy.</li>
    <li> **This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a Vitamin C rich product as a recommendation after a facial. My skin is typically normal to dry. I used this product after cleansing and toning but before moisturizing both morning and evening. I used one pump on my face and neck. Within the first full day of use, my cheeks started turning red and developed dry patches. I thought it was just the first time use and decided to continue to use it for a few more days. However, the redness and dryness got worse and I developed a couple of pimples. Needless to say I had to stop using it. The reviews for this seem to be so good. Maybe just wasn&#x27;t made for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Shipping was excellent, I have become addicted to Amazon. The ease of ordering, ease of the website, and everything is guaranteed! The product is wonderfull, people used to say I look tired, yesterday my boss said, Wow you look like you slept well last night! Yes!! I have only been using it for a week! I am over 50 and gravity has taken its toll, haven&#x27;t seen wrinkles disappear yet but, I hope with continued use I will. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> It is easy to be hesitant of anything that promises to help with having smoother and clearer skin that also has no scent but this one does just that! Within the first week of use my face is feeling and looking better than it has in awhile and it has even diminished a few of the wrinkles that I was pretending didn&#x27;t exist yet. I was honestly surprised not only that it worked so quickly but as to how well it worked too!</li>
    <li> It took about a week and a half  for me to see any results.  I noticed that my skin felt more hydrated with the serum than with just my moisturizer alone.  I was hoping to see some of my sun spots fade but nothing so far for me.  My pores do look smaller, so I would recommend this to those looking to minimize the appearance of large pores and hydrating skin without that greasy oily feeling.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product so far. It is a clear gel that spreads well, I just need to pump once to get enough, so it should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it dries on the skin and only once I didn&#x27;t apply anything afterwards. In the morning after my skin was not dry, but I prefer to follow with a moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t feel so dry (it feels clean-dry after applying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel my skin firm and bright.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but I really like it.  I love serums and I have been using hyaluronic acid for a long time now.  That’s what I was going to order when I saw that this particular serum also contained vitamin C. Perfect!  I was hooked.  Even after using it a week, I can see slight changes on my face and hands.  Yes, I use the product on my hands as well in the hopes of holding off on those age spots I’m going to get.  I know they are coming.  I don’t have many spots now, but I was told that vitamin C goes a long way in lightening them.  I’m willing to give it a try.  I have a feeling I will be reordering this product a lot.</li>
    <li> WOW! This stuff is crazy good! I am 57 years young and am seeing more lines than ever and never really used any type of wrinkle reducer faithfully because I never saw results. With this, I see results! This serum is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> Great serum i received for discounted price will buy again</li>
    <li> After using it just 4 weeks, my wrinkles are not as visible. The skin of my face is so soft and smooth, the tone is more even. Good part of it is the firmness of the skin, the pores are way less visible. I&#x27;m so happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone with wrinkles and pores problem.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this Serum.  Within one week of using this product, my skin glowed so much that my daughter complimented me on my &#x27;flawless&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a black woman in the 50-60 age group.</li>
    <li> Best thing to have in a girls daily routine. It works well when you happen to develop pimples. this baby reduces those pimples within 1 week. plus it help with my complexion. not bad of this triple action serum. im sure to buy it again once i run out of my first bottle.</li>
    <li> Went with the Amazon reviews when looking for a Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid combo. Read a lot about this combination of ingredients but wanted something my ultra-sensitive skin could handle. Love the product and the results I&#x27;m seeing so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that it&#x27;s impossible to see how much I have left. Thankfully I have Amazon Prime. When I sensed the pumper was starting to send me air I ordered immediately. I ordered an extra in case of emergencies too!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only about a week.  I love how lightweight it feels on my skin, not at all oily. I use it in the morning and can easily apply make-up over it and then again in the evening.  I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 wks so far... haven&#x27;t really seen any difference with my fine lines or with the hyperpigmentation I have. It does make my skin feel softer though lol. Not really sure how other ppl are getting results in a wks time.. but I will wait a few more wks and see if it gets any better for me.</li>
    <li> It seems to make me skin too dry.  I will keep trying it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I got these 5 days ago and it has been the miracle i needed to get smooth skin. It literally smoothed out my skin in 2days. I have oily face and that has also reduced, my skin is more even. I will surely buy again. This is really good.</li>
    <li> Wife calls this stuff my fountain of youth. It&#x27;s awesome. This is my 4th bottle. Buy a back up though because you can&#x27;t see when it&#x27;s about to be empty.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year. One bottle lasts almost 6 months using it one to two times a day. The serum is lightweight.</li>
    <li> This is now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product.  I will not be without it.  It actually strengthens the texture of your skin, tightens and helps with discoloration from sun spots or aging and does it gently!  So pleased that I found it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this serum to anyone who wants skin with a better look, feel, and texture. This product contains hyaluronic acid which is wonderful for your skin.  It feels amazing being applied.  After it dries I always apply a moisture and foundation.  Get ready for compliments!</li>
    <li> Great product.  This is my second purchase.  It came fast and I even received an e-mail asking how I like the product.  My face feels nice and firm and my complexion is much clearer.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. i have tried so many different brands of this acid serum and none work as good as this!!!</li>
    <li> It goes on very easily and a little product spreads a long way!  Too soon to see results yet...</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My skin feels and looks softer already after four days of using it. I&#x27;m 58 and live in Arizona and this is a must have for me, as Arizona has very little humidity.</li>
    <li> This  Triple Action Vitamin  C enriched  serum  by Voila&#x27;Ve has a high quality of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid.  I received it on 5/1/15 and it came in great condition.  I used it tonight and I can feel a tingling on my face. that is to be expected. it only takes a few drops and put all over your face and you must moisturize afterwards.  I wait to moisturize for about an hour so the serum wont be diluted.  this serum IS NOT diluted and in the purest form a Hyaluronic serum can be.  the direction say to discontinue use if redness persist but I haven&#x27;t experienced any of this. I recommend this product to the mature woman with aging skin.  it will fight wrinkles, take away any dullness, and keep deep lines at bay.</li>
    <li> It has a real nice feel on my skin.  I am not sure if it is helping with my fine lines and wrinkles, but it is not breaking me out.  I have been using it for only a couple of weeks....so time will tell.  I do like the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting my 2nd bottle of the Triple Action Vit C serum and I have noticed that most of my brown sun spots have started to fade nicely! I do use SPF everyday and while on vacation in strong sun, I use super high SPF. But, even with all the care I take to cover and protect my skin, I have still developed some of the discoloration. I have really fair skin and tend to be dry. but this serum is not causing any xtra dryness as I always follow with my day or night moisturizers. I highly am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> There are so many different products out there that you hate to waste your money on empty promises. This stuff really works and almost immediately starts fading sun/age spots.</li>
    <li> Very nice leaves face feeling refreshed and have noticed a difference since using this product will buy from again A</li>
    <li> I have tried many vitamin C serums but I truly love this one. It has no scent and goes on with no greasy feeling at all. It evened out the texture of my skin and my face looks great! I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> have not used it in a while, but it was ok.</li>
    <li> I use the Dr. Denese Omega-3 skin barrier protection serum first.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use my Triple action vitamin C serum and hyaluronic acid to hold in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I also put it over my Hydroshield!&lt;br /&gt;The Hyaluronic Acid is what hold in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C stimulates collagen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell</li>
    <li> This is the BEST serum I have used and I have tried alot of products. I noticed results pretty fast. I love this product I can not live with out it !!!  If your are looking for a serum this is the one.... I highly recommend this producg. Just try it and you will fall in love with this product !!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few days and so far I like it very much. I use like 2 drops ( AM and PM) and moisturizer (Olay complete all day moisture cream with sunscreen BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 15 with anti-oxidants C &amp; E) and my skin still have some flakes...well, not as much as I used to but still there ( maybe will go away with more time using...not sure). I also use it with Derma Roller 540 needle (Titanium) before I apply the Vitamin C Serum. So far I love it and by the way, if any issue or question the seller and Amazon Costumer Service I assure you THEY ARE THERE FOR YOU! I am like anyone else here sand not working for the Company or anything like that. Go check my profile and see all my other reviews. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> It may be a good quality product but I don&#x27;t like it, found it is too sticky on skin, has some kind funny smell. So it is still sitting in a medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is working GREAT!!!  I can honestly say I have never and I&lt;br /&gt;mean never been so impressed with any product the way I have been with VoilaVe&lt;br /&gt;Triple Action Vitamin C Serum.  After just a couple of days I saw improvement,&lt;br /&gt;but thought it had to be my imagination, nothing works that fast.  But this&lt;br /&gt;does.  I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles I have craters!  The improvement is truly&lt;br /&gt;amazing, I never expected anything to work like this, one always hopes it will,&lt;br /&gt;but to find a product that actually does, well I hate to sound like I&#x27;ve gone&lt;br /&gt;over the top but it seems like a miracle!!!  At 65 I have tried a lot of&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;lotions and potions&amp;#34;  but this is the first thing that actually works, wish I&lt;br /&gt;had found it years ago.  So I can only thank you for such a wonderful, wonderful&lt;br /&gt;product, and please, please continue to make it available, and don&#x27;t change a&lt;br /&gt;thing, don&#x27;t see how you could make it any better!!!&lt;br /&gt;And one more thing it makes your pores shrink, this is an added bonus.  This stuff is great!  Great for the wrinkles on your neck also.  Twice a day is all it takes to get great results!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much improvement but ran out very quick. Only last a little over 2 weeks. Not enough to make fair judgement.</li>
    <li> My skin is smoother, clearer, and I have less fine lines around my eyes and mouth after using it a few days. My pores are getting smaller (nice surprise) I have never been so impressed with any product the way I have been with Triple Action Vitamin C Serum.  The bottle is a nice size (bigger than expected) you only need a small amount, meaning this bottle will last you a very long time. So far I am very satisfied and I would definitely recommend this product to others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just as well as any other cheap product I have used. I will give it more time and see how my dark spots fade.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff; this is my second purchase. I use it in conjunction with my derma roller and have noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> There were no noticeable changes to my skin tightness or texture. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Three years ago I had breast surgery which left me with a small pimple on my nipple. I was having to drain it about every 10 days. I bought this product to lighten up a brown age spot on my face which it did but then one day I thought about applying it to my nipple. I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt anything and before 30 days my nipple was completely closed up and healed. Thank you so much. Doctor wanted to go back in to see what was wrong but I refused. I glad I did because this product saved me from having another surgery.</li>
    <li> This serum penetrates the skin very quickly and makes my face feel smoother and more firm. I have heard several times that the hyaluronic acid is very good for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Well, for a week now , I have been receiving emails from the co founder of voila ve to let them know my opinion of their product.  I had been reluctant to leave a review until I had more time with the product. After a little over a week I started having flaky, and dry skin and a few blemished areas, and pimples. I normally have very clear skin. I have never had acne problems ever. I get compliments on my skin complexion.  I wanted to try  the triple c serum to help with the age spots and fine lines. I am 39 and never really took care of my skin like I should, but was blessed with clear complexion and did not think I needed anything. That is until the age spots and freckles and darkening around the eyes.  I had high hopes for this product. Anyways, I knew that changing and using any new skin care regimen can have some effects such as flaky , dry, maybe a couple of pimples. But that is normal. Thats what is expected during the process of cell rejuvenation. However, my skin started gettingworse, itchy, and tons of little tiny bumps,. Pretty much a type of skin rash.  I stopped using the product. Needless to say, I am somewhat disappointed,  but dont let that detour you from buying it. everyones skin Iis different and this didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I am 60 and have damaged skin from sun and smoking history. This is the only product I have found that has made a significant difference after only ten days. I&#x27;m almost afraid to say it out loud but wrinkles have already lost some depth, my skin is softer and smoother and the pores are less visible. I use a very small amount twice per day after cleansing and then moisturize. I have wasted enough money on wrinkle products but this deserves mention. I don&#x27;t know if the improvement will continue but I am very excited about this serum. I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid products before that did not help so maybe it&#x27;s the inclusion of vitamin c. I hope the price continues to be affordable on amazon because I have found something that is helping. I don&#x27;t wear make-up so I really appreciate any improvement that I can get. I have experienced absolutely no irritation or redness and a few drops truly covers my face.</li>
    <li> Love how it plumps the skin around my eyes, softness, firmness.&lt;br /&gt;And wonderful customer service, received a call from the vendor &amp; they were so nice , asked if they could e mail me a 30% off offer.&lt;br /&gt;Used after fraxel treatment &amp; my skin felt amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I use under day creame &amp; sunscreen , at night on hands &amp; arms, they feel amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum a while ago and I am really happy with this purchase. Product came as promised. I started using it right away. Two pumps are enough for me then I follow with my moisturizer. My face looks healthy , fresh, and vibrant. It is also very well moisturized. I did not have any odd reactions that is redness or rashes while using it. I am really satisfied with this product. Great price also. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick delivery and great customer care shown.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of branded skin products but so far this is the best I&#x27;ve had, results wise and value.  I&#x27;m a 59 years old woman of Asian descent and prone to brown spots.  In just a couple of weeks, my skin is brighter and my brown spots is less noticeable.  Just this morning I noticed that the fine lines on my forehead and wrinkles between my brows were gone and that&#x27;s so amazing!  Also, the wrinkles  beside my mouth were shallower which I&#x27;m sure will be gone in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot for making a great undiluted product that delivers wonderful results!</li>
    <li> Since I received it, I have used it twice a day.  As the reviews reported, a little goes a long way.  I have noticed that my brown spots are fading and that my wrinkles are slowly disappearing.  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I tried this serum because I have wrinkles on my forehead, after 4 weeks of use, the wrinkles are almost invisible! It also helped to make my face look brighter and a much better skin texture. I am so happy!</li>
    <li> This product provides an even balance of C and hyaluronic acid that leaves skin feeling refreshed while encouraging a mild exfoliation.</li>
    <li> As aging, my face is getting so dry, I have been trying and looking for serums, hope to improve some fine lines. I tried squalene serum before, costly but I couldn&#x27;t get what I was told. Skin was still dry and can’t really tell any differences.&lt;br /&gt;When I was searching for Christmas gift on Amazon couple weeks ago, I ended up seeing this product, I thought I would give it a try, so I ordered 2, one as a gift for family. Products were delivered quickly and I started using it right away. I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is scentless, which is a good thing. I hate skin products with fragrances; imagine to put several products on your skin all with different scents…Its texture is not sticky or greasy, easy to spread out. So a couple drops are enough for whole face and neck. After using it for almost a week so far. I can tell my skin is getting clearer , smoother and refresher. Freckles seem to be lighter color. I can tell the skin is moisturized and toned. And the dry feeling has also improved. Skin is moist all day. As long as the skin is moisturized, the fine lines is fading out. I love this product so much, it quickly became my daily skin care route, a must use now. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great, definitely makes a difference in texture of my skin. My mom loves it too she has been getting complements on her skin as well.</li>
    <li> this kind u can put all over without burning, i love it cause it tightens my skin.very happy with this product will buy again</li>
    <li> Everyone is commenting on my skin!  this is great stuff and my skin luvvs it.  Worth purchasing and checking it out for yourself!</li>
    <li> My mom is using the serum and it is doing exactly what the sellers claim it will do.  The dark spots are fading and her face is softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> There is a reason why this Serum has so many positive reviews. As a massage therapist (over 10,000 sessions) I have seen and felt the difference in people who take good care of their skin. My wife loves the way my face feels after using this product. I actually look forward to putting it on every morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Serum is especially &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; in its feel. It completely absorbs. I personally add a little Squalane (from a company Timeless). You will not be disappointed in this Serum. I will be using this skin care serum from now on. I give it my highest recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan the co-founder responded to my email the very next day. It is a pleasure to do business with her. I know money can be an issue but taking care of your skin is certainly more important than spending money on lottery tickets and lattes. My final recommendation: Exercise. Eat right. And don&#x27;t forget to get a massage. ;-)</li>
    <li> I started using this serum a few weeks ago and have always been really diligent about my skin.  I&#x27;m 38 years old and have very few if any wrinkles but last week a salesman came to my door and when I answered, he asked if my parents were home!  The only thing I have been doing differently is including this serum into my daily routine.  It is really outstanding, has a great consistency and if it feels a little dry initially just follow up with your moisturizer.  I am recommending this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  My skin is smoother and looks fresher.  I am definitely happy I made this choice.  Customer service and delivery were very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I have only use this serum for two weeks but can already see a difference in my skin. Softer and smoother. The fine lines are gone. The deeper wrinkles around the mouth seem somewhat better. But I don&#x27;t expect anything will make them go away. After all I am close to 80.The age spots maybe a little lighter or maybe I just want to see that. Time will tell. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Sadly it makes me break out abd I also find it to be sticky. I was really hoping it would work out for me but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My skin is smoothing out and starting to glow!  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now while taking phytoceramides-Wow!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Not a facelift, so don&#x27;t expect miracles, but did see and feel skin improvement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on my 4th bottle...&#x27;nuf said???</li>
    <li> The problem with a product like this is that it&#x27;s so hard to tell, because it&#x27;s largely meant to be preventative. However, my skin, which is very sensitive, hasn&#x27;t reacted badly at all, and I think that after only a few days I do already notice a slight calming effect on my skin--a little less redness and irritation. So I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the product. My dermatologist told me I had to get a product with vitamin c, and so I decided to try this, and I&#x27;ll be staying with the brand.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT I WILL KEEP PURCHASING I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A VITAMIN C SERUM</li>
    <li> I like this well enough to place another order for this and,The Phytoceramides.  At 72 yrs. I&#x27;m sure it will take a little longer to see the results desired!</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I&lt;br /&gt;actually saw visible results on the fine lines around my eyes and overall complexion after first week. Best anti aging product I have tried ever. would.buy again. thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the triple action vitamin c serum for about 3 months now.  My skin is softer, but the most noticeable difference is when I started using it on my neck.  My wrinkles are definitely diminishing.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup, just moisturizer &amp; this serum really works.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be reasonably priced and was thrilled it lived up to the reviews I read on Amazon. After using it for less than a week, I already have seen a marked change in the appearance of my pores and a decrease in my Naso-labial Folds (those pesky lines that form from our nose to the corner of our mouth). The serum goes on easily and quickly is absorbed.  I have paired it with a facial cream containing ceramides and could not be happier with the results! To top things off, the co-founder emailed me and gave me helpful hints on using the serum effectively. I was very impressed with the personalized service and individual concern this company offered to me as a customer. I will for sure be using this product for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> The Triple Action Vitamin C Serum left my face feeling very smooth and well moisturized.  The ligh-weight serum wasn&#x27;t even noticable after application.  The bottl is so much nicer than dropper bottles and much more convenient! And the Free Guide is a great bonus too!  Awesome follow up from the seller to ensure complete satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I received my bottle of Voilàve triple action vitamin c serum quickly and began the treatment on my face that day. The bottle was larger than I had anticipated, so I felt that I got my monies worth in this product. I was a little nervous about starting a new product on my face, because my skin is so sensitive and I usually end up with a red burning face and have to stop using the product. Not with this product. I am delighted to say that I had no reaction at all. Within the first few days of use, I noticed that my face feels tighter and softer. I normally have bumps on my face, but those are all gone now. I have only been using this product for a week now, I can’t wait to see what my face looks like in a month of using this product. This product is easy to spread onto your face and you won’t need too much. It is not thick like other products and there is no scent to this product. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to smooth out there face.</li>
    <li> Aloha from Honolulu!&lt;br /&gt;I received it super fast (especially for Hawaii!)&lt;br /&gt;Although I just received it, I could tell the minute I tried it that I was going to Love it. I have tried numerous C Serum products and most seem sticky or gooey and I haven&#x27;t always liked the smell. This goes on/in magnificently, absorbs and is scentless! I will definitely be purchasing VoilaVe Triple Action Vitamin C Serum again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for two weeks now and see very good results. My &amp;#34;puppet&amp;#34; creases on either side of my nose and mouth are very shallow now, and the crease between my eyebrows is almost gone. I only use one drop for all of these areas and don&#x27;t notice any dryness. I am very pleased with the product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used. Non irritating. Fades spots and with face cream excellent for wrinkles. My only admonition is keep way away from eyes.  It just seems to get in them real easy if you are not careful.  Gel like consistency slides into eyes easily I guess.</li>
    <li> I have had amazing results.  I couple it with OZ Naturals hyaluronic acid serum.  What a change!  Skin feels refreshed!</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old and have been using Triple Action C product for a week now.  My skin is brighter and fine lines have diminished.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> MY skin was decent to begin with, but this product gave it luminosity. It also felt smoother and looked smoother as well. I am 64 and am told I look  ten to fifteen years younger.Only a tiny amount was needed so this was very economical. I also like the fact that it contains a variety of  vitamin c forms. Adding the hyaluronic acid moisturizes deeply.This single product is all I need after cleansing.This worked as well as higher priced products-and it&#x27;s all in one bottle!</li>
    <li> I feel the vitamin c serum works on wrinkles. I have used it for a while and can see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks in combination with the VoilaVe Rose Hip Oil as a moisturizer and it really seems to be working. I am still not sure you can use this under your eyes (I emailed them but no response).  I started using it under my eyes this week (make sure to put rose hip oil after it dries) and have really liked the results. I will continue to watch and see how well it works. I am hopeful :)</li>
    <li> waste the money!! it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
    <li> I was told by my dermatologist that every woman over 30 should use Vitamin C serum in the morning and RetinA at night so I went looking on Amazon for a good Vitamin C serum. I chose this one because of the reviews and the price, but I especially loved that it came in a pump bottle and not one of those annoying dropper bottles. I could not be happier. I only use one pump per application and that is PLENTY for me. This bottle will last me months. I have honestly noticed that my skin does seem smoother, more even toned and my pores seem smaller. I really didn&#x27;t think I would see that much of a difference, but after just 3 weeks of use I really can. The customer service has been surprisingly nice. They have even emailed me twice now to see how I have liked the product. The emails were personal and obviously written by an actual human being, not just some automated response. I am very happy with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Adjust until you get the amount of product to use just right. Ran across an article the other day about the &amp;#34;magic of using this product combination&amp;#34;. High hopes!</li>
    <li> I highly Recommend this Vitamin C Serum. The Serum is silky and goes on smoothly. It is scent free and absorbs easily. I have used many different Vitamin C Serums and I find this one to be very effective and easy to use. The company offers great communication and customer service if you have any questions regarding the use of the serum. Great Product. Wonderful Customer Service. I highly recommend this Serum.</li>
    <li> The product works well.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this Triple Action Vitamin C serum mid-May and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It glides on and dries quickly.  I have noticed a significant brightening of my skin in addition to small pores and beautiful smoothness accomplished by a softening of lines.  When you include the affordable price this VoilaVe product simply cannot be beat.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wishes to improve their skin.</li>
    <li> Great product that I use on my face almost everyday, I need to clear an feel better on what I do for myself.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought such a product online.  I was a little skeptical but decided to give this a try as it has many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the design of the bottle.  Very easy to dispense the liquid from the bottle. After trying out for a couple of weeks, my skin now feels moisturized and smoother.  I love it! A GREAT product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, you just need very little to apply to your face or if you use to much it will&lt;br /&gt;make your face feel very dry.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long ways so use this very lightly.</li>
    <li> This serum soaks really quickly into the skin.  There is no greasy feel, although it may leave a slight shiney look.  However, when make up is applied over it, it doesn&#x27;t affect the make up at all.  So 5 stars for smell, feel and quickly soaking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it has helped my skin~ I can&#x27;t say that it has improved it at all.  No improvement in pore size, wrinkles or texture that I notice.  I had been using Arbonne Vit. C serum and it works much, much better.  With this, I don&#x27;t notice the improvements I did with Arbonne.  I was disappointed, but wanted to try something less expensive.  It just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed for 2 months and there was absolutely no difference.  I think the bottle I received was water.</li>
    <li> Love the bottle &amp; safe seal for better containment of product. Easy to use. The Multi-C product seems to show a skin tone look improvement as well as greater healing of skin from prior blemishing.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week on my face and neck, I can definitely see a positive improvement. My face is smoother , my dark spots are lighter and my skin feels firmer. I also have a couple acne scars by my chin area and they are fading.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly believe with time and patience of using this product that I will have found a great product for my daily skin care !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product only once a day, instead of the recommended twice daily. What I like is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily at all, and not drying either. I think my face is clearer since using it. Maybe with long term use, I can have the smoothness I&#x27;m wishing for.</li>
    <li> I liked the first. The product went on smoothly. It lasts and lasts.The airtight bottle with a pump prevents oxidation, but it also prevents me from seeing when I&#x27;m almost out! One day it pumped, the next, day it squirted out a bit, then nothing. So I was out for a few days. Fortunately, they ship out quickly, so I was back in business in no time.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away.  I will be back</li>
    <li> This serum is very light and absorbs almost immediately.  I use it along with the hyaluronic acid serum. My skin feels nourished after use. I have dark spots on my face and they seem to be lightening.</li>
    <li> Great product.will buy again as it has all three vitamin c&#x27;s.did not irrate like some I have tried in past.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this product and I have ordered it twice. The gel goes a long way, so you only need a couple of pumps. I love the way it tightens and tones my skin without over-drying it. It also has three kinds of Vitamin C. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My skin looks better. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have used this as per instructions twice a day for a month now &amp; notice not an iota of difference in my skin. None. Tried it on its own &amp; even with a moisturizer on top.....no difference. Am a bit skeptical about the raving reviews this product has got......asking for a refund...</li>
    <li> This is the second brand of Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried in the past couple of years.  The first was gooey, and never really absorbed into my skin.  VoilaVe is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been through three bottles so far, and the acne discolorations and sun damage are less noticeable, and I only use this in the evening before my tretinoin cream.  The serum absorbs quickly and leaves a clean feeling to the skin without tackiness.  It has not caused breakouts in my acne-prone skin, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or make my eyes water when I apply it.  I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a quality Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> This is the best produce I gave ever found! I have been using this for over two years and my face looks younger than before I started using it. My daughter says I still have no wrinkles at 56. I will always use this product, thank you ViolaVe!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a change in my skincare routine.  Also, I&#x27;m a new mom and was finding myself looking tired a lot.  The serum leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  My skin also appears brighter and the serum gives me a well rested look.  The bottle is generous sized.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Noticeable change in texture in two months.  I&#x27;m impressed and will continue with this product.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and am already seeing results.  Better tone and texture.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS EVERY DAY ON MY FACE. IT MAKES MY FACE REALLY SOFT . IT ALSO FIRMS MY WRINKLES FOR THE DAY. I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> I have been using Triple Action Vitamin C+ Hyaluronic Acid for the past year and am pleased with results.  I have aging skin and Sun damage... I have noticed a softening of the skin and less sun damage.  I believe it has helped prevent further damage..I believe in this product..</li>
    <li> Love this product and it arrives so fast</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in about a week. Like that it&#x27;s a gel, disappears quickly!</li>
    <li> This Serum is the best I have ever tried. I have been using it for weeks and see the lines are slowly dimishing in a short amount of time. Buy this product. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now. My skin looks great:  firm, bright and healthy. I use a moisturizer after it dries - morning and night.</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old and have used moisturizers since my twenties. But years and years of sun loving started taking their toll, and, though I \\&quot;quit\\&quot; the sun worshipping at 40, the damage was done.  I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon this serum; it&#x27;s the best of all I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  I love the way it glides on and absorbs quickly.  I love the pump bottle. And I love hearing, \\&quot;But you CAN&#x27;T be SEVENTY!\\&quot; My dark spots are still there, but they are diminished, and the dark circles under my eyes appear less dark.  But, hey!  I&#x27;m seventy!  And I recommend this product highly!</li>
    <li> DID NOT DO MUCH THAT I COULD SEE</li>
    <li> My skin is actually more radiant since I have been using this serum.  In the beginning, I used this once a day.  Now I use it twice daily and I see more improvement.  My red marks (left over from acne) are fading.  This is the only product I have ever used that faded these marks.  I have just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now.  I can definitely notice a difference in the actual texture of my skin. It is smoother with my pore visibly smaller than before I was using It. I use this in conjunction with the rose hip seed oil and find it is a perfect match.  The vitamin C can be slightly drying but when used with the oil it is perfect. I am 48 years old and honestly have gotten so many compliments on my skin lately how it has been glowing and appears to smooth. My makeup goes on much better and looks more natural than ever before. I am very pleased thus far and will continue to use it and am hoping to really see a reduction in the tiny lines around my eyes and lips.</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical at first after reading all the hype about vitamin c. Until I ordered this product. I have had it about a week now and my skin has gotten a lot softer and the fine lines on my forehead are starting to diminish. This product goes on nice and smooth with no sticking residue. Works wonders would highly recommend this product. Love it</li>
    <li> I am 65 yrs old with no significant wrinkles, probably due to oily skin and good genes. But I notice sagging skin, esp. around my jawline. I don&#x27;t think realistically, short of surgery, anything can be done about this. So I decided to concentrate on future wrinkles. I&#x27;m happy to say that I have been using VoilaVe for maybe close to a year now and notice no new wrinkles or any new signs of aging. The main reason I purchased VoilaVe was for the reasonable price and good reviews. And happy that it seems to be working!</li>
    <li> I noticed remarkable improvement to my dark spots,after approximately  4 weeks of using this product. I discontinued use though after my already dry skin became very dry with each use even after following that up with a moisturizer. If not for the dryness....it works great to evenly tone your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this serum a few months ago, and I must say that I achieve the promised results: it reduces my fine lines, smooths my skin and I have a more even tone. I use it just in the morning after a good cleaner and before my moisturizing.. and nothing else! Unbeatable price, no animal cruelty, paraben and alcohol free, and the content is plenty enough to last 6-8 months. Don&#x27;t hesitate and give it a try. Thanks VoilaVe! :-)</li>
    <li> I think I like the Ole Henricksen truth serum just a little better, but it&#x27;s not a fair comparison with this product being significantly cheaper. I like it, use it daily, and am sure I will order again!</li>
    <li> Very disappointing, not applicable as serum it was more like a sticky gel that covered the skin instead of adsorbing in the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over a month and seen no results. Once in the morning and once in the evening with clean skin. I have also tried contacting the seller to get any advice and have not received a reply.</li>
    <li> Very nice, will use again!</li>
    <li> This product is great. My skin looks and feels radiant and I have received quite a few compliments on how it looks.</li>
    <li> This has made an improvement in my complexion. I love this product. I have used other vitamin C products and they didn&#x27;t seem to improve my complexion like this one does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and the results are amazing! Excellent product! I have been trying to reverse severe sun damage and this is the first product that has been able to do help quickly! I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I&#x27;m 57, prone to dry skin and most face products irritate my eyes, but not this one. My skin tone is more even, fine lines have softened, some have almost disappeared.  I use it twice a day on my face and throat area and also at night on the back of my hands. It has faded those dark spots and improved the crepey appearance of the skin.  Using it that often and one bottle lasts at least 2 1/2 months.  I just ordered 2 more bottles, I love it!  It&#x27;s gentle but very effective. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Still using it, and the dark around my eyes seem to clear off.</li>
    <li> i have used this a month now  2 times a day and i do not see any improvements at all  i am very dissatisfied with the product would not recomend</li>
    <li> Am  on my 2nd bottle and have noticed a difference in my age spots and fine lines. I use it to boost my sunscreen under my makeup and at night under my moisturizer. It&#x27;s nice to get compliments on my complextion....at 63 !&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to my family members and my neighbors.</li>
    <li> I have heard Vit c is good for your face, so decided to give this a try. I like how my face&lt;br /&gt;feels when I use it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in fine lines or wrinkles. Maybe&lt;br /&gt;it will with longer use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews and took a chance, I have a very sensitive skin &amp; pro breakout &amp; have a lot of dark spots due to acne scars. One of my concerns, aging skin around my eyes. after 2-3 days of use followed by my moisturizer unbelievable! around my eyes, the line that&#x27;s been bothering me for quite a while is lessening &amp; the dark spots on my cheeks wow! start to lighten! I will never go without this ever! I even want to purchase 2 more bottles just to make sure I have a stock. I love it! thank you this product is a miracle in a bottle! my friends saw me &amp; said you look blooming! that&#x27;s only 2-3 days of use. imagine a month or a year wow!&lt;br /&gt;this product is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 4 wks ago and had been diligent about using it twice a day as instructed by Susan, cofounder. I am 50, have an olive complexion, did alot of sunworshipping most of my teen and young adult yrs. Although not too many wrinkles thx to my olive skin I still have crows feet, laugh lines and a mild forehead crease. I also had some uneven skin tones. I use dermologica skin creams and put blue lizard cream when out in tge sun as I do quite a bit of hiking. I didn&#x27;t see any results and did feel sone dryness and have been in communication w Susan regarding my usage and progress. I was optimistic but wasnt going to be surprised if there were no changes. I saw my mom yesterday after about two weeks of not seeing her&lt;br /&gt;and i asked her if she noticed anything different about my face (not&lt;br /&gt;knowing i had been using any products). she said that it looked like i had&lt;br /&gt;makeup on (which i didn&#x27;t) because it looked very even and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so yea! it is working, just needed time, and perhaps someone who i haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;seen to be able to notice the difference. thanks, i&#x27;ll be sending for&lt;br /&gt;another bottle as soon as this one runs out :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different serums and moisturizer, drugstore variety to designer and nothing works as well!!! Use it on my face, neck, ear lobes, and hands all the places where age shows the most. Been using it for a week and I am amazed at the results. The nasty lines on my earlobes are gone and the frown lines between my eyebrows are fading fast. Use 4 FULL pumps twice a day. Makes my skin a little dry with so much, but I let it dry and then apply pure jojoba oil as moisturizer and I think I look 10 years younger already :-)</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone who it experiencing signs of aging.  It makes my skin feel tighter and smoother.  There is a little tingle while it is drying, then it goes away.  Dries fast and I apply foundation.  Love it, I even gave some to my 20something daughter to try and she also loves it.  Will and have reordered. :)</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products and absolutely love this one.  It makes my skin feel very soft and my makeup goes on smoothly.  I noticed the change but was actually surprised when someone at work mentioned that my skin looked so good and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used other vitamin c serums, but this one was more gentle on my skin.  I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I tried to get the packaging off this product, it wouldn&#x27;t pump and then the stem broke and I lost half the contents on the counter/floor.  The packaging was defective.  Not sure about how well the product is because now it was exposed to air, broken container.</li>
    <li> I started using the triple Vitamin C serum a week ago and just ordered a&lt;br /&gt;refill so I will not run out. I am 65 years old and have pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;issues that occur with aging skin....I have spent more money on&lt;br /&gt;different cosmetics that claim to address this issue with no results so&lt;br /&gt;when I was on Amazon I decided to see if there were any excellent&lt;br /&gt;reviews out there on products for this....I found the triple ageing serum by Voilave and&lt;br /&gt;decided that the price was right and I had nothing to lose....after only&lt;br /&gt;3 days, I saw results! The spots are fading to half their&lt;br /&gt;darkness!...now I am using it on my hands and chest .... I am so excited&lt;br /&gt;to see what will happen.  I hope they develop more products!  A must have!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin with this product. Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Although I began using this product months ago and it seemed to make a difference, I KNEW there was a difference when I begged my husband to start using it. I wanted to see if I could truly tell whether it was just &amp;#34;wishful thinking&amp;#34; on my part or if I had found a product that actually performed as promised.  Our skin is clearer, brighter and looks more rested.  We live in Florida and age spots are pretty commonplace around here.  However, this product has definitely helped.  We are both 54.  I have always tried to take care of my skin but my husband is purely a &amp;#34;soap, water, &amp; shave&amp;#34; type guy! It goes on easily, dries quickly, and you only need to use one pump to cover your face and neck!  I highly recommend trying it on another family member if you are skeptical!</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my skin. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin C serum for about one month now. I use it every day morning and evening.  I only use one pump and it covers my face, neck and chest. It&#x27;s very emollient and non - greasy. I apply this and after it dries I put a couple of drops of VoilaVe rosehip oil. I find that my skin is clear and my Rosacea has cleared up totally.  No more red blotches. My skin tone is even and smooth. I use less foundation and my skin has a dewy look. Initially when first using my skin did peel a little bit that only lasted a few days. Nothing major. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Definite improvement with my skin!  I use a Vitamin C facial cleanser before this serum and follow it with a homemade moisturizer with essential oils.  definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a senior and since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in my skin. Especially the face, neck, hands where I&#x27;ve had sun damage. I&#x27;m about to order another bottle. Be sure to put a moisturizer after you apply it. I use  Vivo per Lei from Amazon which is very comparative to the Forever Flawless line, except Vivo does not cost $600 like the Forever Flawless.The photo below is me Apr. 2016 age 63!!! Everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;m just ordering another bottle. I&#x27;m updating my first comment. This serum has reversed years of sun damage. I use on neck and hands. I use Neutrogena face wash and neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair moisturizer and drink lots of water gets toxins out from your skin!! Stay out of the sun if possible. I have a tan year round but I use the self tanner,. I use this product on my hands and it has reversed sun damage. The photos of me are current today at age 64.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  saw  results quickly and to date.</li>
    <li> I began using. Voila Ve Triple Action Vit C Serum on Sat. May 24th. After a few days I noticed I had some breakouts in my &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; zone. I mentioned this in one of the following emails I received from you and your assessment was spot on. I had also purchased a new sunscreen moisturizer that I had never used before.  It is always a good idea to try one new product at a time so you can see how your skin reacts -positive or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days of going back to my regular moisturizer, the breakouts began to diminish. Within the next couple of weeks I found myself catching glimpses of my skin and commenting to myself on how good it looked. I didn&#x27;t really stop to think about why, because the Vit C Serum has be one such a normal part of my routine it seems like I&#x27;ve been using it forever! I must admit the texture and tone seem to have improved as well as the tautness and look of my &amp;#34;parentheses!&amp;#34;  I also use it on my hint of a &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; and my profile has indeed improved. It has really taken up the slack so to speak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it hasn&#x27;t been a month yet, I will continue to use and update my review again later. But so far, sooo good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for a little over two months and I see no difference.</li>
    <li> Dear Dan,&lt;br /&gt;I bought the serum about 2 months ago. I am happy to say it is one of the best serums for vitamin c I have ever tried. I have noticed a newfound glow to my skin and radiance brought back. I also feel it the skin is smoother and pores are refined I know I am getting my daily does of anit-oxidant protection for my skin and helps with the assaults from the sun, smoking , pollution ect. I eat a very balanced and natural diet on the inside so I treat myself right all over. I use the serum around my eyes also. The dermatologists feel that this could be helpful. when you drive your car, you get sun induced damage on the driver&#x27;s side. just like your arm gets tanner on one side! that is a bummer but this serum has really helped even out my skin tone. I would buy it again for sure. I am a makeup artist also and I recommended this product to my clients and friends and my friend who lives out west just bought 2 bottles this week I will  let you know her results but I do this give this product 4.5 stars. your line is very good.  keep up the research Dan and keep the products coming! gina  milite</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  didnt work for me at all, so i returned it and got refund</li>
    <li> I love this product so after using a full bottle I decided to give a free bottle to my daughter and a couple of friends. My daughter loves hers as well. I am saving the others for gifts. I know they will love it to.</li>
    <li> I received my Vitamin C Serum just a few weeks ago and have already can tell the difference in my skin.  I am sure it will only get better in time.  I am looking for to their Vitamin C creams and lotions to come out in the future.  I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.  Sally King</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wasting literally thousands of dollars on name brand products from Sephora, which I&#x27;ve recently discovered are mostly either ineffective or actually bad for your skin!  After some research, I decided to look for some products with Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, which is how I came across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is large (much larger than anything you&#x27;d get from a name brand product for triple the price).  The serum itself is very watery, so you only need a small amount, meaning this bottle will last you a very long time.  Even though it&#x27;s watery, you can tell it&#x27;s working once it&#x27;s on and instantly plumps/softens your skin.  Take care not to use too much, though, or you&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s drying your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using Tretinoin for wrinkles (I&#x27;m 23, this is preventative mostly) as well as some other new moisturizers/oils, so it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint exactly how this serum alone has helped in the long run.  While some have said Retinol cream should not be mixed with Vitamin C, there is an abundance of evidence supporting the contrary, and I find that they do in fact work well together.  Either way, Vitamin C is very important for your skin and combining it with Hyaluronic Acid is genius.  I haven&#x27;t seen many products with these ingredients together, so this is a great find that is saving me money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - my skin has never been more hydrated, even, clear, and happy!  At this price, it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for anyone who, like me, has wasted money on high-end products searching for a \\&quot;fountain of youth\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t exist.  But I have learned a lot about the products I&#x27;ve been using from Paula&#x27;s Choice.  If you want to know what a certain product or ingredient actually does for your skin, look it up on her site.  She&#x27;s a dermatologist who has reviewed almost every beauty product out there (makeup too).  It was her advice that pointed me in the direction of this wonderful serum.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product, and makes my face feel great with a super glow.  I have already referred a friend to the product and she as well likes it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a skincare product with Vitamin C and was happy to find this serum that also contained hyaluronic acid which I had been using.  Saved me a step in my daily ritual and the cost of another product.  After using this for several weeks, with a few days of dry skin, I found the amount of product that works best for me.  The changes were subtle but there they were.  Despite some negative reviews, I kept using the product and am glad I did.  I have a more even skin tone and noticed that several small bumps and spots I&#x27;ve had for years are now almost gone.  I&#x27;m 60+ with all the wrinkles that go with it but didn&#x27;t expect this serum to magically erase them from my face.  It didn&#x27;t.  But I was surprised that over time my face had changed.  Those wrinkles had a softer look and I lost a lot of my sagging jawline.  Not saying I look young again but just not as old.  I do use more serum on my nose and chin which are oily.  I no longer have the problem of noticeable pores and use less makeup or none at all.  To be honest, the makeup sometimes made the problem areas look worse anyway - So, I am extremely happy with the results I got from this product and will definitely buy it again because I&#x27;m way to happy with the results to go back to where I was.  Recommend this to others?  You betcha.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical at first because the product is quite watery and sticky as it&#x27;s drying.  I always applied after a thorough cleansing both day and night, then allowed to dry thoroughly before adding moisturizer.  Have to say, my skin looks much more radiant and even-toned.  Just turned 70 this year, albeit a youthful 70, no wrinkles - just felt my complexion was dull and the pores quite noticeable.  Not now!  Huge difference.  Also taking additional vitamins for skin, hair, etc which no doubt add to the results.  Anyway, I&#x27;m very pleased and thus would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product  since Monday evening and im  liking the smoothness of my skin. I wake up feeling less oily which is super amazing ! And it&#x27;s helping with the redness I get too!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a lot of sun damage on my face (skin dry and flaky), and have read that Vitamin C can help with that, and may even help prevent cancer by fighting free radicals in the skin itself.  So I tried this serum, and within a week or so my skin looks and feels much smoother, and the flakiness is gone.  The difference is obvious and surprised me.  I don&#x27;t know whether it is really helping heal my skin; I&#x27;ll have to check with my dermatologist for that.  But if I can use this stuff instead of getting lasered, great!  Serum feels nice, not greasy.  Pump keeps out oxygen and is convenient.  And the label goes almost all the way around, protecting it from light (not that there is a lot of that in the medicine cabinet).</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It&#x27;s not sticky, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it absorbs right away. It nicely prepares your skin for moisturizer, which is important because as the bottle mentions, this is powerful stuff &amp; can dry your face if you use it too frequently. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any change in my complexion since using this serum.  I really don&#x27;t have many wrinkles and feel I waste my money on products such as these.  This would probably help someone who had significant wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about a week &amp; 1/2 &amp; have seen small signs of fine wrinkles disappearing. It is not drying, but you can definitely feel your skin tightening.  Sometimes I use a moisturizer &amp; sometimes I don&#x27;t at night. So far I like this Vit. C product. I have used 2 others &amp; the 1st one did nothing &amp; felt filmy. The 2nd one worked great but broke my face out. So I had to stop using it. I&#x27;m sure after using this for a longer period I will see more dramatic improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day, as instructed, for 5 days and I love it. I can see that the age spots are becoming less noticeable. There has also been a slight tightening along my jaw line and on my neck. I am hoping that the longer I use the serum, I will see ever better results. I love this product and don&#x27;t intend to be without it.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. Have used 100% Hyaluronic Acid before and I noticed that the stretching sensation on your skin it&#x27;s less with this one as it&#x27;s mixed with Vitamins.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Personal service.  Its a little hard on my older dryer skin but brightens it up too.</li>
    <li> Used once, immediately started itching and breaking out with small red itchy bumps. Will not use again. Too many chemical ingredients but claims to be all natural.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t normally write reviews but i have to do so on this product. The reason why i bought this product is because i often see all the facial salons offer Vitamin C mask, and i read about how Vitamin C can benefit your skin. I have to say this Vitamin C serum works very well for me. My skin is very sensitive and easy to break out. But since i used this product, my skin is so much better, less break out, my skin tone is more even, the dark spots i had from acne are gone. I also bought for my mom and sister in law to use.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, make sure to let the serum dry on your face first, before putting on moisturizer as in the instruction.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to use and love using this to make my skin feel refreshed and feeling lovely!</li>
    <li> I had been using an anti-aging serum that I loved. When I went to re-order I learned the company I purchased from had gone out of business. I went searching and found this one. Although I have only been using for about a week I can tell a tremendous difference. I just apply a small amount in the morning after I get out of the shower and at night after I wash my face. After a couple of days I could tell my skin was brighter and the lines on my forehead and around my mouth were not as pronounced. I would definitely recommend this serum to others if you are looking to fight aging skin like I am.</li>
    <li> I have always been cautious with my skin. I&#x27;m very fair with freckles and the sun is my enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a great skin product that will not just feel like I iced a cake on my face, has always been a problem.. When I found this serum I was really excited to try it. Ordering the product was quick and painless. It arrived exactly when it was expected, and when I tried it I knew this was the one. Clear, clean, fragrance free, I was in heaven. For the first time I felt I had found a product that I would not have to worry, I was going to break out or develop a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the serum it is smooth and cool and almost instantly is absorbed into your skin. It leaves no redness or mask in the area that it has been applied,  I noticed an immediate smoothing, to the overall texture of my skin. There is no greasy feel or sheen. No irritation, no scent, no dye. Its all the things you want without all the things you try and avoid for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VoilaVe is packaged in a pump bottle so it&#x27;s super for traveling. Just drop it in your bag and away you go. No more worrying that its going to leak or slide in the jar and all over everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed, take the chance, because you will love this product.</li>
    <li> when i was teenager, there was no way to put any kind of face cream on my face because it was so sticky, annoying to use it everyday, and believed i did not need it. when i was late 20s go to 30s. it was OK only night light cream or 1 serum, that was it. when i turned to early 40s till now 47, i realized that my daily routine is so ridiculous (my husband told me). i have combination+sensitive skin, with some acne from time to time, some age spots, and very visibly annoying sun spots on my cheeks. so after washing my face, i use toner, concentrated whitening serum, face serum, acne cream (for preventing). if in the morning, i add sunscreen spf50, and re-apply every 3 hours (i live in florida), and i still have the dark spots on my face, and the new one starts to show the sign like that everyday, and my face is not smooth. for years, i have been trying (almost) everything in the market. it sounds crazy, but this is me. i&#x27;m too scared to use any peeling chemical (even i bought it from amazon before) or laser. so when i ordered and start using this serum, i take it very serious. after i wash my face, i use this voilave serum only (pump it only 1 push for my whole face). it&#x27;s clear, feels like water+gel, a little sticky, it dries and absorbs so quickly, then the acne cream. if in the daytime, i put sunscreen like always. 3 days in the roll, this is the day 4, i checked my face, my face is smoother, no new acne popped on my face, the dark spots are just a little bit lighter. now i give this serum 70% satisfaction for my result, plus no breakouts, and i will continue following my routine for a couples weeks, i will write the comment again. please know that i have had almost 10 years of age, sun, and acne scar spots, so i believe the results should be different depending on how long that you have this problem on your face. i knew that&#x27;s no way to get rid of them completely, but at least fade away some of them, i would be happier.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a short time but I can see some changes in my face. my skin seems to be getting a little smoother,so far,so good.</li>
    <li> I have to say I love this product! I am in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but I am starting to get fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead and after using this product for a month or so I really am seeing a difference! I mainly use it at night and follow up with VoilaVe Argan Oil as a moisturizer and I love the results. It doesn&#x27;t smell, irritate my skin or make it greasy. I wake up with super soft and great looking skin! If I am seeing results this early I look forward to see what continued use will bring!</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple weeks now and feel a nice difference in my skin. It feels smooth and healthy. I tried many other vitamin c serums and this feels the best by far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a short time but I have noticed a difference with my skin.</li>
    <li> The best facial product on the market.  My skin is glowing amd I always suffered with acne my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid For Your Face has repaired my poor skin to glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend product and I always order way ahead to make sure I never run out.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will be buying more for sure.</li>
    <li> I use it weekly.  It tightens my face when it dries, but I have not noticed any change in the lines on my face.</li>
    <li> Great!  I see a huge difference!</li>
    <li> this product really works. l could really see a difference in one week.You dont need much and it dries quickly- not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> I really like how this has erased age discolouration on my face..it seems to be working very well..I use it during the day along with my rosehipseed oil...great beauty regime</li>
    <li> Since I started using this serum am happy with my face.</li>
    <li> read a good deal about this product, which is why i ordered it. am waiting as the results are not immediate.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this one, I think the &amp;#34;3 types of Vitamin C&amp;#34; and the pump bottle played a part in persuading me. My husband and I both use it and felt that Best Vitamin C Serum For Your Face Contains Vitamin C + E + Hyaluronic Acid Serum - Potent 20% Vitamin CE Hyaluronic Acid Serum Will Leave Your Skin R Sold by OZ Naturals that we purchased before on Amazon was much more effective. I will purchase that one again when we finish with this bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a month now and I definitely see a difference - less lines and a more even complexion.</li>
    <li> Packaging appears impressive.  But, there is only one ounce &amp; I found better options for less.  (Watts has nice products)</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks so try this product and see how it worked.  I looked at many products on Amazon that had both Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid and chose this one based on reviews and price. I have to say I am not disappointed! I have definitely noticed a change in my skin and fine lines. I use it every morning and every evening (for the most part). I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, and used a moisturizer after the product dried (dries in about 15 seconds). Unlike some reviews, this did not dry out my skin at all. I actually apply a generous amount first to under my eyes and forehead as that&#x27;s where my problem area is.  It immediately feels tighter. However I use the moisturizer on top of the product as the directions state, and the combination works great. I will definitely be re-ordering this!</li>
    <li> VoileVe triple action vitamin C serum - so I got this on a special promotion because my mom won&#x27;t shut up about how great vitamin c serum is and I do have some skin issues so I thought I would try it.  I have trouble not so much with acne but lots of small bumps on my face that I have a bad habit of picking at just because they are there I guess. She said I should try to start exfoliating and use all natural products. I have been putting this on twice a day and so far it feels good - I don&#x27;t see any problems and my skin does feel smoother and has calmed down.  I will continue to use this.  It says also you should use a moisturizer after the serum.</li>
    <li> This serum goes on smoothly and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in both the texture and radiance of my skin. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and I will continue to use VoilaVe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used Triple Action Vitamin C Serum a few times; however, I already see an improvement in my skin.  Also, a few friends mentioned that my skin looks better.  I give this product a 5 STAR rating.</li>
    <li> I got this with the REFRESH phyto ceramides and have been using them for a month now.  I&#x27;m 66 years old with sun damage (brown spots), undereye pouches and discoloration, and the beginnings of jowls and chicken-neck.  The first week of use  and my skin looked way brighter and healthier.  The second week, the undereye discoloration disappeared.  The third week the sun damage was almost gone.  This week the chicken neck is GONE!!!! and the jowls are almost unnoticeable.  In addition my skin tone and color are better than they&#x27;ve been in years and years.  Also any little boo-boo I get heals in a matter of hours instead of days like it used to.  I highly recommend this combination to anyone and wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> I have found this probably why remarkable in eliminating age spots over time.</li>
    <li> Just started using this serum - but my skin feels firmer already.  Pores appear smaller.  Love how it quickly absorbs, and that there is no fragrance.  The packaging easily dispenses the correct amount - tried the dropper bottles and always got more than I needed.  Giving it 4 stars until I have used it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using skinceuticals c e ferulic regularly and liked it, but the cost was too much.  I went on Amazon and read reviews and the reviews for this product were very good so I wanted to give it a shot, not to mention the price was much more affordable.  I started using this product immediately following the directions and noticed after 3 days of use that my dark sun spots were fading.  At first I doubted what I was seeing and thought that I was losing it.  I kept using for another week daily and have noticed significant changes in the spots on my face.  I will continue to use this product and will definitely try VoilaVe&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice and have found that my skin is a little softer and maybe a few less wrinkles.  I would recommend you give it a try. Everyone does not have the same skin type.  It is great under makeup and has become part of my morning and evening regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for approximately 3 months. My skin has radiance, my pores are tighter and the white heads on my nose are almost gone.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I like it</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite.  It has definitely brighten my face and even tone my skin.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This vitamin C Serum from VoilaVe  is a little bit different from others I have reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unique because of it&#x27;s lack of dropper design. Instead it uses a pump. This makes it very easy to use. There are less messes.&lt;br /&gt;It has a money back guarantee for a reason. The results are impressive. It is a great buy if you want smooth radiant skin. I loved the way my skin left after an easy application. It is also safe on acne prone skin, as I had no breakout trouble while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle for free to review, but my opinions are mine alone.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after I saw pictures on internet of people who have used the product. I tried it on myself but I did not notice much of a difference. The only thing I liked about it that it&#x27;s not greasy and feels smooth on the face. The main ingredient of the product is water and vit C. The Hyaluronic acid was the forth one out of 8 which means it&#x27;s not enough of it in the product. Plus I am not sure if the acid can effect the face topically. So far no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Have not had it long enough to give yout my opinion yet</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several days now and I have not seen any improvement.  the serum is sticky and since it has hyaluranic acid I thought it&lt;br /&gt;would be easier and not need moisturizer. I can not rate it at this time.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it helps.  The jury is still out!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and would recommend to all my friends who is very high maintenance and the product great for a amazing price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several months now and it&#x27;s been wonderful for my skin. Finally something that works well.</li>
    <li> Cannot say if this helped eliminate wrinkle lines buy certainly while I used it the appearance of lines and is a good product for a facial maintenance regime</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable that vitamin C can generate such quick, positive results! This will now always be part of my skin care regiment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I bought a more expensive one, similar item, with supposedly a better selection of vitamin Cs,  it was oily and I had a small allergic reaction. I will be going back to this one.  I like the pump, too.  The other was an eye dropper.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for a month now and really like it.  I think it takes 2-3 months to really know if a product works, so I have ordered more.  I am 74 and most people think i am in my sixties.  I would like to keep it that way, so I try to use products that will maintain my skin.  I am a little old to expect wrinkles to go away, but i can help keep my skin at its best.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the big results from the small amount needed. Use morning and night for soft, smooth skin. Making progress on these wrinkles!</li>
    <li> It is drying, though.  Contrary to the description which says it moisturizes.  No results to report other than a feeling of tightness when first applied.</li>
    <li> It impresses me. After the very first time used, my skin seemed younger looking, and it continues to. I haven&#x27;t missed an application; I use it twice a day. Goes on clean and easy, absorbs quickly (in seconds), and even the pump dispenser is very well designed. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> i liked it&lt;br /&gt;Does not sting&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday and have noticed a change is my skin&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I could swear this stuff is too good to be true. I have tried every expensive serum and lotion out there. This is all I&#x27;ve been using and my lines on my forehead and around my eyes have reduced by at least 80%. It seems too good to be true for the price, but since it&#x27;s&#x27; working so well, I plan to keep on using and ordering.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product.  There appears to be a small amount of Vit. C in it.  It is not very effective.</li>
    <li> Contains two chemicals known to be toxic!!! Read the ingredients!</li>
    <li> I love the benifits of this Triple Action Vitamin C Serum!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer &amp; looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait and write a review until I had used this serum for a few weeks. I am now on my second bottle, first lasted over a month, using twice a day, there is a significant change in my skin. My &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; lines are much &amp;#34;finer&amp;#34;, my skin has evened out and oh, so soft. The bottle is much bigger than expected, so a great value.  The company has followed up with me via email to check in to see that I received my purchase on time and to ask if I had any questions. They also gave me some great tips. I highly recommend this product for great results, value and customer service and appreciation.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It has a clarifying effect on the skin that I haven&#x27;t seen with any of my other vitamin C serums and I think I might have tried most of them. This goes on smoothly then dries quickly after you put it on, not oily at all like some of the expensive C serums I have tried and you can feel a sort of pulling effect on the skin. It also takes very little so it lasts a long time. I use this in combination with Peter Thomas Roth Un wrinkle Peel Pads, Cetaphil cleanser, skinnygirl vitamin c scrub(note: I haven&#x27;t purchased the skinnygirl scrub from amazon because our local WM had a way better price. But I will have to purchase it from Amazon if WM doesn&#x27;t get it in soon. I only paid 6.99 at WM. I hope amazon will start carrying it just as cheap. It is my favorite scrub.), Avalon organics Vitamin C toner ( I even put the vitamin c toner on my forehead when I have a headache and it helps). I put the triple C on last, let it dry then follow with a deep moisturizer at night. During the day I use cetaphil lotion then follow with sunscreen. I use L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream.  For sunscreen I use OCEAN POTION SPF#45 FACE ZINC OXIDE CLEAR. It is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn and tear up all day.</li>
    <li> I just love this serum. its light, natural, fragrance free and  it does exactly what is suppose to do leaving my skin texture so smooth and so soft to the touch not to mention the great customer service! unbeatable!  I will re order another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Need more time to see results</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple.  My wrinkles appear to be less noticeable and&lt;br /&gt;my complexion brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this product. My skin around my mouth was always breaking out, dry and flakey - and now... Wow, what a difference.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  Glad to have a good product that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!</li>
    <li> Im a guy and i definetely love this product.</li>
    <li> great difference in my skin</li>
    <li> This product works well. I honestly did not have high expectations for it. But immediately after the first use, I mean overnight, I saw results. I have acne prone skin and this product does a great deal in evening out your skin tone. It feels light and it can easily be applied before putting on makeup. I would recommend using it at night. Overall, a great product. I will be adding this to my collections.</li>
    <li> Truly boosted my collagen levels. Fantastic product;I will continue to use this nightly as a preventative agent along with a good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> FANTABULOUS SERUM AND AN AWESOME, COMMUNICATIVE SELLER!  SHE CARES ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF USING HER PRODUCT.  I HAVE MADE REFERRALS AND HAVE PURCHASED A SECOND BOTTLE.  I HAVE CONTINUED TO USE THIS PRODUCT AND ABSOLUTELY WON&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT.  I HAVE TWO BOTTLES IN RESERVE AT ALL TIMES.  USE THE NEXT, ORDER ANOTHER.  I am just shy of 61 and since I have been using this product, I have had more people ask me &amp;#34;What are you doing to your skin?  Your complexion is amazing!&amp;#34;  Just this week, August 26, 2015, I even had a late 20-something guy flip when he looked at my driver license for verification and he said, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re 60?  You could&#x27;ve fooled me!&amp;#34;  Made my day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for the next product ordered for an update on this review.  Per Dan at VoilaVe.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and have been using it for a week now.  I have already noticed a difference with my face.  My skin looks fresh and rejuvenated.  My pores seem to be less noticeable too.  I would recommend this product and consider myself a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> I think that my fine lines are better.  I am from Florida and at 61 years old not much can help but a face lift but this seems to be an improving somewhat and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Unlike other higher priced serums that I&#x27;ve tried, this one really stands way above all the rest. After just one week of using Triple Action Vitamin C Serum, morning and night, my skin tone is brighter, the lines around eyes, and mouth area have greatly diminished.  In addition, the puffiness under my eyes are gone, and my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin feels so soft and much firmer. This soothing serum does not sting the area around my eyes, and cause them to water, as the others have. I would also like to add that this company&#x27;s Customer Relation&#x27;s Department is outstanding, and really cares about their customer&#x27;s experience with this product. Triple Action Vitamin C Serum is an amazing product! Don&#x27;t let the affordable price fool you. It&#x27;s the new &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; in a bottle. Thank you Amazon for making Triple Vitamin C Serum available to your customers.</li>
    <li> I love this serum because it has delivered:&lt;br /&gt;- fast results&lt;br /&gt;- less noticeable fine lines, especially around my eyes&lt;br /&gt;- less noticeable dark spots&lt;br /&gt;- freshness and glow to my acne-prone, sensitive combination skin, without clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;As expected after reading the ingredients, it does leave my skin feeling a bit tight in the same way that pure hyaluronic acid does (read more about how hyaluronic acid &amp;#34;works,&amp;#34; if you haven&#x27;t, and it will all become clear.) To remedy that, I apply this serum under my moisturizer or non-comedogenic oil like safflower oil.&lt;br /&gt;I hope its price of a little less than $30 will not change.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I saw a commercial that many famous and beautiful women used to keep her skin beautiful and look younger, also had a good review. but I don&#x27;t think so, My skin is not softer or anything better after I used it.&lt;br /&gt; I do not like it.  Why not?  Because this product seems egg white.  I feel the same stretch on my face as if I used egg white, smell is not pleasant.  So do not waste your money buy another product.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and another for my mother.  Both of us like the product!  I was glad to find a product that did NOT break my skin out since I have a fragrance allergy and  this product doesnt contain fragrance.  Looking forward to sampling their othr products.  Havent noticed any diminishing of any fine lines as of yet.  One negative is when the 2 products arrived, they were together in one box and it contained a plastic air filled pack inside but this did nothing to keep the 2 bottles from being tossed around loosely in the box nor protected them from hitting each other and breaking.  I thought for sure at least one would have broke !  Luckily they did not.  They need to wrap each bottle with bubble wrap to protect them alot better and in a much smaller box for a more snub and better fit.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have already ordered my second supply of the Vitamin C Serum because it worked so well for me. It was hypoallergenic (did not irritate my skin) and the results, more radiant skin with less fine lines and wrinkles within 2 weeks of using the product, have me continuing to use this product on a regular basis</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> Serums are the most important part of any skincare regime. Not only are they the first step in nourishing and protecting scrupulously cleansed skin, they lay down the foundation that determines how well your other products will work in terms of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;According to the label, it contains the following:&lt;br /&gt;Purified water (Aqua), Ascorbyl Glucoside, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Hyaluronic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethythexylglycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ascorbyl Glucoside is a form of vitamin C, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is a water-soluble form of vitamin C that functions as an antioxidant.&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate or MAP is turned into C by the enzymes in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trifecta of C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MAP also acts to lighten and brighten skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself feels good, and the mere act of gently massaging it in gets the skin energized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to test, and it is fine for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love it. Noticed dark spots and fine lines have disappeared. I have used it for nearly 6 months.</li>
    <li> I waited to see if I would notice a difference in my skin before writing this review. After three weeks I saw nothing! Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks, but I already see some improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and color. I&#x27;m really impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> First, I want to say that the owners of this company are the wonderful and very customer-service oriented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I found this to leave my skin sticky or tacky.  I used on clean skin sans any other product, but my skin felt slightly sticky.  One of the owners and I tried to trouble-shoot through my challenge with this product.  I do not have this issue with other Vitamin C serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is either me or the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not thick.  It is quite thin and almost watery.  You would not expect it to leave your skin tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not for me.  I love Timeless 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz.  I think I will return to that product.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what all it does... but seems to tighten skin up before my mosturizer. I have ordered a few times now and I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Essential product. Use it twice a day to lessen dark spots and just good for your skin</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my fine lines and evening out the whole tone of my skin. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> This is just a clear serum. I like that it has no smell. I have used this for four days and can so a difference in my skin. It have not broken out and the redness seems not so red.</li>
    <li> Turning 65 in two weeks and noticing a few stress marks on my face promoted me to try thus product.  After reading the reviews, I ordered 2 pumps.  I am extremely happy I did.  I use it 2X&#x27;s per day with mousturuzrr , after it dries.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, has commented on how young and wonderful I look and how my skin is glowing and translucent. After a few weeks the difference is noticeable but after a few monthd , for me its unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used anything like this on my skin. I was one of &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; that never consistently washed on moisturized. Now that I got hooked up with an amazing Esthetician who gives my a microdermabrasion facial every month she got me to commit to my skin. For the first 30 days I washed and moisturized twice a day. One I &amp;#34;passed&amp;#34; that test, she asked me to get something to nourish my skin. She said a vitamin C serum. Didn&#x27;t point me to a specific brand. I found your product on amazon and read great reviews. Despite the fact that there were competing products available at a lesser price, I went with yours primarily based on the reviews. And, well, you do get what you pay for after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks or so since I&#x27;ve stated using the serum and I can&#x27;t tell a perceptible difference. The truth is, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to. Taking care of my skin, I&#x27;ve learned, is more about slowing down the aging process and protecting the skin from further damage, and a little less about reversing damage. Anyway, I love the way it feels when I use it. First I wash and dry my face. Then I apply three pumps (I read in the instructions that it can dry your skin - this hasn&#x27;t happened to me) and gently apply it all over my face and neck. Then I wait for it to dry and that&#x27;s the best part. My skin feels so firm when it dries. Like a facelift. Hahah. But that doesn&#x27;t last. Then I moisturize and voila.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this for about  three weeks but it seems to work well. Has helped clear up some mild Rosacea that I have developed over the past few years.  Having never has Acne as a younger person, this was frustrating to be over 50 and have what appears to look like acne.  I will have to see if it works permanently but so far so good.  It is easy to apply and you need only a little but do follow up with a plain or tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Lovely product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for only one week and already my skin is smoother.  I look forward to updating my review as results develop</li>
    <li> I found this to be a very good quality Vitamin C serum. I really like to use this on my face before bed. I just put a few drops on my face then gently rub it in. It absorbs and dries very quickly without leaving any sticky or oily residue. Just after the first use I found the tone of my skin to be a lot brighter and skin felt tighter.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply. It&#x27;s a bit drying but many anti-aging products are so I just apply moisturizer over it. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it has improved my skin but it appears to be of high quality and vitamin C is something dermatologists often recommend for anti-aging. I&#x27;m hoping for noticeable results with regular use.</li>
    <li> OK, I admit I struggled giving this only two stars.  The product is worth a definite 5 STAR credit!!! However, why oh why would you change a GOOD thing?? The new pump bottle is pure trash.  Either nothing pumps out or a huge glob comes out all over the place, wasting the product.  I have used this Serum for almost 2 years and am so frustrated with the new bottle, I am seriously considering looking for another source.  :(   dma</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after my daughter had been using it for a few weeks. She&#x27;d had a bump on her cheek for quite a while that felt like a pimple but hadn&#x27;t come to the surface, and after just three applications had diminished to a slight pink spot on the surface of her skin. I grew up in Southern California in the days before the very thought of sunscreen protection and have lived in Kansas for 45 years. I&#x27;ve had more pre-cancerous spots burned and cut than I could count and more than half dozen cancers removed. Before I began having to go to a dermatologist for this I used tanning beds for my base tan and used sunscreen to prevent burning when I was out in the sun. I had to resort to wearing a foundational make up on my face because of the red and brown sun damage spots. I got my order for this product very quickly and I could see a change within a week of using it morning and night. My red and brown spots were fading!! I ran out and haven&#x27;t reordered yet but the results have remained. I now use only a good moisturizer with some skin tone color for my type in addition to a little concealer on the darker places and under my eyes. I have been so pleased with this product. I have and will continue to recommend it to family and friends! It goes on and soaks in easily and feels good on my skin. And my dermatologist said the only way to get rid of those spots was a chemical peel... Well that&#x27;s just not true!! This product is priced right for me and is, beyond a doubt, worth every cent! Thank you thank you thank you!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the lines around my mouth or eyes and I have been using the product for several weeks.  Hopefully it will happen soon.</li>
    <li> I wash my face about twice a day everyday, so I needed something to put the hydration back into my skin and brighten it up a bit.  A friend recommended me this product so I decided to try it out and see how it works.  It feels super light weight on my face and absorbs into the skin quickly, also it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily by the end of the day.  Would defiantly recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I tried this as soon as I got it! It is soothing and tingling at the same time. This made my face feel firm and alive :) I can feel it working as Im writing the review! Non greasy formula leaves my face feeling fresh too Love this product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Voila Ve Triple Action Vitamin C Serum is amazing!  I use it daily to moisturize my skin. It does a great job of helping to plump up my skin and fill in those fine wrinkles. I also notice that it has helped diminish age spots too. It takes just a little bit of serum (one pump) to cover my entire face. My face feels refreshed and smooth. I like that it came with a free e-book and delivery was fast. I have tried some other brands, but this one by far gives me the best results. It makes my skin feel refreshed and renewed. This is my new favorite brand!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be chosen to receive some free samples from VoilaVe and this serum was one of them.  I love the combo of the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, it really leaves your skin feeling so fresh and clean - and the pump on top makes it so easy to use, you just pump a few drops onto your fingers and rub into your skin.  This serum did not leave a greasy feeling on my skin and there was no residue which is great.  I have pretty severe acne at 38 years old and my skin is always so oily, so finding the perfect skincare products has always been very difficult for me.  This helped to tighten up my skin and it did help reduce some of my acne.  This serum contains NO alcohol or parabens and it comes with a 365 day money back guarantee.  Did I mention it is NOT tested on animals???  I have been very happy with it so far just in a week that I have been using it, I highly recommend giving it a try and see how well it does for you :)</li>
    <li> so far i havent notice anything to be honest.....n i use it day/night</li>
    <li> I just started using this so this review is more for customer service but I can say that so far I really like the product. I like how it feels and spreads. My skin hasn&#x27;t objected to a new product like it usually does and I trust the ingredients and the manufacturing. I have already been contacted by the company to make sure I received my order in time and to give me contact information should I find myself unsatisfied with the product and I find that admirable. They have extensive product info available and explain the science in understandable methods which I appreciate. As I continue use I will update on the results of the product. I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and have taken good care of my skin but I&#x27;d like to lighten my freckles and see if I can take a few years of my smile lines around my mouth and eyes. I hope it delivers but hey, I figure if the worst lines on my face are from smiling I shouldn&#x27;t let those lines bother me...still hope it works though. ;)</li>
    <li> I have been using the Triple Action Serum for 3 weeks and I am having very good results. I am using the serum after cleansing with my Clarisonic brush and a mild cleanser 2x/day.My skin feels very soft and smooth and my clogged pores are clearing themselves. The discolorations are fading and I have a little glow that wasn&#x27;t there before. I am making sure to use an SPF 40 every day. I am very pleased and find the VoilaVe much easier to apply than Skinceuticals Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m not sure about this product.  I think I need more time with this also. It is very drying and at times it itches.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know. I got several pimples (haven&#x27;t had one in several years) and after using it nightly for a week, got hives on my face. I&#x27;ve rated it low because of all the beauty treatments I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one I&#x27;ve had to stop using due to negative reactions.</li>
    <li> Just trying this product for 2 weeks per the instruction. So far so good, love the feel of my skin, pores looks finer the next morning but still need to see the result later after a few more weeks/months. Will surely continue to order if it really works good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This potion is great.  It tightens pours and give you a natural looking glow.  I will continue purchasing this item again and again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really feel that I have noticed a significant change in my areas of problem.  I will continue to use the product until depleted.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference after using this product</li>
    <li> I use this product every day. It&#x27;s gentle and has no scent which is good for my sensitive skin. I only use one pump of it and haven&#x27;t  had a problem with dryness.</li>
    <li> Received a defective bottle of serum - no product came out when pumped - tried many times. Was unable to contact VoilaVe either by phone or email. Glad I was able to return to Amazon. Will not purchase again!</li>
    <li> No noticable difference in my skin whatsoever. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this in combination with Triple. C serum for about three weeks. And the results are unbelievable.  I used Olay regenerist&lt;br /&gt; also Roc and neither compared. My skin has essentially no fine lines and the wrinkles are not as deep and noticeable.  Love the products.</li>
    <li> Works really well as a firming serum for the face and neck. I apply an AHA exfoliant cream at night, use a charcoal facial scrub during my morning shower, and then apply this immediately afterwards. I saw results in about six weeks. Tighter skin on the face and neck to the point a couple of friends mentioned I was looking younger. One even accused me of using botox. Wish it were cheaper as a bottle only lasts six weeks.</li>
    <li> Does NOTHING! The product is basically just water. Followed the directions and used it twice a day for a month and I saw NO improvements.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a vitamin C serum for awhile since I am over 50 and starting to notice fine lines under my eyes and pores were getting on the large side as I have combination skin. I received my serum in 1 day which was sooner than expected. I had to try it that night as I was excited to see some results. I applied according to the directions and was amazed how refreshed my face felt and my pores seemed smaller by the next day. Within five days I&#x27;ve noticed the fine lines under my eyes have lessened in appearance, which is very exciting. I recommend moisturizing after each use as it keeps your skin feeling supple. I will continue to use this product twice a day and look forward to seeing even more results. I gave VoilaVe 4 starts for now and will submit another review after I&#x27;ve used the product for 30 days.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! It is by far the best vitamin c serum I have used so far and I have tried 6 others. I have even used a few vitamin c serums that cost over $80 per oz and this product is still much better! Wish I had found it sooner. My skin is so soft and several dark spots I had are almost gone. Amazing is all I can say!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I am buying this product and I absolutely love it. Cleared up most of my blackheads and keeps others at bay. Its amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! People think I am in my early 40&#x27;s when I am actually 53.  The serum has worked so well for me that I get comments all the time about how my skin looks.  Obviously I love that!    If you are looking for a serum to help your skin, reduce wrinkles, brighten your complection and simply help you look younger, this is the serum for you.  Trust me, i will be ordering it over and over and over.</li>
    <li> I have used many vitamin c serums, this one is by far the best. It goes on so easily and absorbs so quickly. Many serums I have used were sticky and took a long time to dry but this serum dried fast and there was no stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my results have been dramatic! I had these two faint lines on the side of my face, this serum actually took them away! I was so surprised. I also have been having an issue with my skin texture which has been very rough since childhood and this has made my skin so smooth and has totally even out my texture and tone. I will be buying again and referring all my friends.</li>
    <li> I really liked the way my skin felt after several days of using the Vitamin C Serum.  I did not expect to have my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that much change in my skin. I like the way it feels and I want to like this product but I can&#x27;t. Good news...no new wrinkles or big pores Bad news ... No changes.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this is the only serum I can use that doesnt sting my face in the slightest. It has 20% vitamin C and includes three differe types. I put it on my face before I go in the sun for extra sun protection and also before bed. Great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I purchase this product and it&#x27;s great. It works really good on my skin, delivery, discount offers and follow up by the company are very good. Will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> am not sure yet,is day 2. the price is right now does it work for this 54 year old with not many wrinkles but some melasma and dark spots</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 44yo who has recently fallen down the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; rabbit hole and have found two products that I will continue to purchase - one is this Vitamin C serum.  (The other is an 8 in 1 Anti-Aging serum which I discovered &amp; purchased thanks to Birchbox.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product exclusively for the last 3 weeks (I was out of the Marcelle and waffling on a purchase) I can say that I feel confident that the serum has significantly lightened my (significant) sun damage, and ticks off every box a 44 yo could want:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fine line and wrinkle reduction. YES&lt;br /&gt;-Your natural skin tone back. YES&lt;br /&gt;-Smoother, more vibrant skin. YES&lt;br /&gt;-Hydrated, healthier, younger skin. YES&lt;br /&gt;-Reduction in age spots, discoloration, and freckles. YES&lt;br /&gt;-Plumper, firmer, brighter, more RADIANT SKIN. YES YES YES&lt;br /&gt;And YES - less acne, even when I generally suffer from monthly hormonal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve had some DEEP forehead wrinkles for years that are wayyyyyyyyyyy less noticable now, as well!  This isn&#x27;t a placebo effect, everyone agrees there&#x27;s a significant difference now. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also repurchased the other anti-aging serum (as it has that &amp;#34;almost primer&amp;#34; serum feel, while this product simply dries down nicely) and will continue to use both - who wouldn&#x27;t? It&#x27;s SO rare for skin care products to actually work the way they purport to work.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, you need very little to do the job and after only three days I am seeing tighter, clearer skin with lightening of sun damaged spots. This is a real keeper!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It has really made a difference in my face.  I apply a small amount morning and night and my face looks younger and my skin feels softer and healthier.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this C serum and use as part of my daily face routine everyday. Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> very good product. have been using for about a month and my skin looks smoother. after it dries on my face i put coconut oil on.</li>
    <li> Just amazing feeling and result! I oderered 3 times this serum and will continue. Highly recommend for every woman after 40. The best!!!☺😊😃</li>
    <li> I have tried many vitamin c serums, but this is the best by far! It has no smell, goes on so smoothly, and within a week my face felt smoother. Even the uneven texture I had from some child hood acne is now smoothing out! I am so impressed. Nothing I have ever used in the past has worked like this. I also tried this on some spots I have from sun damage on my right arm and it has lightened them up considerably. All I can say is WOW! I will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> Have to be honest-- I do not usually bother writing reviews because I figure someone else will care enough to share, until I used VoilaVe&#x27;s Triple Action Vitamin C Serum.  I started using this product and I realized, WOW, I actually feel compelled to write a review.  This product is amazing.  Although I have used Vitamin C toners and moisturizers bought at my local health food stores, never before have I used a Vitamin C serum with hyaluronic acid.  Here is the kicker, I have not used the serum on a daily basis as recommended but have been using it only once a week as part of my home facial regimen.  Admittedly, I did not read the suggested use instructions before I began incorporating the product into my facials.  Even so, using it once a week, I can see and feel the difference.  My skin is more vibrant, my complexion more clear, the pores are smaller.  In fact, the texture has improved so much I keep wanting to touch my face (don&#x27;t do that!).  :)  However now that I know I can use it daily, morning and night, I am excited to see the results of more frequent, and regular use.  By the way, I emailed the co-founder and asked if they plan to create a Vitamin C toner and moisturizer to go with this serum.  She said those products are in the works but they have all-natural organic oils they recommend for moisturizers so I will check those out.  Maybe I will end up feeling compelled to write a review for those as well.  We will see.  Okay, that is all I have to say.  Thank you for reading.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me, however the company went out of their way to make sure I was happy.   I personally have had better results from other products, but not better customer service from those companies.  So 3 stars for the product/customer service scores averaged.  It&#x27;s worth a shot, it may work for you.</li>
    <li> I used this product for one month. It feels nice on the skin, but other than that I saw no noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> My skin looks better since I started to use this serum.</li>
    <li> great product. It&#x27;s hard to keep vitamin C stable, but this way of dispensing ensures that light cannot affect the C.</li>
    <li> not as great as another brand I used to use that&#x27;s now sold out (shessentials) but a good replacement for it for the time being.</li>
    <li> A very nice serum that works.  I very much appreciate the pump mechanism which no doubt helps to preserve the integrity of the product over time.</li>
    <li> I could not tell that this product is any better than what I already use, and it is more expensive.  It was a waste of money as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> I have just placed my third order for this.  I really love the product.  It has evened and brightened my skin.  Be careful with this product at first and follow the directions given as it will exfoliate your skin.  Be sure and use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see alot of change</li>
    <li> This product is true to the reviews! I noticed a dramatic change (Texture and overall healthy appearance) in my face within a week by using this product. Also, my son is now using this product, but not for the same reasons. He works out a lot and had horrible acne on his back. With regular use his acne is not completely gone, but hardly noticeable. Very pleased with this product and currently have purchased my third bottle!</li>
    <li> i am hopeful that it is doing the job,  It got great reviews for the triple ingredients</li>
    <li> I am using this serum after using derma micro needle roller and I noticed the results are better than what I was expecting. I will keep using it at least 2 times per week.</li>
    <li> DIY go on youtube and see how easy you can do it yourself for a fraction of the money. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I used all of this up.  I noticed that this seemed to help with my pimples.  I didn&#x27;t break out as much when I used this serum.  Maybe because it helps the skin heal or something.  Not sure.  Also, I noticed it faded my freckles to the point that one is hardly even noticeable anymore.  Which is awesome!  I didn&#x27;t really notice any drying affect, but that could be because I use Argan oil to moisturize with after applying this.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this years ago!  My skin looks and feels firmer and less wrinkled. My husband hasn&#x27;t noticed but I&#x27;m hopeful,  I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars if he does ;) Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been used it for almost 3 week I did not see any different. And I hate the smell of it but I have to keep used it cause I don&#x27;t like to wast money. Is really not working</li>
    <li> Wonderful product... been using it or several months.  60 year old skin with lots of sun damage.  Really makes an amazing difference.  My skin is best its been in several years.  Lots of compliments and much cheaper then botox and/or plastic surgery!</li>
    <li> My face feels more smooth, firm and radiant. I noticed it is helping diminish fine lines on my forehead.</li>
    <li> I have been using VoilaVe Triple Action Vitamin C Serum for several months now and I have to say that I love it!  It really has made the lines on my face and neck less noticeable (especially around my lips).  I use this one first then let it tighten a bit, then I put on the VoilaVe Hyaluronic, then the Eye Gel.  After that all tightens the Argan Oil goes on.  I sometimes mix the Rosehip Oil with the Argan Oil.  The smell of the Rosehip Oil is not my favorite, but the scent goes away quickly after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;beauty systems&amp;#34; from high-end department stores before and never got the hang of the process. These products are so easy to use and all their products combined don&#x27;t add up to the cost of one of those so-called high-end products.</li>
    <li> I have only had the product for a day; it is to early to say it works but from all indications I am delighted.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;A Daum</li>
    <li> I Love this I love the way it makes my face feel all day long I wear it under my make-up and it just makes my skin feel fabulous all day long. I get a lot of compliments on my skin at work.</li>
    <li> IT DID NOT PERFORM AS IT WAS SUPPOSE TO..... I AM DISAPPOINTED BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU ORDER BY MAIL...</li>
    <li> I was very skeptic, but this is an amazing product.  A friend whom I had not seen in a while came by after I used this a week or so.  They went on and on about how young I looked and asked what I had done.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this serum because I read online about vitamin C &#x27;s benefits for skin. Since I never took care of my skin until I got older, I wanted something like this to help the damage I&#x27;d already done and stop the constant dryness. I can tell a big difference after using this for a few weeks now. My dry areas became smooth and hydrated, and unlike with other products or regular lotion, my face stays smooth and soft throughout the day. Plus, the serum has a light, pleasant smell and pumps out in just the right amount so I don&#x27;t waste any. I&#x27;m happy to say my skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but the price is way beyond my reach now.  I guess ill have to age quicker now.  In any case when your skin &amp;#34;drinks&amp;#34; something that means its good.  When it can breathe after it drinks thats even better.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my skin.  I have very dry and sensitive skin so I do not blame this product.  Thanks !</li>
    <li> I like this product. My skin feels better and softer and it absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Light serum that works!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but my skin certainly seems smoother and that is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve used this product for about 6 weeks, and I can say that the brown spots are lighter.  I will continue to use it because it is easy to apply, works, and I want to see how far it can go.  Now, I am a woman of 77 who sat and worked in the California sun in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s when it was trendy and when there wasn&#x27;t sunblock available, and I am sure most of the damage was done then, but it didn&#x27;t show up as &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; til I was in my 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s,  So this is hard core stuff I&#x27;m trying to get rid of.  I notice that spots that have appeared in the last decade fade easier than the older ones, but even those are, very slowly, showing some progress.  My advice for those of you who are watching your own spots appear now, is get &#x27;em while they&#x27;re relatively new, use sunblock to keep what you can at bay, and be consistent in applying this product.  My one caveat is I wish it were sold in a larger quantity, because I am using it on my lower arms and back of hands, as well as the face and decolletage.</li>
    <li> I am 48 about to turn 49, and have a lot of skin damage from the sun. Nothing I tried had worked to repair the damage. The fine lines and just some of the wrinkles seemed like there was no hope. That is until I used the triple action c serum. This serum worked wonders on my face. The lines have been noticeably lessening and the overall texture of my skin has improved immensely. I am so impressed. I truly do look many years younger. Oh, I have been using this along with their hyaluronic acid serum and the two together really are amazing. I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> it seems ok, but have no result.</li>
    <li> Excellent product , I could almost feel the effect immediately , apply it at night and in the morning my face looks fresh .</li>
    <li> Product OK, but experience marred by company&#x27;s incessant soliciting.</li>
    <li> Lately I have been very conscious about taking care of my skin. I’m in my late twenties so it’s important to start taking care of my skin now before I start seeing fine lines and wrinkles. After doing some research I discovered that there are great benefits of using Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid as a skincare regimen to prevent the signs of aging. I decided to purchase VoilaVe Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid because it is alcohol free and paraben free and does not contain a bunch of harmful chemicals like some of the other vitamin C serums on the market. I love that the product comes in a convenient pump which makes application much easier. I have very sensitive breakout prone skin so I have to be careful what I use on my skin, and so far this product has been great! It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and healthy. Since I don’t necessarily have wrinkles I’m using this product more for wrinkle prevention and to slow the aging process. I have some acne scarring on my face and this product really helped even out my complexion and lightened some of the scarring that I had. I can’t say enough good things about this product, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve tried many expensive serums and they certainly didn&#x27;t do as well as this serum.  Within a day or two my skin looked brighter, firmer, and my pores looked smaller.  I bought in July and am ordering a second bottle today. You only use a small amount but I use it on my face, neck and hands.  I&#x27;m 65 and it really made my skin look so much smoother.  I got follow up emails from the company asking how I liked the product and was it working for me.  I really like that.</li>
    <li> I have always been prone to dry skin, especially on my face. This is even further worsened by the winter and my pregnancy. I have been trying different products in search of the ideal solution for my problem. I stumbled upon this Vitamin C serum and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so happy that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this serum alleviated my dry skin concerns, it has helped to enhance the glow of pregnancy and bring some youth and brightness back to my face and around my eyes. It&#x27;s a wonderful product and has been nothing short of a godsend for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was packaged nicely and arrived almost overnight! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and love the results. My face feels smoother and looks healthier. I cannot say enough about how fantastic it has been!</li>
    <li> I thought it worked well.  I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> I think I have to try this product a little longer.  I am 82 years young so I&#x27;ll give it a little longer to work!</li>
    <li> I just ordered a third bottle.  I have very sensitive sun damaged skin.  This product makes my skin softer and seems to sooth the sun damaged places.  No irritation.  The company foloowed up with an email and a telephone call whiich was unexpected and appreciated.  Hope it helps my many wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have always had oily skin and prone to breakouts.  It penetrates immediately and seems to smoothen my skin.  Not greasy like other products I have tried.  Also I have noticed some red spots that I have had seem to be fading.  I would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
    <li> I have never used Vitamin C serum until now. I love this product. I can notice a change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Pricey but works kinda</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and have less redness and less oily t-zone.  Pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old. I&#x27;ve been using Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid for about 2 months now and I definitely notice a difference. My skin is tighter and smoother. Over the weekend, when I&#x27;m off work, I tend to be more slack with my skin care routine. Monday morning, I can tell! As the directions say, use with a moisturizer. I find the combination works beautifully. A little of this goes a long way. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed on a couple of morning I&#x27;ve forgotten to apply before makeup, my foundation doesn&#x27;t look nearly as smooth. I love this stuff and will definitely be ordering again!.</li>
    <li> for myself it was too strong. even if i used a pinch</li>
    <li> Just started using it, but can tell I will love it. I have been using Vitamin C Serums for years and this one seems superior.</li>
    <li> I have only been using Voila Ve about a week.  I have had no problem with the product. No smell which is good. Nothing unpleasant about it.  No response however.  Too early to to tell.</li>
    <li> Great product and good customer service.</li>
    <li> I have not used this as much as my Organic Rose Hip Oil and Low &amp; High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum from VoilaVe because I was concerned it caused a break-out when I first used it. Turns out I found the culprit and it wasn&#x27;t this serum so I started using it again, only to have the pump stop working lol. The pump works sporadically so I still use it but I did drop the rating to 4 stars because it&#x27;s a pain to get working again when it decided it wants to stop. Anyway, the three products together have really softened my face and brightened my complexion. I&#x27;m very impressed with VoilaVe&#x27;s line of skin care and thinking about trying out their Argan Oil once I run out of my current brand.</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  I have finished about 2/3 of it.  I think it helped me.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference in a week,wow</li>
    <li> I like it......so far this is one of the best of its kind.</li>
    <li> Price is reasonable. I&#x27;ve tried not just 4 different kinds of leading brand to remove saggy skin and dark spots/circles below my eyes that creates an older face. This serum is amazing. You&#x27;ll think by reading it contains Vit. C, has harsh ingredient. Nope. I was mistaken. I was skeptical to purchase this item but thanks to Amazon and due to over 500 written reviews with 4.5 star rate. I myself was able to prove that this is really 5 stars. I also use this all over my face and within 3 days application, I&#x27;ve seen an immediate improvement. My eyes sagginess and color improves to 80% including less visibility of face lines. I&#x27;m completely sold and would highly recommend this to all even to past 50 years of age who wants to enhance their youth and maintain it.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing mostly for the excellent customer service I received. My inquiries were answered very quickly and the founder stands behind her product and guarantee.  I used it on and off (perhaps not as regularly as I should have) and noticed smoother feeling skin.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any diffrence in my skin. I have used it for 1 full week thus far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this vitamin C serum for less than a month and my skin is literally glowing, I look lighter and a sunspot I had has almost completely vanished, this is very effective, I will buy it again, I used a different vitamin C serum but this has done much more for skin, I am surprised because the other one said it contained other things this doesn´t like hyaluronic acid and other stuff but this one has resulted way more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don´t like is the spray button I push it and it doesn´t spray it pours everything down, I don´t know if it´s that mine came deffective but anyways the product is really good! Even people have complimented my skin hahaha :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results I have had in less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! It&#x27;s super silky feeling, and it makes my skin feel really good. Its moisturizing and gives my skin a nice glow, without making it look oily. I like using it especially because I&#x27;ve been tanning, and it helps reduce sun damage. I recommend this :)</li>
    <li> before i had finished using the first bottle of this stuff, i started to notice that my skin looked brighter, healthier.  i ran out on a trip and didn&#x27;t think anything of it.  after i got home, i noticed that my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; had faded.  that&#x27;s when i ordered another bottle.  i normally scoff at all the claims made by beauty product manufacturers because they never seem to pan out in real life applications.  if you want to look healthier and &amp;#34;glowier&amp;#34; and be happier with the face you see in the mirror, give this one a try.  i can definitely see the difference when i don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> I need more time, but I already love this product because it has help to eliminate my oily skin.  My makeup last so much longer.  I will continue&lt;br /&gt;to use this.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months.  I recommend it especially for those over 50.</li>
    <li> This product, after only 2 weeks use, has almost eliminated the small wrinkles around my mouth.  Definitely will be a re-order.  UPDATE: Above was after my first order of this product.  Now I am on my third reorder and I don&#x27;t intend to stop using it.  My skin looks amazing; youthful in color, smaller pores, and reduced depth and number of wrinkles.  This product is definitely a keeper in the fight against aging.  I am 62 now and my skin looks better, fresher than in my early 50&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum for your face makes your face look healthier. Goes on easy, dries fast, feels good.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Make my face feel really good.</li>
    <li> Not good did not see a difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I think my skin is more refined.</li>
    <li> This serum as been a life saver. It truly rejuvenated my skin. I recommend it highly to anyone that want younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I thought I would really like this product because of all the great reviews, PLUS I have been trying to find a Vitamin C Serum in a Pump for a while now because I didn&#x27;t like dealing with the &amp;#34;eye Dropper&amp;#34; styles.  This serum has the thinnest consistency of any one I have ever tried, it was just like water in a pump!  I would pump it onto my finger and it would roll right off (yes I tried shaking the bottle before pumping!) I could barely get it to my face half the time and when I did the serum was so thin I could not spread it all over the side of my face because it would roll off so fast!l  I know it is made up of water and Vitamin C but I feel there should be a little more consistency to it, it should adhere to your face a little bit before it absorbs.  Perhaps I got a defective container?&lt;br /&gt; I was very disappointed after all the great reviews!  I&#x27;ll have to search around again for another Pump or tube type!  Any suggestions anyone has, I would greatly appreciate :).</li>
    <li> I get compliments almost everyday on how bright and perfect my skin looks. I use several Voila Ve products, but I really couldn&#x27;t live without this one!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time, in good condition. I use it in the morning under make up, I did notice additional dryness. So I got a new hydration product as well. I started to get comments on my skin....that I looked years younger...it felt great. So when I finished the first bottle, I bought another, and it is now part of my regime.</li>
    <li> Hi good evening,i already see how this Triple Vitamin C serum..is vanishing my sun dark spots..n hoping they will dissapear completely..thanks for this marvelous product</li>
    <li> Will reorder more  good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my face feel silky smooth!! I apply this product every morning and night.1 bottle lasts about 1.5 months...</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00FFANXMM Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid for Face - Contains Three Forms of Vitamin C for Superior Results - Pure &amp; No Fillers - Neutralizes Free Radicals - Finest Serum Available - 1 oz]][[ASIN:B00FFANXMM Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid for Face - Contains Three Forms of Vitamin C for Superior Results - Pure &amp; No Fillers - Neutralizes Free Radicals - Finest Serum Available - 1 oz]]I love this product! I am sensitive to chemical smells and I can easily use this product. It has a light citrus smell that is wonderful. I use it twice a day every day. Friends ask me what I am doing to have such youthful skin. I am 52 and most people guess I am in my 30s. Thanks VoilaVe!</li>
    <li> Very nice, gentle serum makes skin smoother and softer</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I ordered 3 bottles for my daughters. After about 2 weeks, my skin looks brighter, smoother, less lines and less pimples.</li>
    <li> loved what this did for my skin, after a couple weeks my skin was glowing, on my second bottle :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum now for almost a week and it&#x27;s been great! I&#x27;ve been using a prescription retinoid for the past few months (to clear up some marks) but wanted to discontinue using it was too drying and irritating for me. So, I decided to add a vitamin c serum to my skincare routine in place of the retinoid. I ordered this product because of the great reviews, great price, and because it contained more stable and lesser irritating versions of vitamin c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially afraid that the serum would make my even drier than it already is (thanks to the retinoid!) but that wasn&#x27;t the case. My skin absorbed the serum fast, and didn&#x27;t cause too much drying. I&#x27;ve used one drop every night (will be using it day and night once my skin&#x27;s well-adjusted to it), and follow up with a moisturizer. I see a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone and clarity and feel that with continued use, my hyper-pigmented marks will fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is also convenient to use instead of a dropper, and there is a fair amount of product. I was also pleased with the fast shipping and great customer service. Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> I just happened to stumble onto this serum about a week ago. I added it to my daily regimen of PTR products. I am just amazed at what I have seen in just 5 days of applying it twice a day. I never have luck with skin care products this quickly. Let me add that I am 38 with very few wrinkles thanks to my mom introducing me to good skin care habits at the age of 12. However, I am blonde and very fair with freckles. Freckles that multiply when I am in the sun even with the 50spf I wear in my sunscreen and the 30 spf that is in my bb cream that I apply to even out of my tone. Some areas on my face almost look like dirty spots from the freckles all combining and overlapping each other. It was never this bad until I was pregnant with my twins and developed the pregnancy mask that changed my skin tone forever. I recently started using other vitamin C products from PTR line along with a very good peel that I use at least twice a week. My skin had already started improving when I switched over to these products. The total skin care boost came when I started using this Triple Action Vit C Serum. I first started noticing that my skin had a nice healthy glow to it. Instead of being the dull pale color with freckle blotches, I finally had some pink in my cheeks and other area on my face that made my skin just glow. I then noticed that the two hard little bumps that have been on my cheek the past year have totally disappeared. I have tried everything too to get rid of them down to basically picking them off. Well they are completely gone! Not only that, but my &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; spots have really started to fade. I recommend to everyone to buy this product!!! It is excellence in a bottle! I have used skin care lines that I have to get from doctors that have not done what this serum does. Voile Ve&#x27;...I hope you come out with more amazing products!!! I can&#x27;t wait to come back and update my review after I have been using this a while. I have a feeling the results are going to be awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have found products containing vitamin C that I have used in the past, had a distinctive smell of the vitamin, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;I do not smell the vitamin C in this product at all, so I am just curious as to just how much of the actual vitamin C is in this product?&lt;br /&gt;And although I do like the way that it feels on my skin, I am not sure that I am getting the full benefits of &#x27;C&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This serum is really good , it firmed my skin and helped lighten some of my acne scars .it&#x27;s excellent as a make up primer and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone very reactive skin so I&#x27;m really grateful for that . I&#x27;ve used this  product a few weeks and I&#x27;m excited to see futher results.</li>
    <li> One morning I looked in the mirror and thought, wow when did I get old? I did some research on different natural ways of stopping and hopefully correcting what time and lack of moisturizer had done to me. I saw a ton of reviews about some really expensive stuff, but not wanting to try something that cost over $100 a month only to find that it did not work. I ran across the amazing reviews of this serum. And the price was great, so thought I would try it. I naturally have very oily skin, and was worried this would add extra oil. I was pleasantly surprised with serum as it did not add more oils and made my skin feel so smooth all day. I have seen the younger me slowing emerging. The only tip I would give is little is more. One to maybe two drops will go a long way. Truly great stuff here!</li>
    <li> skin is tightening up, does what it advertizes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 2 months now and I can definitely notice when I forget to use it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and has cleared up a lot of my trouble areas that I haven&#x27;t been able to treat unit now. I&#x27;m really glad I came across this product and will definitely be buying it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I used this product 3 weeks more..  I tried many expensive serum , but this product really help my skin... the customer service lady teach me not use the toner before use this product.. really work ! Because my skin very sensitive n dry.. Now! My skin not dry , very smooth n shinny.. I&#x27;ll buy more for my sisters to try. I&#x27;ll keep going to use.. Good price n great product. I love it .. thank you Amazon n customer service (Susan) to follow up the customer feedback. Great service!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for wrinkles...because as of yet i don&#x27;t have them. I can&#x27;t speak about makeup...as I rarely wear it. I can&#x27;t even mention acne because I only get a zit once in a blue moon. I&#x27;m 30, fairly healthy, with good skin. For obvious reasons I had never thought about buying cream and products. I don&#x27;t have a nightly regime that I slather on my face. I&#x27;m against a lot of the products on the market due to all the chemicals that my system really doesn&#x27;t need. Why then am I writing a review for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VoilaVe then? Because they are the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who gave me one as a gift to test drive for the sole fact she knows I don&#x27;t generally buy into this kind of stuff. But she tried it and thought for once that I may actually change my mind. I did. Considering this is the only thing in my &amp;#34;regime&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m not fighting major battles with difficult skin issues it was actually very easy to see the change in my skin...immediately. My skin was smoother and softer. I actually didn&#x27;t realize that my skin was a little rough until I felt it after using this. Two squirts from the bottle was more than plenty. Considering the size of the bottle you get, this skin serum is going to last me a looong time. So well worth the money. Add into the fact that if you look at the ingredients on the back you will see minimal additive. That&#x27;s right, only a few ingredients instead of a ton of toxic chemicals you normally would have to wade through. That&#x27;s another huge bonus for me. Fragrance free as well and goes on smoothly without drip or grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this is a big winner for anyone looking to improve the tone and texture of their skin. Considering the exceptional price, there&#x27;s no way you could find the equivalent of VoileVe elsewhere. So a must buy, hands down.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month now and I can see some of the brown spots on my face despairing. I am using it after Derma roller applications. My daughter tried it. She also loved it and I purchased a second bottle for her.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Voilave triple vitamin C serum + hyaluronic acid. Somewhat watery. Tried it for about 3 weeks. Goes on smoothly  with no dryness. Haven&#x27;t seen any different in my skin.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this for the fourth time -- or maybe it&#x27;s the fifth. I&#x27;ve looked at all the Vitamin C serums on the market and I believe this is the best. Here&#x27;s why: Vitamin C is very unstable and will not stay potent unless packaged to protect it from light and air. This pump bottle has the best packaging I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon. I don&#x27;t think everyone understands how crucial that is. Secondly, the ingredients are great with no tricks or fillers. Some other serums contain fragrant plant oils that give the product a seductive scent, but fragrances, whether natural or synthetic, are always irritating to the skin. This serums is absolutely fragrance-free. Also, it glides on smoothly and is a pleasure to use. I use two pumps on my face and neck every morning. It absorbs quickly within seconds, leaving absolutely no residue, ready for moisturizing. Finally, it works. It has helped me get rid of a lot of unevenness, old acne scars, brown spot. This product is now an essential part of my morning skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that I respect the integrity of this company. They don&#x27;t relentlessly solicit 5-star reviews from you with questionable tactics like promises of free products or other rewards. They leave you alone. I did get a 20% off coupon in my email this summer, which I immediately put to good use. :)</li>
    <li> Clears skin so good_highly recommend this !!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a few positive results, as follows:&lt;br /&gt;- my fine lines are diminished,&lt;br /&gt;- my dark spots are fading, and&lt;br /&gt;- my skin is more resilient and firm.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase and use this product twice a day, every day.</li>
    <li> Not work worse my wrinkle not help it....</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I noticed a difference in my skin in just a couple days. My pores looked smaller and my complexion just looked better. You really only need to use just a little so the bottle will last a little while. I highly recommend this product. I did receive this product to try for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I like this serum a lot. My cace is much firmer after using derma roller</li>
    <li> Liked it, was okay but not enough to buy again. Great company and customer service.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and slowly my wrinkles are becoming smaller and I will continue using this serum..  It does work if you follow the directions&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this  product.</li>
    <li> I like it, but can only use every other day with my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  Will leave your skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> i am using the serum for a week now and am amazed how it tightens my skin and it also leaves a beautiful glow. i will definitely reorder . don&#x27;t know when that will be since it takes so little serum to get such wonderful result.</li>
    <li> This serum is incredible. I ordered this serum several months ago, I never wrote a review but decided I needed to write one. I bought this for my wife, she didn&#x27;t use it right away. Then, last month, she started using it. She is beautiful, but she does have some fine lines around her forehead and eyes so she focused on those areas. Wow! In the last month not only can you see a decrease in her lines, but her complexion, skin tone, and texture all have improved. She truly does look years younger! I would highly recommend this vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> The gesture of this serum is so soft and wonderful. I really love the way it glides on my skin. I have had no dryness whatsoever and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft. Whether it helps my skin or not, I love putting this on before my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about four days and already notice a difference.  My skin feels smoother and looks better.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in two weeks.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
    <li> Serum does what it says. I use 1 pump for my face and neck, and my skin feels more supple, and less dry.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a week but have already seen results with a crease I have had above my jaw area.  It was very pronounced but now is nearly invisible.  I can&#x27;t wait for more results after I have used it longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. After a perfect delivery, I tried the triple action vitamin C serum and found it has a very light scent which I liked and it goes on like silk. Leaves your skin feeling healthy. Love it, even recommended to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> This serum works like magic.  My face feels and looks younger.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product and it is very light , it makes my face feel tight... I really appreciate how the seller checked in to give me additional information about the product and to see if I was pleased with the product thus far....I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It makes my skin feel so smooth after using it and with just a little bit of my moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results this brings!</li>
    <li> It is amazing serum, i don&#x60;t have a wrinkles but my dark circles gone in 1 day! I love it!</li>
    <li> I seriously love the fact that the serum is alcohol and paraben free The serum not only has Vitamin C in it, it also has Hyaluronic Acid in it as well.It is a clear liquid that has a very light scent. When I applied it to my face it immediately soaked into my skin. It feels very lightweight and did not make my face feel oily or sticky. It actually feels very refreshing on my face .Forget the facelift, lasers, and chemical peels! Vitamin C has been shown to be just as effective at reversing the effects of time and environmental damage to the skin. Notice brighter, smoother skin! As the serum penetrates deep into your skin, you can feel confident knowing you are reversing skin aging and preventing further damage at the same time. You deserve to have young, beautiful skin at any age, and now you can! I highly recommend this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.I haven&#x27;t used face-creams for years as I thought nothing actually worked. Tried this prodoctu for the first time last night - in a face mask. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes... I honestly looked a lot younger when I woke up in the morning. The wrinkly bits and red bits didn&#x27;t look red and wrinkly any more - except for around my eyes, it will take a little longer, but they did look a lot less wrinkly and the dark circles were nearly gone - after one day! Unbelievable but true. Right now my skin looks healthy, smooth... I highly recomended this serum...</li>
    <li> VoileVe Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid - Got this on a promotion and I love using serums so much now over just moisturizer creams and lotions. This really penetrated and I do get visible results from consistent use.  I have been applying it every night - I started with twice a day but found I was getting a little red so I am using this at night and the moisturizing cream with Vitamin C and B in the am.  The packaging on this product is heads above other all natural vitamin serums that have that made on the kitchen table home-spun look the bottle and the labeling has a upscale and professional look that would be a nice gift item.  Great job - great formula and a good price.</li>
    <li> 2016 UPDATE: for months I used this serum and thought I had good results then the owner of the company Dan emails me and going back and forward I realized DUH I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly.  NOW I have awesome results with great customer service. Kinda GREAT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME!! I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out what happened to my product. Shipped very quickly but it opened and leaked. Is it safe to try still?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a discount for trying this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I have gotten so many compliments after only a week people actually notice and ask what I have done to my eyes because it has totally brightenedy entire face!!</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of months and didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and assistance very good products</li>
    <li> Works great.  Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
    <li> I use it twice daily. I totally cut out foundation and powder out of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do suggest using Moisturizer. My face went dry without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m 25 w/ fine lines. Granted they are still there slightly, but fading.)</li>
    <li> I have ordered this for a long time and loved it but all the sudden they shrunk down to size so much and you get only a small pecentage of product with each order. Irritating to say the least. I hate constantly having to reorder. Give an option for people to order a small size or a large size and price accordingly.</li>
    <li> Helpful for aging skin</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Feels great on my face. Wrinkles are less pronounced. Love all the products of this company.</li>
    <li> I like, my face shines. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in perfect condition and was nice to use. Thx</li>
    <li> Ok, so have only been using for about 3 days... I swear I see a little difference, wishful thinking maybe ?  But no dryness or irritation, so thats good.. I will post another review in a week or so...</li>
    <li> The product seemed to give my face a clean, glowing appearance. Goes on smoothly and dries quickly so that I can use my moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> Not sure what this did. Not much in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry skin as I live in a dry climate, and was very much looking for a new cream for my face.  The Triple Action Vitamin C formula first got my attention because I really enjoy naturalistic products.  Within a couple days, I found that I really enjoyed this product.  It wasn&#x27;t greasy and left my face feeling refresh and smooth.  Not only that, but I found the ingredients in this lotion to be very complimentary to my skin. It addition to that, the bottle was a perfect size and I know I will be able to bring it with me when I travel. I tend to use this product right before I go to bed, and it leaves my face nice and smooth! I couldn&#x27;t be happier, it is definitely a 5 star face lotion. I can see myself using this for quite a while, and I encourage new buyers not to hesitate.  You won&#x27;t be let down!</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels much smoother and looks more hydrated</li>
    <li> I am a total skincare junkie to the point where I am always on the look out for the next best quality product.  However throughout the years I have been greatly disappointed by a lot of high end and low end brands with their level of quality.  One thing I except from skincare companies is honesty and transparency with their ingredients on all their products.  I hate seeing companies that claim to be all natural, and yet upon a further look at their product list, you find things like alcohol, fragrances, witch hazel and fillers which really affect the health of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly enjoy VoilaVe products because of their honesty and integrity to their consumers. So far all their products that I have used from them contain no alcohol, fillers, binders or fragrances (to name a new) in their bottles.  What you see and read is what you get.  Many of their products are certified organic, none are tested on animals and all their products are made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently tired a bottle of their VoilaVe Triple Action Vitamin C Serum.  Now I was really curious in trying this out because I had never heard of a &amp;#34;triple action&amp;#34; vitamin C serum.  In my whole time of being a beauty blogger and learning about skincare products, I didn&#x27;t really know how many different possible levels of vitamin C that existed.  Nonetheless VoliaVe was able to bottle this in one, PLUS it also contains hyaluronic acid which is awesome.  I remember thinking when I was waiting for this product in the mail &amp;#34;man if only it contained hyaluronic acid it would so totally rock!&amp;#34;  When I finally got the bottle and read the ingredients I was excited!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in a long 1oz bottle in a pump action form which I thought was amazing.  You see, normally vitamin C comes (or should come) in the form of a dark opaque bottle with a droplet.  However the only problem with that, is that its a race against time before the vitamin C which is an antioxidantgoes bad.  Normally you have about three months to use up a bottle of vitamin C before it loses it full effect.  So in this case bigger is not always better.  Antioxidants breakdown with light and air.  However VoilaVe vitamin C was packaged in a air tight pump action container with the companies logo and information wrapped around the bottle to protect it from light.  I thought this was brilliant because that meant I wasn&#x27;t acting like a speed devil using useless amounts of vitamin C in order to finish it up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a clear form and you honestly need only one drop for your whole face.  The pump action is very controlled so that a large amount does not dispense causing waste.  It glides on smoothly on the skin and absorbs quickly with no residue left behind.  This serum works great for those who have uneven skin tone, dryness and dull looking complexions. It helps with redness on the face and acne scars to name a few.  The hyaluronic acid helps to plump out the skin, diminish the looks of fine lines and wrinkles, and smooth out your skin.  VoilaVe also produces a Hyaluronic Acid on its own which is really worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for almost three weeks, I have to say I am totally pleased!  Everything this product claims to do it has done.  My face really feels the changes in the look and texture because of this product.  This products contains to even out my skin tone, reduce the redness around my nose and plump out my skin with a healthy looking glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have yet to end up with bad results or any allergic reaction from any of their products.  I honestly cannot say enough about this company and the amazing quality of products they put out.</li>
    <li> Drying. No change in skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome smoothing agent</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. First of all, the company really shows they care for the customer. They sent me an ebook giving tips on how to optimize the use of this product and how to keep my skin looking young. I was very impressed by how much they care. My skin, which is very sensitive, looks much better. I&#x60;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I can start to notice a better quality. I definitely recommend this product and this company as a whole. Will try more of their products.</li>
    <li> This Serum delivered was I was hoping for; I did the research on Hyaluronic Acid and its recommended to close pores and fade brown spots. I already have tried other products that did not delivered, I think is because the HA is higher on this product and the addition of the vitamn C makes it work faster. I have been using it for 10 days. After I wash my face AM I aplly all over my face and on PM only the areas I have problems with. My nose was an issue with large pores and my cheek had a medium size brown spot that I had not even able to take it off with laser. This Serum has been fading this brown spot slowly and now I don&#x27;t have to use double layer makeup on this side of my face. At night I do a little of the Serum on my nose and cheeks. So far it has delivered what it promised!</li>
    <li> Love this product is great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for the past three weeks and have found that my fine facial lines have diminished and my face feels smooth and silky.  Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Looking forward to the addition of their pure hyaluronic acid to their product line.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING. I searched endlessly on amazon for the perfect serum with hyaluronic acid and found this product to have the best reviews. Firstly, it arrived very quickly. Also, the co-creator of the product, Susan, personally emailed me to ask if my product had arrived and how it was working..a very nice touch. So a couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work your way up to the amount you use. It&#x27;s extremely powerful and concentrated. The first time I put it on, I got these red bumps on my face and my skin was burning. I thought, ah I wasted money! I immediately washed my face and didn&#x27;t use it for two days. But after speaking to Susan about it, she suggested I use very tiny drops to let the skin adapt. Voila it worked. I use now two pumps for my whole face and a little on my neck. A little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally a week later, the &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; around my eyes were significantly reduced! My skin is so much smoother and retains moisture, a lot of my friends have commented that my skin looks much more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best also to put it in the morning after you wash up and before you go to bed. It is quite drying though, at least on my skin. After the serum has completely sunk in to my face, I put on my usual moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s but I wanted to start taking care of my skin now so that I can prevent lines and wrinkles in the future. I absolutely adore this product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I tried the product. I only used it twice so far and I already noticed that my skin feels smoother and firmness. I like it so far. I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in a few weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> My only problem with this product is that the bottle give you know indication when you are running low or your rate of consumption.</li>
    <li> Great product. It feels moisturizing even though it is a serum. Way less expensive than any other vitamin cserum I have ever tried and seems just as good so far.</li>
    <li> I sure hope I can continue to buy this for the rest of my life everybody should have this on their face it&#x27;s a great supplement for the skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this this serum for just under one week and I can honestly say, Triple Action Vitamin C Serum works like magic. I have been using Vitamin C serums from several companies, most recently from Mychelle and Dermalure. When it was time to re-order, I stumbled upon VoilaVe Triple Action Vitamin C and read through the reviews. I bought it right there and then and it arrived within a couple of days. Within the first application, I knew this is what I&#x27;ve been searching for. This serum tightens the skin instantly. I cannot wait to see the results after 30 days. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I believe makeup goes on flawlessly if the skin beneath it is nourished. Often times, I start by doing a DIY turmeric mask or  DIY facial scrub before moisturizing the face. I cannot wait to have my friends and clients try this serum. The company also has amazing customer follow up. Susan immediately emailed me to see how things are working out. It&#x27;s not too often that you get a follow up from a company after you purchase a product. That&#x27;s a winner in my book!!!!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for over a month now it feels good on your face,you use before your moisturizer but I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my face at all.The company is real nice I do have to say that.I use it every morning and evening.I still have half a bottle left so maybe at the end of the bottke I&#x27;ll be able to see a bigger difference,but I  can tell my lines around my eyes aren&#x27;t quite as noticeable</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really see a difference. Skin feels a little softer but could be from change in weather. Too much money</li>
    <li> Does what it says... I read the  reviews. My face looks fresh, young , and let me tell you all my co-workers are 25 yrs young than myself and my skin look just as young</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good reviews and price.  However, I prefer a product that combines vitamin C with moisturizer in one bottle.  I used to use a vit c with cucumber combined that worked great, it&#x27;s was too expensive so the hunt continues.</li>
    <li> Maybe too early to rate, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  Probably will not buy again.  My old product, in my opinion, works much better</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen and have found my skin really sagging and wrinkling.  I used my first bottle of the serum and noticed my skin looked firmer.  The wrinkles around my mouth seemed to not be as deep.  I have started my 2nd bottle as I know at my age it will not work an over night miracle, but it does appear it may improve my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is every thing it stated it is. I am not disappointed in the high quality of this product or it excellent results. After trying several other products, this is the only one you will ever need. It is the only one I will ever use again. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to look younger, reduce fine lines and give your skin a youthful glow.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work fairly well.  I am using my second bottle of the serum and it does seem to make my face feel&lt;br /&gt;softer and smoother.  I am 65 years of age and my skin is not winkled a lot around my eyes or my mouth but, I was beginning to get the early jowls around my mouth. At this point I must say that they appear to have receded.  The serum smooths on easily and quickly so that morning and bedtime routine is completed in a very timely fashion.  I&#x27;m very happy with the outcome thus far.  This product will last about a month and only costs $23.00 which I thought was amazing for what it does.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum. Better than many others I have tried. I actually had some friends at work tell me my face looks bright and refreshed. It has helped smooth my skin and even out the skin tone. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> love the texture and makes my skin feel good after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;Makes it brighter and feels healthier. I feel like I am doing something good for my skin!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product but it didn&#x27;t have enough in the bottle as it suggests that u use it twice a day to get results, which I did but it ran out quickly and I was conservative,  I would suggest this company put more in the bottle for the price of $27.00.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> I just received my triple action serum. It goes on smoothly, and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  Makeup applies over it nicely.  Another reviewer said it was gritty, but that is not my experience at all.  I feel like it I like that it has a slight tingle which leaves me feeling like it&#x27;s working and I have not had any irritation or redness. To my senses, it is basically unscented, which works for me. Get the free ebook for more directions. Use a moisturizer. I give it 4 stars until I update...I am optimistic that this product will help with my dark spots, and lines... good customer service and fast shipping. update to 5 stars. I have seen good results with Triple action Vitamin C.  evens out my skin tone very well.</li>
    <li> i like to use it after i use the derma roller,it gets on very easy and absorbs nicely after i massage into my skin on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use with their hyaluronic serum. Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it. My skin looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> I used a small amount under my moisturizer and liquid foundation. It makes my fine lines disappear. Just what I expect from a serum and the price is great. About half of what I used to pay.</li>
    <li> I did not expect the results I have been experiencing with this product.  I&#x27;ve used C serums in the past and they took months to work, and worked only on my wrinkles.  Immediately this product made my skin feel silky.  Within a couple of weeks I noticed my skin &amp;#34;looked&amp;#34; smoother.  I was pleasantly shocked!  It has been nearly a month now and even though it&#x27;s winter here my tiny wrinkles are less noticeable.  Most remarkable, though, is that my turkey neck is so much better.  I can&#x27;t imagine what&#x27;s next but am very excited to find out.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel like sand paper.  I put it on and once it dries it feels like a mask of on my face.  It causes my skin to look very dry and flaky.  I don&#x27;t see the hype here.  I&#x27;ve been using if for over a week now as directed and have only experienced extremely dry skin.  It must not be good for normal skin - maybe good only for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I like triple action the best! I&#x27;ve tried two others and this is the absolutely the best. Thank you</li>
    <li> This cream really does work. Within a week of using it, my skin is brighter, clearer and the lines are softer... Worth every penny so far!! thanks!!</li>
    <li> VoilaVe serum is a very is a great product. A little goes along way, and you can feel it tightening the skin as soon as you apply. If you are expecting a product that removes wrinkles this is not it, but is there any that really does?  I will buy again and would recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I am a 58 year young woman who got my mother&#x27;s Irish ruddy complexion and not my Spanish father&#x27;s smooth skin. I have used many products over the years to help with complexion but, never felt satisfied.  After two weeks of using Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid, at night, I have noticed my skin looking and feeling smoother and glowing.  I highly recommend this product and will be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> Great results.  My skin has never been better in years.</li>
    <li> I just received this product earlier this week, but already I can tell difference in my skin. I use it in the morning and in the evening and my skin already feels softer and smoother. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It feels fine I hope it works with the time</li>
    <li> Just love this product. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and I could see the result before finishing my first bottle.</li>
    <li> Have used vitamin C serum for several years.  This product does an excellent job.  I will continue to order it, regardless of offer for review.  I use it daily before tint moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this because  I read a review by someone who said this product removed the puffiness under her eyes. She was right! My under eye circles are not nearly as puffy, and the dark circles are not as dark! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good prodct, but not curative, is preventive.</li>
    <li> This absorbs easily and I like the fact that it also has Hyalurlonic acid in it.  I have been using Skin Ceuticals Vit. C and this does just as well</li>
    <li> It stinks like rotten water, but still i continued for couple of weeks. No results what so ever!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has severe eczema. This product is amazing! It clears up her break outs quickly. My other daughter uses it for acne break outs. They both love it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  I love the way it goes on so easily.  It dries quickly and makes my skin much smoother quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to use the product a bit longer for full effect but I feel it is doing well and will continue to improve my skin as the days go by.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Makes skin look and feel younger.  The only drawback is that the directions require you to use a moisturizer after applying.  I wish they sold or advertised a recommended moisturizer along with the product, I can&#x27;t help but think that all moisturizers aren&#x27;t created equally.  I am not convinced that the product is any better than other hyaluronic acid facial products.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and love this 3x Vit C serum + Hyaluronic Acid product.  It also helps blemishes to disappear sooner.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about a month now.  I use it once a day and you only need a very little to cover your face.  I follow up with an excellent moisturizer.  I notice my skin is softer and has a healthier look.  I don&#x27;t know about reducing wrinkles but it has absolutely reduced the color of my age spots.  I am hoping with continual use they will completely disappear.  I also had several dry spots that have gone away.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this serum! After using it for a week I have had no irritation and can see several areas of my face improving. Will continue using it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a little over 1 month and I&#x27;m beginning to see results. My face glows, my freckles are a bit lighter, people are asking me if I did something to my face like &amp;#34;Botox&amp;#34;. I just ordered another bottle, I hope I continue to see more results with time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week, so can&#x27;t tell anything at this point.  I&#x27;m hoping to notice something by the end of the month.  Problem is, I also started using a phytoceramide product Dr. Oz recommends at the very same time.  Dumb, I know.  But I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started.  So if I do notice a change, I guess I&#x27;ll have to use both products forever!</li>
    <li> This product is nicely priced (I pd $17.50), but it&#x27;s like putting a thin coat of glue on my face. As soon as it dries, my face feels dry and taut. Very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably-price serum that works as promised.  One squirt covers my whole face, and for the first time after using any facial product I am seeing a noticeable reduction in the size of my pores. It has smoothed my complexion, as well. They also have excellent customer service, with a representative contacting me to see how well I like their product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like the way it sinks right into the skin, especially after a microdermabrasion session.  It feels good on the skin, moisturizing but not greasy.  The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that sometimes it can feel a little sticky--that does go away as it dries and doesn&#x27;t happen most of the time, though.  I also found it a little creepy that the company called to ask that I write a review.</li>
    <li> I am a middle aged woman who has watched my skin become duller over the years. This is the first product that has seemed to visibly help in terms of brightness, smoothness, and much more uniform appearance. Years of spending time in the sun have taken their toll, but this serum seems to diminish wrinkles. I recommend it for a those who, like me, have spent a great deal of time outdoors and want to repair some of that damage. I use a moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed, and the combination is working.</li>
    <li> Was surprised how much I loved this. Made my skin feel healthier and younger. Not sure if it made a huge difference on my forehead wrinkles, but I&#x27;m 27 and they aren&#x27;t very pronounced, so I wasn&#x27;t carefully analyzing them everyday. I love that this soaks into my skin and doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin greasy. I recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin starts to look much better.  I am hitting 80 soon and I hope that you also have a good product against age spots. Erika</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best serum out there. I bought this and have been using it with a titanium derma roller and I&#x27;ve received some incredible results after only a few weeks. My face is clearer, smoother, more even toned, it&#x27;s got a healthy glow to it, and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are diminishing slowly. I use this morning and night and have yet to have any sort of excessive dryness or reaction to the serum. I am now going on 3 months of using this product and finally had to order another bottle (a little goes a long ways). I am very excited to try more of VoilaVe products and continue improving the overall appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m so glad I came across this product!</li>
    <li> You can actually see this the acid eating away at the dark spot result so far have been slow but looking very promising would recommend. . I&#x27;m even have another on the way ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several serums and this one is by far the best. Everything you need for more hydrated, firmer, healthier skin is in this bottle. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I was developing some fine lines. These pretty are pretty much gone now. I like the pump bottle much better than the dropper bottles. And a little of this goes a long way and fully absorbs with no sticky feeling. I use it at night, because that our bodies repair themselves while we sleep. I will definitely order this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Because this serum is so expensive, I decided to try one from one of my favorite companies, InstaNatural, since they&#x27;ve added more products. Their prices and quality are outstanding and usually qualify for Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> I actually noticed smaller pores on my cheek areas. I am 61 and people tell me I have great skin but up close I can always see pore size. There still showing but much smaller. So easy to put on because it is almost like water. Dries quickly and I cover it with a moisturizer or sunscreen. It is a great price too.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter. It was received on time. She had not started using it yet. I do use Vitamin C and I hope this works as well.</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin, I think majority of is water. Do not have any smell at all. The company have satisfaction guarantee policy, but I am not sure how to get my money back.</li>
    <li> Very good product, was my second one, the first one was a gift and my skin feels so much younger and wrinkles getting smaller since I start using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have oily skin and almost any face product makes me even more oily and shiny.  This one goes on light and is not greasy - but even better than that are the results!  I have noticed a definite reduction in the lines on my face and my skin looks brighter and healthier.  I will be purchasing 2 at a time from now on because I definitely don&#x27;t want to run out!!</li>
    <li> I feel in love with this product first time to use it. I am not sure how it works since it is not harsh and has no chemical odors but its amazing. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few things, all leaving my face dry, no results or full of break outs. This product is not greasy, does not &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; or clog pores. Leaves face feeling tighter, clean, refreshed and most of all moisurized. I encourage others to give it a try. I will be sticking to this product.</li>
    <li> Have not used long enough to evaluate the results, but I think it is helping. Will probably need to use it for another 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this product- it is smooth to put on, dries quickly and a little goes a long way making it last longer.  My skin is smoother, more even toned and wrinkles have diminished.  I think I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Like the results of daily use of the Triple Action Vitamin C +Hyaluronic Acid.  The product is easy to reply and the bottle has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum daily fir about one month&amp; ver pleased with results. I am a believer of using vitamin C for antioxidant properties, and this has 3 forms of vitamin C. As a plus it has hyaluronic acid. I find  I am getting better clarity &amp; hydration. I will continue to purchase as not only a good product bit good value.</li>
    <li> Tried and used this product now for 6 months. It is part of my routine morning and night after cleaning the skin and before moisturizing it. Smells nothing but I see the difference on my skin. Never tried another product and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
    <li> I waited to review this item until I could see a difference or not!  It took a couple of weeks before I began to seeing a few changes and just recently I looked in the mirror and actually took a second look!  AMAZING!  At first I thought &amp;#34;no way&amp;#34; this could work - it felt so sheer going on I figured I had just bought a bottle of glycerine!  LOL  Was I wrong.  And for the price?  You cannot beat this.  I am 61 (almost 62) so I HAD a few wrinkles and they are gone (like around the eyes).  I definitely will buy more - this is GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now along with the Rosehip Oil and my skin has never felt or looked as smooth and even textured.  The discoloration is even disappearing. I use the Rosehip Oil at night and this product in the morning.  It is not drying to the skin, or makes my skin red, or feel tight as many of these type products do. I can not say enough about this product after only 1 month of use.  I look forward to trying many more of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy</li>
    <li> This was a great product I used to help clear up my skin. It worked well! The only thing is that the bottle is too small. Great quality though!</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum is clear and odorless and feels very silky on your skin.  It comes in a sealed container with a pump dispenser that is extremely nice and doesn&#x27;t allow air or impurities to enter into the serum.  I did some research into the types of vitamin c it contains and found out they are very stable forms of vitamin c.  I also contacted the company several times with questions about their products and received very fast and courteous replies.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who is constantly on the go, in fact my friends think it&#x27;s funny because they say I have &#x27;all the jobs!&#x27; After reading this products description, let me tell you, it completely delivers! Being on the go constantly, I&#x27;m left with virtually zero time to give my face the proper pampering it deserves. This serum spreads on evenly and goes on smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I can most definitely see the results! My face looks brighter and the fine lines I have are less noticeable than before. Although I may be exhausted, my face certainly doesn&#x27;t look have to look like it using this serum! A friend purchased this for me as a &#x27;try it and I promise you&#x27;ll enjoy the results.&#x27; He was not kidding. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I loved this product my skin immediately responded favorably. My skin is very oily and not sensitive  so I wasn&#x27;t concern with any form of drying out or irritation. I washed my face as usual applied the product went to bed. The next morning my skin looked tighter and smoother that was after the first application. Needless to say I have a new favorite skin care product. Thankful :-)</li>
    <li> It has only been 10 days since I started using the serum  so great differences are not here yet but m face does feel smooth as silk and I&#x27;ve been told twice that there is a glow in my face. Did the product do it??I don&#x27;t know!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Within a week of my using this, one of my employees asked what I was doing, as my complexion looked so wonderful! Almost immediately, I noticed a reduction in fine  lines and wrinkles. After looking at a picture of my niece &amp; my daughter and myself, a friend told me that the 3 of us looked like sisters! I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and have noticed my light brown skin becoming smoother and brighter. This product is going to last a long time because one pump is enough. I have no complaints so far but cannot say whether this product is exclusively a miracle worker or not as I am currently using a few other products in conjunction with this. All of them together is proving to be my best face regimen yet and I am completely satisfied with everything I am using currently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using TAV now for about a month.  I just use it in the AM after shower, before my moisturizer and makeup.  It appears to be working.  I had a picture on my FB taken in Dec. &#x27;13 and one taken last week that I put on FB, the comments were amazing.  I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s and would like to continue keeping my skin as smooth and young looking as long as I can.). I just ordered 2 more bottles .....I had a discount code so that helped.)</li>
    <li> VoilaVe has smoothed out my wrinkles and nourished my skin and has helped renew and repair.&lt;br /&gt; My skin looks younger and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very concentrated so I found with my skin being dry that( less is more) I only need a half of pump.&lt;br /&gt;As  a consumer of many products, I would say this is one of the best as far as treatment and value and cost.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she thought it would act faster than it has.  still using it and hoping it will work,</li>
    <li> This is a MUST to have.  It truly is a miracle in a bottle.  It does indeed help with discoloration (anywhere).  I not only use this on my face but in other areas where I would like to have more &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;.  I am a (mature) woman and with age, come spots and ruddy complexions.  This is a wonderful product.  Now, you need to give it time.  It is not going to give you spotless complexion in one night but I did see visable improvement in less time than I expected; and I am not talking about bottles I am talking about just two weeks or so.  I will continue to buy this product.  AND I have to say that the sellers are EXCELLENT.  They are there for any questions, customer service, etc.  They truly care about how you like their product.  You can tell they created all their products with love and are very proud of their products.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it!  My sunspots are fading and my skin looks better than it has in years!  Would definitely buy again.  Why spend 3X the $$$ for a major name product for the same results when you can buy this?</li>
    <li> Super.I use with vitamin c moisturizer best results...</li>
    <li> Not sure yet. Will use it till it&#x27;s finished.</li>
    <li> Saw results in 2 days but definite ones in less than 1 week.</li>
    <li> Awful. Caused irritation, rash, to my skin. The company will not accept a return, so why would they care if it is a good product? I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the way my face feels after I use it</li>
    <li> Product comes with a warning slip that says go to the internet for instructions.  Since I have sketchy internet, took me a long time to get their page... which offers no guide but solicitation for more products.  It reduced my confidence in the product which I have still yet to make use of for the warning being so adamant that I should read the instructions because it can dry out skin if you use too much.  Since my skin is so dry... It&#x27;s held me up for getting to use the damn thing.</li>
    <li> Works greats; would order again</li>
    <li> This did nothing. it was similar to water in its consistency. most vit c serums make my skin soft and smooth. this just made it feel dry. i&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for the dr. wu vit c serum that i got at costco (no longer carry) without spending a fortune and haven&#x27;t had luck yet. this is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have reordered it twice all ready. My skin feels so firm. I apply lotion on top of this product and my face is always so soft -</li>
    <li> It is very sticky and I believe made my face break out and my face never breaks out.  Have to wash my hands to get sticky off.  May be fine for someone else tho</li>
    <li> i bought this for smile lines and this product made them even worse. product was very drying</li>
    <li> I have ordered this several times. I only use one pump morning and night. It has been helpful in lightening my dark spots on my skin. I would recommend it and definately see a change in my skin. I am 63 years old and need all the help I can get.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> After an entire year (probably more) of using another product, I went searching for the what I heard is the best combination of ingredients.  That&#x27;s how I found this awesome little bottle.  After the very first use, my skin was already better than what I&#x27;d experienced after all the months of using the last product.  WOW...I was both angry and excited.  I started out using this every other night, wanting to make certain it wasn&#x27;t going to dry my face out too much.  (I&#x27;m over 50 and have yet to experience dry skin so I wasn&#x27;t worried; just followed the precautions given...)  After about two weeks, I started to use it every night.  My skin is softer than I remember...since preteen years, maybe!  I could FEEL a difference after the first use and I honestly believe I could SEE a difference after a month.  Wrinkles were smaller, less visible, whatever you want to call it.  I&#x27;m waiting for more firming action in the jawline area but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m starting to see a change there, too!!  THAT is the main reason I decided to try this serum.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without a bottle of this serum from now on!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference. Someone actually told me I look older lately! Not the result I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I followed instructions, and applied morning and evening using the entire bottle over around 2 month. No chance whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I know, you are suppose to see an improvement after around 4 weeks. Didn&#x27;t happen. Buy something else.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice a day for a week and I don&#x27;t see any results.  I am trying to find a Vitamin C serum that really works.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Great product - very nice feel on the skin and visible results.  Excellent vendor and customer service, as well.  I will buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> The product works and delivery always on time. I will definitely buy again and i will recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I have noticed less wrinkle lines and it firms up your skin. I am not allergic and the price was great.</li>
    <li> One of the nicest vitamin serum I&#x27;ve ever used. I would have given it 5 stars if it wan&#x27;t for the misleading packaging. For only 1oz of serum, it comes in a giant bottle with a pump and you can&#x27;t see how much you&#x27;ve got left in it before you have to order a new one. I was caught off guard when it emptied out in less than a month. If they were honest about the packaging, the bottle should be about half of its current size! It made me wonder how much I was actually paying for the GIANT bottle...</li>
    <li> I am turning 51 this year and have been using the Triple Action Vitamin C serum for over a year now.  I absolutely love this product!  I have sun damaged skin with some age and sun spots that have started to rear their ugly heads and this product has truly helped diminish those nasty spots.</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum very softening for the skin, quick results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see the results.</li>
    <li> Love it this products are amazing in two week&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks brighter and younger a recommend to use it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for a couple of weeks, two times a day, and I can see and feel a difference in my skin.  I am 59 years old and have a few age spots on my face that have started to fade since using this product.  You do not need to use much.  It applies nicely with no odor whatsoever.  I can feel it tightening my skin as it dries.  Once it has dried, my face feels incredibly soft.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use a moisturizer with this or any other product I use from VoilaVe.  My fine lines and wrinkles have started to diminish.  Definitely performs better than expected.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 months now. I really like it. I only use it once a day at night. I have extremely sensitive, dehydrated, oily, acne prone skin.  It has helped a lot with hydration. My melasma is lighter in color and my fine lines are softer. It has not broken me out. My skin is not any oilier. It is not a miracle in a bottle, But it does help! Would I try other Vitamin C Serum? Yes. But I’m in no hurry to do so. I have purchased a second bottle.  I did remove one star because the company does not say what percentage of vitamin c is in it. I have also just ordered 2 more products from this company.I can&#x27;t wait to try them,</li>
    <li> No difference, Ive used it twice a day as recommended for about 2 months now, it felt like just pouring water, smell is odd + texture is to liquid it doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> This stuff made me break out the first I week I used it along with Black Diamond..😒</li>
    <li> The best vit c serum is vit c 22% is amazing !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after even one application of the Triple Action Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid serum! Even though I have sensitive skin, it is gentle and I have not had any redness or irritation. It leaves my skin velvety soft, even toned and with a soft glow. I have even used it on my arms and it works wonders there, too. I will be keeping this in my beauty cabinet!</li>
    <li> I have not started this as yet.  I will let you know how I like it after I have had a chance to see the results after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product about two weeks now. I&#x27;ve used it morning and evening although they say once a day for most because it could dry your skin if used twice a day. Twice works nicely for me and has not caused dryness. First I cleanse the face. Then I apply the serum which I allow to dry to maximize the effect. I follow this with my moisturizer (day cream for mornings and evening cream for evenings - there is a difference, you know). After the moisturizer has soaked into the skin somewhat, I apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m not going out for the day, I just use a little blush and lipstick. Using the serum along with a moisturizer tends to give my face a nice glow which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my daughters was recently visiting me and she noted that the dark spots on the side of my face were not as prominent. Wow! That makes me feel that something is working. I believe perhaps the VoilaVe Triple Action Vitamin Serum could have a major role in this for me. So I&#x27;ll continue to apply it.</li>
    <li> Yesterday was the first time I used it, so I have to give some time to share an opinion.</li>
    <li> I think is working well, I should use it alone though, so I know is doing the job, I will, and send anupdate!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I enjoy trying out new products.  This felt like nothing more than water on my face.  I have used Glo Therapeutics Vitamin C and that is excellent.  Unfortunately, once you open the bottle over time, the serum will oxidize quickly.  This product does not have the same effect in terms of tightness of my face when applied.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Finally, a facial product that actually works! Best product that I&#x27;ve ever used,  by far, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT. My face is softer, brighter, and this product has had a great impact on my discoloration from sun damage and acne scars. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with  this  product, wil reorder.</li>
    <li> May be too strong for sensitive skin, I had allergic reaction. I do have a few friends that use it and love it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Started from cheap packaging and product quality. Smells funky. Wanted to return but I got too busy with other things...</li>
    <li> We all know how wonderful &amp; nourishing vitamin C is for the skin....This is the first product that I&#x27;ve seen, that has 3 different kinds of vitamin C plus hyaluronic acid. I love that it&#x27;s alcohol and paraben free, being that I always try to get products that are as free from toxic chemicals as possible. I like that it has a pump, since it makes it easier to control how much product you put on your skin. Being 54, I&#x27;m looking forward to losing some of my fine lines and getting a more tone look to my skin! :) summer59</li>
    <li> . My pores are getting smaller and face feels smoother. I needed something stronger than what I was using as I have oily skin. It did not dry out my skin. And looking forward to better results as I continue. NO smell and seems to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; right away. I will give 5 stars when I notice a few brown spots fading and pores get even smaller.</li>
    <li> I tend to get contact dermatitis and I can never pinpoint what triggers it, so I&#x27;m always hesitant to try anything new on my face. I wanted to try a Vitamin C serum, and after reading all the positive reviews, and the affordable price, I thought I’d give this a go. Things I like: It has no fragrance whatsoever, you don&#x27;t need to use much at all, and it absorbs quickly. After a few weeks of use, I think that my skin tone looks and feels more smooth and supple. I should also state that I clean my face with a Clarisonic Mia, which has also helped to refine my skin/clean my pores better, so, between the two, I&#x27;m very happy with the condition of my skin so far!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months. I&#x27;m not sure it has made any impact on my skin but hasn&#x27;t seemed to harm it either. I hoped it would noticeably fade my two brown spots and even out my skin tone but it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 6: Okay, now I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months and ran out. I re-ordered same item today over other products for two reasons: 1)cost + discount and 2)ratings. It&#x27;s hard to tell how much it has helped because it&#x27;s necessary to use with other products (namely moisturizers). I will give it another go until I decide on whether or not to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have only had it a couple of days but like the way my skin feels</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to see that the serum seemed to help keep down the brown spots,keratoses and skin tags that have plagued me for many,many years. My skin is smoother than it has ever been and since I am 68 that is really something to be pleased with!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t spread well as it is too dry. I prefer NuNutrients. The ingredients are identical and it spreads more smoothly. This was on sale at a special price, but I won&#x27;t repurchase it..</li>
    <li> Smells like dirty socks, and is runny.  I don&#x27;t think it has any effect whatsoever.  Totally fake reviews make it look exceptional.</li>
    <li> Skin does feel smooth, but at the same time, the &#x27;color and tone&#x27; seem off.  Have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I just got this and started it, it goes on smoothly, its okay.  I don&#x27;t see a difference yet. Will see once the bottle is completed.</li>
    <li> Great serum, I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!! it gives your skin that boost it needs perfect under my moisturizer,  will defenetly buy again</li>
    <li> I love this serum it smooths out my fine lines and gives me a youthful glow. My recent reorder I was unsure, the bottle/package had changed from my previous two shipments but I noticed shipped from a different site. It is still the same amount ant the same great product. Update: I was really upset the pump on the new package was sticking and would not pump(I thought was empty) , I ordered for my mom a week later and her serum was working fine. I was ready to down grade my rating but the product is great the pump is just broken, I just had to put in a different contaner.</li>
    <li> No, it&#x27;s not a facelift in a bottle and it won&#x27;t make a 75 year old look 30 again. But it does make this 52 year old get compliments and I have seen noticeable improvement in elasticity and tone as well as reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Second time I&#x27;ve ordered it. I can tell an immediate difference in the tightness and firmness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Okay just a heads up before I start reviewing this product, I just wanted to mention that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and I have sensitive and acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this bottle yesterday and have only applied it once so far, right after using my derma roller. I can see and feel a difference in just one application. My skin felt great today (the next morning) and I think I will keep using it for sure. It not only feels soft but I can see a glow honestly. I will post an update later as a follow-up. I agree with some of the review writers in that a little goes a long way. The amount you get from just one pump is suffice to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has only been one use, but so far the serum has moisturized my skin instead of drying it. Also, I have acne prone skin as I mentioned before. Almost anything will make me break out, but this actually AMAZINGLY calmed my skin and took away even the redness from my derma roller and face wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days and I&#x27;m already seeing results!</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to try this product, since my experience with Vitamin C serums has always been cut short by the oxidation process. As a result, I decided to purchase a serum with an airless pump design rather than the glass dropper that lets air in and only accelerates the aforementioned oxidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for almost two months, hoping to see some improvement in skin tone, clarity, and evenness. Also, I wanted to fade a small post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation scar on my chin. So far, absolutely no change on any front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that for Vitamin C serums to be effective, it needs to be present in a 20% concentration. Unfortunately, I was so enamored by the convenient pump design that I didn&#x27;t even bother to check how much Vitamin C was actually in the product. Not that it would have mattered, anyway, since VoilaVe does not provide that information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to like this product, especially since it&#x27;s one of the few Vitamin C serums that a) isn&#x27;t packaged in a way that spoils the product almost overnight (mine hasn&#x27;t yellowed yet!) and b) doesn&#x27;t contain irritants like plant oils or witch hazel extract (or worse, ambiguous cocktails like &amp;#34;Herbal Antioxidant Infusion&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll give it two stars for that.</li>
    <li> Was great...however, I had other products, &amp; will let you know when I&#x27;m ready to reorder.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have used other vitamin C products before, but this is by far the best. I have used it for about two month, and I can see  a big improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Using this product for about a week.  My face feels soft glowing and firm. No adverse reaction. I&#x27;m 43 years old and up until 8 years ago I was a big fan on tanning beds and Sun bathing.  I&#x27;m also a smoker. A couple of women at work have asked me what I have been using my skin. One gal commented that I look like I&#x27;m in my thirties. I have been using another company vitamin c 20 percent serum for one month in the am and before bed. I found that a good cleansing routine helps. After cleansing with your choice of cleanser. Pat your face dry with a clean towel.  Use only tepid water!!  Then use a toner. I personally use witch hazel. It&#x27;s inexpensive and does the job.  Wash your hand thoroughly.  Apply the triple action serum. Let dry and apply your favorite moisturizer.  I use a light moisturizer in the am and a heavier one at night. Will update on fine lines and age spot.  This is working for me.  I hope you get the same results.  Ladies do not forget the same goes for neck area.  I would recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working, this is my second bottle...hard to tell a difference really</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so far&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with it I sure would recommend it to other customers.</li>
    <li> I received the serum and it seems to seep through your skin...Now all I want is the wrinkles to disappear...Just don&#x27;t want to look old....I really hope what you said about it will be true....I give it a 5 right now</li>
    <li> Love this product so much I ordered two more bottles.  My skin is becoming more radiant all the time.  I&#x27;m 69 years old and people tell me I don&#x27;t look a day over 50.</li>
    <li> Love it. I put a retinol based serum on top and the results are magical!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I use in the evening and I love it after i put make-up on I applied a tiny drop and rube it between my hands and gently apply it on my face and it gives me a glowing look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for less than a month. It&#x27;s ok, but so far can&#x27;t see much difference from the Neutrogena Deep Wrinkle Repair I&#x27;ve been using. Guess a Retinol treatment ultimately agrees better with my skin and wrinkles, in conjunction with a good night firming and lifting cream (Triple Action L&#x27;Oreal night cream) I&#x27;ve been using, which also contains Hyaluronic Acid. The VoilaVe Vitamin C Serum is only for wrinkles and possibly age spots, which I fortunately don&#x27;t have to deal with on my face. It can dry your skin if you don&#x27;t use a good moisturerizer in addition.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference. Nice product</li>
    <li> I like Triple Action Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid because it is effective. I have a combination oily skin and used it sparingly on my T-zone where it tends to get oily during the day. I am very surprised that even just using a tiny amount (even less than half a pump), I have noticed the difference on my skin tone. My face is not as oily as it used to. My skin is softer and fairer! Even I am surprised because my family and friends can notice the difference on my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product has a note inserted in the bottle cap to remind users to use sparingly as it is a potent serum that may dry skin if overused. So, I followed the instruction and even used less than the half a pump portion and the serum is already effective even with a small amount used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product because of its effectivity and the good results I have seen on my own skin texture and complexion.</li>
    <li> I have seen age spots lighten.  The formula is very watery and dries out quickly.  You have to use a moisturizer only because it is like using alcohol on yr face.  It isn&#x27;t anywhere near the potency it claims, where it says use sparingly. I am even using retina a, at night with this product. But it did lighten age spots better than anything I&#x27;ve used so far. I just thought it would also tighten the skin.  It&#x27;s way to runny for that. I am not sure I&#x27;d I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I have been been very happy with the results.My skin showed results within days of starting to us it.The only problem was with the last order I placed.The container was either empty or was stopped up.We could not get it to work.Had to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone as a gift.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Works fast tighning up the large pores on your face, must use twice a day on a clean face.</li>
    <li> My skin has softened and lighted. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin is smoother, clearer, and I have less fine lines around my eyes and mouth after using it a few days. I&#x27;m going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> This serum did not irritate my sensitive skin so I was able to use it daily.  I also saw an improvement in the texture of my skin. I will get this again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. One pump covers my whole face. Bigger than what I thought it would be. It is a little drying so a great moisturizer on top is key. I just started using on Monday so in 30 days we shall see. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars yet cause too soon to tell if working. I do notice a nice glow to my face. I am using this with a lactic acid peel also purchased on Amazon so far amazing together.</li>
    <li> VERY DRYING TO MY FACE</li>
    <li> I have been using both Triple Action Vitamin C Serum, and 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 16-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a product that improves the texture and appearance of my face and neck.  As a result, I’ve tried products used by both talk show host Oprah and Ellen which turned out to be very expensive. After seeing a Dr. OZ show regarding the benefits of using products with high-levels of vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and retinol; a Google search led me to these VoilaVe products which were affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I didn’t like the sticky feel of the hyaluronic acid which I applied first; followed by the vitamin C. So, I begin blending both - two drops of hyaluronic acid and two spray pumps of vitamin C in the palm of my hand and applying it to my face and  throat which was much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, the dullness of my face and neck due to environmental exposure and age is fading. My face and neck is more radiant, velvety and firmer which indicates my skin can only get better with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these products to people wanting to improve the texture and appearance of their face and neck.</li>
    <li> triple action Vit C serum. has no smell :) and is as described &amp;#60;3 Just finally tried it today</li>
    <li> Definitely smoothed my skin out and began to fade my dark spots.  Have used for a month and am purchasing more!  Once it dries, be sure to moisturize.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was spending a lot more money on skin care and i feel this gives me the same results. I am now saving money and atill getting the results i want.  I have been using it for 18 months and my skin feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> Live the serum...feels good going on and I know I&#x27;m doing good for my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old and very fair skinned. I have been using the Voila Ve Vitamin C serum since August 2014 (2.5 months).  The bottle lasts me about 30-40 days.  I use it all over my face and neck and eyelids.  It does not burn or irritate my extremely sensitive skin on my face or eyelids.  I have rosacea skin condition and just about everything burns my skin.  I don&#x27;t wear make up (foundation) because of this issue with my skin.  The Voila Ve is non-irritating.  It &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; reduces my fine lines to practically nothing and reduces the deeper wrinkles substantially after applying and letting it dry.  I fan my face to dry it faster.  Then, I apply a light moisturizer over the serum.  My face looks just radiant after I apply it!!  I wear a little powdery blush, but no foundation.  My make up looks great over the top of the Voila Ve.  It&#x27;s a great base before applying lip color (I use the 12 hour stuff on my lips), so, I always put some on my lips, too.  I went through 2 bottles already since August and ordered 2 more.  I will be ordering more, as well, for gifts for family and friends.  I never would have believed that something could make your skin look younger in just minutes.  It has an excellent &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; quality to the serum.  My skin looks so smooth &amp; younger after I apply it.  BE SURE TO APPLY A LIGHT MOISTURIZER after the Voila Ve dries, or your skin will look &amp;#34;pulled&amp;#34; and dried out.  People always guess me to be in my early to mid forties.  Maybe I look young for my age due to good genetics and healthy diet, but the Voila Ve sure takes those fine lines and wrinkles away, although, it&#x27;s a temporary fix.  The lines and wrinkles are back again the next morning, but, like I said...In my opinion the is a superior &amp;#34;skin firming&amp;#34; serum!! I will surely be ordering more.  A great price, too, at $19.95/bottle.</li>
    <li> Noticed my pores getting smaller within a few days. I&#x27;m still using but not sure it&#x27;s all that it claims to be.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Easy to apply.  Leaves skin moist . Give me a couple weeks for complete opinion. {·12/05/2015)  If I may add since I&#x27;ve had time to try this product.  This company does have nice product at a reasonable price.  If  you compare the active ingredients in this line against those advertised to be used by the stars, the common ingredients are vitamin C AND Hyaluronic acid . AND Your credit card is safe from monthly charges.  Remember the sunscreen.  I can&#x27;t. Believe how great my skin looks and feels. I get compliments and inquiries  regarding my skin</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I apply just once a day in the morning.  I recently ran out and have noticed a significant change in my skin coloring and overall healthy appearance.  I cannot wait till it arrives, I ordered two bottles this time.</li>
    <li> I really gave this stuff a chance.  I bought 2 bottles and used faithfully.  I am blessed with good skin even at the age of 57.  I swear by Dove soap, which I&#x27;ve used as far back as I can remember.  I&#x27;m not asking for much but at 57 I could use some help.  However, with this product I have not noticed any improvement whatsoever.  I am going to try a more expensive brand and see if there is a difference.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results! A very small amount has great coverage. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> useing for three weeks, have not see any changes</li>
    <li> I like it and it feels good on my skin but I don&#x27;t know if it does what it claims.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using this product for about a month. Use before I go to bed. Cleanse face with apricot scrub and rinse with cold water. I apply vitamin c serum to my face, neck and top of hands. I also use cera ve moisturizer with hyaluronic acid recommended by dermatologists. I see great improvement in my pores becoming smaller, tighter skin, prune lips softing and much smoother skin. I am 69 years young. People don&#x27;t believe my age. Love this product. Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> This is one product that  I am using daily since I received it but, I don&#x27;t see any firmness in my skin as claimed by the seller.  I did notice that my skin got a little brighter but no change in the elasticity of the skin.</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on smoothly and sinks into the skin well.  There is no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C Serum out there.. Product works as expected!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 18 mths I love it. Unfortunately I have moved from the US and I cannot get it posted to me in Australia. So I did a big order and get it sent to my friend in the US and she is sending it on to me in Australia. I got my daughter to get a price from a company who sells it on Amazon and they wanted to charge $100 US to post it  for 10 bottles. This is outrageous as I can get a medium size box and fill it to the brim for $65. to Australia.  If there is any way we can get it sent to us at a reasonable price I have quite a few people in Australia who are interested in buying it.  Anyone thinking of trying it do yourself a favor and give it a go. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am 47 and have acne prone skin.  One week after using this product my skin has cleared up 50% and my skin looks healthier and feels amazing. I will be ordering this again!!  Hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin either.. but I do have combination skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s part of my daily morning routine. For a 51 year-old, my skin is doing OK. No wrinkles, which I attribute to topical Vitamin C and another product I use at night that has retinol in it. I haven&#x27;t found anything to battle my few dark &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots (that isn&#x27;t crazy toxic), but, I figure those are a result of sun damage that is not reversible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other VoilaVe products too, which are OK. This is their best one though. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for my face.</li>
    <li> I received my order of Triple Vit. C. Serum.  I like it very much.  I feel it is good for my skin.</li>
