      <li>BEST hair curlers ever.</li>
      <li>But this set is perfect!  </li>
      <li>Excellent curls and waves.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not, however, a perfectly designed set.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this</li>
      <li>These are the best curlers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works perfect.</li>
      <li>It is best as an at home unit.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the end result.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so very happy!</li>
      <li>Very good product</li>
      <li>But I was delighted to see the clips, because you can use them without the rollers!  </li>
      <li>I still have beautiful bouncy curls.</li>
      <li>This set used to have an on/off switch on the front, which was GREAT, since you didn&#x27;t have to unplug it every time.  </li>
      <li>Work Great.</li>
      <li>So, these intrigued me with their promise of no kinks and great curls.  </li>
      <li>The idea of heated clips sounded great at the store, but every time I use them, they leave crimp/tooth marks in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Happy</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a great set and</li>
      <li>She thought my hair looked great and when she dropped me off after lunch</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>it is great .</li>
      <li>Curlers work great but the clips don&#x27;t hold the curlers.  </li>
      <li>I have had them about a month now and think they are great.  </li>
      <li>The oil that comes with the curlers gives great shine and keeps those flyaway hairs from popping out.</li>
      <li>and I think she looks great</li>
      <li>Great for styling hair for formal events, or just because.</li>
      <li>She is happy and that makes me happy.</li>
      <li>It makes great curls and adds body.</li>
      <li>this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>the set stayed in and its great having the clips also heated which I didn&#x27;t realize when I had ordered  very nice  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and am impressed.  </li>
      <li>Or if I&#x27;ve set my hair and didn&#x27;t quite get the look I wanted at the top of my head, I use a couple of the heated clips and get the perfect effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These APPEAR to be superior</li>
      <li>The quality is good, rollers and clips seems well made and durable.</li>
      <li>If you have a bag or something in which you can store the clips, good.  </li>
      <li>So in the end this was a good investment, if my daughter has no complaints then neither do I, since this was a gift for her...</li>
      <li>The value must be good for her to say she likes something.  </li>
      <li>Good shipping times.  </li>
      <li>The rollers are great, and this set heats up nicely.</li>
      <li>also had a good side-by-side comparison of the two sets of rollers.  </li>
      <li>but I let the curlers heat up a good 10 minutes before I start using them on her hair.  </li>
      <li>to some good news:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly, and the clips heat up so quickly that I can do all my hair just with the heated clips if that&#x27;s the look i want.  </li>
      <li>Love the way this is set up  Heats great  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Great set, quick to use, does a great job.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I really love these!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, if you asked me to design the perfect set, it would be exactly this.  </li>
      <li>the better they work!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>These are amazing.  </li>
      <li>Heated clips are a good idea, but needs better design to avoid leaving dents in the hair.  </li>
      <li>Loving them and just learning how to use them for my bob hairstyle to add lift and body.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but I am so thrilled with this curler set that I felt like I should write one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As for the comb and the argan oil packet, they&#x27;re nice perks, but nothing</li>
      <li>The heated clips are a nice feature, but the Setter works well, even when the clips are not heated.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re on your own.  </li>
      <li>, you&#x27;re on your own figuring out how and where to store them.  </li>
      <li>I liked the butterfly clips.</li>
      <li>Each person will need to set your own time and if you heat the clips or not.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and these rollers did a good job of adding bounce and body.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with them, will be nice if they would have a retraction cord..</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>hair is very fine, so I haven&#x27;t yet tried using the HEATED clips to hold the rollers in place.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Held my hair and didn&#x27;t fall out and happened to be very comfortable.</li>
      <li>This was a good value and the rollers do heat quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the results are good and these are by far the best hot rollers I&#x27;ve used, but there are some issues with the logistics.</li>
      <li>With my fine hair that is amazing.</li>
      <li>many times I just give up and use my curling iron.  </li>
      <li>In actuality, 10 minutes worked better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not if you use these curlers, though, because some \\&quot;genius\\&quot; thought that more heat would improve the curl and figured out a way to heat the clips too.  </li>
      <li>After all the rollers are all out I hair spray some more.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with the conair xtreme multi-size hair setter.  </li>
      <li>it had an on/off button - instead of having to plug or unplug it, but I guess that also makes it more eco-friendly.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>Love the clips that hold the rollers in place.  </li>
      <li>The product is labeled as being charged with ionic energy that protects from frizz and static</li>
      <li>but I prefer the use of these rollers because of the incredible volume, softness and natural look of the curl.</li>
      <li>I wish it worked better.</li>
      <li>had ordered (and returned) another set of rollers from Conair because an hour after I curled my hair, all the curl and most of the body was gone.</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I made sure then, to not move around at any pace faster than a slug.</li>
      <li>I love the rollers, I love the hair clips, I even like the comb that came with the set.  </li>
      <li>I took a chance with these and LOVE them.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really adorable.</li>
      <li>The clips are okay</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s more out of laziness than satisfaction with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They seemed to work better than these newer clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I have to say that this set isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
      <li>However the longer the rollers set the better heating in my opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I have to say that this set isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
      <li>This product works ok .</li>
      <li>And, it seemed to work for me where I had more hair (at the sides and bottom).  </li>
      <li>Which were even more accentuated by the argon oil in my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-  love the clips</li>
      <li>you are looking for a hot roller set that is a good value and works, try this set.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> What is the voltage of this product. I will use it in Singapore. Singaporw voltage is 220</li>
    <li> Excellent curls and waves.  Great.</li>
    <li> They work well don&#x27;t wet your hair though. Damp hair is alright to use. They get hot fast! I have natural curly hair but I like to touch it up.</li>
    <li> Use: This was to replace the exact same set that I accidentally knocked off the counter on the floor (smashing the case and heater).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Can&#x27;t complain, my girlfriend loves them and I think she looks great afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
    <li> The curlers are smaller than they appear and the clamp leave crimps in your hair.  This set maybe great for short curly hair but not for straighter hair that needs volume and not CRIMPS from the clips.</li>
    <li> The clips do not hold any of the rollers in place. Because of this the very hot rollers flop around burning ears, forehead and scalp. An absolute horror. I will think twice about buying things online, sight unseen. Had I seen the cheep ridiculous clips up close, I never ever would have gotten this.</li>
    <li> Curlers work great but the clips don&#x27;t hold the curlers.  Will be ordering the metal spring clips.</li>
    <li> The clips do not stay on and the curler falls to the floor. Gonna have to return.</li>
    <li> Rollers did not heat evenly - returned.  Also, design flaws.  Edges of rollers got hotter than the rollers.  Do they not test these before putting them on the market?</li>
    <li> I love my hot clips,don&#x27;t use all ,but the small ones are great.</li>
    <li> I have fairly long hair and the clips don&#x27;t hold at all. I like the soft curlers its just not for long hair.</li>
    <li> The clips hinder the speed of curling your hair.  There is an extra step to putting the clips on a bar to be heated which only allows 2 at a time, then you wait a bit for them to get hot.  Not a big fan of this system.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my gf and she absolutely loved these curlers, they heat up quickly less than a 1 min I&#x27;ll say, they&#x27;re easily to put on and within 20 min she was ready to go! Her curls lasted all day and they still looked nice by the end of the day, her hair is not very thick so I really don&#x27;t know if this product is for everyone considering some girls have really thick hair or thin hair, long and short hair. Her hair is right below her shoulders and still did the job. The case only has space for 3 clippers but no big deal for her she just put the rest on a box. Only advice make sure you don&#x27;t forget to turn them off it does not have an on and off button, it needs to be unplugged when done, other than that she gave it 5 stars, curlers do curl her hair great!</li>
    <li> Clips would not hold hair at all!!!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with them, will be nice if they would have a retraction cord..</li>
    <li> it make my hairs look really nature and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my hairs at all .... it is great .</li>
    <li> Wife likes hers.  The value must be good for her to say she likes something.  Only 4 stars due to the lack of some larger rollers.  Recommend she says.  She is happy and that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Good shipping times.  Watch out that you don&#x27;t burn your fingers like I did. Curls good for thin hair and stays</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this OVER-RATED product. I have used hot roller for years.  These APPEAR to be superior however the overrated heated clips flop left and right and don&#x27;t stay gripped without a struggle.  Conair fell short on this product.</li>
    <li> This product works ok . The clips don&#x27;t really hold the roller in place. I did try putting a small amount of hair and it still didnot hold well.</li>
    <li> I wish this contained more curlers, I have a lot of hair, and this really did not do the job for all my hair.</li>
    <li> Min wouldn&#x27;t heat up past the point of bring slightly warm to touch. I&#x27;ve let them heat up for upwards of an hour and a half and the light still didn&#x27;t turn white to indicate that they were hot enough to use (they were still not hot to touch). What a let down.</li>
    <li> Bought it to get more of the medium size rollers after combining them and discarding the large and small I now have what I need.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend them  to people all the time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to get as hot as they should. Clips leave marks in your hair. My hair is very thick and to my butt usually hard to curl but these did curl my hair. I would recommend using something other than the provided clips</li>
    <li> This is a good hot roller set. Heats ups as the directions say.  However the longer the rollers set the better heating in my opinion. The rollers are smaller overall than what I am used to.  The clips are okay but I do like the previous butterfly clips better(super clips). By the way you can still get them from Conair or Amazon but they can&#x27;t be heated.  This is good for short to medium length curly hair  because of the roller size.</li>
    <li> Love this! I used it the same day I got and it&#x27;s a keeper! Would recommend this to all women who want/need a touch of &amp;#34;bounce/curl&amp;#34; in their hair!</li>
    <li> Was using expensive hot curlers purchased from qvc.  They took so long to heat up, and had to remain in hair forever for results.  These are amazing.  Heated in minutes, and great curls in just a few.  Wish they didn&#x27;t leave clip marks, but overall, they are a great buy.  Love them.</li>
    <li> This was a good value and the rollers do heat quickly. The quality is good, rollers and clips seems well made and durable.</li>
    <li> My old Conair was wearing out, so I ordered this newer version. Very satisfied with my purchase, though I want to order some extra curlers.</li>
    <li> The clips don&#x27;t hold the hair well.  If you very carefully watch how you place the clips, you should see if you are denting in the hair or not and may mostly be able to avoid that, but the curlers move and/or fall out.  The clips are also somewhat heavy, so having them fall a bit and hang from your head is not so comfortable and probably not good for the hair.  I ended up ordering another set of Conair rollers with a claw clip that held well (Conair Xtreme Super Jumbo) and that is the set I use, not this one.  Those clips are much lighter and stay put really well.&lt;br /&gt;So I do regret buying this...  It doesn&#x27;t get used.</li>
    <li> It might be new, but its overall conditions (box, unit, package etc..) look Not New. Although it works, but I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The wife seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Really not impressed.  the clips get way to hot and it&#x27;s pretty hard to hold onto the hot curler by the ends and the hot clips...just wasnt what I had hoped for.  Also the curler although diff sizes are all pretty small.  wouldnt recommend this unless you are way into doing your hair in hot roller and wear some kind of glove to protect your hand</li>
    <li> Loving them and just learning how to use them for my bob hairstyle to add lift and body.</li>
    <li> Great set, quick to use, does a great job.</li>
    <li> This thermal style roller is good for gentle waves in long hair, but not tight long lasting curls. It would work well on fine shorter hair, but I have very long hair and it just leaves a small wave which fades rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace old curler set withe the slip on clip (broke a couple of the clips over the years) thought I&#x27;d try this set with the clams that you can warm up, but the damn curlers kept slipping out of my hair. Returned and went back to old set.</li>
    <li> The clips were not bog enough 2 secure fhe roller to my head.  Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Item received with other items in outer box that was in good condition.  This item&#x27;s container had been previously opened, item box damaged, some spilled contents.  Item did not work properly.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. She doesn&#x27;t have any problems at all with the rollers staying on her head. I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance and purchased this roller set, I looked past the bad reviews on this product. You can&#x27;t go off of every bad review there is on a product. So in the end this was a good investment, if my daughter has no complaints then neither do I, since this was a gift for her... I would definitely recommend this roller set to anyone who is looking for a good product...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but I am so thrilled with this curler set that I felt like I should write one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spent 3 months searching for a way to style my hair after going from short hair to medium length hair.  I have fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of natural body and doesn&#x27;t typically hold a curl all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered (and returned) another set of rollers from Conair because an hour after I curled my hair, all the curl and most of the body was gone. And I hated the plastic clips, which left marks in my hair.  But this set is perfect!  I love the rollers, I love the hair clips, I even like the comb that came with the set.  I use a mixture of the large, medium and small rollers, and all of them stay in place with the metal clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still experimenting, but I can get different looks depending on what I do.  When I heated the rollers for 10 minutes before setting my hair, and used the smaller two sizes, and kept the curlers in until my hair was completely cool, then I got CURLS that stayed in all day and evening.  Happy surprise - when I woke up the next morning, my hair looked so cute with tons of body and loose curl.  Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I didn&#x27;t let the rollers heat for as long, and the curls were less tight but still curly, though my hair did get less curly over the next couple of hours.  For me, that was perfect, since I like a little looser look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine, so I haven&#x27;t yet tried using the HEATED clips to hold the rollers in place.  (I thought that hot curlers + hot clips might be too much heat for my fine hair.)  But I was delighted to see the clips, because you can use them without the rollers!  I had seen some some clam-shell things on TV that I had planned to buy once my hair grew out.  It was a great concept - you just wrap your hair around 1-finger or 2-fingers or 3-fingers, depending on how tight you want your curls to be - and then place the clip around thecurled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I went to order those clam-shell curling things they were something like a hundred dollars, which is crazy, so I gave that up.  But when I saw the shape of the clips, and saw that they could be heated, I tried them.  It worked perfectly, and the clips heat up so quickly that I can do all my hair just with the heated clips if that&#x27;s the look i want.  Or if I&#x27;ve set my hair and didn&#x27;t quite get the look I wanted at the top of my head, I use a couple of the heated clips and get the perfect effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still experimenting with the set, but so far I have not gotten a look that I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had lunch this week with a friend who knew I had been trying to find the right tools for my new, longer hair.  She has seen my hair for the past 15 years, including the past 3 months of okay-my-hair-is-long-enough-to-style-now-but-I-can&#x27;t-get-it-to-do-anything, so she knows what it normally looks like.  She thought my hair looked great and when she dropped me off after lunch, she asked if I could send her the link so she could purchase a set for herself.  So I pulled up the amazon link to send her, and I noticed the single review (this is a very new product).  I read the review, which was quite negative, and I joked to me friend that other reviewer and I must live on different planets, because our opinions of this roller set are so different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you asked me to design the perfect set, it would be exactly this.  I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> My hair is difficult to maintain a curl in for any length of time. I bought this after having owned its predecessor for a number of years (that one is still working).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is a better product, heats faster and maintains heat longer.  I can now curl my hair and still have plenty of spring left at the end of 5 or 6 hours.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, naturally wavy, and passed my shoulders. When I get a blow out with curled ends, my hair holds the curl for days as I have a lot of \\&quot;body.\\&quot; Normally, I will straighten my hair with a hot iron in the morning so I was excited to try these hot rollers and change up my look.  Unfortunately, these did not curl my thick hair - at all. It gave it a little body, but you could not tell that I had left in these curlers for over 15 minutes. It was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transparent white dot was an easy indicator as to the readiness of the rollers and the hot clips were a nice touch. I laughed at the argan oil, because it was a tiny sample that did not make it through all of my hair. I receive bigger samples from the well-known beauty store in the mall. I am disappointed to say that I cannot recommend buying this product if you have thick, hair as I am afraid they just won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> The main question is: What did we do before ceramic hair products? Ceramic rollers, curling irons, straighteners? I really don&#x27;t know but I now own all of the above and my hair somehow always comes out as I want it to. I love Conair&#x27;s ceramic rollers and this is my second set. My hair is very hard to control - it&#x27;s medium thickness - but I have a lot and it has very uneven texture: curly here, wavy there, straight somewhere else. Until I found ceramic rollers, I couldn&#x27;t curl my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the ceramic itself or the flocking on the rollers. The rollers are held onto the head by butterfly clips that keep them on securely even if you&#x27;re moving around. When you remove them, there isn&#x27;t a dent or line where a pin would ordinarily leave one. The ceramic base holds the heat quite well and the unit heats up quickly. You won&#x27;t burn yourself as the rollers are not too hot to handle. I keep the rollers in my hair generally longer than one would need to because I have such hard to manage hair. I have to shout out to Conair for giving the rollers a very girly hot pink ambiance. They&#x27;re really adorable. Comes with a useful, sturdy, wide-tooth comb, 20 rollers in three sizes (I prefer the jumbo size), and 20 butterfly clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product though I was excited to get this hair setter because I was under the mistaken impression that the clips could be stored inside the unit instead of lying all over the counter-top or in drawers needing to be dug out and arranged when I wanted to use them. There is only room for 3 of the plastic clips in the compartment and then if you want to heat them (not sure why you&#x27;d need to do this), you have to move them in and wait a bit for them to warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does heat up quickly when plugged in but there is no ON/OFF switch so you have to remember to unplug it after use (I am bad about that -- I know it&#x27;s not best to leave any small appliance plugged in because the electricity stays on, but I do it anyway thinking that switching to OFF will suffice.) When the ready dot on one of the curlers turns white, it has reached curling temperature. The rollers come in 3 sizes which should be sufficient for most light wave needs but if your hair is really thick or long, you might have some trouble. There are twenty rollers in all and they are plastic with flocking that won&#x27;t tear at your hair. They are not too hot to handle when fully warmed. The product is labeled as being charged with ionic energy that protects from frizz and static and I found that to be the case for me. The curl was soft and full of body. My other issue was that the curlers would NOT STAY IN PLACE. The ones on the top of my head weren&#x27;t secure enough and bobbled toward the front of my forehead and flipped all over the place. Since the clips had no real tines to them, they did not grip as well as I would have liked. I didn&#x27;t notice any crimp marks when I removed the rollers. The set comes with a nice wide-toothed comb and a small foil packet of Argan oil that either needs to be used all at once or some provision for it to be stored so it doesn&#x27;t leak the rest out when you want to save it. It was only a sufficient amount for one application to my shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say that this set isn&#x27;t my favorite. I prefer this model instead: [[ASIN:B005CE21YW Infiniti Pro by Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers]]. It has an ON/OFF switch on the front and the clips have tines that make the rollers much more secure in your hair. Ultimately, however, both of the products I&#x27;ve used have not answered the clip storage question to my satisfaction!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say that this set isn&#x27;t my favorite.

    <li> The clips will not stay in and this product makes my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> The rollers are great, and this set heats up nicely. Unfortunately, the clips provided are terrible. My hair isn&#x27;t incredibly fine, but the rollers still fall out: even with little to no movement.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be larger. So I was sadden by the size. My hair is down to my waist. Did not work for me. Other wise they would be do able.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair. Over the years, I&#x27;ve had to work hard to find the curlers that work the right way and come up with tricks for keeping the curlers on my head and not falling off.  For the most part, my favorite are a set of traveling curlers that have plain wire clips that hold them in to prevent the kink other types of curler holders can leave. So, these intrigued me with their promise of no kinks and great curls.  Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The curlers have a place that hold four clips that heat with the rollers.  You have to keep replacing the clips in it as you roll your hair.  That&#x27;s not bad.  And, it seemed to work for me where I had more hair (at the sides and bottom).  I tried a few times, but always ended up with a kink at the crown/front of my head where I have less hair.  This annoyed me. But, if I had long, luscious hair down to shoulders all around I think these would be a fine choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The curlers did heat up very quickly - the longer you leave them the hotter they will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The clips did keep the rollers on my head instead of me chasing them around the bathroom floor as they fell off my head.  But, they also take up a lot of space when you&#x27;re not using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I wish (and it&#x27;s just a wish) it had an on/off button - instead of having to plug or unplug it, but I guess that also makes it more eco-friendly. After all, everyone says to unplug your appliances even when they&#x27;re off to save energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I did love the big slot in the middle of the rollers that heat them up --- instead of the old rods you used to place them on, the good variety of sizes, the sponginess of the curl that protects your hair - and surprised me by stiill giving a lasting curl and finally the wide tooth comb that came with it - so you don&#x27;t destroy the curl while styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of hot rollers, probably over thirty years.  These are nice, rollers and they heat up really fast.  The rollers do what they are supposed to do, but there are some engineering issues that need to be addressed:  One, the clips work perfectly on the smallest rollers, but are not big enough to hold my hair and the roller on the medium and large rollers.  I have long thick hair and that probably adds to the problem, but I&#x27;d imagine most people using hot rollers have fairly long hair. I always end up using the pins from my old hot rollers.  Secondly, the rollers are placed on three metal strips for heating, but arranged inside a scalloped shape, with a small cut-out for the small rollers, and large cut-outs for the large rollers. I find this rather irritating when I&#x27;m removing my rollers in the morning, and I have to stop and ponder how to get all the rollers back on the metal strips where all the rollers fit.  Sometimes, I just give up and leave them in a pile until I get home and have the energy to put the puzzle back together.  That said, the rollers are nice and seem of good quality, heat quickly and well, but are just lacking in the two areas mentioned above.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my hair</li>
    <li> I was so afraid to buy these after reading the reviews for this model and the older model. After watching a girl demo these on Youtube I thought I would give them a try. THEY work for ME! My curls were bouncy and glossy they held over night! the clips that others complained about falling out or not holding...Held my hair and didn&#x27;t fall out and happened to be very comfortable. I have long fine hair that usually will not hold a curl with curling irons. I did use a little volumizer spray and heat protective spray before using the rollers. I love them and I am so excited that I now have full bouncy curls :-) BUT like with anything try them for yourself some products work for some and not for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I really love these! I researched for a while on which set would be good for me and if the hot roller set would work. It works perfect. I have fine african american hair. When I leave my stylist, my hair is always gorgeous...full of body and curls. She curls it with the flat iron. I never have the same curls the next day but using the hot rollers, I can have the save bouncy curls without using any irons.&lt;br /&gt;People kept saying that they burn their fingers. The only thing I encountered was making sure I roll it away from my face so the roller won&#x27;t lay against it. But because everyone complained about burning their fingers, I bought some Reusable Rubber Finger Gloves(tm) but I haven&#x27;t had to use them.</li>
    <li> When I was in high school, the only way I could make my hair look like Rachel from Friends&#x27; hair was to get up EARLY in the  morning, every morning, and set my hair on hot rollers. I&#x27;ve had a set of Remingtons since back then that turned white when hot, and had wax inside to stay hotter longer, according to the accompanying instructions.  That set of hot rollers has served me well for over a decade and a half, and in the last few years, I haven&#x27;t done much with my hair other than let it air-dry and let my natural waves/curls be their bad selves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this magical hair setter arrived, courtesy of the Vine Program, and I might be a hot roller believer again, at least on days when I don&#x27;t want to look quite so wild-haired.  I ripped the box open and tried it right away, not even bothering to brush or section my hair first.  The rollers heat up in just a couple minutes, and the clips heat up even faster.  I didn&#x27;t even use a mirror.  I used all 20 rollers in the set, and while it DID accommodate all of my bra-band-length, very thick hair, it took a little effort, some roller rolling trickery, and I would have achieved a better end result had I not overstuffed the curlers.  Still, though, what I got were big, bouncy curls that looked quite nice!  This morning, I used all the rollers from this set and supplemented with my 1990s-era Remingtons, and I also took the time to section my hair beforehand- by the inch, it&#x27;s a cinch; by the yard, it&#x27;s hard.  The results were even better, with each roller having to deal with only a 3/4-inch thick section of roller-width hair.  I&#x27;m enjoying big, bouncy, curly hair today.  Actually I needed to put in some products to tone down the bigness some, because with my thick hair, it was almost as \\&quot;big\\&quot; as it is long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a good side-by-side comparison of the two sets of rollers.  The rollers on my Remingtons always got quite hot to the touch on the side that was closest to the heating unit when they were on their spindles, and the curlers themselves were sort of grippy-rubbery, which could make for some pulling.  Also, I had to buy Conair SuperClips for use with those rollers, because I never did get the roller-pin technique down.  The Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multi-Size Hair Setter heated up much faster than the Remingtons, were much more comfortable to roll and also slide out of my hair, with their flocked outside.  The ends stay cooler, too.  I like that the clips are also heated and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said before, I have thick, heavy, fairly long hair, and two sets would do the job better than just the one.  You can order extra rollers and clips in specific sizes from Conair, and they heat up fast enough that if that&#x27;s the route you wanted to take, if you know which size rollers work best for you and you don&#x27;t want to mess with the other sizes, but if you like using different sizes in different places in your hair, you might be farther ahead to just buy an extra set.  Then at least, you wouldn&#x27;t have to figure out where to store the extra rollers that won&#x27;t fit in the unit for storage. As for the comb and the argan oil packet, they&#x27;re nice perks, but nothing awfully special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one complaint I do have, and it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker, is that there is nowhere to store the 20 clips that came with this unit.  Three of them go along the right side, inside the unit by the curlers, and the other 17, you&#x27;re on your own figuring out how and where to store them.  I used a Zip-loc bag.  That doesn&#x27;t bother me so much, because with my original sets of Remington hot rollers, I bought the Conair Super Clips and had to figure out where to keep those clips, but they weren&#x27;t  made specifically for those curlers and they weren&#x27;t included with them.  The clips included with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat set are made specifically for these hot rollers, and they could have provided an on-board storage drawer for the clips, without adding too much extra size to the unit.  Still, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.  I love the ease of use of this hair setter, I love the results, and I really am thinking about buying another set and getting rid of my Remingtons finally, after all these years!nit.  Still, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.  I love the ease of use of this hair setter, I love the results, and I really am thinking about buying another set and getting rid of my Remingtons finally, after all these years!</li>
    <li> I have not used hot rollers for many years.when I did use them I would have curls for about 5 minutes then my hair would be straight again. When I saw the opportunity for these new curlers and their promises of lasting curls I thought why not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I washed my hair I applied the argone oil sample but it&#x27;s not really clear on how to use it it just says apply to wet or dry hair so I assume you leave it in your hair I put a little bit in my hand and rubbed on my freshly washed dry hair and it made it immediately frizzy so I didn&#x27;t care for that very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a learning curve with these rollers on figuring out just how to place the clips so you don&#x27;t get marks on the hair. The unit heats up fast but the rollers do not burn your fingers like the ones did from 20 yrs ago. I found the hot clips to be too hot against my scalp so I stopped heating the clips just used them. I waited 12 hours from the time I curled till writing this review. I still have beautiful bouncy curls. With my fine hair that is amazing. The only reason I took off 1 star is the clips don&#x27;t have on board storage. I&#x27;m just keeping mine in the box for now. The rollers don&#x27;t tangle when removed another big plus. Each person will need to set your own time and if you heat the clips or not. These are the best curlers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:Just had to come back and tell you my curls held for 5 days. No gels or sprays. I have fine thinner hair that is damaged from medications and coloring. My har looks fuller and so smooth and bouncy.  I upgraded my rating to 5 stars who cares if the clips are not on board. BEST hair curlers ever.</li>
    <li> First off, the box was missing the instructions.  I went on line and printed them out.&lt;br /&gt;Promo indicates that it takes 75 seconds for the unit to heat...no way.  Don&#x27;t believe any hair setter is at heat necessary in such a short time.&lt;br /&gt;Indicator light...when ready to use, it should go from reddish orange to a white...mine did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to some good news:&lt;br /&gt;1. There are plenty of rollers&lt;br /&gt;2. Rollers were comfortable and easy to secure with clips provided&lt;br /&gt;3. All rollers heat at the same time, but only 3 clips at a time...so the user has to add from the generous supply of extra clips as each is being removed and use them in sequence...thought this would be a true annoyance...surprisingly, it was not bad to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 plus minutes, or when heat dissipated from rollers in head, removed the clips and rollers and let hair cool, then finger styled and shook out the curls...a very nice soft look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as portability...no case is provided.  It is best as an at home unit.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and these rollers did a good job of adding bounce and body. The set heats up quickly. The flocked rollers are gentle to the hair and the hot pink plastic edges make them fairly easy to handle. The twist on this set is that you can also heat up the butterfly clips three at a time. This is supposed to prevent crimping and lines in the hair. I used them on one half of my head and unheated on the other and can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference. But overall, I did like the quality of the curl and the increase in body. I liked the butterfly clips. I admit to being a bit of a klutz and have never mastered the old school pins. The bonus wide tooth comb and sample of argan oil was considerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not, however, a perfectly designed set.  First the ready to use light is on one of the rollers. This is confusing and hard to see. Secondly, the clips must be contained separately making them susceptible to loss and damage. Thirdly you must unplug the device to turn it off. While that is probably not bad practice with small appliances, it is annoying. Finally, I really wish manufacturers would use retractable cords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that these curlers would be as successful on very thick or long hair. My hair is medium length and layered.But overall I was pleased. My hair had lasting body, curl and shine. Recommended.</li>
    <li> There are several things you need to know&lt;br /&gt;1.  I am a klutz with no aptitude working a curling iron without burning myself and giving up in frustration.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I have no desire to spend hours getting ready&lt;br /&gt;3.  I like to see progress and find it frustrating wondering if I have curled something I can&#x27;t see&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with the conair xtreme multi-size hair setter.  It is so easy to use.  It heats up quickly, I can quickly set my hair and since my hair is in rollers, I can see what is left to do.  I can wander the house doing things instead of being tied to a curling iron in front of a mirror.  Finally no pony tails, no hiding under a hat with sloping shoulders knowing my hair looks like $%#@!.  I am not used to passing a mirror and finding my hair looking this good with so little effort.  Love the clips that hold the rollers in place.  I am spending minimal time and when I am done find myself strutting with confidence.  Finally something that works well for me.</li>
    <li> Heats super fast but not crazy about the clips. Poor quality design in the clips.</li>
    <li> It is true that the heated clips are not good close to hairline.  It is true the clips leave a crimp mark on your hair.  I solved this by using the clips you get in B&amp;B supply store, usually in black or white color and so LOVE THIS PRODUCT as it works great otherwise.  Heats up quick as stated.  Highly recommend !!</li>
    <li> the rollers heat fast, the curls last long and it was a gold box deal ! It also has different size rollers and nice clips that don&#x27;t leave bumps in your hair !</li>
    <li> These are my secret to big curls. I have had a lot of people ask what salon I went to get my hair done! Great for styling hair for formal events, or just because. Takes about fifteen minutes and the variety in size of curlers makes it look more natural and less pageant-like.  I didn&#x27;t get a wide tooth comb like this suggests, but I don&#x27;t mind because I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> These were my first set of hot curlers, so I have nothing to compare to. But I must admit that I was surprised with how well they worked! I was Sandy from Grease for Halloween this year, and I&#x27;m not big on wigs. Somehow, I managed to pull it off with these. If they could work well for me, someone who hasn&#x27;t got a clue when it comes to styling hair, imagine the possibilities of someone who does! I&#x27;m actually having a good time exploring different ways to use the curlers, from some help with my friends who are not as challenged as I am when it comes to styling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside: it claims to have a light (which it does) that is red when it is first plugged in (which it is) that it is supposed to change from red to white when ready (which it does not). I have worked around this... the longer they are heated...the better they work!</li>
    <li> The clip is really bad quality and is way too small for the rollers. When you clip it on, it just slides off. The rollers get quite hot, which is nice. But I don&#x27;t know if my hair is too long or something, but the rollers are too small for a whole strand of hair to go around. So unless you have short and super thin hair, this is pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> Hate it!  I purchased this to replace an old Conair (with wire clips). . . These constantly slip out of my hair, are loose, have to be refastened.  And my hair isn&#x27;t that thin!  If  you use the heated clips on the hair on top of your head (that shows after you comb out) the hot clips will leave a dent in the hair.  Very unsatisfactory!!</li>
    <li> It dates what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It makes great curls and adds body. As far as the construction, there should have a place to wined the cord and not just to wrap it around the appliance. Also it should have come with a bag for the clips. The section the warms the clips is a wast of space it should have been made so that you can store the cord in the space.</li>
    <li> Very good product but my hair was too short for the size rollers</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m one that does massive research before I buy anything. So needless to say, I googled searched, saw all the youtube videos there&#x27;s to see, and read most amazon review and decided to purchase The Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Jumbo And Super Jumbo Hair Setter with Super Clips and Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multi-Size Hair Setter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as they came in, I put them to the test.  I washed and blow-dried my hair. It&#x27;s long and layered. They were ready to go after 5 minutes of plugging them in. I rolled up sections as I dried it (double the heat).  I also sprayed the dried sections with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Elnett Satin Hairspray Extra Strong Hold.  I used the multi-size rollers for the back to create tighter curls and the jumbo rollers for the front and bangs to create volume and loose waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished setting them all, I resprayed.  I put on my make-up, got dressed, and had coffee.  Left them in for about 45 minutes.  They were completely cool to the touch before taking them off.  I was very impressed with the end result. Beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the clips for the Multi-size roller; they don&#x27;t hold the roller enough to stay in place.  Other than that, great buy!</li>
    <li> I would have returned these rollars if I hadn&#x27;t waited so long. They leave a crease in my hair where the clip was. I had a wonderful set of Conair curlers previous to these, same price. So I expected the same quality. I don&#x27;t know what do with the crease. I&#x27;m living with them till I find a set I like.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  It&#x27;s soft and straight but will hold a curl, hence my purchase of these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up with a set of rollers that was similar--also Conair, also a set like this.  There is one primary difference: those had metal clips or pins.  These have larger, heatable clips.  However, there is a single size of clip for all the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve run into two primary problems that doom this product.  First, the clips fail to actually clip the roller into fine hair.  Everything just tumbles down.  Fine hair lacks the texture to hold the clip.  You&#x27;d think the flocking would help.  It would, if the clip would actually clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and I believe this would be a problem for everyone, is that the clip doesn&#x27;t work for the largest size of rollers anyway.  It fits--barely--around an empty roller.  Add hair, and it no longer fits.  This is poor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself wishing for the old-style metal pins, even though sometimes they hurt!  They seemed to work better than these newer clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not planning to return this item, but that&#x27;s more out of laziness than satisfaction with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On edit, I see that other people have also have problems with the clips.  I also see that Conair sells a set of clips alone (\\&quot;superclips\\&quot;).  Does that make anyone else as irritated as it makes me?</li>
    <li> The flocking did not work with my fine smooth hair. Even with the clips the curlers would not stay in.</li>
    <li> The unit did not heat sufficiently.  Heated clips are a good idea, but needs better design to avoid leaving dents in the hair.  Save your money...</li>
    <li> Love them they hold a curl and are so easy to put in I would recommend them to ANYBODY!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this and tried it 2 times.  I absolutely love it and am impressed.  Its replacing my old old conair one that was terrible and never handled my hair well.  I have chin length super straight hair and gives it body and it lasts a few hours so far.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order the hot rollers because I have had several over the past few years that were all unsatisfactory  the last set by Revlon actually melted because they would not stay put in the case they had. Love the way this is set up  Heats great  the set stayed in and its great having the clips also heated which I didn&#x27;t realize when I had ordered  very nice  I am very happy with this</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, down to the middle of my back and often have trouble finding hot curler clips that will hold my hair.  These curlers are nice because it&#x27;s a gentle heat and you can heat up the clips in the container but for me, unless I use tiny sections of my hair and that would take me all day to do, these clips just didn&#x27;t hold the curlers in.  I tried on one section of my head to use tiny sections and it took me a long time.  Then I tried using normal section pieces and the clips and curlers just slip right now.  I think this would be good for someone with thin hair or a young girl.  It&#x27;s a great product but I need heavy duty clips.</li>
    <li> My wife is using these to set her long hair, replacing an old Conair set which has very large rollers.  She says these are a better fit for someone with medium to short length hair, whereas her hair is very long.  They do the job though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her only big complaint is that the handles for the clips are too small even for her tiny fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a great set and the fact that she switched over to it completely is a testament to its quality and function.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of hot rollers in the past, so my experience with these is based on a comparison to others. These rollers heat up quickly, which is a plus. But for me, they were hard to use. There&#x27;s nothing on the barrel of the roller to help grip the hair, so it slides right off. Holding the roller is difficult because there is no raised edge on one side. My hair is shoulder length and super fine, so it doesn&#x27;t get a tight hold from the heated hair clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product a three simply because the problems I had might be particular to me.</li>
    <li> I had this exact set of rollers before -- I got a second set in order to combine them, and have more of the smaller rollers, which I use more.  So I have used this set of rollers about 3 times a week for the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly (not in 75 seconds or whatever they claim, but easily in under 5 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;- Gets VERY hot in that time (you can open the lid during heating if you prefer it less got)&lt;br /&gt;- Clips really help to hold the curl&lt;br /&gt;- Flocking on rollers avoids damaging your hair&lt;br /&gt;- Flocking is durable (on some previous roller sets I had, the flocking wore off easily, but on this set, it&#x27;s only barely wearing off a couple of rollers after about 300+ usings)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This set used to have an on/off switch on the front, which was GREAT, since you didn&#x27;t have to unplug it every time.  I guess Conair just needed to be cheap and save 5 cents on the manufacturing of each set or something...hate it when companies make their product worse just to make a bigger profit!&lt;br /&gt;- The top lid&#x27;s hinge is a little flimsy -- it breaks somewhat easily, especially if you move/shift the set around a lot (which you&#x27;ll tend to do more since you now have to keep unplugging it!)&lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; wide tooth comb and packet of Argan oil are not very useful.  Nothing quite as messy as a foil packet of oil...a better \\&quot;free bonus\\&quot; would be an extra clip or two, since that you might actually use if you lose one!  (Roller sets used to come with at least one extra clip for this reason.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this set -- it would just be nice if Conair would bring back the on/off switch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying this is a really good hot roller set that is easy to use and fast.  The rollers took about 5 minutes to heat up as indicated by one of the rollers having a dot on the top of it that turns white when they&#x27;re ready.  In actuality, 10 minutes worked better.  There are three different size rollers, 8 large, 6 medium, and 6 small for a variety of tightness in your curls.  The velvety roller gives all the perception that you&#x27;re not frying your hair, and the heated plastic clips secure the roller in place well.  I was a little concerned that there is only room for 3 clips at a time being heated in the unit, but they heat up extremely quickly.  If you replace the clips as you go, they heat up plenty, in fact almost too much.  The rollers are easy to handle hot, but the clip is actually a little hotter and has the potential to burn so don&#x27;t let it touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have long straight thick hair that generally takes curls well and I have a lot of it which posed some logistical problems.  I would prefer that all the rollers be the same size since you really do notice a difference in the tightness of curls for each of them and the smaller size comes out a bit frizzy.  There also aren&#x27;t enough rollers in the set for me to set all my hair and leave it in, but you do have the option to purchase extra rollers and switch them out as you go like the clips. Unfortunately with the potential for extra rollers and the fact that most of the clips come in a separate package, the unit doesn&#x27;t store everything nice and neat.  You need to store the clips separately so could lose or break them.  The cord on the unit is not retractable either.  Lastly, there is no on/off switch or auto off feature which is surprising.  Apparently there are other models by this maker that at the very least have an on/off switch.  I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s not the case here, but you have to unplug it to shut it off and it&#x27;s important that you do, since I wouldn&#x27;t besurprised if the clips melted over time, they get so hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the results are good and these are by far the best hot rollers I&#x27;ve used, but there are some issues with the logistics.</li>
    <li> Work Great. This is my 3rd set in ten years. I use them daily.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered these for my oldest daughter who has long, fine, and thin hair.  She was doing natural pageants and I couldn&#x27;t get her hair to hold a curl from a curling iron and foam curlers were just too tight and frizzy.  Now I know these say instant heat but I let the curlers heat up a good 10 minutes before I start using them on her hair.  Just a note, if your hair has a hard time curling, dirty hair works best.  If you are working with clean dry hair, I suggest putting lots of hair spray on each section of hair before rolling it.  I&#x27;ve found that if you want a relax look, use the larger curlers and if you are looking for more of a tight curl, use the small.  I leave them in her hair for at least 10 minutes, sometimes 30 to 60 minutes.  When I take out the curlers, I don&#x27;t let them fall out, I actually unwrap it so the curl stays in place.  After all the rollers are all out I hair spray some more.  Once the hair spray is dry I style it.  I have found that if have the clip up too high on the roller, it will leave an indent.  I wish I could find a set of curlers I like with the pins, but after trial and error, I&#x27;ve learned how to use these curlers with much success!</li>
    <li> My hair is too fine, the clips did not hold the curler and the whole thing just fell out of my hair.  Returned the product the next day</li>
    <li> I wish it worked better.I feel like the rollers get not hot enough,it is what it is .Do not buy this product if you have Thick hair it will a complete waste of your money</li>
    <li> I was using this product and decided to purchase a newer set.  The information listed with the hair setter indicated that it had an on/off switch which I was looking for as the one I was using had one.  When I received the product I found that there is no on/off switch and I now have to plug and unplug the hair setter for each use.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hot rollers of 30 years finally died.  I took a chance with these and LOVE them. I have had them about a month now and think they are great.  As others have noted, they are not for all hair types.  I have fine hair mid shoulder length and the roller sizes are perfect.  I do use product to extend the curls but they now last all day.  For those that complain there is nowhere to hold the curler without burning your hands, not true, you just need to learn how.  For those who complain they just flop around and the clips don&#x27;t hold,  pull your hair out then roll  so you can get the roller tight to your scalp.  Yes the hot clips can burn your ears.  DONT use hot clips near your ears...  Common sense people!  Anyway  FIVE STARS  this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I usually have good luck with Conair products--they are economical, durable and do their job well. This curling set, however, is one I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing.  The idea of heated clips sounded great at the store, but every time I use them, they leave crimp/tooth marks in my hair.  Additionally, the clips do a poor job of holding the curler in place on my shoulder-length hair.  As another consumer noted, it requires several re-tries to get the clip to hold--many times I just give up and use my curling iron.  I&#x27;ve owned the set about two months now, but will be donating it to Goodwill in favor of a different set with standard pins rather the plastic \\&quot;chip bag\\&quot; style of clip provided with this roller set.</li>
    <li> This is the second Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Setter that I own.  There is nothing wrong with the set that I&#x27;ve had for 6 or 7 years.  I just love this set so much that I wanted a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; just in case.  Also, I bought the first Setter when I had very short hair, and now that my hair is longer, I generally only use the largest size roller, so it&#x27;s nice to have a few more of that size.&lt;br /&gt;  This Instant Heat Setter is really instant!  It heats faster than my curling iron.  The rollers are extremely easy to use - and I think they are easier on my hair than the velcro type.  Each roller has a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; ends which makes it easy on my fingers and my hair.  The heated clips are a nice feature, but the Setter works well, even when the clips are not heated.  Before I tried this Setter I always had a problem getting hot rollers to stay in my hair - the pics and pins never seemed to hold the roller in place.  The clips have solved this problem.  The only remotely negative thing I can say is that it takes a while for my hair to cool down.  I like to put the rollers in and have them cool down before I remove them and that takes at least 15 minutes, which isn&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;instant.\\&quot;  But, if I want less curl, I clip in all the rollers and then remove them and allow my hair to cool when the rollers are removed.  This works very well and is very quick!!&lt;br /&gt;  The comb and the Argan Oil were nice bonuses, but I would buy this hair setter with no reservations if these 2 \\&quot;extras\\&quot; were not available. If you like to add some curls or waves to your hairstyle - this Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Mult-size Hair Setter is for you.  You can vary the amount of curl by using different roller sizes and by the length of time you leave the rollers in your hair.  This product really does not take much more time to use than a curling iron.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought my wife this set for her birthday to replace her spiky heavy plastic ones that slide over heater pegs-very old school. But these new ones just didn&#x27;t have the curling &#x27;punch&#x27; she was used to. Bless her heart, she tried to make these work since they were a gift, but just couldn&#x27;t get them to perform. It was if the new system was too &#x27;soft&#x27; or maybe too safely designed to really curl her hair. She has gone back to her 20+ year old set.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multi-Size Hair Setter with Bonus Wide Tooth Comb and Packet of Argan Oil! This product is well worth the money. The flocked (soft, fuzzy) surface of the roller helps hold the hair in place. Curlers heat up quickly and it does not take long to set hair to create voluminous, soft, beautiful, natural looking curls. I use these several times a week in the morning before work and it does not take too long for those that are in a hurry in the morning. I also have a curling iron but I prefer the use of these rollers because of the incredible volume, softness and natural look of the curl. Curls do not look frozen or stiff as you often get with curling irons. Tip: Use a heat protection spray before you place hair around the roller. Once all of your hair is on the rollers, add a bit of flexible hair spray while it is cooling. Your curls will last all day! The rollers come with clips (not the metal pins) and they are very easy to use, a wide tooth bonus comb and last but not least, ARGAN OIL! I adore argan oil. It makes my hair so very happy! Guess what? I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Let me draw a rather obvious picture for you before I really dig into my review.  When using heated rollers, the user wraps hair around the curler.  The layers of hair act as a buffer between the hot curler and the person&#x27;s scalp.  Just tuck the clip into place and you can go about your business until the curlers cool and you remove them to reveal your curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not if you use these curlers, though, because some \\&quot;genius\\&quot; thought that more heat would improve the curl and figured out a way to heat the clips too.  Now, instead of there being any distance between your flesh and heat, there is potentially none at all.  This is especially the case along your hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used these, I had slight red marks all along my forehead and my ears were practically glowing because the curlers kept slipping and the heated clips kept touching my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was not pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already own heated hair curlers, you likely have a set where you can take the clips and store them, either in a space on one side or along the back.  Not with this set of curlers.  There is nowhere to store the clips for the curlers.  They don&#x27;t even offer a zipper bag or something for them.  You&#x27;re on your own.  If you have a bag or something in which you can store the clips, good.  If not, I would suggest buying something or creating something before you use these curlers because you&#x27;ll need to keep rotating new clips onto the heating element to get the full benefit of those heated clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the obvious solution is simply to not put the clips on the heating elements.  Sort of defeats the purpose of actually having heating clips.  But if you&#x27;re like me, you probably don&#x27;t want your ears and forehead to be bright red and would prefer not to experience the discomfort of the heated clips anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poorly thought out and very poorly designed set of heated curlers.</li>
    <li> I was excited about these curlers-they take up less room on my bathroom counter, and work just like my other set.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still going to use my other set. These were a pretty horrible experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, I plugged it in. There isn&#x27;t an on/off switch-not a big deal, you just plug or unplug. I then noticed there is no place to store the clips. It holds 3 in the case, and as for the rest, well pray you have space/organization somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;They heated up very quickly though. I didn&#x27;t time it, but I believe they were only plugged in for 2min before the indicator light went off. O and on that subject, the indicator light is easily compared to a math test. The instructions sounds easy-it&#x27;ll go white. Well SURPRISE! It&#x27;s not that large, easy to see light that turns white. That would be too easy. It&#x27;s a light on one particular curler that goes white. It took me a second to spot. Whatever, I rolled my eyes and went on.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a curler. And then dropped it. Because the entire curler gets pretty hot. All my other sets have at least some area that you can grip that isn&#x27;t as hot as the conducting metal. Not this set! My finger prints were burned off after use.&lt;br /&gt;I manned up though, and proceded to put them in my hair. I figured out that the fuzzy \\&quot;non-slip\\&quot; part of the curler is actually warm compared to the plastic hot pink ends. And as a side note, if you use the heated clips, prepare for some pain, because those are hotter than you know where.&lt;br /&gt;As i was curling, I noticed the clips were not wrapping around the large curlers that I was using. Because I have fairly thick, medium length, silky hair (especially after using the argon oil. That stuff is why the review gets 2 stars) and because I&#x27;m not fond of the poodle look, I used the largest (there are 8 of those) curlers. I made very certain to place the clips then, because they weren&#x27;t wrapping correctly, in such a way so as to not achieve the lined look in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;How silly of me, because once they were all happily set, and I unplugged it for safety, they began to slip around. What happened to non-slip? Beats me.&lt;br /&gt;I made sure then, to not move around at any pace faster than a slug. I mostly just sat around because I was afraid to do much more movement than breathing. In retrospect, it made no difference. After 15min, the clips had moved around so very much, and of course, as I took out the curlers, my hair had the dreaded lines. Which were even more accentuated by the argon oil in my hair. I brushed my hair with the wide-toothed comb provided, which actually did better than expected, and yes, my hair was curled well. Except for the lines. And it somehow ended up looking very greasy after using the curlers-it didn&#x27;t before them. Weird, I know.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel like throwing the set out of a window, and keeping the argon oil and comb. I don&#x27;t believe this was the intended effect Conair was going for. Save your money, these aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is very easy to use, just turn it on and in 5 minutes the rollers are hot. Enough rollers for medium lenght hair. The clips do make a little mark on your hair so I tend to use them cold so there is no mark on my hair. Get the one with the on and off botton otherwise you need to plug it in and out every time you wish to use it.</li>
    <li> reasonably price and it does its job</li>
    <li> O.K.  I am not great at hair styling.  That said, this is the third set of hot rollers I have tried and this is by far, my favorite set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  different size rollers for different size curls&lt;br /&gt;-  these rollers really get hot and even hold a curl on my fine / thin hair&lt;br /&gt;-  creates curls that last&lt;br /&gt;-  love the clips (These work so much better than the twisable ends or pins of my other hot roller sets.)&lt;br /&gt;-  heat up VERY fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  not really enough in the set to do your whole heat of hair if you have long hair (wish there were double of each size)&lt;br /&gt;-  large case, so not easy for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I am still experimenting with how to roll my hair so that the ends don&#x27;t crimp (my fault, not the rollers) I am very pleased with this product.  I think I have finally found a hot roller set that works for me and my hair.  I am even thinking about ordering another set so that I have double the rollers and can set my hair all at once, leaving the rollers in while I get other things done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a hot roller set that is a good value and works, try this set.  You won&#x27;t be disapointed.</li>
    <li> Found it very hard to secure the roller with the clips, disappointing.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone who has long hair. My hair is medium-thick and a little past my shoulders. I didn&#x27;t get the result I had hoped for with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multi-Size Hair Setter. I&#x27;m sad I threw my old set away now- it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes the gray plastic clips in the photo, but the clips don&#x27;t keep the roller in place.. I had to redo three or four throughout the process. I ended up ordering the Conair Super Clips SPC10X 10 count- they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set warms up quickly, that&#x27;s a plus. They were hot to the touch, but not hot enough to curl my hair. I&#x27;ve used them several times and tried different things to improve the quality of curls, but it hasn&#x27;t helped. The end result is less than okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m disappointed. Conair has let me down this time.</li>
    <li> I want rollers that give me curl, or just body, without the wrinkles that can occur with some roller/clip combinations. These do the trick. Let them heat completely up. Then leave it until they cool for curls, take them out after a few minutes for body. (Don&#x27;t brush your hair until it cools completely). The oil that comes with the curlers gives great shine and keeps those flyaway hairs from popping out. I will definitely buy more of that stuff. The curlers are easy to use without burning fingers, the clips are strong enough to keep hair from slipping, and they work! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these. Conair is the only hair care products I&#x27;ve bought since I was fifteen, and I&#x27;m OLD now. Smile.</li>
