<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great cream. smells good &amp; the spf 30 is perfect.</li>
    <li> use this product after wrinkle cream and get a pretty good result. a little to sticky. will try another of your products.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this.....Not greasy but through the day it ran in my eyes and burned no matter how much I altered the application. Maybe running from the forehead?? Nose?? Then about 2/3 the way through the bottle my neck broke out it itchy and ended up at the dermatologist&lt;br /&gt;trying to get it to stop. Not exactly sure if it was this cream or not but gone back to some other creams and everything is settling down again.&lt;br /&gt;Texture was great with this. So maybe somebody with less sensitivity would love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this day cream.  I was using an expensive day cream and this stuff is better.  I have noticed an overall clarity of my skin that I didn&#x27;t have with the expensive cream.  I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> Actually find this stuff very greasy. Not like usual RoC products with are invisible.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  Too soon to know if it is effective.</li>
    <li> skin looked better after one week of use</li>
    <li> I am returning this is not original</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer after seeing a review in Health magazine. they said it was light and for hot steamy New York summers, you need light. Weelll, it&#x27;s pretty light but still a noticeable film on my face. That said, I am satisfied with this product, but not ecstatic. The 50 spf is better than I hoped for and the lift/tightening is a plus. I cover my age spots/freckles across my cheekbones and put some down to and under my jawbone for my \\&quot;jowls\\&quot;. so this replaces the 2 products I normally use. Amazon&#x27;s price was good, better than the big box drugstores. With an additional small purchase it made free shipping.</li>
    <li> The best day moisturizer with the right amount of non-greasy SPF and as a bonus non-comedogenic (important for acne-prone skin). I apply after washing, toning, and serum but before my foundation. It already includes a facial smoother so I can skip the skin smoother/blur step with this day moisturizer. I love how it&#x27;s feather light and absorbs quickly but leaves my skin soft all day. I&#x27;ve used it for months and yes when used daily, your skin will look firmer (but please note I also use this moisturizer in conjuction with instanatural&#x27;s anti-aging acne and eye serums during the day and at night those serums along with instanatural&#x27;s skin brightening moisturizer and Roc&#x27;s Deep Wrinkle Filler).</li>
    <li> Very greasy. Didn&#x27;t go well under makeup. Total waste. I&#x27;m glad  I tried it with an Amazon gift card ,instead of paying almost double at a drug store. So disappointed I heard a lot of good things about &#x27;Roc&#x27;  products.</li>
    <li> RoC CompleteLift Day Cream feels soft on skin; it does not do anything other, but I do like how it feels.  Ok if you get the buy 1 get 50% off another ROC product.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for many years and I really love it!  For me is the best!  I will buy more soon!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 4 weeks, and still no jawl lift, so I returned to facial muscle exercise. This seems to be an expensive sunscreen, whose use is important to prevent skin detereoration from sun exposure. I may try the antigravity serum, but I don&#x27;t expect much there either.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much change in  5 months . Use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> ROC&#x27;s advertising slogan is &amp;#34;We Keep our Promises.&amp;#34;  This product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! So smooth!!</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect to use after the shower to keep your face fresh and protect from the sun and give you a very good sensation</li>
    <li> I have been using this for at least two years now.  I love it!  It works  and leaves a nice finish for applying makeup.  I use this somedays and on others I use Lancôme absolue day cream.  On days I know I will be outside the Roc is on my face.  I have never got a burn with this on and it seems to plump up the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> My wife is used this for a very long time and go without it .</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the RoC products.  However, this product feels more like a sunblock than a daily moisturizer. I can only tab on very-very little to the point of my skin feeling dry in some spots because if I put on a decent amount my skin will look shiny (but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy).  Not sure of the solution.  Nevertheless, it contains broad spectrum (SPF 30) which is a must now a days!!</li>
    <li> ROC is a great product overall.  I bought this for the summer months for extra SPF protection</li>
    <li> Light, no fragrance, not oily and feel confident with SPF 30</li>
    <li> I saw this recommended in a skin care article and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Its makes skin smooth and stays all day.</li>
    <li> I am almost 50 and the fine lines and tone of my skin improved greatly. You need to give this product a try for a good week or two to enjoy the results. Well worth it and is now my go to daily face cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best moisture cream that is sold!  The price was amazing based on what its priced at drug stores.  I have really dry skin and under my makeup its hard to find a face cream that feels smoothe, but this is it!! Dont hesitate to buy this, its worth the money you pay for it..</li>
    <li> It is ok. I don&#x27;t think it did anything for my skin. But it didn&#x27;t make my skin greasy either, so that&#x27;s good. Some reviews said that its smell is too strong but I didn&#x27;t think that was the case. It smells nice and not too strong. And the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the original Roc daily moisturizer w SPF 30. The original was a bit too greasy and had read that this is a lighter formula. It is lighter in the formula but still leaves a shiny look to my face. I guess it might be the SPF in both creams that leave the shine. Will use but. It sure if I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. My skin was really starting to show signs of age and neglect, and daily use of this product (and the night cream) has made a huge difference. Multiple friends/family have commented on how great my skin looks. Strongly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Note: Amazon price is significantly cheaper than in-store pricing.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to just about anyone. This moisturizer has an SPF of 30 and it leaves my dry skin soft. I live in Arizona so dry skin is a problem. At night I use the Multi Correxion Night Cream.</li>
    <li> This product not only lifts and moisturizes your skin, but it has an SPF of 30 which is what I wear year round.  It has a nice smell and really works!  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Well the ingredients say this is nothing more than sunscreen.  Not sure where the anti-gravity comes in.  The label is only thing that says lift and anti-gravity.  Guess if you are protected from the sun you will keep your skin lifted.  Preventive good but I wanted corrective action in my day cream.  Compared this to my regular sunscreen and they were identical in ingredients.  Like the consistency of this cream however. I think I wanted more from my day cream for anti aging purposes than just sunscreen.  I will use this up as I like it for sunscreen purposes but won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing the product. It  is the most effective wrinkle cream I have tried. It works great creating a smooth moisterized complexion and minimizing the appearance of deep wrinkles.  I am keeping it handy for daily sun protection.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended using this and I am very happy she did.  I am in my 60s, and it has kept my skin smooth and fresh looking.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great!  Not only it has SPF 30, it goes on really smoothly and has a great light scent (that somewhat helps mask the sunscreen smell).  Would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight yet moisturizing anti-aging facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought for my wife, she loved, the cream works very well, she was very happy with the results,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and she recommends .</li>
    <li> Happy with this lotion. Container lasts longer than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  I like the SPF 30 factor and find it a good moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good day moisturizer and decided to try this product because I&#x27;ve liked every ROC product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I like that this product has SPF so I can apply it in the morning and then not have to worry about applying sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be outside.  That being said, the cream is a bit thicker than I thought it would be (I expected it to be lighter) and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling as smooth as I would like.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dry skin since using this product, so it does work well as a moisturizer.  Overall I am satisfied with this product and would order again.</li>
    <li> A little harsh for my skin</li>
    <li> This seems to work well for my aging skin as a moisturizer with some &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; to it!</li>
    <li> Fast ship as described</li>
    <li> Great seller.  Product arrives as described and very fast.  Product is so-so.  I don&#x27;t think I will become a fan of ROC any time soon.  The texture is a little too thick and gives me zits.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever used.  It has been like a magic eraser of time on my face.  I am forty-two years old and in my years I&#x27;ve seen it all and it was starting to show on my face.  I&#x27;m like everyone else living this rat-race half asleep and fueled by coffee, but my face has become fresh as a daisy.  I team it up with the multicorrexion night cream.  The results have been amazing.  I&#x27;ve gotten back 10 years and then some.  When I look good I also feel better which is also a great plus.  The longer I use it the better I look.</li>
    <li> I am 72 years old.  This stuff works. That&#x27;s really all I have to say about this good product. I use it all the time under minimal makeup</li>
    <li> Seems to give you face a tighter appearance for that day of use.</li>
    <li> Used this product for about a week and love it. I definitely will purchase other products from this line. Highly recommend trying RoC products.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many facial moisturizers and I like the RoC line which I purchased from Amazon. My only complaint about virtually all daytime facial moisturizers is that they contain sunscreens. When I perspire these creams leach into my eyes and it burns like crazy. I use a daytime moisturizer during the day and I don&#x27;t always go outside so this pain is pointless. I wish someone would manufacture a good daytime cream that does not have a sunscreen. I prefer wearing a hat and I would skip the sunscreen altogether. Other than this quibble, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> had high hopes to remove wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;have not seen any difference, like all other products, did not work, save your money..</li>
    <li> Use all the time and have gotten good results!</li>
    <li> I am using it for over a year now, but I can feel my skin much more hydrated than before and less sensitive to the weather. I think is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend to anybody mainly for those with mature skin.</li>
    <li> When I use this moisturizer my skin tends to feel a little dry and needing moisturizer.  I like other Roc products but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m 46 w/normal skin</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really correct the dark spots on my face… But it is a decent moisturizer for daily use</li>
    <li> Great product but does not last long</li>
    <li> the best sunscreen q had. I think buying another . I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> May be my skin type but my skin did not like these Roc products at all.&lt;br /&gt;I saw where another review had problems too&lt;br /&gt;It left a sore on my chin so I quit using it for a while and tried later..&lt;br /&gt;Then I ended up with 2 sores on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always buy 1 then buy the rest of the regimen.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that the wrinkles are minimized but this is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product so far. Too soon to see if it gives me the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I do love it.  I love the feel of it especially.  It goes on so smooth and feels good on your skin.</li>
    <li> As I stated in another review, I am a fan of the Roc line. It&#x27;s priced right and you do get results. I am in my late 40&#x27;s (that&#x27;s too much information already.....) and I look about 10 years younger than my actual age. I attribute this to sunscreen during the day, every day, and retinol at night. It&#x27;s not that complicated. I decided to try this one because I&#x27;m seeing a little bit of beginning sagging and that is just not too cute........ I like the multi correction spf moisturizer more than I like this one. That one is my go to and I&#x27;ll be going back to it.  This has a nice velvety texture, but like the eye cream you have to figure out just how much is the right amount for you to apply. If you use too much the product will sort of ball up, which is gross and you can&#x27;t put make up on over that..... If you use too little your face does not feel moisturized at all and you won&#x27;t get the benefit of the spf.  I don&#x27;t think I see any lifting results from this and I don&#x27;t find the product particularly moisturizing, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Use it daily and it is a good base for my mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer in production, unfortunately.  I wrote to the manufacturer when I could no longer find it on store shelves.   Wish they would bring it back.  I am in the process of trying to find something equivalent.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It goes on light doesn&#x27;t burn eyes.</li>
    <li> i was using multicorrection spf at first but i saw this one an i decide to try it an yes i like it better this is my second time ordering this item is very light it do not smell strong,i don&#x27;t see any lifting but is very good spf moisturizer leaves your face an neck very soft i used this everytime at go out</li>
    <li> Needed an easy to travel cream with sunscreen. So nice I&#x27;m still using it a month later.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I think it does have an effect on making the skin on your face look younger and tighter.  It takes a while though, but I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great  product. Moisturizes and conditions my skin so it looks great! I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Awesome, protects me from sun and moisturizers too. Not leaky at all. I never feel that is melts on application. After three weeks my bf noticed I looked more refreshed and my skin subtle. I honestly see that it has smoothed out my face. Good product, nothing magical but I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have started using this product about a month ago. I really like the way my skin feels after I apply it, it feels very silky. I actually like the smell of this product. I was afraid I would find it too strong (per some other reviewers), but I don&#x27;t find it strong at all. After a month I already see results. I am 35 years-old, and have thin lines which have started to soften. I re-ordered it again for when I run out!</li>
    <li> Economically priced and quick ship.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks. I like having 25 + spf in my moisturizer so I always have protection so love that. The texture is easy to apply but doesn&#x27;t give me the really great moisturizer feeling. No noticeable improvement in wrinkles but it&#x27;s early days.</li>
    <li> shipped timely and fair price</li>
    <li> I have never used ROC products before but this one will make a believer out of me!  Though it does smell good, you can tell its SPF - which is what I bought it for along with the corrective items it advertised.  I swear my face looks better the moment i put it on!  Today I actually left the house with just this on (I am 45 years old).  Sometimes I wear it at night too.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I like that it has sunscreen plus fights wrinkles.  I apply it at night after cleansing and also in the morning, but I wait to apply makeup so it will absorb well into my skin.  It goes on light and non-greasy and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> Not ideal- as it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as moist as I&#x27;d like... but, overall good. I haven&#x27;t noticed any visual difference though? But I&#x27;ve used skin products/lotions/oils for YEARS- so I&#x27;m just trying to maintain and keep the signs of aging from coming too quickly. Being 41- I have to be proactive- even more so now! Still like the product- as most Roc products feel good and work well :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say if it works or not because I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.  It says in the description that it has &amp;#34;Pure RoC retinol&amp;#34; but it does not have any retinol in this product.  If you can read the package (I couldn&#x27;t from my computer), you will see that it does not contain retinol.</li>
    <li> Using this with the face wash daily resurfacing pads and sensitive retinol treatment at night.  So far, I&#x27;ve had redness, irritation and dry skin patches.  I&#x27;ve even had some acne blow up however, I understand this is part of the process of the skins purging and therefore, IM giving it another two weeks.  If nothign changes, I will stop using but so far &#x3D;so good.  Looking forward to seeing the end result.  Give it time.</li>
    <li> I like anything Roc makes, so I hope this product does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a spf 30 day moisturizer that was good for sensitive skin &amp; not cause acne.  I didn&#x27;t realize this was an anti aging cream, too lol I&#x27;ve used it every day for less than a week &amp; I&#x27;m kinda shocked by how great my skin looks especially how smooth &amp; toned my forehead is &amp; I didn&#x27;t even buy it for those benefits but I&#x27;m certainly happy with the results &amp; glad I did buy it! My skin feels great &amp; I slather this all over my neck, too. Can&#x27;t forget about that sexy neck haha if I can block out the sun &amp; not get acne I&#x27;m super happy. If I can do those two things AND get tightened, firmer skin?! Over the moon! Love love love this. I&#x27;m kinda nerding out on it.</li>
    <li> Price/quality best product! Non greasy, quickly absorbed, keeps my skin hydrated. (I need anti aging)  It&#x27;s a pity we cannot buy this  specific cream in Belgium...</li>
    <li> This daily moisturizer helps your skin without the shiny look - it is very very comfortable to wear and the 20 SPF is a great plus.  The price is just right.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for a month already and I&#x27;m not getting as good of results as the other reviewers are describing.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling  dry and stretched but  gets really grease as soon as I get a tiny bit of sun or heat, I think I&#x27;m going to try something different next time.</li>
