### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It has a great taste, best iron gummies I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Boys loved it!</li>
      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>I take them at bedtime along with the rest of my gummies (multi, D3, B12) and I am happy.  </li>
      <li>I tried a liquid Iron supplement for kids and couldn&#x27;t get them to drink it even in juice, but this is great and they eat one every day.</li>
      <li>One of them need to be distracted to make sure he does not spit it out, so I show him the &amp;#34;dyno&amp;#34; on the bottle and let him hold the bottle while chews and that works great!</li>
      <li>Very pleased.  </li>
      <li>love these, great taste, no issues getting child to eat them, infact she reminds me when i forget.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with these vitamins.</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>I have been order them for a year or more and my daughter loves them!</li>
      <li>glad I found you!</li>
      <li>Delivered as promised :).</li>
      <li>Kids love the flintstones.</li>
      <li>These are WAY better, no issues, and i don&#x27;t care what the cost, not having to give her the liquid supplement</li>
      <li>My kids love the taste of these and eat them eagerly.</li>
      <li>My kids love these.</li>
      <li>No fillers or fats or processed stuff to taste better, but hey they do the job.</li>
      <li>So we love these gummys</li>
      <li>I will order these again, for sure.</li>
      <li>They taste great, but most importantly my iron and ferritin levels have finally improved.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly tasty and definitely not hard on my stomach.  </li>
      <li>They taste ok, and did what they needed to, but be careful around kids, Iron is poisonous to them in quantity and these taste great.</li>
      <li>Kids love it and it is a very valuable supplement</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m currently pregnant).  </li>
      <li>is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>These are the only gummy Iron supplements that I was able to find.  </li>
      <li>The product tastes good and was represented properly but the ultimate result won&#x27;t be known until blood work is done to find out what effects it had on anemia.</li>
      <li>I  was super surprised on how tasty they are.</li>
      <li>They are very tasty.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like pills and tend to not take them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them and the Seller.</li>
      <li>so put them on the high shelf away from kids and pets.</li>
      <li>They are for my 97 year old mother that cannot swallow large capsules.  </li>
      <li>but other than that, they are an easy way to get your iron.</li>
      <li>As much as I really don&#x27;t like them, I will probably continue to gag them down, since I need to make sure I get enough iron.</li>
      <li>She gets 2 per day and got her iron level back to normal, without any drops or medicine.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately my 2 yrs old daughter, who is anemic,  doesn&#x27;t like gummies and thus I haven&#x27;t been able to get her to take it.</li>

    <li> It has a great taste, best iron gummies I have ever had. I buy them for my girlfriend every month and she loves them.</li>
    <li> They taste ok, and did what they needed to, but be careful around kids, Iron is poisonous to them in quantity and these taste great. so put them on the high shelf away from kids and pets. but other than that, they are an easy way to get your iron.</li>
    <li> I was what I expecting. Unfortunately my 2 yrs old daughter, who is anemic,  doesn&#x27;t like gummies and thus I haven&#x27;t been able to get her to take it.</li>
    <li> Kids love it and it is a very valuable supplement</li>
    <li> The product tastes good and was represented properly but the ultimate result won&#x27;t be known until blood work is done to find out what effects it had on anemia.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this!!! She gets 2 per day and got her iron level back to normal, without any drops or medicine.</li>
    <li> My daughter has low iron &amp; these are a savior! She refused/hid/disposed of e dry other type including a drink if she knew the drops were in it.&lt;br /&gt;She is 6 and loves the flavor!!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found you!</li>

No tears or stomach upset!</li>
    <li> Taste like crap but they are vegan so what do you expect.  No fillers or fats or processed stuff to taste better, but hey they do the job.</li>
    <li> Love these! I suffered from iron deficient anemia for 3 years prior to undergoing gastric sleeve weight loss surgery. That put me at further risk for worsening anemia. Needed blood transfusions after the surgical site bled. I am required to take chewable iron for the rest of my life. After searching for tolerable ones for over a year, I tried these. They taste great, but most importantly my iron and ferritin levels have finally improved.</li>
    <li> Makes my daughters tummy upset even when taken with food</li>
    <li> 2nd order for my Dad. He loves them and they are easier on his stomach than other vitamins with iron. I highly recommend them and the Seller.</li>
    <li> They are very tasty. I had to take iron cuz I am deficient in iron during my pregnancy. I really don&#x27;t like pills and tend to not take them. These are so tasty I look forward to eating them. I&#x27;m also feeling less tired and nk general so much better since I started taking this iron.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised :). I  was super surprised on how tasty they are. I will definitely continue to buy as I suffer from low iron.</li>
    <li> My son hated the taste of these iron gummies. I am anemic, so I ate them. I ordered the Flintstone vitamins with iron. Kids love the flintstones.</li>
    <li> I usually do like these vitamins but this batch was wonky.  Looked different, shapes were inconsistent.  I wonder if they had any nutritional value.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with these vitamins. I have been order them for a year or more and my daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly tasty and definitely not hard on my stomach.  I take them at bedtime along with the rest of my gummies (multi, D3, B12) and I am happy.  I will order these again, for sure.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes the taste and she needs iron.</li>
    <li> My kids love the taste of these and eat them eagerly.</li>
    <li> Boys loved it! Their cheeks got some color after a couple of days of taking this iron vitamin.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  They are for my 97 year old mother that cannot swallow large capsules.  She loves these!</li>
    <li> Daughter hated the taste.</li>
