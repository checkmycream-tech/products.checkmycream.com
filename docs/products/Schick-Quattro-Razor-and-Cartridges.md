### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I will be recommending this razor to all my friends and family because it is the best that i ever used.</li>
      <li>Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, period!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Again; this is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, the best Schick has ever made, better than anything Gillette has ever made.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try the Schick Quattro Titanium razor and it has been the best choice that i ever made, I even had the best Top of the Line Norelco and Panasonic razors</li>
      <li>A good deal any way you look at it.  </li>
      <li>A good deal any way you look at it.  </li>
      <li>The best razor I&#x27;ve had so far : it&#x27;s the best of the 4 blades&#x27; razor, and I found it even better than gillette&#x27;s fusion.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll happily pay much more for it.</li>
      <li>To my surprise, I really love it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price, and this is my favorite razor I&#x27;ve been able to find yet.</li>
      <li>We both have our own.  </li>
      <li>and I strongly urge you to give this razor a try!  </li>

      <li>(I haven&#x27;t done the Schick/Gillette test again, however, so I can&#x27;t be sure they didn&#x27;t take my advice.)    </li>
      <li>Very comfortable to use, with very clean results.</li>
      <li>I love it!ment cartridges are fine with me and cheaper than all of Gillette&#x27;s inventory</li>
      <li>the shave is good but the cleaning of the blades after each stroke takes 4 times as much as the mach 3 .be warned.stay with the mach 3.well</li>
      <li>They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
      <li>The cost of replacement cartridges are fine with me and cheaper than all of Gillette&#x27;s inventory</li>
      <li>Smooth and easy shave.</li>
      <li>My face felt as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all; that&#x27;s how smooth the Quattro shave was for me.  </li>
      <li>This is important to optimize performance.</li>
      <li>Those are good too(close shave) but the blades needs replacing more often and I have cut myself on more than 1 occasion when I was less cautious.     </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad the price for these great razors came down</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s love at first site</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s love at first site</li>
      <li>The Schick razor handle itself is very comfortable to grip and has a very metallic solidity to it.  </li>
      <li>Even at full price these blades are cheaper than the competition.</li>
      <li>When I saw how cheaply these razors had become, I decided to purchase two at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>product shipped very fast!  </li>
      <li>what kind of Titanium technology they use, but the blades last almost forever and even with close</li>
      <li>I used to use Gillette Mach3 for many years then when the five blade Fusion came out, I naturally tried it.  </li>
      <li>I find that its smaller size (with 4 blades) is more agile than the Fusion yet has many of the benefits (including the single edge trimming blade).  </li>
      <li>The blades stay nice and sharp for a long time, and I always get a nice smooth shave from them.</li>
      <li>, I get a closer shave with this razor and it glides smoother and the blades last twice as long as the gillette and the new handle design is perfect.</li>
      <li>And if this first shave is any example I can see getting 8 - 10 shaves per cart.  </li>
      <li>About 5 years ago, when the quattro first came out, I did an experiment.</li>
      <li>And if this first shave is any example I can see getting 8 - 10 shaves per cart.  </li>
      <li>Very good razor, smooth shave with a lot less irritation than my previous razor.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to report after 10 shaves with the same blade that I&#x27;m getting a close, \\&quot;teenaged\\&quot; face look and absolutely no irritation.</li>
      <li>I love how much time I save in the morning by not having to re-shave several times over the same area to get a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>I found that the cartridge head of the Fusion is just too large and was less maneuverable than the Mach 3, so as a kind of compromise I decided to give the Quattro a try.  </li>
      <li>I spent more time trying to unclog it</li>
      <li>I shave every day, sometimes twice a day, especially if I have someplace important to go to in the evening.  </li>
      <li>an takes too muckin much time.</li>
      <li>No other razor in 45 years has given me a shave like this; and it didn&#x27;t take more than 20 minutes to shave including preparation if that long...maybe total time was 15 minutes..?</li>
      <li>In the review that I wrote here, I suggested that Schick should market a cheaper blade that&#x27;s just as good as the Gillette blade, and then advertise the more expensive Quattro, priced comparably to the Mach3, as lasting 40% longer.     </li>
      <li>This razor is sharp enough, but the strip of moisturizer or whatever it is at the top starts to peel off within the first couple</li>
      <li>For my normal use it NEVER clogs for me.  </li>
      <li>It appears other people have had other experiences, but I am pretty thrilled with this razor.</li>
      <li>Face it, razor companies make their money when you buy new blades.</li>
      <li>was new as advertised.</li>
      <li>I see this item as a loss leader at the W retailer, and say why not, I&#x27;m always looking to try new things.</li>
      <li>The razor arrived about two hours ago and with a three day beard i took my new Quattro upstairs, showered and then did my regular pre-shave prep after which I used my brand new Quattro for the first time.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m on blood thinners and am prone to bumps and ingrown hairs</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m on blood thinners and am prone to bumps and ingrown hairs</li>
      <li>and wow what a deal!</li>
      <li>I have a full face, very coarse medium density beard and after not shaving for three days I decided to test my new Quattro by shaving against the grain only from my first pass to my last.  </li>
      <li>The design of this razor catches hair in the blades and it is such a pain to get clean for the next stroke.  </li>
      <li>the only thing that it needs is a container to keep it in with some kind of fluid to keep it sharp.</li>
      <li>Mine is over 3 years old but still looks almost new.     </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s more profit if they get dull sooner.    </li>
      <li>If they did, they must have been polling 13 year old boys with peach fuzz...  </li>
      <li>My friend likes it, it gives a closer shave than the ones with fewer blades obviously and doesn&#x27;t irritate him as much.</li>
      <li>Including washing my face, rubbing on Proraso Pre-Shave, then working up a lather with shaving cream and then waiting for about 3 - 4 minutes to completely soften my three day growth...that&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This Quattro Titanium lasts much longer than the regular Quattro.</li>
      <li>This razor gives you a shave similar to a high priced electric, with no irritation and maybe even a bit closer.    </li>
      <li>(yeah my mistake for being stingy) before realizing that my shave has gotten pretty rough.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and even new Fusion blades cause minor irritation, and become unusable to me after a week.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a delight to use it especially when you have a sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If I shave longer hair (ahem), it clogs and has to be rinsed more often, but not more so than I&#x27;ve seen with other multi-blade disposables.  </li>
      <li>I used 3 times as much water and spent double the time shaving.  </li>
      <li>Of course, everyone is different and your skin may do better or worse.    </li>
      <li>Kudos to SCHICK for making such a long lasting high quality product.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been shaving a long time.  </li>
<li> Again, Fusion isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I feel these are more compatible with my skin.</li>
<li> do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not one cut or nick and absolutely no razor burn or other irritation whatsoever.  </li>
<li> These blades have 3 thin \\&quot;high AWG\\&quot; retaining wires running perpendicular to the blades holding them in place.</li>
<li> The Mach 3 on the other hand does not have these design flaws.  </li>
<li> If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> previous handle came apart after 24</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t get my money back because this schick sucks!</li>
<li> I even dried the Fusion blades with compressed air, maybe this gave me another handful of uses.</li>
<li> I was having trouble finding this razor in a store, so I figured I would check on Amazon</li>
<li> I am not happy with this razor after the second shave.  </li>
<li> This prevents irritation, but in the worst case may require a few more strokes to get a shave that will allow you to move your hand in any direction on your face and not feel a trace of hair.    </li>
<li> I am not sure if they did any market research on this piece before it&#x27;s release.  </li>

    <li> This razor is sharp enough, but the strip of moisturizer or whatever it is at the top starts to peel off within the first couple uses. Also, at least one of the vertical wire bands that hold the blades together always breaks within the first week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving a long time.  I shave every day, sometimes twice a day, especially if I have someplace important to go to in the evening.  This titanium-coated razor is the smoothest and easiest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  For my normal use it NEVER clogs for me.  If I shave longer hair (ahem), it clogs and has to be rinsed more often, but not more so than I&#x27;ve seen with other multi-blade disposables.  I love how much time I save in the morning by not having to re-shave several times over the same area to get a smooth shave.  It appears other people have had other experiences, but I am pretty thrilled with this razor.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy another overpriced package of Fusion blades that wear out after 5 or so shaves. I even dried the Fusion blades with compressed air, maybe this gave me another handful of uses. I see this item as a loss leader at the W retailer, and say why not, I&#x27;m always looking to try new things. I have sensitive skin and even new Fusion blades cause minor irritation, and become unusable to me after a week. Of course, everyone is different and your skin may do better or worse.    I am happy to report after 10 shaves with the same blade that I&#x27;m getting a close, \\&quot;teenaged\\&quot; face look and absolutely no irritation. The titanium metallurgy probably does not rust and dull like the Fusion. Even at full price these blades are cheaper than the competition. These blades have 3 thin \\&quot;high AWG\\&quot; retaining wires running perpendicular to the blades holding them in place. This prevents irritation, but in the worst case may require a few more strokes to get a shave that will allow you to move your hand in any direction on your face and not feel a trace of hair.    The only slight issue is the blades do get hairs and debris in them that won&#x27;t come out with rinsing, but a touch with a toothbrush makes them look and perform like new. This is important to optimize performance. This razor gives you a shave similar to a high priced electric, with no irritation and maybe even a bit closer.    Again, Fusion isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I feel these are more compatible with my skin. YMMV, but I doubt you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Face it, razor companies make their money when you buy new blades. There&#x27;s more profit if they get dull sooner.    About 5 years ago, when the quattro first came out, I did an experiment. I had been a Gillette guy for years and was using a Mach3. I bought the Quattro and used them on alternate days. The Quattro lasted 40% longer.     In the review that I wrote here, I suggested that Schick should market a cheaper blade that&#x27;s just as good as the Gillette blade, and then advertise the more expensive Quattro, priced comparably to the Mach3, as lasting 40% longer.     Well, they seem to have done something like that without any invidious comparisons. This Quattro Titanium lasts much longer than the regular Quattro. (I haven&#x27;t done the Schick/Gillette test again, however, so I can&#x27;t be sure they didn&#x27;t take my advice.)    Maybe not as profitable, but if their aim is to gain market share, it worked for me.</li>
    <li> product shipped very fast!  was new as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this razor after the second shave.  In the past, I have always used the Mach 3 and it was MUCH easier to rinse hair from the blades.  I am not sure if they did any market research on this piece before it&#x27;s release.  If they did, they must have been polling 13 year old boys with peach fuzz...  The design of this razor catches hair in the blades and it is such a pain to get clean for the next stroke.  I found that my shave took twice as long because I had to stand there constantly rinsing hair that was caught up in the blades.  I used 3 times as much water and spent double the time shaving.  Shouldn&#x27;t 4 blades speed up the process?  When I compared this to my Mach 3, I noticed that the 4 blades seem closer together and there is no free space behind the razor to let hair escape.  The Mach 3 on the other hand does not have these design flaws.  Back to ol reliable (Mach 3).  Too bad I can&#x27;t get my money back because this schick sucks!</li>
    <li> If you are of middle eastern descent with a typical thick beard, then stay away from this piece of crap. I used it for several months (yeah my mistake for being stingy) before realizing that my shave has gotten pretty rough. Its very difficult to shave around the lips and there is alway something left to be desired after each shave. I just tossed out mine along with all of the existing blades and i&#x27;ll be going back to my Gillette and I&#x27;ll happily pay much more for it.</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard and have tried most of gillette razors with the last being the Fusion. I decided to try the Schick Quattro Titanium razor and it has been the best choice that i ever made, I even had the best Top of the Line Norelco and Panasonic razors, I get a closer shave with this razor and it glides smoother and the blades last twice as long as the gillette and the new handle design is perfect. I will be recommending this razor to all my friends and family because it is the best that i ever used. I just bought me an extra razor in case i lose the one that i have. Schick you have hit a homerun this time!</li>
    <li> Smooth and easy shave. Very comfortable to use, with very clean results. It&#x27;s a delight to use it especially when you have a sensitive skin. The best razor I&#x27;ve had so far : it&#x27;s the best of the 4 blades&#x27; razor, and I found it even better than gillette&#x27;s fusion.  AND the blades last forever!</li>
    <li> and i am disappointed.i just finished shaving my groin and let my tell you the shave is good but the cleaning of the blades after each stroke takes 4 times as much as the mach 3 .be warned.stay with the mach 3.well i lost 10 bucks.no big deal.</li>
    <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
    <li> My friend likes it, it gives a closer shave than the ones with fewer blades obviously and doesn&#x27;t irritate him as much.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and it isn&#x27;t a close shave at all.  Going back to buying our Preserve razors.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Goodl blade. The required amount of discription by Amazon is really lame an takes too muckin much time.</li>
    <li> The Schick razor handle itself is very comfortable to grip and has a very metallic solidity to it.  Mine is over 3 years old but still looks almost new.     I&#x27;m not sure what kind of Titanium technology they use, but the blades last almost forever and even with close shaves I Never get razor burns or cuts.     I also use Gillette&#x27;s vibrating mach 3 triple blades. Those are good too(close shave) but the blades needs replacing more often and I have cut myself on more than 1 occasion when I was less cautious.     I disagree with the reviewer who gives it one star and compares the quattro to a disposable bic.  They are night and day.  Also, I have no problems shaving anywhere below the nose and above the lips.    Kudos to SCHICK for making such a long lasting high quality product.</li>
    <li> This was without a doubt the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The design of it is pretty retarded. I spent more time trying to unclog it then I did using it to actually shave with. Ended up getting another Gillette instead.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding this razor in a store, so I figured I would check on Amazon and wow what a deal! It&#x27;s a great price, and this is my favorite razor I&#x27;ve been able to find yet. The blades stay nice and sharp for a long time, and I always get a nice smooth shave from them.</li>
    <li> I purchased the combination of Schick Quattro Razor and 2-pack of four cartridges here on Amazon.com after reading the majority of reviews...the majority of which give this razor either 4 or 5 stars and I agree with that vote!  The razor arrived about two hours ago and with a three day beard i took my new Quattro upstairs, showered and then did my regular pre-shave prep after which I used my brand new Quattro for the first time. Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, period!  I have a full face, very coarse medium density beard and after not shaving for three days I decided to test my new Quattro by shaving against the grain only from my first pass to my last.  Not one cut or nick and absolutely no razor burn or other irritation whatsoever.  My face felt as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all; that&#x27;s how smooth the Quattro shave was for me.  No other razor in 45 years has given me a shave like this; and it didn&#x27;t take more than 20 minutes to shave including preparation if that long...maybe total time was 15 minutes..? Including washing my face, rubbing on Proraso Pre-Shave, then working up a lather with shaving cream and then waiting for about 3 - 4 minutes to completely soften my three day growth...that&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem flushing out debris from between the blades and I don&#x27;t notice the blades being closer together than the blades of a Hydro 3 or Mach 3 like some reviews have said. I only use either Edge Gel or Proraso mug soap and I know that never clogs.  What we learned in the 70&#x27;s was the CBC&#x27;s in the aerosol white foam shave cream had a glue like result with the beard and skin shaved and that caused the clogs in the Trac II and Atra of the day.  If you switch to brush and mug or gel you shouldn&#x27;t have a clog problem as long as you rinse often; rinse from back and front.  Just my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Again; this is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, the best Schick has ever made, better than anything Gillette has ever made.  The cost of replacement cartridges are fine with me and cheaper than all of Gillette&#x27;s inventory and I got a bonus in that the packs of carts were two packs of 4 carts each; but when I opened my package this afternoon I received 2 packages of 4 +2 carts per pack &#x3D; 6 carts in each package. A good deal any way you look at it.  And if this first shave is any example I can see getting 8 - 10 shaves per cart.  In short: I&#x27;ve found my razor for life...or as long as Schick keeps making it.  It&#x27;s love at first site and I strongly urge you to give this razor a try!  I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m on blood thinners and am prone to bumps and ingrown hairs so I take my razor and blades very seriously.  If I could find one thing wrong with this razor I&#x27;d say so!

    <li> I was sharing my razor with my partner, and we kept taking out our personal razor blades to use with the single razor in the house.  When I saw how cheaply these razors had become, I decided to purchase two at a very reasonable price.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to into his bathroom to retrieve the razor.  We both have our own.  I&#x27;m so glad the price for these great razors came down so I could purchase two.</li>
    <li> I used to use Gillette Mach3 for many years then when the five blade Fusion came out, I naturally tried it.  I found that the cartridge head of the Fusion is just too large and was less maneuverable than the Mach 3, so as a kind of compromise I decided to give the Quattro a try.  To my surprise, I really love it!  I find that its smaller size (with 4 blades) is more agile than the Fusion yet has many of the benefits (including the single edge trimming blade).  I also find that the Schick Titanium blades last twice as long than either the Mach3 or Fusion (not mention they are cheaper than Fusion blades as well).  One cartridge lasts me two weeks with daily shaving.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Very good razor, smooth shave with a lot less irritation than my previous razor.  Would definitely recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always use this razor. the only thing that it needs is a container to keep it in with some kind of fluid to keep it sharp.</li>
