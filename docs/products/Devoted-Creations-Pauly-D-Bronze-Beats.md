      <li>and honestly I didn&#x27;t think it was gonna work.</li>
      <li>Thought I liked this..showed nice color after 1 use.</li>
      <li>If you own a home tanning bed, this is the tanning solution you need.</li>
      <li>but honestly it didn&#x27;t change my color.</li>
      <li>But it seems to do the job of giving you a nice tan, and it seems to keep tanning you after you tan.</li>

      <li>this lotion frim amazon is very light in color and haven&#x27;t noticed any results. .  </li>
      <li>The scent is VERY light.</li>
      <li>Amazing paid 25 bucks for this lotion about three months ago and its still going strong.</li>
      <li>The Bronze Beats is great, goes on easily and has a fresh scent.</li>

      <li>I love this bronzer, combined with others</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>It gave me a beautiful bronze glow and my skin didn&#x27;t have the normal after tan smell.  </li>
      <li>I was using $10 cheeky brown lotion (which I love) and I wish I would have just stuck with that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, very nice a lotion that tans you fast.</li>
      <li>One thing I do have to say is, make sure to clean your hands after applying the lotion!</li>
      <li>I have Eczema and soft has never been the word to describe my skin lol</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It made my skin feel smooth but the Bronzer rubs off on clothes after. It kept me tan just not as tan as I&#x27;d like. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> this tanning lotion is amazing. i got great results. perfect bronze color. i would recommend to anyone who tans in tanning beds</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells great, moisturizes my skin and gives me a natural looking tan while I tan that lasts..just wash your hands after each use.</li>
    <li> Beats those tan shop prices anytime. Don&#x27;t waste money with them when you can get it here for a way cheaper price.</li>
    <li> i used this lotion as a starter lotion when i first began tanning....its wonderful!!!!!  goes right into your skin, not greasy, and no after tan odor!!!  it doesnt rub off onto your clothes and stain them, as many other lotions containing bronzer do. i love this stuff would def reccomend.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I was looking for a good tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t leave me too dark, streaked or orange. The gentleman at the tanning salon recommended this lotion and it was perfect! I am very pale when I start tanning and needed just enough color before we took the boat out for the first time this year. LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions over the years and have not really stuck with any one lotion.  Last year my favorite was Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Take Olive Me- but that one was really thick and made you feel pretty sticky and was heavy on your skin, despite giving good color and having a nice scent.  Bronze Beats was a much smoother and lighter application- that already made it a better choice over the former. The scent is listed as Coconut Nights- and I really like it. It&#x27;s not a heavy coconut smell, it&#x27;s very light with that tropical coconut hint, with a somewhat deeper nutty/chocolate scent- it&#x27;s not overpowering and it would work for guys or girls- definitely a more neutral scent. Also, since this is a bronzing lotion it&#x27;s a brown color and as soon as you put it on it gives your skin a nice little glow- it&#x27;s a natural looking bronzer, not orange at all. I start out very pale but can get fairly dark, but have a problem with some lotions making me look orange.  This one gave me a good bronze color. You will definitely need to leave it on to get the full effects of the bronzers- I tan in the evening and leave it on overnight. I was also surprised that even wearing white pajama pants- none of it rubbed off during the night- really seemed to stay on the skin.  I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not too heavy and absorbs into the skin quickly. I also didn&#x27;t notice that much ATO. I&#x27;ve never found a lotion that completely covers up ATO, but this one does really well with the fragrance holding up.  Overall, I am happy with this lotion.  I would definitely recommend it for a nice bronzing lotion for those looking to build a nice base tan.</li>
    <li> I already have a great base tan. But, that base tan stayed a \\&quot;Base tan\\&quot;. Didn&#x27;t seem like my skin was getting any darker. So I went and looked at this. Every review I have read and every little research I did on this lotion said it was REALLY dark. So I figure eh..what the heck Ill try it. Mind you I have tryd many. Considering I tan almost every single day I can. So anywho I bought this and I put it on...Needless to say It was LIGHTER then my skin. Smells amazing. But Didn&#x27;t do jack. I just got it yesturday so maybe I need to use it a little longer. But I don&#x27;t have high hopes. So maybe my next step in tingler...Idk but this didnt do much. Not pleased!!</li>
    <li> The lotion seems to be diluted. . The exact same lotion from the salon is twice as dark in color and works amazing this lotion frim amazon is very light in color and haven&#x27;t noticed any results. .  Would absolutely not recommend.. goes to show why it was so cheap</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer, combined with others it gives my skin the most amazing glow ever, but do not wear white after you use it, it&#x27;s a color brown like very dark foundation, basically African American concealer almost, it says blemish remover and I see why... It&#x27;s bronzer concealer, just don&#x27;t wear something that stains easy after using this, you will sweat light brown</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Bought it because I love jersey shore, continue buying it because its a killer product! Brings out a nice, bronze tan. No Orange color. Very even and quick to notice!</li>
    <li> This lotion made me dark in just a few sessions. I was as white as casper now i look like just like a guido should!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and this has to be one of my favorite lotions! It smells like vanilla and has a deodorizing smell that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a tanning bed! If you already have a base tan then I highly recommend this lotion. If you are just starting tanning for the first time and if you are kind of pale then I would hold off on buying this lotion because it is SUPER dark and it will leave streak marks if you are really white. Other than that this lotion is perfect!</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this tanning bronzer!! I actually was using JWOW&#x27;s 50X Black Bronzer for awhile and saw this one, so, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot just to see. This actually worked WAY better than her&#x27;s AND it is cheaper than her&#x27;s as well on top of that!! I LUV the smell much better to boot!! People have actually complimented on the coconut smell, saying it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got much darker than I did with JWOW&#x27;s 50X Black Bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try his other one he has to see if I like that one better or not. Either way, I&#x27;m gonna stick with Pauly D from now on!! :D</li>
    <li> Smells great, and works well. The only con is that the product is dark which can get on your clothes.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Have used the lotion before and knew it was the real deal. Smelled the same and gave me a great tan!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! AWESOME! GREAT AND FAST! I was so happy with this purchase! Thanks again, so very much! A must buy!</li>
    <li> Less expensive than the same great product found in professional tanning salons.  If you own a home tanning bed, this is the tanning solution you need.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a good bronzing tanning lotion this is a good lotion to use for tanning inside</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this because it&#x27;s from Jersey Shore. I bought it because it didn&#x27;t have and 1 star or 2 star reviews. I used to work at a tanning salon and I know how expensive lotions are. I would rather buy online then pay full price for lotions because I don&#x27;t get my discount anymore. I read reviews for the top sellers we sold at the salon and most of the sellers said don&#x27;t buy from Green Web because it wasn&#x27;t the real product or it was sealed with scotch tape. So I was searching for a good product not sold by them. I got this from Home-N-More. It took 8 days to get to me, within the delivery days. And this works amazing!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m African american/caucasian. I look more white then anything, just black facial features. I tan farely easily but would just to get an extra boost of color so reduce the time I spend in a basic bed. I tanned without anything 5 times in two weeks (first time in two year) and then got Pauly D. I just got out about 20 mins ago after 12 mins in the bed. My skin doesn&#x27;t smell burnt like it normally does when I don&#x27;t use anything. It has a nice light topical smell like coconuts. And I got darker by 2 shades!!!! It does have some glitter in the lotion but I can only see it on my palms. I&#x27;m not orange what so ever. The lotion blending into my skin pretty well and after I got out of the bed my skin was soft. I have Eczema and soft has never been the word to describe my skin lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps in your decision to get it! It&#x27;s worth the money :)</li>
    <li> this lotion smells great and leaves a nice smell after tanning. It does not give the typical burned tanning smell! the color of the bronzer has a slight shimmer so be sure to wash your hands after application</li>
    <li> I have used many tanning lotions and this ranks right up there with the best.  It goes on smoothly without a greasy feel, and gives me a natural looking, deep tan that my friends notice.</li>
    <li> Pauly D has definitely got some great indoor tanning lotions. The Bronze Beats is great, goes on easily and has a fresh scent. It leaves you instantly bronze and has the same skin care technology as the Devoted Skinny Couture. I would recommend this lotion to any self tanner who is looking for both instant and delayed effects. I would highly recommend this lotion to male tanners,as the smell is not feminine nor is the bottle.</li>
    <li> I tan everyday and enjoy trying new lotions. This one smells great but doesnt absorb in as well as others and the color washes right off after the first use. I was expecting more from a Pauly D lotion!</li>
    <li> Awesome results just after a few uses!!! Love,love,love this product...great price!! Will recommend to all my friends!! Great bronzing agent</li>
    <li> I tried this product and found that the bronzers rub off on my clothing all day after use. Once I tanned at lunch then went to Gym later that day and it was still rubbing off. And this was like 5 hours after using. Not good people.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer....smells good. I loved it! If you like using bronzers in the tanning bed or outside this is a great option.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite tanning lotion. Ive tried sooo many others and I love the color this gives you plus it smells amazing! It is a bronzer so its brown which is great cause it gives you instant color and you can see where you apply it. Does not streak or leave you orange. I do not use any other tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> this stuff is terrible. it has wayyyy too much self tanner in it, it is basically like putting foundation all over your entire body. also stains hands and fingers brown when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this tanning lotion! When the pools closed for the summer &amp; I continue to tan in salons, I was pretty white after 2 months of no sun. Pauly D has made a tanning lotion I feel is designed just for me! It works so fast &amp; I do not have to tan very much to maintain color. Delivered very quickly, safely packaged &amp; I highly recommend this lotion!! It is triple the $$ in salons!</li>
    <li> Happy with this product. The price was very reasonable. I received it quickly. The smell of the product is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t make you turn orange.</li>
    <li> Used numerous lotions and this is one that worked good for me deep tan, wash hands after, I never got orange on my or my clothes recommended over a lot of other brands.</li>
    <li> Bought a small thing of this at the tanning place and after my first day of tanning I was 3 shades darker!!!!  It&#x27;s amazing. Can&#x27;t wait to get my big bottle in the mail.</li>
    <li> Smells good but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it right...I&#x27;m using it for outside tanning....</li>
    <li> i never use to tan and get any color but ever since i been using this ive gotten so much darker in such a short amount of time. already bought my second bottle!</li>
    <li> I will use this complany all the time for all kids of products. This tanning lotion was at a really good price.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on REALLY dark. Like it gives you a tan before you tan! I noticed a pretty nice difference to my skin after just one use. And the lotion has a nice beachy kind of smell to it. The lotion goes on nice, not greasy. My skin kinda just soaked it right in. The after tan smell ain&#x27;t the best but all tanning lotions have that burnt up smell to me afterwards. It WILL stain hands, i wiped with a towel and used baby wipes and still it still stained my hands. Even after scrubbing them twice afterwards. That&#x27;s my only dislike. But it seems to do the job of giving you a nice tan, and it seems to keep tanning you after you tan. (If that makes any since!!) Hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> Amazing paid 25 bucks for this lotion about three months ago and its still going strong. Amazing smell, bronzers and immediate tanning results. If I could rate it a 10 I would give it a 10!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for size! It doesn&#x27;t have glitter in it so it&#x27;s great for a man or woman. Will be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I seen results after the first use! I will but this product again...Just make sure you rub it in completely!</li>
    <li> works just like it says. Great tan no streaks. Thanks pauly d . If you havent bought some yet you have to try this out. Very good tan loation Tks</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. It did not turn my hands orange even though it is a bronzer, and had little after tanning odor. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> You want a real bronze after maybe the second  session your skin will look great</li>
    <li> bought as a gift for my bestie who absolutely loves pauly d.  he loves this lotion and def a great bronzer at a great price.</li>
    <li> Thought I liked this..showed nice color after 1 use. Then I noticed it stained my palms and clothes worse than ANY bronzer or lotion I have ever used. Oh and it does not absorb into skin instead sitting on the surface....easily rubbing off. Most gross is shaving and having a slick of it adhere to razor the next day.</li>
    <li> Thought I was ordering a different version, but got this. So far it&#x27;s only o.k. Doesn&#x27;t give the savage tan I expected.</li>
    <li> i got this lotion in hopes of it working like the advertisement said.wrong!it stained my feet 0range and ive been tanning for almost a year.the lotion went 0n dry and got dryer!what a mess the smell is like that 80 s selftanner q.t.what a waste 0f m0ney! Pammy D</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion for the first time and am perfectly satisfied with it.  The bronzer is great.  It goes on easy and has a pleasant smell. I will order it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been tanning 3 times since using this, and I&#x27;m already noticably brown (people I know keep asking if I&#x27;ve been somewhere tropical).  Goes on smooth, makes my skin super soft, and has just enough bronzer to boost you up a little without making you that silly orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside, the smell is...weird.  It&#x27;s ALMOST a sweet smell, like candy, but it&#x27;s a little musky at the same time.  I suppose that this is to help the male market.  But it&#x27;s not so offputting that I&#x27;d not use the lotion.  The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very nice a lotion that tans you fast. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The lotion is just like any other I have purchased. The lotion is average. If it is less expensive , if not buy something less.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion so much! It smells fantastic and makes your skin sparkle. Sometimes when I&#x27;m going out on the town I wear it just because it has pigment in it to make you look instantly more tan and I get complements on how nice I smell.</li>
    <li> Great all-over bronzed color with no streaks! Easy to apply &amp; smells good. Definitely recommend for use in an indoor tanning bed.</li>
    <li> It is an okay product I thought I would get a better result from it. So as for recommending this I don&#x27;t think I will  thanks</li>
    <li> This product shipped extremely fast! In a tanning salon, this lotion would have been 4-5 times the price offered here. You really cant beat it! The lotion smells great and comes out of the bottle dark, so you know you&#x27;re getting instant color. It&#x27;s not as creamy as JWOWWs lotions, but it still applies easily and provides a great result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Goes on creamy, smells great.  Will purchase again.  Allows for a great, rich bronze tan. love, love, love</li>
    <li> I just received this bottle a few days ago and I love it! First of all, the price was awesome and the bottle is huge! I also like the fact that there are bronzers in this lotion because it helps to get you dark fast. The scent is VERY light. It smells nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, which is good because you should wear this stuff for hours after tanning to get the full effect. One thing I do have to say is, make sure to clean your hands after applying the lotion! Hands do get kind of orange-y, but other than that, I am quite pleased with this product. :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this.  It&#x27;s almost a chocolate smell and its not strong at all. After tanning you can hardly smell it at all. The bronzer is a beautiful color not super orange or anything but honestly it didn&#x27;t change my color. I was using $10 cheeky brown lotion (which I love) and I wish I would have just stuck with that. I have been using it do two weeks now three times per week and I can&#x27;t really tell that I am any darker than I was before using the product</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave my clothes orange. Smells nice too. If you&#x27;re gonna spend money on a tanning pass, it is worth it to buy this product too. Makes you tanner and makes the tan last longer. No brainer</li>
    <li> After using bronze beats I definitely noticed a difference. It gave me a beautiful bronze glow and my skin didn&#x27;t have the normal after tan smell.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This does help me get a deeper darker tan and I like the smell.</li>
    <li> this is everything it claims to be. I&#x27;m not a sun worshipper. never have time for it. I&#x27;d like to be. but I seen this read the reviews decided to try it. and honestly I didn&#x27;t think it was gonna work. I&#x27;m not very patient person. but my god I&#x27;ve never bronzed so rich so dark in my life. and I only sunned each day on my lunch break for one hr. and booya !!!!!! four days of this and wham!!!!! I&#x27;m browner than I&#x27;ve ever been. I&#x27;m a fan of this stuff now. for sure. you won&#x27;t be disappointed its worth every dime.</li>
    <li> Used this product for three weeks and didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  would highly suggest buying a different tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> this tanning lostion sucked ill never buy it again didnt like the results had no results dont recommed to buy</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion went on smooth and made my skin feel soft after tanning. However it doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but doesn&#x27;t stink by any means. That&#x27;s the only thing I could find wrong with this product. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Hot this for my husband cause he didn&#x27;t want to be using my jwoww. He didn&#x27;t really hold the tan very well. (He&#x27;s a white white boy) BUT I used it and its just as great as jwoww :) I hold tans like a boss! Lol</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Paula D Bronze Beats and after 1 use I can tell a big difference.  I usually get up in the mornings take a shower then get in tanning bed before going to work.  It is very important to me not to smell like I just got out of the tanning bed and with this lotion it does a wonderful job.  I looked at all the reviews on tanning lotion before I decided to purchase this one and I am so happy I did.  I will be using this lotion for awhile.  Thanks for all the reviews that helped me make up my mind.</li>
    <li> I had never been tanning before but my best friend had had this and so we decided we would go tanning and we both bought a bottle I would have to say this product work quick and fast if you buy this you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for many years and used numerous tanning products. The pauly d lotion makes me look very orange after one use. I am already tan so it&#x27;s not from being pale and using a bronzer. And it makes me smell like crayons. Left my hands all orange even after wiping them off after putting it on. Very runny product, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. I got really dark I had to lay low tanning. I&#x27;ll be doing it again this summer</li>
    <li> I am a guy who&#x27;s a few pounds overweight and I tan at home.  Most of the other lotions out there smell like &amp;#34;stripper&amp;#34;.  At least that is how I can describe other lotions.  This one is a light scent, and yes it has a coconut smell to it.  However, if you have used Australian Gold products, this in my opinion, is much lighter.  If on a scale of 1 to 10, Australian Gold is about an 8 in scent strength, this is probably a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get stained palms from this like I do other lotions and this stuff goes on pretty smooth.  Not thick like some others, but it feels a little greasy going on (but dries fast).  Coverage was easy and I have yet to see any streaking.  No orange color either, although I have a really good olive tone complexion.  All in all, I am going to stick with this brand...</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I was pretty excited because it kept my skin smelling great and I had an amazing tan! But that all went away after I took a shower. It washes and sweats off, sometimes it can even be scratched off! I&#x27;ve tried to give it a chance so I used it for a few weeks but my actual skin tone hasn&#x27;t changed a bit besides my shoulders getting red. It&#x27;s a great product if you&#x27;re just looking for a quick tan that goes away, but other than that, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I scored a really good price on this tanning lotion. I don&#x27;t know how many would be interested in a brand created by a cast member off the jersey shore, but the past few times I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve recieved good results nevertheless. I have tried a few other brands of tanning lotion and I do have to admit that this one smells similar to one of the products I used prior to getting this item but that doesn&#x27;t really tell me whether this product works better than another vice-versca. As any tanning lotion says near the directions: for best results, apply liberally on areas exposed to sunlight. Long story short, it&#x27;s tanning lotion, it&#x27;s effective, the price won&#x27;t break your wallet, and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather picky when it comes to any sort of body products, especially tanning products but when I saw that this had silk formula I was so tempted to try it, so after a week of reviews and ratings on this product and even asking my friends who own tanning beds about the product, but long story short, I ordered the product and absolutely love this product and my skin loved it too. The smell, the smoothness you get, the sexy shimmer, and the color. The service was equally impressive as well, arrived only a few days after I placed my order!</li>
