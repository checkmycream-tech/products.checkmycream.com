      <li>super fast delivery wonderful product</li>
      <li>you experience the same thing, I&#x27;ve found that on the dryer days it&#x27;s best to use the Moisturizing Lotion, and then use this on warmer days.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>and I love the feel.</li>
      <li>I realize this is designed for those with oily skin, but I wish it was just a bit more</li>

      <li>Glad to find this on Amazon.  </li>

      <li>I have tried some moisturizers which are not supposed to clog pores (even those in one of my favorite skincare lines, Mario Badescu) and found that even these products cause breakouts or make my skin feel &amp;</li>

      <li>Overall, a great product by Clinique!</li>
      <li>This is one product that would be on my top three things to take to a deserted island.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, the bottle was labeled B83, which means it was produced in 2013 August, there is about two years to the day I received it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect product perfect delivery</li>
    <li> I normally get the Moisturizing Lotion and by accident ordered the Gel. I thought I would give it a try anyway. The product cause me to break out in a rash and small bumps all over my face. It gave me very itchy and dried out skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it came to the stores. still have not ben able to find a better one. One bottle will last u for months.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product from Clinique.  It absorbs very quickly into your skin and does not leave a greasy feeling behind.  When I first started using it I was wary because of the price.  You can get their 3 step skin care for $50 on their website.  That is a little costly but well worth it.  It is less expensive to buy straight from the Clinique website.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m extremely picky with moisturizers--so picky i decided to stop using them because they all made my skin feel greasy.  after reading the great reviews here, i bought a bottle and am THRILLED with the results. i love it!! it doesnt make me skin feel greasy, has a great LIGHT scent (it smells really clean) and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Really cool product. It rocks</li>
    <li> Excellent product and arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer. It&#x27;s great for combination skin, and you can layer it on if you need more without it clogging your pours or feeling goopy.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is a miracle...in gel form. I am in my late 20s and still have combo skin of a teenage girl and still get the occasional breakout along my chin. I used to use products with salicylic acid because that product is sold as something that is supposed to cure, prevent, or lessen breakouts. After using products with that ingredient for years and not seeing a reduction in my breakouts (they were never really bad...more annoying than anything), I decided that maybe I should try something w/out that ingredient that could hopefully control my oily t-zone yet moisturize the rest of my face.     THIS MOISTURIZING GEL IS THE WINNER!    The gel formula provides just enough moisture to those dry spots but not so much that the oily spots look like an oil slick by the end of the day. I have used it in humid climates and dry climates and it works great in both. There are a few times a year that I will use a normal moisturizer if my skin is feeling extra dry (typically during the winter months). I also really like how soft it makes you skin. It almost leaves my skin feeling like it has a primer on it...and it does seem to make my foundation go on smoother.     You will thank Clinique after you use this moisturizer on your combo skin and see the amazing results it produces!</li>
    <li> the box of Gel was coming broken,which annoyed me a lot</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for two years now.Recently i bought it from the above store and found out it was a fake.First and foremost this moisturizer is fragrance free,but the one i bought online from this store has a minty scent,and the feel is different.&lt;br /&gt; Please buy clinique from a reputable store even if you have to pay more.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Definitely helps with my oily skin!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin is also always flaky and dry. I decided to purchase this product because I read some good reviews about the ingredients and how light it is. After using it for the first time my skin started to break out. I keep using it because I was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t this product but my face just keeps getting breakouts. I decided to stop using this moisturizer and my blemishes went away. If you do decide to try this product, I would suggest putting only a little bit on one side of your face and see what happens. I know a lot of people say that you can test it by using on the neck and behind the ears but I&#x27;ve found that the pores on the face reacts differently so try it out first.</li>
    <li>   The start for the product of mint odor, I questioned the authenticity of products, then the seller is responsible to Messi department stores small ticket sent mail to me, so please rest assured purchase!</li>
    <li> This is one product that would be on my top three things to take to a deserted island.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Have been using this Clinique product for several years.  A wonderful moisturizer, not greasy and absorbs quickly.  Great product for people with oily or combination skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer, hands down. I use both the lotion and gel formulas (lotion during the dryer months, gel during more humid months) but the gel is my favorite. It has a mild scent that might be unpleasant at first but to me it smells like a spa product, so I feel like I&#x27;m being pampered when I use it. The gel is very cool and light, not oily at all and absorbs well into the skin. This is the best oil-free moisturizer I&#x27;ve found; even ones that advertise as being &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; still have a slightly greasy feeling to them, but this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one pump, rub it lightly between my hands to distribute the product, and then use both hands to pat the lotion on to my face. You really don&#x27;t need more than one pump to cover the whole face. I&#x27;ve never been very consistent with a daytime or nighttime routine (I&#x27;m lazy, I know) so I can&#x27;t speak on how long this will last for someone who has a more consistent routine but I use it approx. once a day in the morning, and this stuff has lasted me for ages. Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product just about every day for about four years. I don&#x27;t go any where with out it.</li>
    <li> It has been almost two months now since I ordered this product, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. I have tried to contact the seller several times now and they still give this this weird email asking if I still want this product. They have already taken my money out of my account and are now asking me if I still want to get this delivered to my place? Are you kidding? I am so peased now. People should not buy this product here. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good one but I know that you will never be able to review and comment about the quality of the product if you order it here.</li>
    <li> Absorbers well and hydrates and I have always loved clinique products.  Running out of words but have to fill this in!</li>
    <li> I just received this product yesterday actually so it is too early to comment on how it works yet...However, I can tell you that it arrived on time and the size and packaging were also as shown.  I have really oily skin so finding a moisturizer that absorbs quickly and does not leave a residue, or even temporarily over dry my skin is HUGE for me.  I washed my face with Clinique Liquid Facial Soap Mild then used the step 2 Astringent and added the moisturizing gel before going to bed.  It is (so far) great.  Let me explain since heck it was my first day using it and all not including following the same  routine I described again this morning.  You really only need a small amount to truly moisturize your face.  It is not sticky and is easy to smooth on your face.  It absorbs quickly again, without leaving your skin feeling like you want to run another cotton ball of astringent over it and just feels refreshing.  I can definitely feel the difference in just the two applications so far.  I will update this post in a month to let you know if it is as fantastic as I think it is.  If it is I will be stocking up for the future.</li>
    <li> If the regular Clinique moisturing lotion is a little heavy for you, then the moisturing gel is what you need.  A little goes a long way and it feels light and fresh without feeling oily.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Love how this is a gel and not a lotion, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue feeling, dries fast and moisturizes</li>
    <li> i switched to this lotion about a year ago and i love it. It is perfect for my type of skin witch is oily. it contols my oil and my face does not get oily as it use to, nor do I break out. i recommend this lotion for anyone that is trying to control their oil.</li>
    <li> It feels moisturizing and cool going on the skin. It is the perfect moisturizer for oily skin or combination skin in the summer. I have dryer combination skin and found it to be not moisturizing enough in the dry winter month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it is gentle enough for sensitive skin. Normal moisturizers and some eye cream burns when applied to my eyes, but this one never does that (I have applied it all over my lid and close to my lashes with no discomfort).</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Cliniques products &amp; have been a user for the last 20 years. It&#x27;s nice to be able to find the moisturizer online rather than having to go to a department store to get it. This is a good moisturizer. I like the way it leaves my skin before apply my makeup. The only reason I give it a start down from perfect is that over time, it leaves my skin a little oily feeling. I think it is because my skin must be getting used to it. All around though, a good buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Clinique, that should be enough but I&#x27;ll tell you that I&#x27;ve been using this gel for 12 years, and when I don&#x27;t like a product I don&#x27;t give it any second chances, that&#x27;s a lot to say for Clinique! Great!!! you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I started using this on my face three years ago at age 30 and couldn&#x27;t believe the dramatic change in my skin tone, clarity and overall glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, as in a few weeks ago, I started to use it on my chest, which has a little bit of sun damage, and I am elated with how much more toned and glowing it looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like the fountain of youth in a bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the gel, though, and not the lotion. The lotion is way too thick and will clog your pores and make you shiny.</li>
    <li> Been using this face lotion for over ten years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive combination skin and this product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Ive tried so many brands of moisturizers over the years and spent a crazy amount on them. This moisturizer is actually a very good deal for such a large bottle and it last for ages.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone with combination or oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this product works really well to hydrate without feeling oily or sticky.  I am not sure how it will work in the winter, but in the warm, humid summer months in NC, it is a really fantastic moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Been using this product as long as it has been available.  Prior to that I used the crème.  Like the gel because it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, shipped fast, packaged nicely &amp; highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The box this came in looked like it had been chewed on by a rat. Hopefully the product is ok.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift for my mom.she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;the another thing is that it is too small but expensive.</li>
    <li> Has used it for over 2 years, worth for anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique for a couple of years now. I usually buy in-store from retailers. This one had no expiry date on it. But same great product.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer, but beware, it is not made for dry skin, it is made for oily skin, so I wish I had ordered another type of moisturizer for my face. It did absorb well, but did not really moisturized my skin.</li>
    <li> Rancid smelling.i threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> If you have combination/oily skin, this product is for you. It&#x27;s a thin texture but still moisturizes very well. I&#x27;ll most likely purchase this again, as I&#x27;ve found nothing else better than it. Great product!</li>
    <li> I loooooooooooooooooooooooooove this product.  Have used it for years!  Just a little bit and it covers all the face.</li>
    <li> I had higher expectations for this moisturizer, maybe it&#x27;s just too light for my skin but it seems to leave my skin a bit irritated sometimes so I&#x27;m going to start using a moisturizer from Lush since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin moisture, especially in winter. However, it smells not very well, just like something alcohol, I think!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love? My daughter&#x27;s favorite moisturizer at a great price delivered to my doorstep in two days....</li>
    <li> My face is always thirsty for moisture but I also have oily skin.  this hoes on smooth and does not feel greasy, but does take more time than I would like to wait to apply my foundation so it is not to slippery.</li>
    <li> You guys have no idea how happy I am for finally having a good moisturizer for my face.. My skin used to get so dry, that when I tried to do a make up, it was terrible.. cuz was peeling off. This is cream, oil free.. my skin is sooo smooth. My husband if alergic to any kind os perfume, and the smell of this is almost nothing.. I just loved!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this moisturizing gel on a whim, and used it til it was gone. Let me say first that it is an EXCELLENT moisturizer. My skin felt healthy, smooth, and firm. However, I bought the gel hoping for better oil control, and while it applied well and moisturized wonderfully, after a mere two hours my face was oily, heavily oily. So much so that my makeup came wiping off when all I used were blotting sheets. I have oily/combination skin, and while this was a fantastic moisturizer, and I liked it very much, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again to wear during the day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause acne. Moisturizes without leaving my skin feeling damp, thick, or oily. Soaks in fast.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face lotion!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy with my sensitive dry combination skin &amp; I definitely notice a difference in my skin when I don&#x27;t use my Clinique products.  A big fan of this company &amp; their skincare products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that this gel is for oily skin when I bought it, and my skin tends to be dry.  However, on hot sunny days when I&#x27;m prone to sweating, I use this gel instead of my regular cream.  It goes on silky smooth and I love the feel.</li>
    <li> Bought this and did not realize it was the gel.  My daughter threw the box away before we realized it.  now stuck with the gel  wish I had the lotion</li>
    <li> The product does not have the same consistency or smell as what I have purchased from a dept store. Makes my skin feel dryer after I put it on than before. I would like my money back.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product for those that don&#x27;t wish to have a lot of extra add ins.  I used it when I need to have something that didn&#x27;t have all those for a diet that I was on.</li>
    <li> The box outside is missing,and the lotion was all over...not a good experience.  But it used very good. So,3 star.</li>
    <li> This Clinique moisturizing lotion was clearly changed. It looks as though menthol was added. The color is significantly lighter than it should be. It&#x27;s very important that Amazon checks this distributor.</li>
    <li> Definitely light weight, but doesn&#x27;t feel like it deeply moisturizes.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has been a constant for years, leaving my face soft and non greasy.  It is absorbed fast, and smoothes out dryness.  I use its cousin the lotion moisturizer around eyes and throat for more long lasting moisture.  Glad to find this on Amazon.  It has no scent, and is safe to put all over your face.  Will not sting eyes. I like the pump dispenser.  At first I thought it was a huge waste of plastic.  I have come to see that it keeps the contents of the bottle uncontaminated.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I bought Dramatically Different Moisturising Gel. Because my skin is of the mixed type, it feels great under the GEL.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin! It dries to a beautiful moist but matte finish, which is great for layering with make up or for just not feeling like a grease ball all day. It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
    <li> First, I swear what I am going to tell you really happened on me. I bought this product as a gift for my friend in China as she told me the brand is nice and it is relatively cheap in America. It is cheap I would say, but the quality of the stuff is terrible. To begin with, I received this product near June 20th, 2015. I only checked whether the wrap is completed and brought it back to China as I was not interested in the  cosmetic and didn&#x27;t know about it. When I gave it to her yesterday(7.17.2015), she told me that the inside bottle was already opened (I don&#x27;t have picture of that, but I guess this is something easy to tell and she won&#x27;t lie to me). What&#x27;s more, the bottle was labeled B83, which means it was produced in 2013 August, there is about two years to the day I received it. According to my study on the Internet, the product was better to be stored under 3 years, and can only be used within one year when it&#x27;s opened (and I don&#x27;t know when it was first opened.) So, that&#x27;s it, I bought a terrible gift for my friend without realize. I cant even return it now as I went back China and will only be back at the end of August.</li>
    <li> I have always had acne prone skin.  When I was a teenager I tried many products from drugstores and found that the moisturizers were usually too heavy for my skin and had a tendency to make me break out.  I have tried some moisturizers which are not supposed to clog pores (even those in one of my favorite skincare lines, Mario Badescu) and found that even these products cause breakouts or make my skin feel &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use the moisturizer in the morning and at night and also use all about eyes rich for the delicate skin under my eyes (since I use acne products with salicylic acid to keep my skin clear I know it is important to keep the skin under my eyes from getting dry!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel is the moisturizer I have come back to time and time again--I am always looking for new products to try to see if another moisturizer will be even better for my skin, but so far I have not found a moisturizer that comes close to supplementing or replacing my Clinique.  I have tried Estee Lauder moisturizers also and found them too heavy and rich for my acne prone skin.  I will keep experimenting and looking for new moisturizers to try but until I find one that blows dramatically different gel out of the water, it will be my go to moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So i desperately needed a new moisturizer and I heard people raving about this one specifically because its said to be called a drink for your skin.Naturally I bought it.Its absolutely AWESOME.It lasts forever and I used three pumps every morning and night.It doesnt smell bad,it&#x27;s allergy tested and its from clinique,the most healthful skincare brand.I dont reccommend this moisturizer for people with oily skin.My nose is very oily and when i put this on my nose I look as if my nose is shining the way for planes to land.</li>
    <li> I am very upset with my purchase (Clinique cream \\&quot;All about eyes rich\\&quot; and Clinique \\&quot;Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel\\&quot;) which I&#x27;ve bought from Laptop-Services in April 2011. The both (cream and gel) I&#x27;ve got unpacked. I think Laptop-Services must pay more attention how the treatments they send to customers are packed! Unfortunately I am not happy with my purchase; I think I&#x27;ll never buy treatments using Laptop-Services.</li>
    <li> cheaper than which sold in China, and so great for mum.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product from Clinique. It absorbs very quickly into your skin and does not leave a greasy feeling behind. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> For years I was using Clinique moisturizing lotion on my face, until one day when I went to purchase it at Macys and the counter person looked at me and said no when I asked for it, and she handed me this product, the moisturizing gel.  She reviewed why it would be better for my face and she said, trust me once you use this and you see the difference you wont ever stop using it.  She also told me that this stuff will help my face looking young, and for the most part, people do think that I am around 23-25 years old, however I am almost 35.  I have used the gel for about 4-5 years, and prior to that the lotion for about 4-5 years. The gel is by far the best! Doesnt leave my face looking wet or oily like the lotion did, and I actually feel cleaner using this product over the lotion, looking back it felt like my face was being pulled on compared to this making it feel tighter. 5*****</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended to me; I have very dry facial skin.  This is not the right product for someone with dry facial skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing gel is the best moisturizer I have ever used and I have used more products then most. I have very bad oily combination skin and also have psoriasis which makes skin products very hard to find that work well. This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and leathery feeling or oily it&#x27;s that perfect balance. I would suggest this to anyone who has oily skin issues!</li>
    <li> My wife religiously uses this product. After finding it cheaper on Amazon, it is a regular purchase now.</li>
    <li> Clinique makes great products, so after trying their Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, I decided to try out the gel. Overall, I like the product, however I wish it was a bit more moisturizing. I realize this is designed for those with oily skin, but I wish it was just a bit more hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you experience the same thing, I&#x27;ve found that on the dryer days it&#x27;s best to use the Moisturizing Lotion, and then use this on warmer days. Your mileage may vary though, especially with skincare products. Overall, a great product by Clinique!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy again because I found out it is tested on animals - something I wish I would have checked before I purchased.</li>
    <li> Very light moisturizer. Was hoping it was more intense.</li>
    <li> I have the same problem for all clinique product. I don&#x27;t know how much I should put on everytime. The gel gave me aches but not too bad, and when I just put a little bit on, nothing happened. I am stilling trying to figure out the balance.</li>
    <li> easy to absorb , No shiny shine problems&lt;br /&gt;wonderful ♥</li>
    <li> Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing lotions are the best in their class. I&#x27;ve been using the Dramatically Different Moisturizer Lotion for years now and have never been disappointed. However, I didn&#x27;t realize this product is gel, so it is not quite the same thing, nor does it work as well; my face feels just as dry after using this. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I love it. And it‘s  Much cheaper than shopping mall.I use it before the make up. I brought one for my best friend as a gift, she love it too!</li>
    <li> Be wary that this is a gel vs lotion so it&#x27;s slightly different than expected.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitve skin. This is the only moisturizer I can use on my face. Thank goodness for Clinique!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get out of the shower, even if I just use cool tap water on my face, my face will have blotches on it. I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Clinique has been a lifesaver. The pump works great. It is convenient because I can keep it in my medicine cabinet -- it doesn&#x27;t have to be on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use many of their products because they are unscented and do not cause any reaction with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Clinique!</li>
    <li> I have combo skin. Some days it can get oily. Some days it can be dry. I don&#x27;t like suing heavy mousturizers. This is the absolutely perfect moisturizer that I have ever used. I will never go anywhere else. It&#x27;s also perfect for under make up after a shower. If you don&#x27;t want this as a moisturizer for night use like I do, I still would recommend it for make up use as its not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> MEJOR NOMBRE NO PUDIERON DARLE A ESTE PRODUCTO.  GEL HUMECTANTE DRAMATICAMENTE DIFERENTE.  EFECTIVAMENTE, ES EL TERCER PASO (3 STEP) DE ESTA LÍNEA DE CUIDADO DIARIO DE MI CUTIS DURANTE LOS ÚLTIMOS 25 AÑOS.  AUNQUE CONFIESO QUE LA PRESENTACION EN LOCION (Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion) NO LE FUE BIEN A MI TIPO DE PIEL Y TUVE QUE DESCONTINUAR SU USO PRODUCTO, UTILIZANDO SOLAMENTE EL JABÓN, LA LOCIÒN Y OTRA CREMA HUMECTANTE DE CLINIQUE.  ESTO QUEDO RESUELTO AL INTRODUCIR LA PRESENTACIÒN EN GEL QUE ME VA DE LO MEJOR HASTA EL MOMENTO, EVITANDO EN GRAN PARTE EL BRILLO EN MI ROSTRO, Y DEJANDO ESA SENSACION INSTANTÁNEA DE FRESCURA Y HUMEDAD EXACTA, SIN NINGÚN TIPO DE RESIDUO.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and have used it for 10 years now. I have used it as an eye makeup remover, and can thank this lotion for my great skin around my eyes! Dont get it in your eye by any means, but it works great nonetheless.</li>
    <li> My mom get allergic after using it. The ones bought from HK before didn&#x27;t cause any allergy.</li>
    <li> Hello, good morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow responses to questions from the satisfaction survey, I chose 3 stars because I&#x27;m using just 15 days. I&#x27;m enjoying the product and indicate to all people who like to treat the skin.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all this false product is about, but if you have oily skin, this is a REALLY good moisturizer! It has a matte finish after every application. Never thought I would find a moisterizer that wouldn&#x27;t leave me shiny. I just put a little extra on my dry areas like around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;However if you have DRY skin, stay away. It&#x27;ll only make you worse.</li>
    <li> Start now and you too will have young skin for many years.  Use the women&#x27;s formula as it is less expensive than what they promote for men - and actually does a better job.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A FAKE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS, DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME !</li>
    <li> This does not hydrate very well, and it smells awful. I&#x27;m surprised how highly this is reviewed, as it is the worst moisturizer for the price I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very oily skin &amp; other products would dry certain parts of my face out &amp; make my oily skin worse. I felt a difference in my skin almost right away. I wasn&#x27;t sure if a gel moisturizer would help me out, so I&#x27;m very happy that I tried it!! The price is great &amp; this product works fantastically....I&#x27;m sticking with this for forever!</li>
    <li> I have oily/combination skin and live in a humid environment. Every few years I decide to try a different moisturizer and regret it. This goes on smooth, moisturizes well, dries quickly, has no detectable fragrance, and never clogs my pores or makes me look greasy.</li>
    <li> It is excellent, and I really love it. It is the same as the picture, and the quality is so nice.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheaper than buy it in my country~like it~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10+ years and it works wonderfully. It keeps my skin moisturized without being greasy. I use a lot at night to help lock in moisture and I wake up with fresh skin in the morning. My hands are forever soft (I get compliments on them all the time) because of this product too. It&#x27;s light, there isn&#x27;t any fragrance, and it&#x27;s non-greasy... plus it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!!! I will continue to buy this product until they stop making it.</li>
    <li> Always the highest results</li>
    <li> super fast delivery wonderful product</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for the past year and it is perfect for my dry/oily skin! I live in New Mexico, where it is always* dry, whether it be freezing or sizzling outside, and before I got this moisturizer I had to wash my face several times a day, because it felt oily or &#x27;residue&#x27; which was unbearable...and the constant washing just dried my skin out more. With this moisturizer though, I never feel like my face is oily, or dry and I have noticed reduced pores (even my aviation mechanic husband loves it!)! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Makes it easy not to have to go to the mall to get this! Light on my sensitive skin and doesnt feel greasy or messy.</li>
    <li> If you have an oily face, this gel moisturizer is the way to go. In summer it&#x27;s much oilier due to humidity but the gel keeps it at bay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought clinique for years and have even bought it before on Amazon and have always liked it.  This &amp;#34;clinique&amp;#34; is not the same.  Its color and consistency are off and it has a bad smell.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem is but it&#x27;s not the same as the clinique I have used for many years.  I would not buy from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion/gel! Leaves skin super soft. Rec&#x27;d using the facial soap with it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t put most moisturizers on my face, because I&#x27;ll break out, but I really do need a face moisturizer.  I never break out using this stuff, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have very oily - acne prone - skin  and many expensive and inexpensive lotions clog my pores or overmoisturize. This product feels very light and I don&#x27;t feel over moisturized. When I have to use my acne products, I don&#x27;t experience the dry patches I normally do from the retina A with this product. I am a new fan.</li>
    <li> This is a gel, not the lotion that you are used to... Btw, it sucks...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not greasy, but moisturizes skin.</li>
    <li> I love most of Clinique products. This one in particular is a favorite. Very light moisturising for oily skin. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Good product would buy again.</li>
    <li> Entrega en tiempo establecido por el vendedor, producto nuevo y en perfecto estado y correctamente embalado. Compre con toda confianza</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and no other would satisfy me.</li>
    <li> My wife like Clinique products along  time a go. She said is the best on market. I  agree and buy for her to make she happy.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturize because it doesnt leave your face oily.  I also like to purchase thru Amazon because if I buy this item at a major department store I might be tempted to purchase other things.</li>
    <li> I feel like it&#x27;s not the best for oily skin.  I&#x27;ve heard people with dry skin using it and they loved it.  I feel like it makes me still a little oily.</li>
    <li> Good quality!I like it.except for the package was not very well,I really like this Gel！Easy for use and feel smooth and comfortable!</li>
    <li> Girl Friend complain this as too dry in the first place, then take a compliment on this gel. She is happy.</li>
    <li> Producto de belleza que tiene varios elementos para ser recomendado, de excelente calidad, se absorbe inmediatamente, no deja sensación grasosa</li>
    <li> Great product! Totally 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisture gel for many years and won&#x27;t switch to any other.</li>
    <li> I love this non-greasy moisturizer.  My face is soft and smooth and my pores don&#x27;t get clogged with oil and gunk.</li>
    <li> suits my wife the best out of all the variety in the market clinique is a good company they need to make bigger containers</li>
    <li> I like the gel more than cream because it feels very thin going on and leaves a soft feel to the touch. Great product, using Clinque for over 10 years. Quick ship.</li>
    <li> Clinique products are always the best and HYPOALLERGENIC</li>
    <li> I normally use the Dramatically Different Moisturizing lotion.  I accidentally bought the gel and I don&#x27;t care for it at all.  It does not moisturize my dry skin as well as the lotion.</li>
</ol>
