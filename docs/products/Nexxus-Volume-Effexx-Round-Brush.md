      <li>Perfect for creating a big, volumous blowout!</li>
      <li>Love it -</li>
      <li>Lone behold my favorite brush was discontinued.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more for straightening than curling.</li>
      <li>Glad we found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Just one run-through with this brush gave me a beautiful soft curl (yes, a bonafide wavy curl) at my bang area.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush as an indication from a hair professional, and it works greatly for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>arrived very punctual and it is good value.</li>
      <li>this is a very nice brush as it brushes smoothly but leaves the hair very soft!</li>
      <li>and the outcome is awesome, really bouncy hair :) my hair is very long (over the shoulder reaches my belly button) and the jumbo size is a nice fit for me</li>
      <li>So easy to use</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2SVACKM9UX3LS]]I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
      <li>and she likes it just fine.</li>
      <li>If you have wavy, kinky hair and are looking for something to smooth it out with the help of your blow dryer, select this brush.</li>
      <li>Fantastic, my hair is easier to manage, it shines.</li>
      <li>brush (big) works great for me</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time yesterday, and I received so many compliments at work.</li>
      <li>I am so excited I just found this again on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It don&#x27;t get tangled up in my hair and it works well as I use it to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice</li>
      <li>straight - most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice.  </li>
      <li>However, overall it is a good brush that gets the job done well.</li>
      <li>It has a hole in the top where it looks like an end piece should be, and the ceramic under the bristles wiggles around and seems very flimsy, like it might fall apart at any moment.</li>
      <li>Best round brush ever!!</li>
      <li>Oh, and I purchased the jumbo btw.the brush is very comfortable to use: light-weight and with a super soft handle that gives you both comfort and traction so as to reduce your grip and relieve hand-pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, the brush is very comfortable to use: light-weight and with a super soft handle that gives you both comfort and traction so as to reduce your grip and relieve hand-pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>It is light, I have very curly hair, it gets on my nerves every time I try to comb it.</li>
      <li>I looked into getting this brush its even better than my old brush.</li>
      <li>It has been worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Every positive comment you read is so true.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>Overall I am pleased that I bought this brush and would do so again.</li>
      <li>Some round brushes don&#x27;t do a good job of grabbing the hair and pulling through but not with this brush.</li>
      <li>It is somewhat heavy but good quality.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind that it&#x27;s slightly larger than most really large brushes.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair that needs volumes and non-frizzing to get fine hairs to lay down.  </li>
      <li>I get used to a certain brush and never want to try anything else out.</li>
      <li>I find that the brush is too large, too jumbo for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even on a day where I didn&#x27;t bother to take much time with my hair, and using a blow dryer barely putting out any heat, my hair still looks better than it ever has: soft, shiny, bouncy.</li>
      <li>Really grips my hair and gives my hair body.</li>
      <li>I usually am really picky about my brushes.</li>
      <li>It works well for blowing my hair out straight.</li>
      <li>each time with whatever sales associate telling me I needed to get the one with the straight plastic bristles</li>
      <li>my 1.5\\&quot; round brush was just not cutting it any more.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair look great when blowing it dry with this large round brush.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine, shoulder length hair and this brush grips on for dear life until the very ends of my hair while I blow dry!</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I am able to dry my hair so much quicker but the bristles are falling out after only 2 uses.</li>
      <li>Really helps me get my hair dry quick.</li>
      <li>Ever go to the salon for one of those cute bobs (long or short) and leave with the softest, lightest, bounciest hair imaginable?</li>
      <li>have super curly and long hair</li>
      <li>I do like the handle, but the other end is the important part.</li>
      <li>or if I got a new haircut.</li>
      <li>I have really long hair (almost waist length) and needed a big brush that could easily grab all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I did not usually write a comment after I buy a product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>The brush gets hot and helps to&lt;br /&gt; to give shape to the hair without making it flat.</li>
      <li>She wore he old one out.</li>
      <li>The bristles are also short and there is less worry of my hair becoming tangled.</li>
      <li>It does cause some static when I brush it while it&#x27;s dry, but nothing unmanageable since I usually only use it when my hair is wet.</li>
      <li>A sticky, dry, oily while later, I pretty much gave up and decided to grow it out and channel my inner flower child.</li>
      <li>but I blow dry my hair fairly straight</li>

    <li> This tells you how much I love the brush: the price decreased an extra 15% since I purchased it last week and I don&#x27;t even care.  I love this brush.  My hair is mid-back length and wavy and my 1.5\\&quot; round brush was just not cutting it any more.  I bought the jumbo size, and it is about 3\\&quot; in diameter.  It is a perfect size for me and helps me get my hair straight.  Each bristle has a longish plastic-tipped piece surrounded by a shorter clump of plastic bristles.  This provides great grab.  It feels sturdy and nice in the hand.  I highly recommend this brush if you have long wavy hair!</li>

    <li> Ever go to the salon for one of those cute bobs (long or short) and leave with the softest, lightest, bounciest hair imaginable? Then you try to recreate it at home and end up with a flat mess. That was me. I&#x27;ve been through countless round brushes...each time with whatever sales associate telling me I needed to get the one with the straight plastic bristles b/c of my thick hair or (when that failed) to get the one with tourmaline or 24 kt. gold and any number of odd suggestions. I thought maybe it was the hair dryer I was using and went through three different models with all sorts of diffusers and attachments. Finally, out of desperation, I turned to shampoos and styling products. A sticky, dry, oily while later, I pretty much gave up and decided to grow it out and channel my inner flower child. Then one day I got a haircut and the stylist had a brush that was just amazing. Gripped my thick hair without any problem but instead of pulling hard on any tangles (I&#x27;m tender-headed), it softly brushed through them like sheets sliding against each other...leaving behind a slightly billowy and very voluminous result. She couldn&#x27;t remember the company that made her brush or even what size it was, but I examined it carefully and then came on Amazon to track it (or its closest relative) down. Enter the Nexxus Volume Effexx. Built just like her brush (for all I know it IS the same as hers), this brush has the longer and more rigid plastic bristles paired with a shorter boar-like one. The result is that it grips even the thickest of hair and then \\&quot;whips\\&quot; it up a bit to create lovely volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time yesterday, and I received so many compliments at work. Everyone was asking me what I did differently or if I got a new haircut. Just one run-through with this brush gave me a beautiful soft curl (yes, a bonafide wavy curl) at my bang area. And the rest of my hair just felt so smooth and light, capturing perfectly that salon-like bounce and feel. Also, the brush is very comfortable to use: light-weight and with a super soft handle that gives you both comfort and traction so as to reduce your grip and relieve hand-pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about this brush and would recommend to everyone. Oh, and I purchased the jumbo btw.the brush is very comfortable to use: light-weight and with a super soft handle that gives you both comfort and traction so as to reduce your grip and relieve hand-pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about this brush and would recommend to everyone. Oh, and I purchased the jumbo btw.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush from Amazon because it was cheaper than the discount beauty store in my area. It works well for blowing my hair out straight. It does not snag or get wrapped up in my long hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzier, but I don&#x27;t think it actually cuts down on my frizz. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut down on the blow drying time either. However, overall it is a good brush that gets the job done well.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2SVACKM9UX3LS]]I have shoulder length fine hair. Actually, my hair sits two or three inches lower than my shoulders. I bought this brush in hopes of getting big soft curls. I find that the brush is too large, too jumbo for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice brush and I like the round plastic tips on the ends of the bristles. No scratching or harming my scalp. The bristles are also short and there is less worry of my hair becoming tangled. I can get some nice lift to the crown of my head. It adds some body to the sides. Body, not curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep in mind, it is a BIG brush. If you have wavy, kinky hair and are looking for something to smooth it out with the help of your blow dryer, select this brush. If you have shoulder length hair and want to add curl and waves, pick a smaller size.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was difficult to pull through my hair, but then I noticed my hair seemed shinier.  I like it a lot.  Keep in mind that it&#x27;s slightly larger than most really large brushes.  It&#x27;s more for straightening than curling.</li>
    <li> Great for those who wish to blow out (straighten) their hair.  Love it - I&#x27;ve been using this brush for years!!</li>
    <li> Is a great brush for blow drying my medium length hair.  Just wish it was a tad larger.  Would highly recommend.  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> No problems; pretty much a standard, non-heat reactive, large round brush. Never had a bristle fall out.  I would improve it only by increasing the bristle size and/or adding the fiber now found in some combs/brushes that far decrease drying time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself.  Too big for my hair length but I passed it on to my extremely long-haired daughter and she likes it just fine.</li>
    <li> I must have bought one of these over 10 years ago and the handle broke a month ago.  I bought two other brushes and neither worked like this one.  I am so excited I just found this again on Amazon.  I have baby fine hair that needs volumes and non-frizzing to get fine hairs to lay down.  This brush is awesome.  I bought 2 in case years down the road, I need a replacement again</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair (to the point that EVERY hairdresser comments on how thick my hair is), and this is one of very few brushes that can actually manage it. It grips it while blowdrying without making it get stuck and wound up. It does cause some static when I brush it while it&#x27;s dry, but nothing unmanageable since I usually only use it when my hair is wet. I also like how sturdy it feels in my hand. Every single brush I&#x27;ve used in the past (including high end brands) has fallen apart in some way or another, but this one feels like I will have it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I usually am really picky about my brushes. I usually stick with the same brand of brush for years. I get used to a certain brush and never want to try anything else out. Lone behold my favorite brush was discontinued. I looked into getting this brush its even better than my old brush. Easier to do blow outs with! Its the best brush I have ever had. Completely impressed!</li>
    <li> I did not usually write a comment after I buy a product.&lt;br /&gt;But this round brush is sosososososos good!&lt;br /&gt;You must buy because of the good quality</li>
    <li> Was hoping this brush would be great for my shoulder length hair, but the plastic bristles on it would make my hair get tangled in it. They would pull on the strands... Not what I expected.. Don&#x27;t even use it anymore</li>
    <li> I have really long hair (almost waist length) and needed a big brush that could easily grab all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This brush (big) works great for me</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brush. She wore he old one out. Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere. Glad we found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It don&#x27;t get tangled up in my hair and it works well as I use it to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice and I do recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair, and very fine!!!  This brush gives me lift at the crown, like I wanted.  With my hair being so fine, and the size of the brush, I can dry my hair in less than 5 minutes!!!  Doesn&#x27;t create staticy hair, either.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, my hair is easier to manage, it shines. It has been worth the purchase. It is light, I have very curly hair, it gets on my nerves every time I try to comb it. This brush helps me give it volume and the effects I want.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for a few months and it has been working as it is described. Do not find any fault in this product hence the 5 stars rating.</li>
    <li> Great brush! I have baby fine, shoulder length hair and this brush grips on for dear life until the very ends of my hair while I blow dry! I ordered the Jumbo and it&#x27;s the perfect size, I thought it would be too big but I blow dry my hair fairly straight so it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as an indication from a hair professional, and it works greatly for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have super curly and long hair and I can blow dry it without a problem using this brush. The brush gets hot and helps to&lt;br /&gt; to give shape to the hair without making it flat. I absolutely love it and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair.  I have semi-thick hair with lots of body.  It left my hair flat.</li>
    <li> Love it! So easy to use and the outcome is awesome, really bouncy hair :) my hair is very long (over the shoulder reaches my belly button) and the jumbo size is a nice fit for me</li>
    <li> Because the rubber handle material starts a little farther away from the round part of the brush, not as much of my hair gets caught and ripped out as other brushes. But a few hairs do get caught each time I use it. Ouch.</li>
    <li> This brush is terrible. I have never had a brush get tangled in my hair the way this one does. I purchased for blow outs and can&#x27;t even use it because it just creates a tangled mess.</li>
    <li> Better star rating would have been awarded if the bristles had been longer.  I have long hair and struggle with this brush.</li>
    <li> Best round brush ever!! I have thick long wavy hair and this brush glides so easily through my hair! My arm doesn&#x27;t hurt and it makesmy hair smooth, voluminous and polished! Better than any other round brush and I have over 20. I want another as a back up.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, and I use a large round brush to help blow dry it straight. It&#x27;s time for a new one, and I wanted to splurge on myself a little. Based on the customer reviews I took a chance on this brush. I am not very impressed, not for the price. It has a hole in the top where it looks like an end piece should be, and the ceramic under the bristles wiggles around and seems very flimsy, like it might fall apart at any moment. I do like the handle, but the other end is the important part. Overall I am not happy, but it&#x27;s not worth the return shipping. The search continues!</li>
    <li> Nice but it does tangle a bit, maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly like the stylist do.</li>
    <li> Really grips my hair and gives my hair body. Some round brushes don&#x27;t do a good job of grabbing the hair and pulling through but not with this brush. I just have to spend 2-3 minutes with my straightening iron and I&#x27;m done! Great volumizing brush!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading great reviews about this product. I must say I LOVE IT...It works great on my hair. My hair feels soft and frizz free. I would definitely recommend it for people with long hair.</li>
    <li> I use this brush while blow drying my hair.  It is somewhat heavy but good quality.  It does not get caught in knots like other round brushes I&#x27;ve had.  My only other comment is that the handle of the brush I received has a slight tilt instead of going into the brush straight - most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a year and it is still in perfect condition.  Overall I am pleased that I bought this brush and would do so again.</li>
    <li> Love it it&#x27;s the best brush I ever had.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with an Olivia Garden 1 inch round brush and this one works just as great but is slightly less expensive. Perfect for creating a big, volumous blowout!</li>
    <li> Buy this. I have never before written a review. I am so happy with this brush I figured I should take the time. Every positive comment you read is so true. This brush arrived and ironically my blow dryer took a crap the same day. Even on a day where I didn&#x27;t bother to take much time with my hair, and using a blow dryer barely putting out any heat, my hair still looks better than it ever has: soft, shiny, bouncy. 5 stars.</li>
