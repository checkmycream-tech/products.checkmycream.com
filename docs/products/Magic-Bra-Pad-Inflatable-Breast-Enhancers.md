      <li>These literally make any bra into a push up bra, which is great</li>
      <li>My dress did a great job at hiding any lumpiness.</li>
      <li>I ordered these for Halloween and they worked great</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did, they are wonderful.  </li>
      <li>You just need to adjust it and find a good bra that will look will with this bra inserts.</li>
      <li>I love them !</li>
      <li>Comfortable, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest swimming lol.</li>
      <li>This product adds a full cup size when fully inflated and add great cleavage.</li>
      <li>Very easy to inflate and deflate, would recommend this product for some one looking to create more in the bust region.</li>
      <li>they are very comfortable ..</li>
      <li>I was able to pump (one) it up to the volume needed to fill my bra so my breasts were even again.</li>
      <li>but so glad that they do.</li>
      <li>You can literally make ANY bra your favorite and your cleavage</li>
      <li>I needed something to fill the void until I was able to get them redone.</li>
      <li>These fit the bill!  </li>
      <li>However I was able to insert the pad under the side of my breast and you cannot see it.</li>
      <li>i love this</li>
      <li>I love the fact that you can make the size whatever you want.</li>
      <li>and they works :)</li>
      <li>Ordered this product a week ago and absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>I am going to have to order more of these in case</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It would be a good product if it didn&#x27;t deflate after the first use.</li>
      <li>an Amazon Prime member I was able to get free 2 day shipping  on my order</li>
      <li>For that purpose, they will prove to be quite effective, but as for breast enhancement of any sort, they won&#x27;t get your hopes - or anything else - up very high!</li>
      <li>and so I have a problem with getting bras that fit me well.  </li>
      <li>They are an amazing product, really.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy for the crossdresser on the go.</li>
      <li>they  have super easy directions</li>
      <li>Suitable for probley up 2 a large C cup.</li>
      <li>Went flat as soon as I filled them with air!!!</li>
      <li>I bought these &amp;#34;breast enhancers&amp;#34; out of sheer curiousity (honestly!)</li>
      <li>The seller is amazing, I got my package a day early!</li>
      <li>The main reason I bought them is because I am a 34 DD and finding cute bras that fit both of my breasts has been a challenge.</li>
      <li>i love the shipping was supper fast</li>
      <li>It is not a bad product if it was not for that fault.</li>
      <li>I also loved how to was adjustable,you could pump less air or more air.</li>
      <li>The best thing any woman could ask for, seriously.</li>
      <li>I found the entire idea hilarious, then went and bought a couple of more sets to use as gag gifts for laughs.  </li>
      <li>I can make both my breasts fit at the same size, and even make the rare to find cute bras into pushups!</li>
      <li>so I guess I am back to spending more money for a product that lasts a year -- not a couple months!</li>
      <li>Give it another squeeze to add a little more air, hit the release to lit a little out, always a perfect fit.  </li>
      <li>But they don&#x27;t conform to your shape at all, just a big lump that shows up under a smooth fitting tee shirt.</li>
      <li>These little things are amazing!</li>
      <li>Wear it with a tight shirt or tight beater top and it will look incredible.</li>
      <li>a 3 piece set of strap perfect (I had bought them there before and lost them sadly) and decided I might as well since both were just $1.</li>
      <li>Oh well -- did not cost much, and did work well while intact!</li>
      <li>i give 4 stars ;)</li>
      <li>I place them along the underwire of my bra and lift my pups over it, and they hold it in place pretty well.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure with a patterned or a more thickly padded bra</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t add much size (no where near a whole cup size) even when filled with air all the way.</li>
      <li>When I need a little more fullness for that special dress, these inflatable breast pads are a dream.</li>
      <li>If you look at the side, you will see the insert if you don&#x27;t have much breast.</li>
      <li>i really recruitment to buy.</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>I really works and does the job...</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>they wouldn&#x27;t show as much.</li>
      <li>Naturally one is the DD and the other is more of a D, with this</li>
      <li>If you are purchasing this product to balance your chest - left, right - don&#x27;t - it won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it gave more cleavage than my chicken cutlets.</li>
      <li>I am a large busted women wearing a full D but after pregnancy and breast feeding my cleavage was less than it was before.</li>
      <li>pop too easily and not comfortable</li>
      <li>The only thing was that If you wear a low cut shirt and you turn to the side you can see the white but can easily be covered with out stopping the appeal of your chest.</li>
      <li>Feels natural and looks natural under your clothes.</li>
      <li>One was ok but the other did not hold the air and left one side of my chest flat.</li>
      <li>I guess the only downfall of them are that they don&#x27;t really like to stay in place all day, but they are worth the trouble.</li>
      <li>I had just recently pondered buying one of the bras that claim to do the same thing as this product, instead I&#x27;ll probably go back to the dollar tree and buy a few more of these incase</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical based on the low price, but these are great.</li>
      <li>so I assume it will get dirty easily if worn too much.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t look stupid, you honestly can&#x27;t even really tell you are wearing them.</li>

<li> so why not enjoy being young?</li>
<li> They are uncomfortable, not natural looking, and when I opened mine and pumped them up for the first time one had a slow air leak the first time I used them!</li>

<li> These were in a local dollar tree here, at first I thought they were silly, but then looked and saw that I was already buying</li>
<li> I am an A plus or B minus bra size</li>
<li> /&gt;They are small, flat, wedge-shaped balloons which have a small pump inside which inflates them either prior to, or whilst one has them inserted in her bra.  </li>
<li> considering I have a bra size that&#x27;s hard to find locally, and when I do the push ups are well into the $30 range.</li>
<li> Total waste of money!!</li>
<li> This product is only acceptable for very small chested women.</li>
<li> They are a little small, not much of a help for me being a D &amp; DD, but helps a little.</li>
<li> I would recommend when you need a little</li>
<li> I wear these everyday.</li>
<li> I have uneven sized breasts</li>
<li> I bought these after one of my breast implants deflated and I was completely uneven.  </li>
<li> I was not sure about ordering these pads but at the price I decided to give them a try.  </li>
<li> It looked as if I went from a A cup to a Small C cup.</li>
<li> As expected, the items proved to be silly and pointless (no pun intended), as well as ineffective.&lt;br</li>
<li> Mine also came with a slow leaking hole in one.</li>
<li> I hate it so soooo much.</li>
<li> chose the beige over the black because I am afraid that the product would show, but for me it doesn&#x27;t slip even when I&#x27;m running up/down stairs.</li>
<li> it is so uncomfortable and looks so fake.</li>
<li> there sorta uncomfortable to wear and deflate by them</li>

    <li> I really works and does the job...</li>
    <li> Quick and easy for the crossdresser on the go. When I need a little more fullness for that special dress, these inflatable breast pads are a dream. Very comfortable and easy to use. Thanks again</li>
    <li> I hate it so soooo much. it is so uncomfortable and looks so fake. So, I advise no one to buy it.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about ordering these pads but at the price I decided to give them a try.  I am so glad I did, they are wonderful.  Wonder Bra came out with an air pump bra several years ago and these pads make every bra an air pump bra.  I am an A plus or B minus bra size and so I have a problem with getting bras that fit me well.  Even padded bras don&#x27;t always give me enough padding.  With these pad every bra I have now fits me perfectly.  Give it another squeeze to add a little more air, hit the release to lit a little out, always a perfect fit.  I am going to have to order more of these in case I spring a leak one of these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Amazon Prime member I was able to get free 2 day shipping  on my order and it arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for Halloween and they worked great and I didn&#x27;t have any issues through the night. They are a bit lumpy but I&#x27;m sure with a patterned or a more thickly padded bra they wouldn&#x27;t show as much. My dress did a great job at hiding any lumpiness. Didn&#x27;t know that these existed but so glad that they do. These are a really great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought these after one of my breast implants deflated and I was completely uneven.  I needed something to fill the void until I was able to get them redone. These fit the bill!  I was able to pump (one) it up to the volume needed to fill my bra so my breasts were even again. I could even wear low cut tops on a trip to Vegas and it never looked like I had one deflated breast.</li>
    <li> I have uneven sized breasts so I thought these would help. But they don&#x27;t conform to your shape at all, just a big lump that shows up under a smooth fitting tee shirt. I returned them.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what i was expecting&lt;br /&gt;not the best, but not the worst either&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the deflating act is more tedious than i expected, maybe I need some patriot fans to molest me at the end of the night</li>
    <li> Ordered this product a week ago and absolutely love them. I am a large busted women wearing a full D but after pregnancy and breast feeding my cleavage was less than it was before. This product adds a full cup size when fully inflated and add great cleavage. Very easy to inflate and deflate, would recommend this product for some one looking to create more in the bust region.</li>
    <li> These are a joke! Went flat as soon as I filled them with air!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it gave more cleavage than my chicken cutlets. It looked as if I went from a A cup to a Small C cup. I also loved how to was adjustable,you could pump less air or more air. The only thing was that If you wear a low cut shirt and you turn to the side you can see the white but can easily be covered with out stopping the appeal of your chest. Also If I am moving alot or doing some pyshical activity they pop out a bit more that the chicken cutlets. I would definetly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> These little things are amazing! The main reason I bought them is because I am a 34 DD and finding cute bras that fit both of my breasts has been a challenge. Naturally one is the DD and the other is more of a D, with this I can make both my breasts fit at the same size, and even make the rare to find cute bras into pushups! Its just the thing a girl like me needed, I am only 20 so why not enjoy being young? I recommend these, buy them asap! The seller is amazing, I got my package a day early!</li>
    <li> This definitely does make your breast look bigger. It would go well with people who breast are 32-34A. You just need to adjust it and find a good bra that will look will with this bra inserts. If you look at the side, you will see the insert if you don&#x27;t have much breast. However I was able to insert the pad under the side of my breast and you cannot see it. Wear it with a tight shirt or tight beater top and it will look incredible. The material of is like a cloth so I assume it will get dirty easily if worn too much.</li>
    <li> pop too easily and not comfortable</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical based on the low price, but these are great. Feels natural and looks natural under your clothes. I would recommend when you need a little lift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/17 -- sadly, both items fell apart today upon washing! Oh well -- did not cost much, and did work well while intact! But do not last as long as other similar - more expensive products - have, so I guess I am back to spending more money for a product that lasts a year -- not a couple months!</li>
    <li> I love them ! they are very comfortable ..</li>
    <li> Very well made. Comfortable, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest swimming lol. Takes a bit of getting used to with placement and wear.</li>
    <li> This product is only acceptable for very small chested women. If you are purchasing this product to balance your chest - left, right - don&#x27;t - it won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The best thing any woman could ask for, seriously. You can literally make ANY bra your favorite and your cleavage looks wonderful. I love the fact that you can make the size whatever you want. They don&#x27;t look stupid, you honestly can&#x27;t even really tell you are wearing them. I guess the only downfall of them are that they don&#x27;t really like to stay in place all day, but they are worth the trouble. I wanted to get argumentation until I bought these. Bigger bust without the pain and expense. They are an amazing product, really. I wear these everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they would give me some sort of lift. They are uncomfortable, not natural looking, and when I opened mine and pumped them up for the first time one had a slow air leak the first time I used them! Total waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these to help with odd sized breasts. You can pump them up and adjust them as needed. They are a little small, not much of a help for me being a D &amp; DD, but helps a little. Suitable for probley up 2 a large C cup.</li>
    <li> I bought these &amp;#34;breast enhancers&amp;#34; out of sheer curiousity (honestly!) to see what type of inflatable contraption could be inserted into ones bra with the expectation of &amp;#34;breast enhancement&amp;#34;.  As expected, the items proved to be silly and pointless (no pun intended), as well as ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;They are small, flat, wedge-shaped balloons which have a small pump inside which inflates them either prior to, or whilst one has them inserted in her bra.  I found the entire idea hilarious, then went and bought a couple of more sets to use as gag gifts for laughs.  For that purpose, they will prove to be quite effective, but as for breast enhancement of any sort, they won&#x27;t get your hopes - or anything else - up very high!</li>
    <li> there sorta uncomfortable to wear and deflate by them selves leaves you lop sided</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, these were horrible. Didn&#x27;t add much size (no where near a whole cup size) even when filled with air all the way. Mine also came with a slow leaking hole in one.</li>
    <li> It would be a good product if it didn&#x27;t deflate after the first use. One was ok but the other did not hold the air and left one side of my chest flat.It is not a bad product if it was not for that fault.</li>
    <li> i love the shipping was supper fast and they works :) i love this i really recruitment to buy. i give 4 stars ;) they  have super easy directions and you know how to do them properly.</li>
    <li> These were in a local dollar tree here, at first I thought they were silly, but then looked and saw that I was already buying a 3 piece set of strap perfect (I had bought them there before and lost them sadly) and decided I might as well since both were just $1. These literally make any bra into a push up bra, which is great considering I have a bra size that&#x27;s hard to find locally, and when I do the push ups are well into the $30 range. I had just recently pondered buying one of the bras that claim to do the same thing as this product, instead I&#x27;ll probably go back to the dollar tree and buy a few more of these incase anything happens to a set.&lt;br /&gt;I chose the beige over the black because I am afraid that the product would show, but for me it doesn&#x27;t slip even when I&#x27;m running up/down stairs. I place them along the underwire of my bra and lift my pups over it, and they hold it in place pretty well.</li>
