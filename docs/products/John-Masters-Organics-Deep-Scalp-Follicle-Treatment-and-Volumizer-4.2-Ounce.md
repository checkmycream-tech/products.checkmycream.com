      <li>:)</li>
      <li>; Sure I didn&#x27;t like her shpeel, but my hair looked so bouncy &amp; voluminous when she was finished with it that I ending up spending $21</li>
      <li>I love the lift I get from t</li>
      <li>She is very constant and very happy about your product!!!</li>

      <li>It did even better than that.  </li>
      <li>It does not have an offensive odor like many I have tried.</li>
      <li>Just really love his products.</li>
      <li>I never noticed a difference in the quality of my scalp (I keep a healthy diet).</li>
      <li>Love love love this product.</li>
      <li>Very surprised and happy about the results just from using it so infrequently.</li>
      <li>I love how clean it leaves your air smelling and feeling.</li>
      <li>strongly reccomend this for ladies.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s supposed to lead to a healthy scalp which, if true, is unrecognized by me.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s start with packaging: I love the spray bottle because it&#x27;s easy to use and get the product right where you want it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been putting this spray on my hair roots for several month and it works great.</li>
      <li>Makes me hair feel fantastic.</li>
      <li>Also, I used to have some &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34; on my scalp and now when I touch my scalp it feels smooth and free of any &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>After the use of this project wtih Rush new bar shampoo, I feel much better!</li>
      <li>Formulated with the best natural ingredients, including essential oils, these hair and scalp products do only good things for you.  </li>
      <li>This makes it feel full</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my third bottle and for my fine hair , it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>Will continue using to see if it promotes new hair growth, which would be great of course, but even if it only worked as a volumizer, I&#x27;d be more than willing to keep purchasing.</li>
      <li>A stellar product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming the look my stylist gave me (that I cannot recreate for the life of me) is not a result  of the products, but because of her magical touch or the fact that she&#x27;s a trained professional.</li>
      <li>I love that its organic, if your concern is hair re-growth organic and natural is the way to go.</li>
      <li>Very nice hair oil spray, i use it everyday with noticeable hair thickness.</li>
      <li>I now use the JM scalp line, and have seen a difference in hair loss and body right away.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was just too strong for my sensitive</li>
      <li>This helps to detangle my hair and makes it very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>this is the first review in my life.</li>
      <li>First off, let me state that I don&#x27;t have thinning hair.</li>
      <li>While I continue to try JM products, I consistently am underwhelmed.</li>
      <li>Most products make my hair flat like a pancake on my scalp.</li>
      <li>The dark glass is great because it protects the light sensitive essential oils</li>
      <li>This product has a positive affect on my hair, causing it to be manageable and stay in place.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a large head and super-fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>Overall I love the spray and the results are slowly but surely showing!</li>
      <li>I absolutely L-O-V-E John Master&#x27;s organic products.</li>
      <li>Really improved some irritation on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I am very please with the service and the product~  </li>
      <li>This product really helped with my hair loss issues.</li>
      <li>It took about two months before I really started noticing the regrowth</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t know that much yet.</li>
      <li>4b if anyone wants to know.</li>
      <li>These products really work well.</li>
      <li>Not only has it helped with hair volume but it actually kept my hair from frizzing when I was in Florida (where it ALWAYS frizzes), which was a nice surprise.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different natural treatments e.g. coconut oil, aloe vera etc.</li>
      <li>So far i love it and will definitely be repurchasing</li>
      <li>Nice and herbally, not sure how else to describe.</li>
      <li>for the hair growth, since I&#x27;ve also been taking supplements (horsehair, biotin, Biosil, and iron), I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this product or those supplements or the whole combinaton that has resulted in new hair around my hairline.  </li>
      <li>grand mother has less hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the deep scalp follicle treatment for years, and I keep returning for more whenever I feel my hair/scalp need extra pampering.  </li>
      <li>The one thing it did do was calm the occasional itch I get after washing my hair.</li>
      <li>I spray it on the most itchy places, and it takes a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>I have the shampoo for normal hair and the Lavender Rosemary, rejuvenator, sea mist and hair pomade........</li>
      <li>After a few uses I noticed my scalp itching more than it ever has before.</li>
      <li>I spray it on while my hair is still pretty wet (right out of the shower); about 6-8 sprays.</li>
      <li>4 days ago I realized I had brand new hair growth in the front hairline area that had been thinning.  </li>
      <li>I have also started to notice a lot less hair loss when I wash it and in general which for me is huge!</li>
      <li>Used only about 2 weeks and my other products seem to give me more lift.  </li>
      <li>I like many other people went through a lot of stress with the financial crisis and resulting recession.</li>
      <li>This treatment is clear and not at all greasy or oily.  </li>
      <li>I am 23 and have had thinning hair since I was around 13 years old.</li>
      <li>My doctor recommended this for some basic seasonal / hormonal hair loss as well as some hair loss after an injury and I&#x27;m amazed to find after a year that it&#x27;s really made quite a difference.</li>
      <li>The Deep Scalp Follicle Treatment really works.  </li>
      <li>My hair has beauty body and is so soft</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to wash it nearly as often.</li>
      <li>I use it after I wash my hair, and I can really tell the difference after 2 months (I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle).  </li>
      <li>I really like this product, I found it in my local Sprouts store</li>
      <li>I have been using this for nearly two months and have not noticed any volume benefits or signs of hair growth.</li>
      <li>The flakiness got worse, and I noticed more hair shed more than usual when brushing and washing.</li>
      <li>but I am about 70% back to normal thickness now after 8 months of use.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because my new hair dresser sold me on the countless (according to her) reasons why you should use organic products on your hair.</li>
      <li>I really thought that this would work, but different products work for different people.</li>
      <li>My hair is responding to this product immensely; thicker and fuller by far.</li>
      <li>I am 23 years old female.</li>
      <li>But overall, I love this spray and hope it is making my thin hair and scalp healthier.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this mostly because the &#x27;volumizing&#x27; claim, and I&#x27;m very happy to report, it does follow through. Like, supremely well! I spray it on while my hair is still pretty wet (right out of the shower); about 6-8 sprays. Massage it in for a minute or two, and then follow with JMO&#x27;s conditioning mist. This stuff is magic in a bottle. It gives my hair phenomenal lift without any sort of weight or greasy looking roots. Will continue using to see if it promotes new hair growth, which would be great of course, but even if it only worked as a volumizer, I&#x27;d be more than willing to keep purchasing. A stellar product!</li>
    <li> I have no hair grown in a small spot (~1.5cm) of my scalp b/c of seborrheic dermatitis. Since I start using john masters organics Deep Scalp Follicle Treatment &amp; Volumizer for Thinning Hair about 3 times a day, the redness and the itch decrease. After 1 month, the spot was smaller. After another month, the spot was less than 1 cm. Now I continue using it and hope the spot will be gone. this is the first review in my life.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this to regrow hair, but I ordered it because it mentioned something about helping with sebum.  It did even better than that.  The extreme itch on my scalp is relieved.  For once in my life, I have found something to relieve the incessant itch.  I spray it on the most itchy places, and it takes a few minutes.  But I have learned to massage the areas until it begins working.  And once it starts working, I have very little if any itching during the day until nighttime or sometimes until the next morning.  It works wonders!  :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I found it in my local Sprouts store but then they ran out of the product so I looked on Amazon and found it. On my 3rd bottle and use it like a spray gel before drying my hair for added body.</li>
    <li> Plumps up my hair and gives it amazing volume.</li>
    <li> Just getting started here... So I don&#x27;t know that much yet.</li>
    <li> Makes me hair feel fantastic. I have fie hair, but a lot of it. This makes it feel full</li>
    <li> I have typical male pattern hair thinning and alopecia areata. I&#x27;m always looking at different products to stimulate growth. I have been using this for nearly two months and have not noticed any volume benefits or signs of hair growth. While I continue to try JM products, I consistently am underwhelmed. This one is like wetting my hair down with fancy water! Take a pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I like many other people went through a lot of stress with the financial crisis and resulting recession. The front portion of my hairline thinned noticeably and after trying several other things such as supplements, I tried this out.  It took about two months before I really started noticing the regrowth but I am about 70% back to normal thickness now after 8 months of use.  It&#x27;s not overnight but it does work.</li>
    <li> very small compared to the money ive spent , havnt seen any difference yet</li>
    <li> I am blonde, thinning hair with aging. I have tried lots of products, all of which are not organic. I have never tried anything like these products! I absolutely L-O-V-E John Master&#x27;s organic products. My hair has beauty body and is so soft and I don&#x27;t have to wash it nearly as often. Just really love his products. I have the shampoo for normal hair and the Lavender Rosemary, rejuvenator, sea mist and hair pomade........love them all!!! Nothing like them!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on sale and it sat on my shelf for a few months.  About 2 months ago I started using it randomly... maybe 2-3 times a week.  4 days ago I realized I had brand new hair growth in the front hairline area that had been thinning.  I&#x27;m now motivated to use this product every single day and combine it with some other products from the same line.  Very surprised and happy about the results just from using it so infrequently.</li>
    <li> I now use the JM scalp line, and have seen a difference in hair loss and body right away. These products really work well.</li>
    <li> Really improved some irritation on my scalp.  Will continue to use this product, and its companion shampoo.</li>
    <li> This helps to detangle my hair and makes it very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for two weeks, do not see any result yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a large head and super-fine straight hair. Most products make my hair flat like a pancake on my scalp. This does not, whether I blow dry or air dry.  I get lots of volume when I blow dry with this, but I usually air dry.  Also, I used to have some &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34; on my scalp and now when I touch my scalp it feels smooth and free of any &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34;.  I also switched shampoo, so that could be a factor.  But overall, I love this spray and hope it is making my thin hair and scalp healthier.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair oil spray, i use it everyday with noticeable hair thickness. Has a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and for my fine hair , it&#x27;s amazing. How can you go wrong with John masters products  but this stuff works  !</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife who continues to claim that her hair is growing back due to using this product.  Hard for me to say if it is just time or for real.  I am posting this for her.</li>
    <li> I might too if I wasn&#x27;t allergic to lavender.  Bought it for the wife since Trader Joes stopped stocking it in-store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good item ^^</li>
    <li> Not only has it helped with hair volume but it actually kept my hair from frizzing when I was in Florida (where it ALWAYS frizzes), which was a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hair growth, since I&#x27;ve also been taking supplements (horsehair, biotin, Biosil, and iron), I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this product or those supplements or the whole combinaton that has resulted in new hair around my hairline.  Whatever reason, I&#x27;m using the combination.  This product does help with volume, though, without drying out your hair.</li>
    <li> Others&#x27; reviews had me hopeful this would help with my angry, flakey scalp (I have seborrheic dermatitis). But, it seems to exacerbate the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with packaging: I love the spray bottle because it&#x27;s easy to use and get the product right where you want it. The dark glass is great because it protects the light sensitive essential oils inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent: it smells amazing! Nice and herbally, not sure how else to describe. The scent lingers for a little bit but not long enough to interfere with any other scented products you may apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I used it every other day (after washing my hair) for about a month. After a few uses I noticed my scalp itching more than it ever has before. The flakiness got worse, and I noticed more hair shed more than usual when brushing and washing. I kept on with the product thinking maybe it was a coincidence, but the itching got so bad I had to stop using and see if it got better. Immediately after I stopped using it, the itching dissipated. So I don&#x27;t know if I was maybe having an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients or something, but this product did the opposite of advertised for me. Maybe it was just too strong for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, based on my experience with this product, I would probably not purchase any other products from John Masters. They&#x27;re too expensive to have them not work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product consistently and unfortunately, have not seen any results. I so wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> I am 23 and have had thinning hair since I was around 13 years old. I have tried so many different natural treatments e.g. coconut oil, aloe vera etc. I  have been using this spray for almost 2 months now and have noticed a small difference already. A lot of the reviews says it takes 3 months plus to see results I will continue using it for the summer and post again if there are or aren&#x27;t better results. I am also taking biotin vitamins and using an organic biotin shampoo and conditioner. I have used all the other products before and all it usually does is help my hair grow longer. However with the spray I am noticing less patchiness and oiliness (my hair is extremely oily). I love how clean it leaves your air smelling and feeling. I have also started to notice a lot less hair loss when I wash it and in general which for me is huge! I usually lose a lot of hair. I have curly hair and my curls are so bouncy and tighter now! I recommend for anyone else who has my hair type to spry only on your scalp and massage. I used to spray it on my hair too but it left my hair with a weird dry texture. Overall I love the spray and the results are slowly but surely showing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference, seems like water.</li>
    <li> I am 23 years old female.I started losing my hair slowly.&lt;br /&gt;My grand mother has less hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 4 months now. I see lots of hair is growing than before.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly reccomend this for ladies.</li>
    <li> Have tried several dermatologist recommended products as well as a variety of other products to assist in reduction of scalp follicle buildup.  This works!!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of John Masters Organics products.  Formulated with the best natural ingredients, including essential oils, these hair and scalp products do only good things for you.  No chemicals.  Nothing that can hurt your skin or hair. I&#x27;ve been using the deep scalp follicle treatment for years, and I keep returning for more whenever I feel my hair/scalp need extra pampering.  This treatment is clear and not at all greasy or oily.  Shake and spray on your scalp while hair is still damp.  Then massage in well, and you&#x27;re done until the next shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product really helped with my hair loss issues. Its like a multi vitamin for you hair. I love that its organic, if your concern is hair re-growth organic and natural is the way to go. It is a bit expensive but a little goes a long way. I spray it generously on my roots and ends after a shower.</li>
    <li> My hair is responding to this product immensely; thicker and fuller by far. I love John Masters products.</li>
    <li> I have given this product 5 stars because after spending $$$$ and time to help with hair loss, I finally found a product that I see results with. It does not have an offensive odor like many I have tried. A little goes a long way too! My dog had surgery months ago leaving her with a 4 inch bald spot. I used it on her and within ONE week her hair is back and thick as before. I will keep using this so that I have healthy thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I was worrying about my hair loss. After the use of this project wtih Rush new bar shampoo, I feel much better!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my new hair dresser sold me on the countless (according to her) reasons why you should use organic products on your hair. According to her, &amp;#34;you could spend every penny you have on organic foods, but if you expose yourself to harmful chemicals through hair products you&#x27;re still unhealthy, you&#x27;re still at serious risk of developing cancer &amp; you can still get FAT.&amp;#34; Sure I didn&#x27;t like her shpeel, but my hair looked so bouncy &amp; voluminous when she was finished with it that I ending up spending $21+ on a 2 oz. bottle of bad smelling (might as well be water) spray that doesn&#x27;t do one damn thing it claims to do. I&#x27;m assuming the look my stylist gave me (that I cannot recreate for the life of me) is not a result  of the products, but because of her magical touch or the fact that she&#x27;s a trained professional. ANYWAYS, to put it bluntly, no I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for about a little over a week but i can already see changes. I have seborrheic dermatitis and i have had way less itching and irritation and definitely less hairfall as well. I have been using it along with the scalp stimulating shampoo, citrus and neroli detangler (i have curly african american hair. 4b if anyone wants to know. The conditioner is really good) and the scalp serum. So far i love it and will definitely be repurchasing</li>
    <li> My mother has been using your product for a year or so.  You could see her scalp from afar because of a thyroid problem.  Now she still has thin hair but its fully grown.  You don&#x27;t see her scalp and she feels great.  She is very constant and very happy about your product!!!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this for some basic seasonal / hormonal hair loss as well as some hair loss after an injury and I&#x27;m amazed to find after a year that it&#x27;s really made quite a difference. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Deep Scalp Follicle Treatment really works.  I use it after I wash my hair, and I can really tell the difference after 2 months (I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle).  Very pleased with the results!  Thanks, John Masters Organics, for a great product!</li>
    <li> After using about 3 bottles of this stuff, I can tell you that it does moisten your scalp and give your existing hair more volume.  That being said I don&#x27;t see any additional hair growth... :(</li>
    <li> Works great to revitalize after a run in with some kind of issue after surgery (that was not on my scalp).&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while, but after a month or so, I&#x27;m seeing results.  This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  It&#x27;s like toner for your hair.  I love the lift I get from t and it calms my scalp so it&#x27;s not itchy.  Doesn&#x27;t make your scalp all gross either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this spray on my hair roots for several month and it works great. Not sticky, has vitamins that feeds my hair and protects from damage, hair grows faster, but it&#x27;s a long term. It&#x27;s not gonna show results in couple of days. This one is like taking vitamin pills, only from outside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m active in several sports, wearing helmets, sweating or the cold of winter, I needed something I could moisture my scalp with but not weigh it down or get my gear full of perfumed smells.  This is amazing!  The side benefit is shiny, fluffed up hair that it noticeable to me and like one reviewer said, scalp itch is reduced.  There&#x27;s nothing worse then having to scratch you head with a helmet on.  Its expensive but worth it to me.  I didn&#x27;t buy this to *grow* hair, but condition my scalp and that has shown good results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ~ 2 months and I am not seeing the results that other reviewers have seen. I really thought that this would work, but different products work for different people. Just keep in mind that what works for one person doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you. Sometimes thinning hair is a result of other factors besides an \\&quot;unhealthy scalp.\\&quot; The one thing it did do was calm the occasional itch I get after washing my hair.</li>
    <li> This product has a positive affect on my hair, causing it to be manageable and stay in place. It&#x27;s supposed to lead to a healthy scalp which, if true, is unrecognized by me.</li>
    <li> Used only about 2 weeks and my other products seem to give me more lift.  Will keep using to see if it promotes Follicle growth.</li>
    <li> First off, let me state that I don&#x27;t have thinning hair. I don&#x27;t think that if you have alopecia or pattern baldness that this will actually do anything for you (sorry!). What this did for me though, is volumize and thicken my straight, limp hair. I spray it at the roots after every shampoo session, massage in and then blow dry. The spray also serves as to moderate scalp conditions such that my scalp is healthier and neither too oily nor dry. One star taken away because it&#x27;s really expensive!</li>
    <li> I am very please with the service and the product~  Its a wonderful product that really is organic and feels great!  My hair loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking if would make my scalp feel differently (healthier?) and because my husband has an itchy scalp. He never noticed any difference in his hair growth. The itchiness did pacify a bit. I felt like I was just spraying water on my scalp. I never noticed a difference in the quality of my scalp (I keep a healthy diet).</li>
    <li> Great product.made my hair shiny and thick.</li>
