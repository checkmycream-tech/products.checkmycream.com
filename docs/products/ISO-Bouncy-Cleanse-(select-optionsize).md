      <li>I purchased the ISO Bouncy Cleanse and the ISO Bouncy Conditioner on Amazon.com on one of my \\&quot;hunts for the perfect shampoo\\&quot; for my thick, shoulder length, curly-wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>I always hesitate to give good reviews after only using a product a limited amount of time, but this shampoo has been exceptional.  </li>
      <li>As most curly heads know, it&#x27;s hard to find a good shampoo</li>

      <li>and it really makes my hair spring up!</li>
      <li>a first for me re:</li>
      <li>I originally had it paired with ISO&#x27;s Color Preserve conditioner and it still enhanced my stubborn curls, but when paired with its intended counterpart both of the Curl Defining products come alive.</li>
      <li>I am African American and this stuff is Great for naturally curly hair.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with hair/skin sensitivities.</li>
      <li>To complete my look though I use Samy mouse and curl creme, which suprisingly because I don&#x27;t really like their shampoo and conditioner for curly hair but the mouse and creme work wonders for my hair, to give it a little more curl too.</li>
      <li>The Iso Bouncy Cleanse shampoo and conditioner is AMAZING for curly hair, at least for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin (break outs from hair/skin products all the time), but I have not reacted from either the shampoo or conditioner......</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and can be used daily if needed.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your hear clean and bouncy not weighted down</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells divine and seems gentle enough to use frequently.</li>
      <li>Keeps the curl soft and yet texture is not limp.  </li>

<li> Pretty disappointed  after reading other reviews I had high hopes.</li>
<li> As with the other products in this line, the fragrance is odd -- though the shampoo is much less chemically fragranced.</li>
<li> My wife had been buying this product from her hair dresser for $17 for less than half the volume of this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I use ALL the Iso products for my curly, frizzy hair.... shampoo, conditioner, bouncy creme...  only things that work to tame my mane!!  </li>
<li> I have thick wavy/ curly hair, and have been receiving a lot of complements since I started using the shampoo and conditioner and allowing my hair to air dry and just do its thing.</li>
<li> It does nothing for my curls, and in fact seems a little drying.  </li>
<li> This is just plain shampoo.</li>
<li> Not sure what hair type this is for</li>
<li> /&gt;We also have hard water.  </li>
<li> This product is hard to find</li>
<li> Another curly product fail.</li>
<li> Sorry I purchased it.  </li>
<li> Smells really bad.  </li>
<li> Either it was a bad batch or ISO has changed the formula.  </li>
<li> disappointed!</li>
<li> The smell is terrible like chemicals and I had to throw it away since it was damaging my hair.</li>

    <li> Works just fine on my darker blond hair that is curly and fine.</li>
    <li> Iso Bouncy Cleanse Curl Defining Shampoo came highly recommended by my hair stylist.  I have color and highlights, and needed something that would cleanse but also protect my hair.  It is very gentle and can be used daily if needed.  The whole family can now use one shampoo and it works well for all of us.</li>
    <li> makes my curly hair feel great, curls controlled, defined and smooth, no frizzies! wish there would have been a pump included. disappointed!</li>
    <li> The Iso Bouncy Cleanse shampoo and conditioner is AMAZING for curly hair, at least for my hair type. For further details of the results of these products, I actually have pretty thin hair but LOTS and LOTS of it. My curl type is an S-curl but if I want to get more ringlets I use this shampoo and conditioner and it really makes my hair spring up! It&#x27;s beautiful! To complete my look though I use Samy mouse and curl creme, which suprisingly because I don&#x27;t really like their shampoo and conditioner for curly hair but the mouse and creme work wonders for my hair, to give it a little more curl too. Love this shampoo and conditioner. Everytime I get it I use it sparingly and only on special occasions lol.</li>

    <li> Is great. Have used before</li>
    <li> Smells really bad.  Would not recommend it even as a pet shampoo.  Sorry I purchased it.  Will not do that again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in search of a great shampoo for curly hair and I really like this product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly, and leaves my hair shiny! I have very sensitive skin (break outs from hair/skin products all the time), but I have not reacted from either the shampoo or conditioner......a first for me re: the conditioner. I highly recommend this product to anyone with hair/skin sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Love it, it does a great job at cleaning but not stripping since I have colored hair. The one problem is that it does not come with a pump had to run to the beauty supply shop to purchase one</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for about 3 years now and I love it!  Keeps the curl soft and yet texture is not limp.  Really like this product.</li>

    <li> The best!  One wash not two!  Great price, excellent quality!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years and ordered from this company several times.  Either it was a bad batch or ISO has changed the formula.  It broke out my scalp.  Had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ISO Bouncy Cleanse and the ISO Bouncy Conditioner on Amazon.com on one of my \\&quot;hunts for the perfect shampoo\\&quot; for my thick, shoulder length, curly-wavy hair.  As most curly heads know, it&#x27;s hard to find a good shampoo and that&#x27;s been my problem, finding a shampoo and conditioner that will cleanse my hair and give it the bounce and shine I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good!  I&#x27;ve been using these products for a bit of time and have noticed my hair feels better and has a shine that I haven&#x27;t seen for a long time. The price on Amazon is a winner as well.  Amazon, please keep selling these ISO products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have hard water.  The ISO seems to clean out the minerals and enable my hair to finally have a shine and manageability for my curly locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the results will continue.  I always hesitate to give good reviews after only using a product a limited amount of time, but this shampoo has been exceptional.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a five star rating and I definitely would recommend this product to my friends, curly or not!</li>
    <li> Love this product and just started using the cleanser. Have ordered my second bottle, this time for colored treated hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is great for moisturizing dry curly hair. it helps shape the curls too. leaves my hair feeling clean but also moisturized.</li>
    <li> Not sure what hair type this is for but I have long ringlet curly hair and it made my curls flat and frizzy which no shampoo has done before. My hair always has ringlet curls even without hair products. I used it for over a week and it dried out my hair completely. The smell is terrible like chemicals and I had to throw it away since it was damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> I am African American and this stuff is Great for naturally curly hair. Don&#x27;t leave home without it!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleansing product. I use a little everyday, and I love that my curls are not frizzy, and fall really well.</li>
    <li> I do not like Sulfate shampoos and this one is...wish they would have listed the ingredients of this shampoo before buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of shampoos to help with frizz for my curling hair.  My hair is fine and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it works great in controlling frizz and defining curls.</li>
    <li> Another product that my wife uses exclusively. Lathers well and rinses out nicly. Leaves hair squeky clean and ready to condition</li>
    <li> My wife had been buying this product from her hair dresser for $17 for less than half the volume of this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair dresser is moving, and she wanted another bottle, so I found this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised.  Buy one, if you use it.</li>
    <li> The item came sealed up and safe in the box. It is a wonderful Shampoo. This product is hard to find so I was thrilled to find it and in such a big size for a great price!</li>
    <li> It actually works! Especially when paired with the conditioner. I originally had it paired with ISO&#x27;s Color Preserve conditioner and it still enhanced my stubborn curls, but when paired with its intended counterpart both of the Curl Defining products come alive. Now I&#x27;ve been using for both years and haven&#x27;t needed to find a replacement product.</li>
