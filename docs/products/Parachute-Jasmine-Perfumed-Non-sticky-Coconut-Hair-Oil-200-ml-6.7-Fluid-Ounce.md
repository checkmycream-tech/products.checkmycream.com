<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Im in love, this product really works. My hair was dry, with flakes.. I tried everything to make my scalp more alive and not dead. Plus my hair use to fall alot when i showered or on random times. Sometimes i&#x27;d go through my hair and i&#x27;d already see strands on hair.. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a couple of days now and i really do see a difference. My hair stopped falling out randomly, and the smell is amazing. I would recomend this because not only does it make your hair look alive, it also helps it with hair loss (for me anyways).</li>
    <li> this smells so wonderful and if it helps my hair to grow which is seems like it&#x27;s working I will keep using it and keep buying it</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair that never wants to cooperate. It took a few tries to get the amount right (a little goes a LONG way. I use 3 small drops), but I now use this oil every time I wash my hair. It smooths my frizz, gets rid of my split ends, and makes my hair manageable without weighing it down. I accidentally used too much once, so I tried curling my hair to make it look better and was amazed at how well it helped hold curls. The amazing scent it just one more thing to love about it.</li>
    <li> i ordered this jasmine scented coconut oil for my hair because laytely the ends of my hair just get dry even after i get a hair cut the next day it&#x27;s dry, and this oil isn&#x27;t helping at all. and it smells really bad it doesn&#x27;t even smell good, i wish i ordered a different coconut oil from amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair oil. it is really light, not too heavy.  The scent of jasmine lasts in my jet black hair all day. My hair is now softer, shinier,thicker, and healthier from using this hair oil. i stopped using other hair products in my hair because this gave me the best results. I am happy that i bought this oil.</li>
    <li> You only need a tiny bit to get your hair looking and feeling soft and healthy! I love it and it smells great!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great,works better,very light, long lasting, non greasy.</li>
    <li> this is more like mineral oil in a bottle. Didnt nourish hair, just left it greasy... and honestly, why would i have a product thats supposedly coconut oil, and change the scent to jasmine. it stinky! i could deal with my house smelling like jasmine, not my hair. YUCK!</li>
    <li> i did not recieve this item. now i am scared to order anything from amazon again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my hair seemed to be thinning and my ends were splitting more rapidly. I found an instructional video on YouTube that provided a method this young lady used to stop her ends from splitting and it worked great! I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I first found this hair oil when I was in India about 6 years ago and I totally loved it. When I got back home I used it after every shower and it made my hair smooth and frizz free. I have curly hair and this stuff acts as a sort of a gel too, it holds my ringlets in place. I ran out of it and was sooo sad :( I kept trying other brands of hair oil only to be disappointed. I finally tracked this stuff down online and had to order it. I am so glad I found it...It smells delightful with the jasmine perfume, keeps the frizz down, and keeps my curls in all day. It also has just a few ingredients so it&#x27;s pretty healthy too, no chemicals!</li>
    <li> My daughter has mix hair  - and reports this is great for overnight conditioning.</li>
    <li> Works really well when flat ironing your hair. It leaves your hair soft, shiny and frizz free for a few days. The scent is also subtle, I was expecting it to be annoyingly sweet but it isn&#x27;t. Overall it&#x27;s a great find and the price is even better.</li>
    <li> i love the scent that enhances the hair which makes it more beautiful. no wonder women in india has beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Pretty heavy but I like it. I use coconut oil in my hair and this actually leaves it a bit greasier but I love it. It smells amazing. Would not recommend for fine hair but if you have curly, thick or dry hair this product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I did like that the product arrived at my house in a timely manner, but I hated the smell once I received it. I may have to add another fragrance to it in order to use it because it made me sick to my stomach. I didn&#x27;t know jasmine smelled so strong. It seems to be a good oil but I just can&#x27;t seem to get past the smell. Other people may like the smell of jasmine but I guess I don&#x27;t although I thought I would.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the scent of this item, but I was disappointed with the ingredients. Since I prefer pure ingredients over chemically altered ones, I will not purchase this product again. As I have use pure coconut oil in the past, I will coninue to do that.</li>
    <li> This is my first time reviewing a product on amazon. I have long, chemically colored (red) hair. I use this oil to tame frizzies, to protect from heat damage, and to treat my ends. Its freezing cold here where I am right now, so when the product arrived it was solid. I put the bottle in lukewarm water for a minute and it became a liquid again.     It smells lovely, and scent lasts for a while. I dont see how they are making any money on this stuff because Although I use it everyday, I only need like, 3 droplets to have shiny, nice smelling hair. Long hair community forums does not recommend it because of the mineral oil, but as a long haired girl, I say try it, and see how your hair responds. My hair loves it. Oh, and I also have a smaller bottle of a redken brand hair oil, which smells like chemicals, and does the same job, for more money. So yeah, jasmine hair oil rocks.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle a long time ago actually, and its still lasted me. I have thick wavy/curly hair down to the middle of my back and always use the oil after my usual washing/conditioning. I usually part my hair first, then apply the oil evenly to each side and comb through with a detangling comb to distribute. I never heat dry my hair, so I can&#x27;t attest to how the oil reacts to heated styling. All I do to it after applying is secure my hair in a few loose buns until dry and I have beautifully defined locks. I can say that my hair is definitely healthier than its ever been, its softer and seemed to grow faster after my last haircut than usual. Not sure if its meant to do that. The oil accentuates my natural curls without the tacky feeling and alcoholic smell of other products.</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair soft and manageable !!! I just cant wait to see it grow longer. I heard it make hair grow, and it smells nice. My hair does not feel grease at all, which surprises me..</li>
    <li> I love this hair oil. I have naturally curly hair, but as I am getting older, it has been getting more frizzy than curly. A close friend told me 3 important steps for perfect curly hair:  1. Never use a terry cloth towel. Use a clean tee shirt to dry your hair.  2. Do not comb out your hair after you shampoo, just scrunch.  3. Use a good hair oil on damp hair.  So, I followed her advice, and this is the hair oil I chose. It is WONDERFUL! You use very very little. Just a few drops rubbed between your palms and then applied through your hair, from bottom upwards, and more on the under layers than the top layers.  My hair now looks great! Just like it did when I was 20! And a tiny whiff of the smell lingers, just enough - not heavy or cloying.   I actually use this hair oil on my skin as well - just a drop. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I actually love putting this in my hair during the shower.  Then I rinse it out and it makes my hair feel and look great the rest of the day!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing!!!!! A little goes a long way. I use it whle my hair is still damp and the oil helps to soften it as it dries. I usually have extremely frizzy hair and it helps to tame the frizzies and flyaways. I will be purchasing more!!!</li>
    <li> My summer hair potion that is great for that suntanned day. I use it on my hair before a braid and swimming.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it was described as \\&quot;Fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot; on behalf of a third party.  I contacted Amazon to ask for the ingredients list because it was not mentioned at all in the website.  The representative was great and contacted the company called Simply Beautiful but no one responded to his call.  When I received the product, the ingredients listed on the bottle are as follows:  Mineral oil, Coconut oil, Isopropyl Myristate, Perfume Benzophenone-3.  I took off 2 stars because of the hurdles one has to go through to obtain an ingredients list and the time one has to set aside to ask for a refund.  The jasmine perfume is near identical to smelling live jasmine flowers.  Coconut oil is great for hair care.  Unfortunately, mineral oil receives a thumbs down in the long hair community forums.  If you do not care about the presence of mineral oil in this product, then you will probably enjoy using this.</li>
    <li> I bought this as i wanted something to add shine and nourishment to my hair, and after reading the good reviews on this, i was very estactic to give it a try.     I had to wait over two weeks for this to arrive and when i got in touch with the seller, they said they had already sent it out and i recieved a new one within another couple of days. That was the first irritation with it.   BUUUUt, back to the product....    I have hair that nearly touches my back. It is very thick and there is a lot of it. It is also on the dry side with normal roots/scalp. So basically just the ends...    I washed my hair as normal and whilst wet ( i follwed the instructions), i added 2very, VERY tiny drops to my palms and worked it through my hair.   It felt like there was nothing on my hair,, but i resisted the urge to add more and went ahead and started to dry.   Straight away i noticed that my hair looked greasy. It felt wirey and looked really greasy and not healthy.  Ive not used it since as i was too scared to see what i t would do to my hair!</li>
    <li> I order this bottle and the first thing I did was smell it and I love the smell. This product is really for having your hair a clean or fresh scent. It is not any kind of hair care treatment only because its 79% mineral oil and only 20% coconut oil. How I use is by mixing it with moisturizer because if you use it by itself it feel like you are putting water on your hair, it has no real affect, it don&#x27;t make your hair feel soft or moisturized. The shipping was good and package well. Will I but this again probably not or unless I want some hair perfume but, then again I could just by real peppermint oil for that with real great affects to my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, great for moisturizing your hair. A little greasy though. A little goes a long way. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing, the effects on your hair are amazing, and the packaging is cute and won&#x27;t let the oil leak out. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the fact it said scented . It smells wonderful . Its a very flowery smell that makes your hair smell so delicate and yes if you get a hug people comment . Its not strong, so they will notice very close only. It is great for flyaways / frizz.I put it on my hair after it is dry but you can use right after shower. I have very long hair (right past mid back) and it only takes 5 drops for me , so this bottle is gonna last me all year . For the price, it cannot be beat . I will buy again if I ever run out that is &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I am African American and I used this stuff on my hair and I seen my hair grow dramatically! its not really oily and the smell is great I will be purchasing againg soon</li>
    <li> Everything it says and more! I love this product may hair smells amazing and it has grown a lot :) also I have curly hair and it keeps my hair moisturized and feeling good.</li>
    <li> Been using Parachute Coconut Hair Oil since I was born (legacy of an Indian mother) to keep my hair moisturized.  I thought I&#x27;d try this one for the scent  and lightness so i could use it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty and floral but not jasmine.  The consistency is good to tame flyaways and moisturize your ends during the day, but be careful as a little goes a long way.  However, for a deep treatment, I&#x27;d stick with the original</li>
    <li> I love this product, will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Dont like the jasmine smell.</li>
    <li> Its an ok hair oil, but the problem is that it is not pure coconut oil. The label reads 79% mineral oil with remainder is coconut oil. So I think it&#x27;s deceptive.</li>
    <li> This hair oil smells absolutely divine! I love to put this oil in my hair prior to washing it in order to give a nice shot of moisture to my dyed wavy hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff truly makes your hair feel stronger and healthier! I put it in my hair every night before bed and then I put it in a tight braid. Wash it out int he mornings and tada!!!</li>
    <li> Before I begin using this product my hair was dry and brittle. Just wouldn&#x27;t grow, since I have been using it my hair has grown a full 2 inches. I love this, I would recommend this product to anyone who has damaged hair from coloring, or to much styling.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but makes my hair feel hard!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, untangles hair.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair oil from Herbal Seller USA and they did a great job in replacing the product when it didnt originally come. The oil is very light, in comparasion to a Coconut oil such as Vatika Coconut Oil. IT is not sticky at all and is more like Dabur&#x27;s Amla Jasmine Hair Oil but it has a better fragrance and it is a lot lighter. It is something you could use a tiny bit of (less then the size of a button) before and then use styling products and it doesnt make my long, black hair oily looking at all. Plus the smell is great, I like it a little better then Dabur Amla Jasmine Hair Oil&#x27;s scent. There is a bit of separation in my bottle--you can see the coconut flakes of solid oil, but that is something I do not mind as a Vatika Coconut Oil user which is just straight coconut oil, very heavy, and a bit solid in the winter where I live (utah.) I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship between my hair and Parachute Jasmine Non-Sticky Coconut Hair oil. I love this stuff after just 1 application.It doesnt even make my hands all greasy like all my other hair oils!! (Dabur Amla, Dabur Amla Gold, Dabur Amla Jasmine, &amp; Vatika coconut Hair oils...) I&#x27;ve stopped using most my hair products--such as mousse, hair spray, and gel and now just use mostly hair oil each day. I use a tiny bit on my son&#x27;s knee length hair (we are native american..) and then some gel in a low ponytail, braided. Both of our hair is a lot better and healthier. Whatever LONG HAIR COMMUNITIES SAY about mineral oils and such---I think that it might be most Anglo(white ppl&#x27;s) hair that doesnt tolerate it well because my knee length hair has no probs with mineral oils and I think the chicks in India, where these hair oils come from dont have much complaint either..I think you should try it out if you are a person of color first before you listen to the other reviews/complaints...you just might like it ;)</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the scent of this product.  I generally never wear perfume unless I&#x27;m going out.  Applying a drop of this in your hair gives you a fresh flowery scent for every day.  This product does contain some chemicals and mineral oils though, so for those of you who are looking for something totally natural, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Ok, this hair oil will do what it say. It will make your hair soft and shine. My hair texture is course, because i dont perm my hair, i been natrual for some years now, so i wanted something that could giving me that softness shine and waves, and this does that for me when i twist my hair or cornroll it. Great product great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. One bottle lasts months, maybe it even lasted a year. It only takes three to four drops for my hair; I have hair down almost to the middle of my back. Rub it around the palm of your hand and start at the ends (spreads easier when you&#x27;re hair is a little damp). Then what&#x27;s left after applying to the ends, you put on the rest. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat at all. It actually makes the frizzies and baby hairs blend with the rest of your hair while still managing to keep your normal body and bounce. BUT...it does make your hair softer, silkier, and shinier than normal so if you don&#x27;t like soft, silky, shiny hair, don&#x27;t use it. If you do like soft, silky, shiny hair, get it! It&#x27;s worth it. Remember, only a few drops! OH...and if you get the Jasmine Perfumed one, ooooo-la-la! It smells soooooooooooooooo pretty and the scent lasts a long time!! Of course if you go into a smoke filled room it vanishes but in a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; environment, it lasts.</li>
    <li> Great product for jasmine oil hair treatments. I do notice my hair shinier and silky as well. Continued use is best for results. Get this product for unhealthy manes!!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel soft and shiny  I will use the whole bottle but when I read the ingredients I found it to have coconut oil and second ingredient and mineral oil first ingredient which I don&#x27;t care for the jasmine was just added for smell I can make this myself and save my money.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy sort of frizzy hair. Its hard sometimes to find something that works for my hair type. I applied this oil to my hair tied it up in a bun and went to sleep. The next day i washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never looked shinier or felt as soft as it did. I will definitely use again and recommend to friends. I seen a video on youtube where a girl shows you how to apply and use the oil for hair growth softness and shine. Very useful.</li>
    <li> Very light weight and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Smells so good.  And makes my hair incredibly soft the next day.  Love it.  The lid on my bottle broke, so I cannot close it all the way anymore.  Just be gentle when closing it!</li>
    <li> Not a spectacular product. It&#x27;s more of an oil than perfume, which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love it! It smells amazing and the hair growth is great!</li>
    <li> I received this product in May 2015, and the expiration date says 1/14. I only discovered it this week when I decided to pull some stickers off the back to look at the ingredients. Not cool.</li>
    <li> been using it for a while now.. It is not too sticky or weightdown your hair. Just right for me</li>
    <li> Smells beautifully however my hair felt extremely dry after use.</li>
    <li> This smells beautiful. I have tried it and I must say my hair is super soft.</li>
    <li> Received this item yesterday.......I must have received a bootleg version of the product. There are misspelled words on the bottle. And the reviews are raving about how wonderful the smell is......mine doesn&#x27;t smell all that great like the reviews suggest....all in all I&#x27;m a little pissed - will not buy from the seller again or the product the ingredients are almost 80% mineral oil.......NEXT!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful I love using it helps alot I will be buying again soon as soon as this bottle is done :-)..</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the stuff!  Use it right out of the shower all over bod and hair.. No alcohol to dry out skin or hair as the expensive salon formulas do. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> This hair oil is pretty good, though, i am not a fan of ANY mineral oil for my hair.  It is ok to use just for what is says it is for: glossing of the hair.  It was not greasy, just as it stated.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have completely damaged hair and I use the coconit oil every night before sleeping and I wash my hair next day morning and find it very soft .</li>
    <li> Love the non sticky, non greasy feeling. this also has a good fragrance of jasmine. I would definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> this was my first experience with &amp;#34;hair oils&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect,but so far I am pleased with this product-I saturated my hair and let it &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; for about an hour then I washed hair as normal and my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy or sticky at all--and the smell is a bonus!</li>
    <li> I first purchased Jasmine hair oil in a market in Roper, Punjabi, India. I love it! I was running low and was thrilled to find it on line. My hair is greying and after years of coloring I&#x27;ve decided to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. My hair is very dry and fly away and this oil makes it manageable and smells yummy. I don&#x27;t care for heavy scents or perfumes, this is subtle. Still want to return to India, but now I can have nice hair here in the states!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I apply it to my hair at night along with my Pantene Pro-V Overnight Miracle Repair Serum. The two work great together .. I wake up in the morning with soft beautiful hair. Smells great and does not weigh your hair down, which I absolutely love !!! I am a sucker for weightless hair products !! Will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Went searching for coconut oil and this had good reviews so I gave it a shot -- I didn&#x27;t realize until later that I was supposed to buy an emulsified oil and not a liquid one. That said, I have long curly hair, and this product MAKES IT QUITE SOFT! I love that. I feel like it hydrates my hair and helps a bit in preventing tangles. I probably use about 20 drops for my hair after I&#x27;ve already put in Suave&#x27;s Captivating Curls Mousse (if you have curly hair, the mousse is a MUST BUY). I&#x27;ve used it on its own without the mousse as well and it works decently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also poured the oil onto my legs and arms, it makes me feel so smooth! I have also used it in a 1:2 ratio of oil:salt as a facial cleanser/exfoliator and it&#x27;s surprisingly not bad (which for me is saying a lot). Next time I will buy an emulsified oil but in the meantime, I am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for: curly hair, long hair, dehydrated hair, aid as a detangling agent, rough or dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for: oily hair</li>
    <li> Did not get intended results, but still had many uses</li>
    <li> didnt like it leaves hair very oily even with a finger amount.</li>
    <li> FIrst off, the shipping. WOW, fastest ever. I received this in 2 days after ordering. It was packaged well, no damage or leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very generous, it&#x27;s a LARGE bottle. if you are used to hair oils such as Biosilk, you will be amazed at the size of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is the best thing about it! Jasmine. Hello! My favorite floral scent, so I was extra excited to get this.  Also, it smells just like the flower...it&#x27;s not overpowering as you might think it would be. It&#x27;s gentle and lasting, but not beat you over the head with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is thin. It works best when you use it on damp or wet hair and remember, one drop!  It&#x27;s always easier to add more if you need it, but if you overdo, as with any hair oil, watch out. You will have a very greasy gross looking head of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid less than $4 for this INCLUDING shipping. I mean, what&#x27;s not to love?! Well, that it is a bit TOO greasy for my fine hair. I use it now to condition my cuticles and things like that....Will last a LONG LONG while at this rate.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this oil over a year ago hoping coconut oil would be a cheaper and more natural alternative to serums (like Biosilk etc) but I actually can&#x27;t stand coconut(taste/smell) so I chose this Jasmine scented oil. Well it didn&#x27;t work--not for me anyway--I only used it a short time at first because I have very fine wavy hair and when I applied it to wet or dry hair it automatically made my hair look dirty. Fast-forward to recent times--my hair has grown several inches and while I&#x27;ve conceded to the fact that my waves will always need expensive lightweight serums for control and shape, I have a new problem: my hair has grown long enough that my hair&#x27;s natural oils no longer reach all the way to the tips and the ends are constantly dry no matter how much brush or conditioner I apply--major split ends, my hair stopped growing.  So I started applying this oil just to the ends--that super dry hair sucks it right up within seconds doesn&#x27;t leave it oily--appears to have less split ends and is growing again.  Best of all of all it only takes a couple of drops to cover all my ends and it is inexpensive enough for me to cover my ends as many times a day as I want to.  So it turns out it works for me...just not how I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I like the feel on my hair, every time you put it on,. I recommend it to anyone who has curly hair to try it because ti works wonders</li>
    <li> Light &amp; great smell. Small amounts can be used daily</li>
    <li> 20% coconut oil.  The smell is horrible.  Definitely not what I expected!  Won&#x27;t be putting this on my curls...yuck!  Enough said</li>
    <li> The product it self works well but when it arrived some of the oil had leaked all over the box. It was not packaged well at all!</li>
    <li> So I only used it one time as a co wash for my hair so far but I will deff use again! ..it made my hair not get that straw feeling after my poo ..I will deff recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. my hair texture is like the typical Hispanic type curly hair if this helps ! ..</li>
    <li> Smell great but not what I expected I wish it Was more moisturizing. But I will mix it with something else.</li>
    <li> This is a VERY popular name brand hair oil in India and in the Middle East in general not only because of its very delightful Jasmine smell but also for its qualities/benefits for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this oil during my first visit to India and unfortunately even though it was so dirt cheap there I didn&#x27;t experiment with it. I could have easily gotten away with the grease hair look over there because people are not judgmental but that really would not blend in as nicely back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bought this even though I read other reviews mentioning the same thing that I am about to complain about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil will basically not wash off your hair with almost anything you use and because of that your hair ends up looking and feeling like you&#x27;ve put olive oil and left it in for a few days. This continues for almost a week even if you soap and wash on a daily basis....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YUK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically if you want to look and feel like a salad but yet smell like Jasmine definitely try this oil if not I would recommend to stay away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long naturally straight brown hair and my experience was not pleasant to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not buy this again or recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for oil to soften my tough grays this product is easy to use and has no sticky residue. Good for the nails and a skin softener.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter&#x27;s coarse/curly hair.  I do not use this product every day.  I use it primarily after washing.  Works good so far.</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful smell and not to heavy on the hair.  It helps hold down the fly aways and is easy to shampoo out.</li>
    <li> I got expired product and ironically it has INR price tag, ....very bad</li>
    <li> A very nice oil and I enjoy having an oil that has a wonderful scent!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this project four days ago, but so far I am enjoying the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> Was not thick and sticky</li>
    <li> I bought this as i wanted something to add shine and nourishment to my hair, and after reading the good reviews on this, i was very excited to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package and all I see it&#x27;s a bottle full of water that&#x27;s not oil. Too watery .I&#x27;m really angry I paid $8.50 for trash.&lt;br /&gt;I only put one star cause it&#x27;s required</li>
    <li> Shortly after giving birth to my third child my hair started to shed like crazy! Everytime I would comb or run my fingers through my hair it would come out in globs! It honestly looked like something out of a horror film! I looked up every possible remedy to stop post partum hair shedding and I came across the same results every time &amp;#34;it&#x27;s inevitable to stop it and it takes up to 6 months to a year to stop its on.&amp;#34; I finally came across a YouTube video tutorial that showed how Indian women grow their hair and it suggested using this oil....long story short I purchased this oil and within 2 days it literally decreased my hair shedding by at least 75%! There was still some shedding but no where near as much as the handfuls I had been experiencing for months! It also makes your hair really soft and shiny...I love it!</li>
    <li> I got it from amazon, good price, excellent  quality. I love it. Can be used as a body Iola&#x27;s well.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good and really helps to moisturize your hair. I feel like it is doing what it should! Also, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I put oil in my hair it smelled great, but it actually dried out and broke my hair off two inches. I had to go to the salon and get it cut a bit to get the dead/ fried ends off. It was the mineral oil in it the hairdresser said. I  will not be using this product again. (still my hair is damaged, it was healthy before I put this in my hair. Buyers be careful). 1/5</li>
    <li> Oil is sticky and smell is not great. Have been using it often but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement</li>
    <li> This product is very good,it smells really good and very light non greasy and I also notice my hair growing much faster!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful really nice smell to it</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this is the smell.  Read the ingredients before buying!  It is not all-natural, very little coconut oil in it.  Did not moisturize and made my hair fall out.  I gave the 2 bottles away.  There are much better products available.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent my boyfriend&#x27;s loves it and doesn&#x27;t know I put this on. Plus irs great for braiding.</li>
