    <li> I have used the stimulating conditioner for several years, and I love it. Not only does it make my scalp feel good, but keeps my hair from getting dried out.</li>
    <li> Good product. I use it everyday for a while now (over a year I guess). A little bit pricey, but smell good (minty) and does a good job at conditioning my hair. Overall a good product.  I purchase it through subscription, and renew it when I&#x27;m getting low, for a better deal.</li>
    <li> Does excellent job of conditioning.  Leaves hair light and manageable.  Particularly enjoy the light and stimulating effect on my scalp during and after treatment.</li>
    <li> Drug store conditioner is not only not as good, but it costs MORE in the long run. The high price tag here is offset by the fact you don&#x27;t have to use much to get results you&#x27;ll never get with product you buy in the drug store. The tingle on the scalp, though not helpful in the long run, was pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have used Crew products for a few years.  The bottles(2pack) the conditioner came in looks used to me.  After opening, it doesn&#x27;t smell like Crew conditioner.  I&#x27;m not positive because I haven&#x27;t taken it home to use it yet, but be cautious w/ this item!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for someone else.  I have never used it, nor do I think I need to.  I use Head and Shoulders or what ever shampoo is recommended for silver hair.  The person I bought it for LOVES it, but what do I know?</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this conditioner.  It has a nice scent and is tingly on his scalp.  He was pleased that he could buy it in this larger size.</li>
    <li> A friend that works at a hair salon gave me a bottle of this to try.    Coming from a position of being a frequent lap swimmer, racking up several miles each week, I have to deal with chlorine and frequent showers.  My first impression is that I liked this conditioner very much. It works well without making my hair smell like highly concentrated Apple Jolly Rancher or the perfume department at Macy&#x27;s. I would probably rate it 4 stars at best, with the list of ingredients causing me concern. I am seeking something more natural than this.    But then there&#x27;s the darn packaging.    Compared to the other dozen or so bottled products in my shower, these bottles are difficult to grip when wet. They just plain get slippery. So I dropped it in the shower. Imagine that. Also, the genius that designed the packaging used a material that shatters when dropped. So now I have a bottle of half-decent conditioner with a quarter sized hole in the bottom. A hole that appeared after I dropped the bottle only once.    It is difficult for me to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It does not pull out my air and makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> The price of $18.99 for two bottles of this stuff is awesome!  The conditioner feels and smells amazing.  It leaves my hair feeling good for the ladies as well.</li>
    <li> Product was received in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected. Well pleased.</li>
    <li> This is for you if: you want a salon quality conditioner that gives your hair a soft and smooth feeling, has a subtle minty scent, and leaves your scalp feeling cool and reinvigorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of the shampoo ([[ASIN:B000GG0NT6 American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle, Package may vary]]) and conditioner is amazing. The shampoo cleans your hair without leaving it feeling dried out and damaged. The conditioner give it a nice soft feeling without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minty smell is quite subtle and not overpowering like some fruity conditioners. It&#x27;s subtle and just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The menthol in the conditioner not only gives your hair a great smell, it leaves your scalp with a nice gentle tingle. It&#x27;s quite refreshing, especially on hot summer days. Yes, it cost a bit more than the generic hair products at your grocery store, but it&#x27;s worth it. You get clean, soft hair with a fresh smell and a nice feel on your scalp.</li>
    <li> good product.  difficult to find locally anymore</li>
    <li> This conditioner works very well and really stimulates and moisturizes.  The menthol in the product \\&quot;wakes up\\&quot; the hair folicles and the feeling after rinsing is very good.</li>
    <li> This Crew product is touted for being &amp;#34;Stimulating&amp;#34;.  It does tingle, but it will does not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.  I prefer a little less tingle than a little more.  What is great is that it conditions my fine hair well in addition to all the stimulation.</li>
    <li> Not positive this is actual CREW product.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for years and has no problem with build up on his scalp. Other products have done that.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Does not feel right.. I have had cheaper conditioners with better results for sure. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> Started using this a few years ago.  Really like how my hair feels with it.  Feels better than using other more generic hair products, I can really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I never realized the full potential of my hair until I stopped buying the cheap crap at the store and started using this.  Much cheaper through amazon than at the big box stores.</li>
