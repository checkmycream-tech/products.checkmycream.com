<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product, excellent, fast delivery</li>
    <li> If you like tingle this is the lotion for you!!!!! I am a loyal Swedish Beauty customer and they have yet to let me down!</li>
    <li> Very itchy skin for about an hour after tanning.  I would recommend for dedicated tingle users.</li>
    <li> I currently own THREE bottles of this stuff so I don&#x27;t run out! I don&#x27;t recommend it for beginners or those who are fair skinned at the time of use. It works well and has a great smell! It has a low tingle factor that will make you itch and feel like you got burnt. The redness will fade and the itchiness will as well in about 2 hours. Once the redness or \\&quot;pinkness\\&quot;, if you will, fades, you&#x27;re left with a beautiful dark tan! Pink Diamonds is the best when you&#x27;ve reached that \\&quot;Tanning Plateau\\&quot; and can&#x27;t seem to get any darker. You&#x27;ll be amazed and thrilled with the color you receive!</li>
    <li> Ok, I used this product as directed, 20 minutes in a low level bed. I am an experienced tanner, never used a tingle until I tried this. Let&#x27;s just say, this product DID NOT work for me. To describe my experience in the best way possible, it felt as though I had soaked my entire body in Nair and then sat in an oven for about 10 hours. I was red as a lobster, not in a &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; way, but more of a severe chemical burn way... Will never use it again, maybe I&#x27;m allergic to it. But it was very uncomfortable for a few hours. It&#x27;s just weird, didn&#x27;t make me any darker either.</li>
    <li> Such a perfect lotion. Authentic! Very affordable. Smells fantastic! A mild tingle. And best of all the color of the lotion has just the right amount of bronzer so if you happen to miss a spot you wont have tiger stripes :) I have purchased this 4 times now. It is a staple in my tanning lotion collections. I make sure to never run out! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.  I did not like the tingle.  I got all red from it like I was sunburn, but I did not really get tan from it.  I threw it away because I just could not stand using it anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It used to burn REALLY bad and I would get super lobster red! But then I started tanning more, n I love this stuff! N it smells super good! I will always use this!!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning in a tanning bed for about a month and a half. I bought this thinking it was a pretty good lotion..Yesterday was my first time using a tingle lotion. The tingle wasn&#x27;t bad, the itching is kinda irritating tho. But when I got out of the tannign bed I automatically started peeling all over. Which I don&#x27;t understand why because I keep my skin moisturized all the time..so now I am pretty much starting over with my tan. Because I peeled so bad..And I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin either. No reddening..Maybe first time fluke?</li>
    <li> Im rating this 4 stars simply because the tingle isnt quite as strong as what I was hoping for but the scent of this lotion even hours after tanning is fantastic! Ive never used a lotion that I didnt have to shower withn an hour of tanning to avoid the self-tanning smell. This would definitely be great for someone who is wanting a little warm up or who hasnt used a tingle lotion before.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for a nice price! Pink Diamond Tingle Tanning Lotion instantly tans the skin leaving a sun kissed look without staying in the sun all day! The tan stays for 1-2 days. If you use this regularly with a bronzer the results are fabulous. The only downside about this purchase was the wait. Took longer than expected to receive by mail.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the tingle. It makes my skin SUPER red for 4-5 hours after use. Didn&#x27;t help me get very dark either.</li>
    <li> This product has just the right tingle to it! If smells nice, will leave you slightly red and warmed bodied for about 45 mins to an hour after tanning but it is really not a serious intense tingle Or burn whatsoever. Just don&#x27;t touch your face with this stuff if you have super sensitive skin. I love using products like this One specifically for this time of the season because the weather is chili!!</li>
    <li> i loved this lotion when i first got it. gave me a boost when i needed it. but i stopped laying for a couple of months, then started again and i used that lotion but it didn&#x27;t tingle like it use too ! and i had half a bottle left and i had to throw it away !! i won&#x27;t buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion EVER. My skin is very hard to tan, and usually loses the tan w/in a day... but when I use this product in the tanning bed, my skin tans nicely AND doesn&#x27;t fade away after a day. This is the only stuff I will use.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for an amazing bronzer! A friend of mine suggested it to me after I accomplished my base tan. I&#x27;m naturally very pale and can&#x27;t use a very strong tingler because of my sensitive skin. I wish I would have been warned to only use  this product for a few minutes in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a VERY dark, beautiful tan - after I was in the bed for my usual 11 minutes. I wish I would have only been in the bed with this product on for five minutes because I was very red with welts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But eventually the tingle stopped my skin from raising and I had a beautiful, dark tan that lasted for days. Five stars for this product --- just don&#x27;t stay in the tanning bed for your usual time! Take it slowly at first.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and we love this product</li>
    <li> i just used this lotion today after using the designer skin lotions for a few weeks.. i used  the obsidian lotion which was so much more expensive and did nothing for me. i have fair skin and i tan but not that deep dark rich jersey shore bronze we all want.. but ater using this lotion.. holy crap.. INSTANTLY i am darker and can seriously notice a tan.. even on my legs!!! which never tan.. $20 for an awsome tan lotion.. so worth it! screw the higher priced lotions which do nothing for you.. i am a big baby.. and i get nervous about the tinglyness.. this was nothing. a very SLIGHT SLIGHT tingle.. almost non exsistant.. but the tinglers make u darker! buy this lotion! its soooo worth it</li>
    <li> Pink Diamond is an excellent tanning lotion. Use caution when using it because it contains tingle! This will leave you blotchy and red after tanning. It goes away within hours. Pink Diamond gave me an incredible tan with only four 12 minute sessions. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Oldie but goodie. Love love love this stuff. Been using it for years! I switch on and off with a bronzer. But this stuff I have always... Seen amazing results. I&#x27;m dark and loving it.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I really liked about this lotion is the scent. Even if you are an \\&quot;experienced\\&quot; tanner, this lotion will make you itch like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. The only benefit of a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; or \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; product, in my opinion, is that you&#x27;ll look extremely dark as soon as you get out of the tanning bed. However, the tan will quickly fade and you will be left with marks from itching so much during your session. If you are trying to achieve a bronzed, \\&quot;beach tan\\&quot; look, I would recommend purchasing a bronzing lotion (which doesn&#x27;t itch or burn) rather than a tingling lotion. After using this product religiously solely because of it&#x27;s wonderful scent, I realized that it isn&#x27;t worth the irritation you&#x27;ll experience while in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion was not for me. It seems okay but would turn my skin bright red, burnt looking right after tanning. After a few hours this would fade and I would not be red anymore but during the few hours, my skin was VERY irritated and uncomfortable. This lotion may be better for someone that likes the tingle hot sizzle. It just didn&#x27;t react with my skin very well.</li>
    <li> The pink bottle threw me off at first, but this product works great for men.  I loved the smell and it was very easy to apply.  I did have a LOT of redness and tingling sensations at first, but after a few weeks I used less and less and the redness and burning sensations started to fade away to nothing.  Going a few times a week tanning and adding this to it has really changed the feelings and look of my skin in a positive way.  Don&#x27;t feel less macho with the pink bottle, it works great!</li>
    <li> I am really liking my new tanning lotion. It has a medium tingle and does turn your skin red for about an hour or so . I didn&#x27;t really notice a bronze color or anything after the redness went away but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. So far so good. I will continue to use this tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff smells sooo good and My tan just after two 15 min sessions is really dark not orange but bronze. Skin feels soft too. As for firming I&#x27;ve but recently been taking the time to really rub it into my inner thighs  and abs so  time will tell. I will be getting this     [...]    again. This seller sent me a free sample pack of sexy sizzle and that gave me a real boost as well. I don&#x27;t have to go tan every day now and Im still really dark. The tingle is mild for me and the results are fabulouse. This product is well worth the money. Good Day All.</li>
    <li> Was pretty impressed. Product does everything it claims to. I&#x27;ve tried many others that make promises they can&#x27;t deliver. Will definately reorder!</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Swedish Beauty tanning lotions, I used to use the Sinful lotion daily for years.  I stopped tanning for a couple of years and then started back when I got my own bed.  I bought this one, hoping it was close to Sinful, since they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  I have to say it&#x27;s awesome.  It is a tingle, so if you don&#x27;t like tingle lotions or you have never tried one, build up to this level before you try it or you will hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It offers a nice smell, not a burnt after smell and it&#x27;s not greasy.  I like that it gives you a bronzer in it as well, and it&#x27;s not an &#x27;orange&#x27; look either.  It didn&#x27;t take long to build up a tan with this one and I would recommend it to anyone that loves tingle lotions and is a fan of Swedish Beauty lotions.</li>
    <li> Having never used a tingle lotion before, I decided to give this one a try.  The tingle was a bit uncomfortable on my legs the first time I used it but nothing that wasn&#x27;t tolerable. The tingle pretty much disappeared after using it for 3 consecutive days.  However, I would NOT recommend using this on your face.  I ran my hands over my face after applying the lotion to my body....HUGE mistake!  My face felt like it was on fire.    This is a decent product if you tan easily, which I do from the waist up.  It gave me nice color without having a base tan.  My legs are next to impossible to tan so it did absolutely nothing for them, even after using it 5x/week for 2 consecutive weeks.  I eventually switched to Supre Torch Tingle Bronzer 6x which deepened my existing color and beautifully tanned my legs, which now look gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This lotion is by far the best smelling that ive tryed. fruit punch love it. the tingle isnt bad at all. im definitly red after i tan for a few hours. but it goes away n the tan is great.</li>
    <li> Amazingggg I got dark instantly &amp; the tingling is not too strong love it !! U switch between this and anOther tanning lotion</li>
    <li> The tingle isn&#x27;t too strong after you use it for a while, which I liked. However, the smell lingers on EVERYTHING! Your clothes will smell like this lotion (which has an extremely strong scent) until you wash them. Don&#x27;t even think of sitting down on your bed or couch with this lotion still on, because the fabric will absorb it and the smell NEVER leaves. It works well, but the smell is something I can&#x27;t get over.</li>
    <li> i was nervous about using a tingle lotion, when i read that this was a mild tingle i thought i would give it a try. i was having a hard time tanning my chest and neck and heard that tingle lotions were the best. im so glad i tried it, the tingle was very mild, it was a nice warm feeling and it made a huge difference after just one use! i think i might just make this my main lotion. it also has a plesant scent that is not over powering. i think if you have skin that isnt very sensitive it will work well for you.</li>
    <li> Great product for a professional tanner</li>
    <li> Great speedy shipment. I recommend this product for those that prefer the slight tingle. Good bronzer without too much heat.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this, he says it is the best lotion for the price paid. There you go! It&#x27;s only around $20.00 here so don&#x27;t waste your money buying it at suntancity or something.</li>
    <li> This, for me, was just okay. Can&#x27;t say I got any kind of HOT SIZZLE from it at all. I will NOT buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love own this lotion smells and how moisturizing it is. The tingle is not to strong but you can feel it. I have turned a nice shade of brown and no orange tones with this. I bought this lotion through solarium it is authentic and will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> not great ... compared to Australian gold products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an experience with tingle lotion before. I bought this product because it had good reviews on it and was fairly priced and wanted to try out the tingle kind. I&#x27;ve been tanning frequently for many years so I am very familiar with all other types of lotions. Just never tried the tingle before. I used it for the first time last night. When I first put it on and got in the tanning bed, I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling at all and thought, dang, guess it doesn&#x27;t work on me. And then when I got out of the bed, it hit me. It was like ants crawling on me, then it was a hot burning, warm sensation for like an hour. It wasn&#x27;t really unpleasant, it was just different. It may be strange to some people but, I thought it was kinda cool. It turned my skin red for a bit, likely because i&#x27;ve never used the product before. I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll get used to it. I plan to continue using the product. Haven&#x27;t decided yet if its made me much darker but, again, ive only used it once. I like to switch up my lotions anyway so I can continue to get a tan.</li>
    <li> Great for my legs....tingles a lot but works!!</li>
    <li> I have always been more than satisfied with Swedish Beauty&#x27;s line of indoor tanning lotions, but I must admit that this is one of my favorites. My skin looks and feels like silk after tanning with Pink Diamond. It also has the perfect amount of bronzer...no orange looking streaks. This is a must-have for other indoor tanning lovers.</li>
    <li> Best lotion by far and great price! I would suggest this lotion to anyone (who has a base tan) and wants to boost their tan quick. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a beginning lotion or to anyone who has sensitive skin, especially if you haven&#x27;t tried tingle lotion before (although its only a T2). It&#x27;s a great lotion to use alone or mix with another indoor non tingle lotion. The results from this lotion are amazing :)</li>
    <li> I have naturally olive tone skin and I tan easily. I used this product outdoor in direct sunlight with an SPF 30 spray over top and within an hour, my skin tone had evenly darkened. Be aware that it does contain Walnut Shell, (I am allergic to all walnut products but it is such a small amount). This product smells beautiful; I was tempted to taste it but I can&#x27;t eat walnut products!</li>
    <li> I remembered when I first tried this back in the summer of 2008, I saw my girlfriend and she had such a beautiful looking tan! The color on her looked perfect. Turns out she was only using  pink diamond and went tanning for only one week straight. I decided to try it. At first I was nervous cuz I did end up red for a few hours, however I started getting a nice tan after! I was using other lotions for a few weeks and I didn&#x27;t really get any color. After using this it really helped me get a darker and deeper color because of the little tingle it has. For me the tingle is just right. Its not very hot, just a little hot. Its perfect for me.  My advice to you guys is that any lotions that contain any tingle WILL get you red for an hour or more after you&#x27;ve just used it. That&#x27;s what tingle lotions are supposed to do! So don&#x27;t be afraid if u get red. I also think you should start using this lotion if you already have been tanning at least a few times. Start off with a base tan then use this! And if your not getting dark as you like with this (this is more of a medium tan) then get a lotion that has STRONGER tingle like &amp;#34;risque&amp;#34; Swedish beauty or designer skin &amp;#34;bombshell&amp;#34;.  But this one will always be a favorite of mine. It does give such a great medium tan color for me.  The smell is great too! Smells like citrus or like a tropical smell and the after smell is still good. It just smells like a good summer tan. The price for this great lotion is extremely affordable. I will deff buy more once I run out. Its been 7 years and im still loving this ;)</li>
    <li> Ok lotion for price def works</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying the Pink Diamond tanning lotion because I can&#x27;t find my regular tanning lotion online (Hot Amaretto, also made by Swedish Beauty) for a price as cheap as Pink Diamond. I figured it seemed similar, so why not. I have dark hair, and tan pretty well, but when I don&#x27;t use a tanning lotion my tan doesn&#x27;t last very long. I find I get dark very quick with this product, and it lasts long :]  Pros:  Smells great.  Goes on skin great and very easy to rub in (Hot Amaretto would turn white, and it would take forever to disappear on my skin) Pink Diamond doesn&#x27;t do that.  Leaves a great bronzed color a little while after I get out of the tanning bed.  Doesn&#x27;t leave orange color, not even between your fingers.  When I lightly pat my face with the remaining lotion on my hand, my face gets a great glow and doesn&#x27;t look fake.    Cons:  Right after you get out of the bed, you&#x27;re going to be itchy, that&#x27;s a gimme.  Red RIGHT after you get out of the tanning bed (but that happens to most people even if you don&#x27;t use lotion)  I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to very fair people, or those to don&#x27;t tan well and/or burn very easily.    All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to tanners that want to have that natural dark look.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does spread well and smells nice. The tingle is mild and bearable, I got tanned real fast. This has been the best tanning bed lotion I&#x27;ve ever used so far and I would definitely recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> Nice tingle factor tanning lotion! I would definitely buy this lotion again. Don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t want to tingle.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a hot tingle like I was wanting it to be. But it does leave a nice color.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this lotion!! I love that I don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after and I love the tingle!!! I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and was always disappointed so I&#x27;m very happy I found a product I LOVE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion can&#x27;t go wrong! Great for first time tingle users. I do recommend getting a base tan first. All in all I am very happy with the results. I use this lotion once a week, sometimes twice. Never tan without it!</li>
    <li> Tried to find a good price on tanning lotion, because the tanning salons always have high prices. Didn&#x27;t like the tingling afterwards with this product.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I thought my skin was going to burn off! It was sooooo painful. Reading other reviews I guess it just depends on the person. But yeah, holy ouch the first couple of times. Then you kind of just get used to it. So the downside to this product is that your skin does get REALLY red and irritated after applying the lotion but on the upside it does leave you with GREAT color an hour or 2 later. I am not a huge tanner and I have really fair skin so it has definitely taken me a little longer to tan than the average person but this lotion has worked wonders for me! If you have skin like mine, once you get that base tan and continue to use this product every time you go tanning it will work really well!</li>
    <li> If you have used to a tingle lotion before then this one is great! It smells fantastic and I can really see a difference in how much darker I am after one use. If you have not used a tingle lotion before I&#x27;m not sure if I would start out with this one, after you get out of the tanning bed you do feel pretty hot and for someone who hasn&#x27;t used one before the feeling might be unbearable. Once again this lotion will make you red and your skin will feel hot after you get out, so if you don&#x27;t want that then I suggest you do not buy it!</li>
    <li> I received this order in a timely manner, which was nice. However I was slightly disappointed when I used it for the first time.  I was expecting some tingle factor and there was none.  I&#x27;m going to use it a couple more times this week and hope for the best!</li>
    <li> Item delivered fast , used it for the first time today this is my first experience with a tingle factor it just gave a warning sensation they I stayed red for about an hr after tanning before the actual tan set it overall I love it works great</li>
    <li> Not too strong of a tingle - just enough so you feel it working, but not so bad that you feel like your skin is on fire.  My skin was red after the first few uses, but it wears off an hour or so after you&#x27;re done.  Tanned pretty fast - had a good solid brown after about 1.5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it smells very sugary, almost like cotton candy.  As a girl, this isn&#x27;t totally horrible, but I&#x27;d rather not walk around smelling like sugar waiting for the bronzers to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, good lotion.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I did not feel a thing! My skin didn&#x27;t turn red, I didn&#x27;t feel anything. Waste of my money! I&#x27;ve read such great reviews on this product and was so disappointed. And I&#x27;m not tan at all! This was my first time tanning in about 6 months and it did nothing.</li>
    <li> Pink diamonds works very well and I received product within the amount of days quoted</li>
    <li> I have used Pink Diamond for several years and I really like it. I tan easily, so it doesn&#x27;t burn me. It does make me itch after I get out of the tanning bed, but so some of the other tinglers do too. I have never had any problems with this product and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good tan. I have tried at least 12 different lotions, and I prefer either this, or Mood. It gives you a \\&quot;real\\&quot; looking suntan and not some of the fake looking tans. Some people, you can tell received their tan from a tanning bed because of the odd color. I have also noticed that I tan quicker with this and Mood than any other products that I have tried. I would advise anyone that has a fair complexion, or that is just starting out, to limit your first visit, until you see how it works on you. Thanks and happy tanning.</li>
    <li> I really like this Lotion it has always been my favorite since it came out so I&#x27;m very pleased with it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first tingler, so I was super scared my first time trying it. I did tingle a little, and got very hot, but it didn&#x27;t hurt, as I see some people have stated. It was no where near as bad as I thought it would be. As to be expected, I was lobster red for a few hours afterwards, but I ended up with a good shade darker (my tanner needed new bulbs years ago, so it takes a LOT to get a tan out of it). Absolutely love it and would definitely recommend to anyone who is curious about tinglers.</li>
    <li> I am a routine tanned and purchased this product in hopes of getting a darker tan because it is a &#x27;tingle&#x27; lotion. I was disappointed that it barely made me tingle and I didnt notice a big difference in color</li>
    <li> I love the tingling lotions, but Swedish Beauty is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  If it is your first time using this product I recommend that you test it first.  It can be overwhelming the first time, especially if your not used to tingling lotions!  If you do like and use tingling lotions, I suggest that you give Pink Diamonds a try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!  Happy tanning!</li>
    <li> After reading the review on this item, I was a little disappointed. It had very little tingle, and I really barely saw results from it. ...the hype was too much for the product</li>
    <li> this is a great tingle, especially if you are scared to try one, it&#x27;s not intense, but it is DARN effective!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a good base tan before a vacation and an accelerator that would help to deepen what I got at the tanning salon. This did a good job. The tingle was not overwhelming and the color magnification was great (bronzer).</li>
    <li> Snap, crackle, pop!  Good stuff. I got a really good tan from this and it smells yummy!  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a indoor tanning lotion. Asked a friend. She recommended Swedish Beauty Brand so I saw this product on Amazon. Good price. So I bought it. Just got it yesterday and tried it. I did exactly what the instructions said and tried it on a small patch on skin. I did that in the car outside of the tanning salon. Waited. Everything was good. Got inside put it on my entire body and got into the tanning bed. I usually go about 10 minutes, after 4 minutes I was out of the tanning bed put on my clothes and got home as quickly as possible. I was so burnt. I jumped in the shower, took medicine, and coated myself in Aloe Vera lotion. I NEVER BURN! I have never had sensitive skin and I have never had a bad experience in a tanning bed. I am seriously so freaked out over this experience. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the price but WOW! One time of use and my skun not only felt quenched but my belly and arms FIRM! This is not an intense tingle so i recommend for beginners. Light,  fruity smell and i LOVE the creamy consistency. I don&#x27;t particularly like most runny, drippy lotions and this one is NOT going to splatter the wall or drip on the floor. Instant dark results as well! Nice and even all over.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Works great just wish it had a little more tingle to it. Gives me a great even tan.</li>
    <li> This lotion didnt work at all no tingle or anything.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> would recommended to any one. it dont leave the red spots that the rest of them do, but gives u what u want</li>
    <li> Good does whats it&#x27;s suppose to tingles a lot and gets you really hot so you have to be able to handle it.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I saw an article that claimed this was one of the best indoor tanning lotions out there. I had never used a tingle lotion before but my skin is very resilient so I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem. I went to the tanning salon and when I got out of the bed I was so scared! My whole body was lobster red and totally irritated. I tried to eat lunch and ignore it but I was totally having a panic attack. I had to go to class so I threw on sweats and when I got out of my exam (probably almost two hours after I had been tanning) and my red skin was replaced with pretty bronze skin! So the moral of the story is, while this product works wonderfully I would absolutely make sure you have a base tan first and when you use it make sure you don&#x27;t have to be anywhere for the next hour so people don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re a lobster.</li>
    <li> Its not as tingly as I liked and I tan very easily but its not bronzing like I hoped</li>
    <li> The product works pretty well. The tingle sensation was new for me, and it&#x27;s pretty - interesting. It&#x27;s not TOO tingly. It more feels like you have an itchy (not much, though) kind of burn. You definitely turn lobster red, even me, with Olive skin. Afterwords, I didn&#x27;t notice too much difference. Have used twice. I&#x27;ll update if it takes me past what I think is my tanning plateau so far. Smells nice, but I am not a big fan of the after smell of ANY tanning lotion - has that kind of burnt and then fruity smell, but better than nothing at all for sure. The best part is I usually don&#x27;t get home until about 20 minutes after, and THEN wash my hands, and never get stains (Yes this has a mild sunless tanner in it) on my nails or anything. It&#x27;s very subtle on the skin which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. I have used a lot of tingle products but this one by far seems to give me a good tan without the lingering redness that comes with using a tingle lotion. I also don&#x27;t feel as itchy (some tingles make me feel itchy after tanning), and I&#x27;ve always noticed a difference after just a couple uses.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff if I don&#x27;t use it you can&#x27;t tell I went tanning!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion works well. The tingle is not strong and you don&#x27;t turn red unless you haven&#x27;t tanned for a while. The smell is pleasant enough and you don&#x27;t get greasy. All in all pretty good!</li>
    <li> I am a inexperienced tanner and was a little hesitant at first with this product. I have used it several times and noticed a tan after the first use! I tried a tingled once before and thought I was going to have to go to the hospital I had such a bad reaction , not this lotion it was just enough for me to know it was working and mildly itchy. Also received product like 2days after ordering!</li>
    <li> If you are hard to tan then this is the product for you.  Granted it does have a slight tingle and redness when you get out of tanning bed but it fades within 30 mins.  Do NOT put on your face or tender areas.  I have been using this for 5 or more years and everyone wants to know how I get so dark.</li>
    <li> This has a decent tingle and smells really good. I like it.</li>
    <li> I put this lotion all over my body and did 12 minutes in the bed. Normally this lotion makes you red and you can feel the tingle BUT the one i ordered a few days ago off of here does not even work at all! No redness, no tingle, no nothing! Im sooo upset someone scammed me. I was really looking foward to purchasing something that even works a little bit.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like this which I have used for years in the other way where bottle was a little harder.  Living on beach a lot it does not come do good.  I know you can use it inside and out because I have used it for 20 or so years.  I do not look like I am in my 60&#x27;s which everyone tells me too.  I want it back in the bigger hard bottle.  That is the only reason I will not buy it. Other then that I would buy it because it is great.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and the price. It does make me red for about an after after tanning so keep that in mind but it gets me better color than any other lotion</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this in the mail today. Went to the tanning salon a few hours later to try it out. First putting it on, I loved it! Smelled very nice and went on even better. Felt so soft and smooth and it was rich, which I like. But as far as the tingle, there was none for me really. Just a bit of redness but not what I expected. Sad to say, after this bottle, I will probably not be buying more.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell, and it does help you get a nice tan.  The tingle is just the right amount for me.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Swedish beauty tanning products and this one is a good example of why! Smells better than a lot of other lotions by other brands and good tingle and bronzing! Tingle is probably a little hotter than I thought it would b but good thing I&#x27;m use to that stuff!</li>
    <li> This is my first try with a tingle, felt as though I&#x27;ve reached my plateau already being a month into tanning and a have a great base tan. I&#x27;m pretty impressed for this to be best for &amp;#34;starters&amp;#34;, I actually bought a sample packet just to try and it didn&#x27;t burn much at all in bed, just could feel as though my skin was throbbing from the heat..(blood boiling to the top). The redness lasted about 30 minutes for me and then turned to a super golden dark brown color! I used this on my arms and chest only, I seem to have problems with them tanning to match the rest of my body. I would def. recommend this if you want to get use to tingles and work your up to the HOTTER ones. Happy Tanning! :)</li>
    <li> Did not receve the tube as pictured. Received the bottle which is 2 years old.Very disappointed!! Would never use expired skin products!</li>
    <li> The lotion is okay. It smells all right and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bronzer in it - I don&#x27;t always go straight home and shower after tanning so I prefer lotions with less bronzer because they don&#x27;t discolor my clothes. As far as tingle goes it is pretty hot which is nice and I see really good results from it. I usually use a tingler so I like the heat, but if you are not used to them I would not recommend this lotion because it will feel pretty warm and uncomfortable to you. For the price it is a good lotion but if you like bronzer I would recommend a different one.</li>
    <li> I am a serious tanner, for over 15 years.this lotion was not as it stated.it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.no tan,no burn,no color.&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again.</li>
    <li> i think its a good lotion for the affect i received. I like the tingle factor b/c it makes me &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like i got something after being in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all. So it was my first time using this and it was easy. As I put it on my arms kind if tingled, I did a stand up 10 minute bed but for 7 min. I mixed a bit of this with regular for my face. I didn&#x27;t really feel hotter when I was in there. I came out dark but then as I got home I was red! It felt at first when your leg falls asleep and you get that tingly feeling, exactly what I felt.  Then you are kind of hot as if youve had too much sun. I fell asleep and it seems like a very small tan once I woke up with all the red gone. I like it though I didn&#x27;t expect anything drastic</li>
    <li> This product is a Great product for fist time tanners that would like to get into tingles! i first started off by using snookis ultra hot bronzer and I love that product! I ordered this one after that lotion, it smells ok but nothing like other cheeper and same amount of money tanning lotions it smells like pineapple and super glue not a nice sent! I personally only put tingles on my arms legs and shoulders, I have little acne on my face but that is a medical problem but with this lotion it broke my arms out WTF!!!! My legs got streaks from this lotion! Would recommend this lotion to people who do not have any acne problem medical or not, and to people who would like to try and get into a tingle lotion! Just not for me period</li>
    <li> Good tanning product.</li>
    <li> Works great! Only tanning lotion I use, I was several shades darker after only laying twice. I definitely  recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used this the first day I got it and works great with your skin . Buy it works great !!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! The tingle is very mild and it does not turn you all blotchy and red! My skin felt \\&quot;hot\\&quot; after I got out of the bed but it only lasted about an hour and shouldn&#x27;t all tingle lotions make your skin \\&quot;hot\\&quot;? Definitely felt no burning at all. I just received it yesterday and have used it twice already and I am already developing a deep, dark tan! I would definitely recommend this lotion to any tanners out there!</li>
    <li> I tanned for a few weeks using this product and was soooo dark after only 3 sessions. This stuff is amazing! I dont mind the &#x27;tingle factor&#x27;, kind of soothing! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the fact that my tanning salon carries SB products (just not this one) and the many positive reviews that it received. I saw the tingle factor and figured it wouldn&#x27;t bother me.. Wrong I was. While this product produces a rich, bronze tan; it also can hurt your skin very badly... Allow me to explain. This product works by making more oxygen at the skin, which makes you tan quicker and more. What it did for me was that, but also burned my skin from within. Every time I use it, I literally feel like I am on fire. If you just barely rub your face with this stuff (its too strong to put on the face) you end up looking like a tomato afterward. My skin also developed what the tanning salon called a \\&quot;fungal infection\\&quot; after using this product. It made me develop white splotches on my body, which make me look like I have vitiligo. Every time I use this, it further ruins the look of my skin and makes me feel like garbage. I will never, ever buy this product or any other tingling lotion again. This was a waste of my money and very detrimental/dangerous for the skin! You&#x27;ve been warned. This is NOT a healthy lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great tingle because its not very strong where you are itchy in the bed for a while.  I would say when it come to tingles it is very mild but I see color with only using the tanning bed and lotion three times!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for indoor tanning.</li>
    <li> Worked only the first two times i applied it&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend this lotion if you want a good tan</li>
    <li> All that this lotion did for me was create a burning sensation and make me red. I used it for a weeks worth of sessions, and all that changed in color was how red I was. I did not get darker with this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives me a great color tan, very golden, and it&#x27;s just hot enough to know it&#x27;s working! I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I have used Pink Diamond for 2 years now (during my seasonal tanning). I love it! It gives you a rich, deep tan and the bronzers are not overpowering (I dont like a very bronzy lotion). For the gal who used it and got the fungal infection, sounds like a tanning bed cleanliness issue, not a lotion issue, as I have never heard of anything like that ever happening from lotion use, only from dirty beds. The tingle is not super strong, but if you havent used it before, I dont reccomend doing a full 20 min with it on at first. Not for the fair complexion either, but I am olive and have a very dark tan after 1 month using a bed and this product for sure helps to give me the tan I want!!</li>
    <li> I have used this tanning lotion for a month now and I have to say I love it! Its the first tingle tanning lotion I have ever used. I started off using Australian Gold Sinfully Black which is great! Because I was worried about what I read (about the tingle/stinging sensation if you are sensitive), I started out by using the Swedish Diamond from belly button down and the Australian Black from belly button up, LOL. I did this for about a week, and YES I did come out of the tanning bed with some really red legs, but it only lasted a few hours. After about a week, I was totally used to it and started using the Swedish Diamond all over and I love it! These are the only two tanning products I have ever used, but I love the Swedish Diamond enough to keep using it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product here, but in the tanning salon I go to. I LOVE the tingle and redness after laying in the bed with this stuff. If you do not understand how a tingle works then of course you&#x27;ll hate this product. As someone who used to work at a tanning salon, I would never recommend this product to newbies or someone without tingle experience without explaining what to expect first.</li>
    <li> First off, I never tanned. I followed all the directions and was burnt to a crisp within 5 minutes!!!! Also, I had an allergic reaction and had hives for days.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel much of the tingle sensation which I like but my skin became very red, blotchy, and mildly itchy for about an hour after tanning. Other than that, I loved this product. I have gotten great results so far and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Great lotion. My absolute favorite!! Just enough tingle.  Been using for years.</li>
    <li> This lotion is by far the best of the best. I have been tanning for over 7 years, and have used an array of lotions. About 3 years ago, my friend let me use her bottle of Pink Diamond and I loved it. It does have the tingle factor, that doesn&#x27;t affect me while tanning. After I get out of the bed for the next 10 minutes, I turn a little red and itch a little, but nothing dramatic. I have used this lotion ever since then, and will never use another lotion. It instantly darkens my skin, and I feel refreshed after tanning. I am naturally dark, probably about olive toned. But as for the fungal infection review, I agree with the person who said it was probably the bed. It&#x27;s more probable that the beds weren&#x27;t being cleaned properly, and it happens often. I used to work at a tanning salon,and some of the girls would walk into the booth for a minute and walk out without even cleaning it. And the person who said it lost its tingle factor, it didn&#x27;t do it by itself. Generally, if you leave your lotion in your car, or somewhere the sun hits it for extended periods of time, then it heats it up and loses its effectiveness. And that&#x27;s with all lotions. But I would definitely recommend this to anyone who tans!</li>
    <li> was good not to strong, didn&#x27;t burn me</li>
    <li> Ordered this and have used it twice now and it has no tingle at all I don&#x27;t know if maybe it&#x27;s just something wrong with this bottle or what</li>
    <li> Came in earliar than I expected. Smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY tanning lotion I use. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on any other lotions. The tingle factor is not as bad as others I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good lotion. It gives you some nice color and has just enough tingle. It smells nice (sort of fruity with some vanilla in there) and the smell isn&#x27;t too strong. It goes on well and feels fine afterwards.</li>
    <li> it works and smells nicer than other options.</li>
    <li> Really like this product with just enough tingle to amp it up alittle.  The smell is nice not to &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product! This is the only product I use while tanning! Absolutely love it! I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I like to use tingle products when I tan - which is only about once a week.  This product sells for 3x what I purchased it here.  It is the exact same product I&#x27;ve bought in tanning salons.</li>
    <li> it does get you tan very fast and smells very good, it didnt have much of a tingle feeling, it wasn&#x27;t too strong; i would have liked it to be stronger!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a tingle lotion in years. I tried a packet of this today at the salon and I&#x27;m hooked already! First off the smell is awesome and it stays that way even after tanning. No yucky burnt coconut smell like all of the other lotions. The tingle is barely noticeable while in the tanning bed although I did feel hotter than usual. After tanning you feel the tingle for quite a bit and you do get red. A few hours after tanning and I am the perfect color! Super fast and great results I am addicted! Certainly NOT for the face so I wil stick to my bronzer accelerator for my face. You also cannot beat the price on Amazon. In the salon a sample pack is $4 and the  bottle goes for $35. I cannot wait to get this in the mail. I probably wont go tanning again until I have it. Who thought someone could get so excited over a tanning lotion. I&#x27;m telling you you wont regret this purchase. It totally made my day.</li>
    <li> Have used this product in the past and am never disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it! Only tanning bed lotion I ever use. Have people every day ask what lotion I use.</li>
    <li> it should say somewhere on here that it will actually burn you. at least temporarily, oh excuse me, I mean &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;...  it certainly works, but not worth the pain, to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion after I got a base tan. I got soo dark it was unbelievable. i absolutely love this tanning lotion. Smells great and leaves you feeling good and you notice color right away. DO NOT get freaked out of you turn bright red the first couple times. HENCE (TINGLE) lotion. Your skin has to get used to it. Again I adore this lotion by far my absolute favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived in amazing condition. amazing tingle tan experience.</li>
    <li> This Tanning lotion made me itch really bad for about an hour after I used it. It did however make me look super dark, I have only used it once so maybe your body needs to get used to it.</li>
    <li> The tingle takes some getting used to but I truly love this lotion, just don&#x27;t forget and accidentally put some on your face.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning and every time I used this product I broke out in hives. Now I know I&#x27;m not an expert on how tanning lotion works but I know it&#x27;s not supposed to make you break out in hives all over your body. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this lotion BUT, it pains me to use it. Literally. The tingle in it was very umm....hardcore. If tingle doesn&#x27;t bother you then it might be a great product. Instead of this, I now use dangerously dark (also by swedish beauty) and cannot be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and tanning effects of this product. I also like how soft my skin feels after its use.</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend. This is a slight tingle so it&#x27;s not painful. I do no tan easy and this really helps to bring out my color. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is a tingle lotion.  If you are unfamiliar with a tingle lotion it basically increases your blood circulation and brings the blood to the surface of your skin.  This is suppose to help you tan better.  This was the first tingle lotion I have ever used and yes it is a bit odd at first.  Your skin turns bright red which is a little freaky, and you also start to itch a little.  However, it really does increase your color.  Just make sure you drink lots of water before tanning, as it does make you hotter than usual (I went late at night without drinking much water during the day and I got really dizzy and felt sick cause I got really hot in the tanning bed.) If the tingle is too much mix it with another lotion (I have a bronzer lotion and I mix it with this and it takes away the intense feeling of the tingler.) Do not use this on your face.  I made this mistake and my face was bright red and extremely itchy. Also, it takes about an hour for the tingle effect to go away.  DO NOT SHOWER within two hours of applying as it will reactivate the tingle effect.  After about a week of tanning with this I am about 7 shades darker than I was (tanning everyday for twenty minutes in a level two bed.) Shipping was really fast and it was the real product.  I have never had issues with open bottles like others have said.  You save tons of money ordering it from Amazon versus buying in the salon.</li>
    <li> It is a very smooth and absorbs nicely. This product does NOT have a strong tingle. It is very mild and not the slightest bit uncomfortable to me. The description does not really apply in my opinion. I am a regular tanner and own my own bed. My natural complexion is extremely pale. So I know what a strong tingle is. Am gonna stick with my Body Butter Red.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning lotion at the same time I bought a gym membership with tanning included, I was hoping for a strong tanning lotion to start off with. I read the reviews and decided on this, I wish I wouldnt have it tingles a little bit but I have been using it since April (it&#x27;s Sept 3rd now) and I cant seem to get that deep dark tan I have gotten in the past using good indoor tanning lotions. I have ordered another brand and will write a review about the lotion I ordered in a month. My advice: if youre not looking for a deep tan go for this stuff if you want something strong this lotion is not for you.</li>
    <li> I find this lotion very unbareable, sadly. When I got out of the tanning bed, It made me so itchy &amp; hot &amp; got me so red. My skin felt like it was on fire, it was so itchy and red that I had to take a shower once I got home.  It gives you a great color though. The first time I used it, it got me about 2 or 3 shades darker. Only used it twice because of how itchy it made my skin though. If you can stand an intense tingle lotion.. then this product is great for you. But if you can&#x27;t stand a strong tingle, try something else. I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the suffering. It did give me GREAT color though. :)</li>
    <li> Ok I used this thankfully only a sample bc I forgot my normal non-tingle lotion and I do have to say that I hate it! While I was in the bed I felt like my entire body was on fire.  Once I got out I was really blotchy all over my body. I had to take a Benydril just to calm it down.  I have used tingles before and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant but did have great results but this was insane and not worth the results. and I pray that by tomorrow I won&#x27;t be so red and blotchy...</li>
    <li> works great, arrived on time! I even enjoy the smell of it, I would recommend anyone to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years. I&#x27;m one of those people that get tan really fast. I go 3x a week for 2 weeks then once a week to maintain. I bought this lotion and used it for my first time tonight. It didn&#x27;t tingle much or at all for me. I used a sample of trinity 3 last week and it was horrible, I was on fire for hours and I burned really bad. I did get the red skin form this but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough where I couldn&#x27;t go out in public. Once the red wore off, which took about 2 hours, I was left with a very nice golden tan! I have an exteamly hard time getting color on my legs and this actually left my legs a couple shades darker. For the price and free shipping for prime members I would definitly reccommend this product!</li>
    <li> this stuff makes me alot darker in just one session. it is very easy to rub in and it smells great</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  Just the right amount of tingle.. I will definately purchase more. Love love love it.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This is not a product got everyone!  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  I have olive tone skin, and I just started tanning in a bed this year.  My first session was with no lotion.  My second session was with another product of a friends, can&#x27;t remember the name.  My friend&#x27;s product was great.  Loved the smell and a very nice color after only two 10 min sessions.  For my third session, my friend wasn&#x27;t with me, so I decided to buy a sample of tanning lotion.  They all looked pretty much the same, except that pink diamond had tingle.  I was curious, so I tried that one.  At first putting it on was done until I felt it tingle my face and kind of burn.  I wiped it off my face a bit thinking the skin might be too sensitive there from acne medicine.  Within two minutes in the bed, my skin was burning hot and sore like a very very bad razor burn someone was pouring lemon juice on.  When I looked down, I saw red bumps all over my chest.  I quickly got out and once the cool air hit me, the burning got worse.  I thought I was going to have to call for help.  After about 5 mins crouched on the floor, the burning went down just a lil but but it was still horrific.  I threw on my clothes and rushed for the locker room to shower.  As I rinsed the product off, I could see that my skin had red swollen welts all over.  The water was very relieving and I felt able to function despite the burning once I rinsed off.  I left immediately and headed home thinking I&#x27;d have to rub down with aloe.  I still had welts and red bumps everywhere.  Once home, I showered fully, using only dye and scent free products, pat dried because rubbing was sore.  My skin still felt raw.  I put on some lotion with aloe and after about half an hour, the reaction finally faded completely.  Granted, my skin is still sensitive today, but I&#x27;m glad the welts and redness are gone.  Ill never use this again, and even if you don&#x27;t react badly, just because your skin doesn&#x27;t freak out, how many people that have had reactions like me really raises the question of how bad this must be for the skin.  Too much chemical I say.</li>
    <li> This was obviously purchased for my wife. She likes it and it does the job. Just make sure you have a base before you start using it.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;tingles&amp;#34; to the point where after 10 minutes I had to rush home and soak in a cool bath with lots of baking soda.  It took about 2 days for the stinging/burning and redness to calm down.  I&#x27;ve returned it.</li>
    <li> Not to much tingle, gives a great pink glow afterwards, and makes your skin feel very soft and it smells good!</li>
    <li> as a fair skinned girl, the salon i started tanning in recommended this lotion. When I got out of the tanning bed, i too was in a state of panic once i seen and felt how red and hot i was! i have a long history of burning really easily so thats what i thought had happened! Anyways, the salon worker recommended i use their wet wipes and wipe myself off once im done. I did and it worked amazingly, it pretty much took it away right away and did not effect my tan what so ever, i eventually built up a tolerance for it and it no longer bothered me much. So go ahead and wipe yourself down with a baby wipe and you&#x27;ll instantly feel better lol</li>
    <li> A nice tingeler, but not overwhelming.  Delivered on time and as described.</li>
    <li> So far the product is good, but does not tingle at all. I bought it to use on my legs...wish it was the way it was described.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I have ever used. This lotion bronzes and tingles which helps my tan last longer.</li>
    <li> It didnt smell as good as expected, it didnt tingle as expected-but it did tingle. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I will finish using the location just because I don&#x27;t want to feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> The first time i used this lotion i got out of the bed and thought i had completely fried myself. my skin was so red and itchy but after an hour or so it went away and i had a nice tan. I definantly reccomend having a base tan first but overall i like it. I don&#x27;t use the lotion if i have to go somewhere right after i hit the tanning bed because of how red and uncomfortable i am for a little while after.</li>
    <li> It was not really what i was expecting when i got it. I thought it would be so amazing when i read all the reviews. It made my legs burn(like on fire burn)and i rubbed the extra i had on my hand on my face and it gave me a rash. It makes you itch when you first get out and a few hours after i dont know about anyone else but thats not the feeling i want when i get out of the tanning bed. I don&#x27;t know if it is just my skin- though i didnt think i had sensitive skin. Also the smell isnt very good either. I would definitely look into this before buying(: (cube tanning lotion is so much better &amp; i heard white to black is good too)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel anything while I was in the tanning bed. When I get out  I have a red sunburn look. Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It goes away in a few hours. It has helped my legs tan.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> I used this product and immediately broke out in a itchy rash. In already medium skinned. I&#x27;ve had my tanning bed 12 yrs and have used numerous lotions. I&#x27;ve never had a instant reaction, as with this lotion. It does make you darker, but rash can take days to disappear. It was tingly and felt like it was burning in certain areas of my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion give such a great color and isn&#x27;t very hot. Gives you a deep tan that last forever only thing could be better is the after smell. You need a base tan before though or u be extremely red after you get out of the tanning bed. I will be getting more of this soon.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Horrible product breaks you out on first use. I would not recommend for tanning. Save your money.  The lotions they sale at Walmart work just fine.</li>
    <li> do NOT use this if you have even the most remotely of sensitive skin! I have never broke out out from a lotion but while I was getting dressed I noticed welt forming on my neck and ankles. by the time I got home my entire body was radiating so much heat my daughter could feel it. ended up taking a benedryl and then a shower to wash the lotion off!! was still very uncomfortable even after the shower but after a few hours it finally went away. sending back and hoping I get my money back!!</li>
    <li> I started my tanning and the Tanning Salon recommended this lotion it is by far the best lotion i have used in a long time although like other people have said dont use it before your going some where within a few hours because you will be red but its totally worth it when your skin has am awesome tan glow ............ In love with this lotion ...... Happy Tanning</li>
    <li> Love this It gives a fast even tan that looks great! I will purchase again. Can not be beat for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I work in a tanning salon and had never been to fond of tingles. i had used Designer Skin Bombshell before but that one did not give me the dark color results that I wanted out of a tingle. I had also used Glamour Goddess and the same thing, not good color results. I then decided to use a &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; tingle such as Pink Diamond and discovered it was awesome! The tingling is light but did give me amazing dark color results after just one use. I would recommend for first time tingle users and experienced ones! You cant go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> This lotion is just what i have been looking for. I used to love tanning with the tingle lotions however they have gotten so hot over the past years that i feel like im gonna pass out after using them.  This lotion has just the right amount of tingle to do the job thst it was invented to do without the bronzer too.  I am tanner with this lotion then using the new lotions on the market with the 300xx tingle and bronzers.  The smell is ok.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion with a light tingle. It will give you deeper color quicker and won&#x27;t make you feel like you are on fire. Nice tingle sensation, great fragrance and a great price! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Smell great and gave me a great tan!! I would order this again!  Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily like other products!</li>
    <li> I love how instantly dark this product made me (after the redness went away), but the tan only lasted a few days which was a disappointment. I&#x27;ll still continue using this product though.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes it &amp; it smells good.  She says it tingles but not to bad &amp; that&#x27;s what she likes about it.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I got immediate results. It wasn&#x27;t as hot as I expected but it works!  I would recommend this product and seller anytime.</li>
    <li> I had researched a lot of tanning lotions, and came across this one with great reviews. All lotions at my local tanning salons ranged from $50-$130. This lotion had a great peice and it was just what I was looking for. I typically like a stronger tingle factor, but I still felt it. Gives me great color, no streaking, no discoloration, no orange tone. It shipped very quickly, within 3 days. I was very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and also will give you great color!! The Tingle 2 is just a touch. A great lotion!!</li>
    <li> I simply love everything about this product. It smells good not too sweet and it gets you dark fast. I also love the tingle.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lotion. I waited til I had a base tan before I used it, but now I use it everytime. The tingle is not as much as I expected and I don&#x27;t itch with it. I love the smell, and it makes you feel soft.</li>
    <li> i have very pale skin but i tan alot so my real skin color is rarely seen,,however the town i live in sucks and the tanning salons are a joke so i wasnt able to tan where the bed acually worked so my skin had really got back to my white self..i went the first  time using something eltes then used this the second time n i was shocked...i went from pale to awesomely tan in days..no joke..this has made me so dark and so fast!! i have NEVER gotten results lke this in 10 years..great smell..thick rich consistancy..great tingle that dont kill u..over all i love everything about this lotion..most likely my new gotta have lotion..thanks swedish beauty! and amazon!</li>
    <li> this is terrible... i was in so much pain from tanning with this... it leaves you burning so bad like your skin is on fire, and so red temporarily that its embarassing when you come out of the bed. i would highly not recommend this product. waste of money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to the tingle world and have always been told to try this one starting out.  Well thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great prices, I decided to finally get it.  It does heat your skin but nothing I can&#x27;t handle. I do pair it with Millenium Solid Black so that may take away some of the tingle.  The combination of the two work quite well.  Leaves my skin soft and a nice brown tan.  Not orange at all...which is a huge plus for me since I have a hard time finding lotions that don&#x27;t turn me orange.</li>
    <li> Very good product, it lasts and costs much less than the prices from our local corner tanning salons and spas.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years and years and I love it! Buying it in the salon is crazy overpriced but the lotion itself is wonderful; it smells delicious and it works wonderfully! The bronzers are amazing and the tingle isnt too intense. If you dont like tingle, you probably should choose something different because T2 is a light sizzle, its mild but its there.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my first time using this product which is why I bought more.  It&#x27;s a great product that enhances my tan.  I only go to tanning bed about 2-3 times a week &amp; this helps me stay as dark as I was when I was going 4-5 times.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the tingle factor b/c it&#x27;s honestly not that bad....doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either.  Overall, this product is great for indoor &amp; outdoor tanning :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this on amazon due to the great reviews it received.  I tried if for a few weeks.  I really liked the smell and I got a good result.  But I got this strange rash on my arms and legs.  At first I did not realize what the rash was from.  Finally I realized it was from the lotion.  I stopped using it.  I tried it again last night to be sure it was the lotion causing it.  Sure enough, today I have a bumpy rash on my legs, arms and hands from this lotion.  I have never in my 31 years had a reaction to any lotion, tanning cream or beauty product.  I am not sure what is in this product but it definitely irritates my skin.  Unfortunately, I am going to have to throw the rest of the bottle away, because I am NOT putting that on my skin again.</li>
    <li> I used this tanning lotion for the first time, not even 6 minutes into my tanning session i had to get out because of how bad it was burning me. I will never use this lotion again, i do not recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I put this one at home, before heading to the tanning salon (thank goodness).  Within 3 minutes, everywhere I put this lotion turned fire red and literally burnt my skin.  I knwo it says &amp;#34;tingle hot sizzle&amp;#34;.. well it&#x27;s true!&lt;br /&gt;I had to jump in the shower and rinse it off, then wash it off.  It took 4 hours to leave my body.  It was horrible.  I do not have sensitve skin.</li>
    <li> My wife has used many different indoor tanning lotions.  She tells me that she does not use much of this product for each application thus the bottle will last for quite while.  She loves the natural color that this product produces after getting out of a tanning bed.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion one day because I didn&#x27;t have anything else available. Little did I know I&#x27;d really end up liking it! It&#x27;s a mild tingle, so mild I only felt the tingle on parts of my legs which was weird, but I end up getting significant color after using this. It smells good which is always a plus, too. My favorite thing about this lotion is its so thick I feel like it&#x27;s really moisturizing my skin well. Swedish Beauty doesn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
    <li> I love watching Supernatural.  It is a killer Series. Dean and Sam are excellent.  I watch the series everyday on channel 18.  It is a great series.  The BOMB!</li>
    <li> This lotion has been around for years,and,if you like a tingle lotion,I would recommend it. It gets hot,like its suppose too,but,not so much that you can&#x27;t stand it. Ive used it 3 times so far,and,I already have a base tan. Remeber,it is a TINGLE lotion,so,it does get hot,and,most definatly,dont use on your face. And,the price is  really great too,in the tanning salons,you would proably pay almost double for this bottle.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Gave the color I was hoping to get in a short amount of time.  there is a strong tingle effect when you finish.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for many years, not only for a tanning bed but for out doors too! If u are planning to go to the beach and want a little color before it&#x27;s great, I just put it on and lay in the sun for about 30 min and boom, I have some color!!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion since first coming out. This lotion has a bronze body blush that instantly gives your skin color! The redness is normal due to the tingle and it darkens you even after tanning! Someone had said this lotion didn&#x27;t tingle on them anymore and that is because your skin is use to the the lotion so seems to me your starting to plateau. It is best to switch lotions after so many uses and also don&#x27;t use the same tanning level all month, use high pressure beds once a week or more! The more lotions and beds you use plus moisture your skin because dryness causes the uva rays to bounce off and not tan you as good!</li>
    <li> It burnt my skin and gave me a bad rash. Not happy with this order at all</li>
    <li> This is NOTHING like the last bottle I had of this product. It is painful, causes a horrible rash, and smells weird. I will not buy this again. And I have the entire bottle just sitting here, that will never get used. I bought some other tanning lotion at a near by salon that works much better and was a lot cheaper. Oh well..</li>
    <li> Works great, but tingle is a bit hotter than I&#x27;d like. has a great smell</li>
    <li> Has a minimal tingle but does the job. I like to switch up lotions and this is one to always lean on.</li>
    <li> applies easy and works great</li>
    <li> Ive noticed all the bad reviews about this product bc of the tingle. Saying it was too hot or made them red and itchy and something was wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;First nothing was wrong with the lotion, Pink Dimond is a strong tingler and your tanning person should have told you that it tingles I mean really tingles!  And NEVER I REPEAT NEVER put a tingler on your face! Ive used tinglers for 8 years and I started tanning at age 16 and I couldn&#x27;t bare putting a tingler on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Second the ingredient used in most tingle lotions in benzyl nicotinate. It microstimulates the skin (which is why your skin turns red), which creates oxygenation of the skin. The more oxygen your skin gets, the easier it is to produce a tan! Also good reason ro jot put on your face other than it burning your eyes and lips is bc the skin on tour face is so thin and the fact that blood is being brought closer to the surface of your skin, you risk popping blood vessels in your face.&lt;br /&gt;Third they can make your skin blotchy and red and may make it seem like its a rash but its not a rash it just means the tingler is working. Its going to be painful for the first few times you use the tingler.  Start off just putting it on your legs then slowly work your way up throught the sessions. Btw heat will make the tingling sensation feel worse. Like walking outside in the sun. Tey sitting in front of your face or blasting the ac in your car after you use the tingler&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least I would not recommend a shower atleast 6 hours after using a tingler.  Water actually reactivates the tingle.  So if you cant handle the burning sensation instead of trying to wash and scrub it off rub some aloe on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Some people may have allergic reactions but blotchy redness red bumps itchy skin and welps and the burning sensation is all apart of the tingler. (BTW if you use a tingler do not rub against someone else or pick up and hold your babies or kids bc the lotion will easily get on their skin which in turn will cause the area that came into contact to become red and warm and tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used this product so many times and I love it. I don&#x27;t use it every time I tan I like none tingler days myself. But I had hit a platue and the woman who owned the tanning salon told me about this gave me a free sample and I got darker and ever since then when I reach a point where it looks like I cant get any darker I reach for that Pink Dimond bottle!</li>
    <li> This lotion is also a good lotion to start out with.  I enjoy the tingle lotions and have used this one before.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Bad Smell (couldn&#x27;t wait to shower to get rid of smell)&lt;br /&gt;2) Awful itchy burning sensation (I get that it is a tingle lotion but c&#x27;mon)&lt;br /&gt;3) I tan really easily and noticed no difference from this lotion&lt;br /&gt;4) Left my tan weird and splotchy in areas (booooo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cheap ( ..yeah thats about all that is good)</li>
    <li> If you are a tanning junkie like me...you will love this product. It gives your skin a nice pink look and also tingles as if you have just layed out at the beach. I will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> As I long time tanner-I know good lotions! This is has a good smell and works well. I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellant!! It even showed up early!! Great smell, great tan, new in packaging. But it&#x27;s defiantly a tingle. I thought a T2 would be mild and although it is SLIGHTLY it&#x27;s still intense if you don&#x27;t like tingles defiantly worth it for the colour results though!!</li>
    <li> Works great for a great price! I&#x27;ve noticed I am a lot darker using this lotion. I will defiantly buy it again.</li>
    <li> The ONLY reason I gave this one star is because: 1) I am a Amazon Prime Member 2) This showed up at my house with a hole in the top of the lid AND a piece of scotch tape holding the lid together. The reason I ordered this is because I used a sample of this product at my tanning spa and loved it. i refuse to use this because it definitely looks like it&#x27;s been tampered with.</li>
    <li> Did not like the tingling effect. Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to it, but it felt like it went on for a few hours after getting out of the tanning bed and showering. Did not appear to darken my tan quicker than any other lotions previously used.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t have too much bronzer so you don&#x27;t turn orange after using it all the time. The tingle is perfect too, it doesn&#x27;t burn you it is a real mild tingle. Also gives you the perfect tan after using it the first time. I will not buy anything else after using this lotion. Works way better than the expensive lotions. I have wasted so much $$money$$ in the past experimenting with different lotions and now I have found the perfect one. Been using it for a little over a year now.</li>
    <li> I love this product it will get you dark in a hurry it does have a tingle to it you will be fire red when you get off the tanning bed .After about a hour the rednest will go away and it will turn dark.A wonderfull product.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped fast. I buy alot of tanning products online and when they get to me they have leaked everywhere from improper packaging..but this was was sealed up tight with plastic and I couldnt be more happier! I will be ordering this again. Works so good. I love the tingle that I get from it. It has given me a great base tan! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> omg..i read the reviews..so i decided to try it..recieved it last nite and used it this morning love it..i can see the difference in color already..getting more today..</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning product!</li>
    <li> Was afraid because it had bronzer in it and didn&#x27;t have much luck in the past the reviews all said it did not leave orange on your hands and they were right.  LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> I know you&#x27;re supposed to get a little red and itchy from a tingle lotion, but this stuff was crazy. I felt like I had a sunburn for the better part of a day. Smells nice though.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. I usually buy from the salon I go to, I will be buying from here from now on. Great price, great product, gives a little redness but not to much and not hot in the tanning bed. Smells ok to.</li>
    <li> This precut had okay shipping. It does tingle when you are tanning in the tanning bed. This product does do what it says it will do though tanning wise.</li>
    <li> Used Swedish Beauty before, but this one has hardly any tingle, didn&#x27;t like the bronzer either, would not reccomend again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a lotion with results, but the only result I got was flaming red skin that was hot and itchy. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Pink Diamond and I love it. The package came fast and was in perfect condition. I applied it to only my legs the first time to make sure I could handle it. My legs did get very red and splotchy that looked terrible for about 30 minutes or so. After the redness went away I was left with a very nice tan. The only down side is that I look like I have some sort of bad rash for about 30 mins. I do get very dark with this tanning lotion and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful! It worked really well for me and I am real pleased with it! I would recommend it  to all my tanning buddies who like a tingle but not one thats real bad!</li>
    <li> I baught a packet of this lotion from my salon a few days ago I needed a tingle lotion for my legs and arms which were refusing to get tan. So was recommended this x2 tingle for my first tingle. Did feel slight tingle and had some redness. Was not very strong tingle like I was afraid of but deff did it&#x27;s job. I didn&#x27;t see to much color from using the one packet twice but maybe would of had better results by using it more.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smelled ok and did rub on very nice also. I would recommend long time use and for first tingle.</li>
    <li> okay product and service, just little disappointed with the results of my tanning. thot it wouldn&#x27;t take as long 2 c results. always heard great reviews from this product, but 4 me, not so good.</li>
    <li> I keep going back to this product!  Just a hint of tingle and good color along with a very reasonable price</li>
    <li> Hello peeps, just wanted to write a quick review  since I used this lotion this morning, this was my second time using it, so time to write something. I have to say first off, I&#x27;m reading alot of reviews about redness, irritation and itching. This lotion is suppose to make you red, thats its job as a tingler. It did NOT make me itchy at all. I am very fair complected and I do have a base tan. Please keep in mind that all tanning lotions that have additives are going to have different effects on different skin types. Tingle lotions are not recommended for sensitive skin, so if you use this and have a negative experience with it, then its not so much the lotion? it is a very mild tingler. VERY MILD, compared to say bombshell, which set me on fire...the color results are amazing, it takes a while for the redness to fade on me, but if you want that deep color and you can accomplish it with little/no discomfort...then this is well worth the monies...great smell, no after smell on me...I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with a base tan who is looking to step up. Enjoy &lt;3</li>
    <li> By far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! It helps get you that dark factor you&#x27;ve been needing. I was a tad worried to use it with the warming and tingling in it but it&#x27;s not bad at all! Yeah your red and a tad hot and itchy for a bit but it doesn&#x27;t last. But make sure you wipe your hands good so you don&#x27;t touch your face or it will irritate it! I&#x27;m so glad I purchaced this and it&#x27;s help me get darker in just a few days then my other has in the last few months!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very empressed for the cost 👍</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a T2 lotion in the past, but this one is by far the best! Wonderful scent, IMMEDIATE results, tingle is more tolerable than any I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin is fair and sensitive to most lotions, but I can use this to establish even my base tan. For those who have never used a lotion with a tingle, I highly suggest you read up on them. The \\&quot;rash\\&quot; you describe is not an actual rash. It is the effect of the tingler making the skin \\&quot;alive\\&quot; and more responsive to tanning. It does go away and the result is a gorgeous tan and the \\&quot;lobster\\&quot; look subsides in a few hours. So don&#x27;t be alarmed. : )  You will love the effect once educated.</li>
    <li> Whew... It&#x27;s hot... Better have a base tan!!</li>
    <li> love it ... fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> I use to be able to get the at my sisters salon and they stopped carrying it so I was super excited when I found it on amazon for such a great deal plus its the only product that really gives me a great tan</li>
    <li> I got this lotion to start acclimating my skin to tingle lotions.  This is my first tingle and I know that it&#x27;s a comparatively low-powered tingle (T-2, they range from 0-100), but it&#x27;s still super hot.  At it&#x27;s climax, I felt like I had a medium sunburn all over, but after I tanned, it tapered off to mild over exposure and now, 3 hours after tanning, it&#x27;s almost completely gone.  For my first session with this lotion, I already had a base tan.  I went in a 15 minute medium-pressure bed with facial bulbs, but I didn&#x27;t put any Pink Diamond on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking into consideration that it&#x27;s a TINGLE and tingles are supposed to be a little uncomfortable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: HOT! Contains bronzers. Conditioning. Spreads really well.  Didn&#x27;t streak or stain my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell.  It has after tan odor under control, but had I known it was going to smell super coconutty, I would have gone with a different lotion.  If I had the option, I would give the lotion a 4.5 because it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, I just try to avoid coconut because my BF doesn&#x27;t like it &#x3D;-(</li>
    <li> This is great does a good job with color but is NOT hot sizzle</li>
    <li> This lotion is really good for people who never used tingle lotions before. It was the first one I used, and I love it. I only used it on my legs and it made me really dark. I didn&#x27;t get hot at all in the bed, which I was glad about. However, when I got out, I was a little hot and my legs were red (the tingle brings your blood to the surface of the skin to make you dark). The lotion also smells AMAZING after you get out of the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if you are using this lotion, don&#x27;t plan on wearing shorts unless you don&#x27;t care if your legs are red. The redness only lasted on me for about an hour after I was out of the bed. After the redness goes away, you get a great bronze look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really nervous about trying the tingle lotion, but I think this a great one for first time users and people who want to get a nice color after just one use.</li>
    <li> I have tanned for years and used various lotions. I used this product for the first time today and instantly broke out into a red rash....not just redness, but hives and swelling all over! The \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; was so painful, I felt like I was on fire. I had to run home and scrub to get the stuff off of me and I am still on fire. I had to take 50mg of Benedryl and steroids to stop the swelling and hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have even the slightest bit of sensitive skin or allergies, DO NOT TRY THIS!</li>
    <li> After tanning, my skin turned red, itchy and burning.  I understood the product caused &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; but this was more than that and difficult to tolerate.  It lasted for an hour or so and I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I have used tingle products than irritated me for hours after tanning but this one is great!  I may feel the tingle for a little bit of time following my tan, but it&#x27;s not intolerable.  My tan is improving quickly and I don&#x27;t turn bright red after tanning.  And I am fair skinned. I recommend this lotion and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve bought. Smells ok. Didn&#x27;t notice any change in my tan with this product.</li>
    <li> I put the lotion on and I put my lotion on prior to leaving to go tan (because it my other lotion works better when I has time to absorb) so not even after 5 minutes of putting it on I started feeling like I was burning from the inside out! I had to get in the shower and try and wash it off (didn&#x27;t help or work). I literally turn so red and got so hot I sat in a towel for 30 minutes and still felt crappy!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I love all tingles, the hotter the better, this one did tingle my face a bit but I didn&#x27;t feel a thing on my body but when I got out I was very dark with a little bit of a pink tone, I already have a DARK tan but this took it up a level, the smell is amazing its like a fruity tropical smell and it doesn&#x27;t have any ato, wish it was way hotter but I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be, but the color is so great I will alternate with my others, I would recommend this to everyone, also great price</li>
    <li> Fast shipping smells great love the burn  It gives off not too intense</li>
    <li> Simply  put,  this is by far the best  tanning bed  lotion  I&#x27;ve  ever  used! I  have tanned for quite a  few  years  and usually  your skin becomes  used to the lotion,  but  not with  pink  diamond.  you  consistently  get the  results promised.</li>
    <li> lol ve love works awesome great for legs highly recommended for the price , I can&#x27;t &amp; won&#x27;t be screwed by tanning companies again ever Mark up is 3 times higher this company is by far FAIR priced</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I was pink for a while from the tingle. I thought I burned but then the pink faded and I actually had some color from only one use! Also, it smells like piña colada :) great lotion, and the price I got it for here was less than half the price I would have paid at my local tanning salons for the same exact bottle.</li>
