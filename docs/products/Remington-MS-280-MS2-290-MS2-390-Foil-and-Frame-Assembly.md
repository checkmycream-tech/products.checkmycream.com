### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent quality and delivered</li>
      <li>The head fits perfect and works as advertised.</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>Good price and good service.</li>
      <li>It came in on time, and good price, but my husband said it pulls his hair everytime he uses it.</li>
      <li>Fit perfectly and performed as well as the original head.  </li>
      <li>I have received this part before and it was OK, but this one was alittle off somehow?</li>
      <li>Why do I need to type so many words?  </li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Delivery was more than satisfactory.  </li>
      <li>It fit.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t appear to be original manufacturers equipment.</li>
      <li>More Important, product is no where near the quality of the original Remington Corp. products.</li>
      <li>Fits great on my old razor that got eaten by my 3 year old.  </li>
      <li>Better than having to go buy a whole new shaver....</li>
      <li>(This system is requiring me to type ten more words</li>
      <li>exactly what i needed.  </li>
      <li>They wear out really fast from the blades rubbing against them making holes that cut the skin.</li>
      <li>worked exactly as expected and was very convenient to be able to order online</li>
      <li>The foils wouldn&#x27;t fit the  foil holder mold, they were too big and were cram in there, and would have no flex and the cutters ate right thru them in no time, thought maybe the plastic foil fram was off so tried in old one.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
      <li>These work fine but don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>i have a remington shaver i&#x27;ve had for YEARS and was delighted i could replace the screens so conveniently and easily at cost that wasn&#x27;t outrageous.</li>

    <li> worked exactly as expected and was very convenient to be able to order online</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know that the head assembly did not include the cutters. So, somewhat misleading.  More Important, product is no where near the quality of the original Remington Corp. products.</li>
    <li> Received the head ass&#x27;y about 5 days after ordering.  Fit perfectly and performed as well as the original head.  Would order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Comes with the replacement screens.  Prevents nicks and cuts.  Fits great on my old razor that got eaten by my 3 year old.  What else does anyone need.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close and seems to pull sometimes. I have received this part before and it was OK, but this one was alittle off somehow?</li>
    <li> i have a remington shaver i&#x27;ve had for YEARS and was delighted i could replace the screens so conveniently and easily at cost that wasn&#x27;t outrageous.</li>
    <li> Horrible! The foils wouldn&#x27;t fit the  foil holder mold, they were too big and were cram in there, and would have no flex and the cutters ate right thru them in no time, thought maybe the plastic foil fram was off so tried in old one. Definitely the foils, dont waste your $$$</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I was getting both the head assembly and the blades just as I did when I would buy the replacements from Walmart but it didn&#x27;t come with the blades. The head fits perfect and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> It fit.  I don&#x27;t need to buy another one.  Delivery was more than satisfactory.  I sold the razor at a garage sale.</li>
    <li> Great product but after three usage the screen popped off and the side holders broke.</li>
    <li> The new blade &amp; screen are as  bad as the old ones I threw away.  I&#x27;ve put the shaver in the drawer and use a $5 battery-powered Chinese shaver that cuts closer, faster.</li>
    <li> Thank you! exactly what i needed.  Excellent quality and delivered fast!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone.  Better than having to go buy a whole new shaver.... Save money and just replace the head!</li>
    <li> This totally met my expectations. Good price and good service. (This system is requiring me to type ten more words and that&#x27;s annoying.)</li>
    <li> It came in on time, and good price, but my husband said it pulls his hair everytime he uses it.</li>
    <li> I purchased ths head assembly with the cutters.  The foil wasn&#x27;t lined up properly and the entire mechanism is rough and snags longer hairs.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to be original manufacturers equipment.</li>
    <li> pulls hairs where the old one did not, good seller</li>
    <li> Thank you! I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> These work fine but don&#x27;t last very long. (Excuse me? Why do I need to type so many words?  Dumb!)</li>
    <li> I thought the cutters were included like when I bought the head assembly previously at Walmart, so I had to order them separately which was a bit disappointing</li>
    <li> The screen is way too thin. This is the third screen I have bought in about 3 years.  They wear out really fast from the blades rubbing against them making holes that cut the skin.</li>
