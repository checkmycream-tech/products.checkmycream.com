    <li> I like it, don&#x27;t love it but will purchase again.  Does not sting the skin like some toners do.  Nice smell, leaves face feeling fresh. Be sure to follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Poor. I&#x27;ve been using this toner for decade.  This came unsealed with a very strong floral fragrance which is unusual of the company standard.  With this I am unable to use.  I believe this is not a true Seacret Brand.  I am leery purchasing from Amazon.com again.</li>

    <li> Had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
    <li> I love this toner! It works well with my skin and takes make-up off without rubbing hard. It also takes the leftover make-up off around my eyes. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference with my skin in just a week.</li>
    <li> Great price and prompt delivery. Love the product. Gentle on skin yet cleansing.</li>
    <li> okay but the drugstore brands actually it works better.  save your money and buy something decent from the drugstore you got better luck with that for now the mineral-rich peeling gel by the Evo per lei works well as well as secret</li>
    <li> Even toner. My skin has many colors.  I have been using this product for about 3 months and have noticed a change with my skin blending in with the rest of my face.lol  I like this product and will continue to use it until all is one color..lol</li>
    <li> This product has a great fragrance.  Have not use it enough to say how well it work, but if you have Use the product and know the out come as to whether it work or no. I say go for it. The price you can not beat</li>
    <li> As far as toners go, I think they are all the same, I would not spend more money for a better brand such as this one. I do not know if it is me, but all tonors tend to leave like a &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; on my skin. I do not like that. It does not feel fresh once it is dry. However, I do love the facial cleansing milk.</li>
    <li> This is great after I have cleaned my face or before I put on makeup.  It is quick drying and smell nice.</li>
    <li> Light, yet tightens pores.  As a woman over 60, I depend on a product that respects my skin and yet does its work.</li>
    <li> this is the only one toner i felt very uncomfortable! it makes me rash which never happened on my face!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The effect is evidently noted after just using for a week.</li>
    <li> This is another great Seacret product. I love all the items in this range. This is just another to add to my fav list.</li>
    <li> This good stuff and the price is great compared to what it cost other places..  I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Had used Seacret products before and I would recommend to anyone.  Great price.  Definitely love using this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best stuff on the market unreal how my skin tone has changed to a more even tone.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  So glad to find I could get it on Amazon.com.  I was first introduced to the product through the pricey kiosk at the Mall.  Hope Amazon continues to carry as I was told the bottle will last 1 year, but it only lasted 3 months - using once a day.</li>
    <li> refreshing, non-drying facial toner.  great for summer to refresh skin and keep it clean.  reasonably priced and no terrible fragrance.</li>
    <li> Only use their products and love everything! Am allergic to so many cleansers but not to this one.  Plus it cleans really well.  I use their whole line of products!</li>
    <li> I use it every morning. It&#x27;s a great toner.</li>
    <li> As soon as I saw there was blue dye in this product I chose not to purchase it. Ingredients are the first place to look for a good product and dye and fragrance are known to be irritants and have a possibility of negative health effects. All other seacret products look amazing though. Hopefully the company will removed this chemical from an otherwise great line.</li>
    <li> This product seacret is really good, my face feel refresh,clean. I might think to buy the whole line of this product. The price is really affordable of the toner. try you will lovet it. Thanks to Amazon to provide product really good and the shipping is fast you will received a soon a possible</li>
