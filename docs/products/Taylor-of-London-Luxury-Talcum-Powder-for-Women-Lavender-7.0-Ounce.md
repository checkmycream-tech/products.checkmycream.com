    <li> can on time am was very good product</li>
    <li> Use almost every day as I love the scent of lavender</li>
    <li> I dislike the smell!  If you like a manly smell than it is great!  I detect no lavender scent whatsoever!  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Some people like this. This product is for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Taylor of London Calming Lavender Luxury Talcum Powder has terrible associations for me. Scent is one of the strongest memory triggers there is. This one is nasty, cheap, and vulgar. Ick.</li>
    <li> Love this talcum!  wonderful smell and pretty tin.</li>
    <li> Smells like the cheapest of cheap men&#x27;s aftershave. It has been moved out of doors to sprinkle in the front flower beds to discourage our neighbor&#x27;s spraying cat and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.</li>
    <li> I love sprinkling floral bath powders onto the mattress cover when I change the bed linens. Bath powders are becoming increasingly harder to find. I observed the same somewhat medicinal scent another reviewer noted, but thought it would mellow out when sprinkled onto my mattress cover and pillows. It mellowed out to absolutely no scent left at all when I went to bed several hours after changing the linens. The scent of other powders I&#x27;ve used last a couple of days before fading away. This is my first Taylor &amp; London product use, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the specific scent or the product line itself, but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> smell is heavely but not overpowering. so soft and silky feeling on your skin. while i really like the lavender, i would also like the lily of the valley and others. you only use a little-goes a long way.plus pretty container that i save jut like i do perfume bottles that are favorites. would recommend</li>
    <li> It smells just like Grandma used to.</li>
    <li> Product(s) came very quickly BUT one of the 2 items arrived really bent/&lt;br /&gt;very hard to shake or push talc out of bent/dented container..,</li>
    <li> Lovely and fresh. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Lovely! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> This powder is expensive but worth it. The fragrance is just lovely. It smells very delicate and subtle, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Fantastic powder at a fantastic price ...buying more as gifts !!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift and never opened it but I could smell the lavender as soon as I opened the box. It was lovely.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this Lavendar smell. It was too strong and didn&#x27;t really smell like Lavendar.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and pretty container, too.</li>
    <li> very nice, smells nice and yes I would buy it again, it hard to really say much, but I really will buy it again</li>
    <li> Beautifully scented powder, that feels silky on the skin.</li>
    <li> was what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I have been using the Taylor of London powder for years and I still love it.</li>
    <li> Love lavender but could not get top to work. Had to pry off the top. Not good for a dusting. More like a dumping</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Service was great too.</li>
