### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Gives a excellent shave.</li>
      <li>The Colonel&#x27;s(double)blades are WONDERFUL!!!</li>
      <li>He is happy, and so am I!</li>
      <li>Excellent blades.</li>
      <li>Excellent blades, I wish they had the sliding ejector feature.</li>
      <li>One of the best blades, very comfortable.</li>
      <li>It is so nice to see him using that beautiful razor again.</li>
      <li>the original schick are still the best for my razor</li>
      <li>These are nowhere to be found in stores in my area, so I&#x27;m very glad to find them here.  </li>
      <li>I ended up receiving a nice handle for a gift and it used the trac II style blades, and it was actually a better shave (and cheaper) than the Sensor or Sensor XL razors  </li>
      <li>good blades,  delivered quickly  Colonel Conk is the bomb</li>
      <li>I was not too sure given the price.</li>
      <li>If you want a better shave try the trac II.</li>
      <li>Had much better luck with the Dorco two and three blade cartridges.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of these.</li>
      <li>These are pretty good blades and seem to shave just as well as the 4 to five blade razors out there.</li>
      <li>They keep their edge for many more shaves than some of the other Trac II refils I have had, and are pretty cost efective  when compared to the latest and greatest cartridges.</li>
      <li>These blades are fantastic.</li>
      <li>because I felt his face, his skin was so smooth,.</li>
      <li>They fit my Mercur (?)</li>
      <li>I bought some really cool Cartier razors and searched and searched for blades - these have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Picked these up for trips or quick shaves when I don&#x27;t have time to use my double-edge razor.</li>
      <li>Shaving with Colonel conk Doubletrack Razor Blades makes for a clean, fast, comfortable experience.</li>
      <li>I had tried some more expensive blades before but find these blades to be very good at a significant cost saving.</li>
      <li>So I am finding the combination of the new DE and these blades in the old Trac II to be about as good as I could ask for.</li>
      <li>me they last about 1 week on average with an excellent, clean shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I have to say the combination is neither as close nor as comfortable as my new DE.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and cut easily</li>
      <li>And it is possible to reach places that I cannot reach comfortably and safely with the new DE.</li>
      <li>These blades last a lot longer and do a better job compared to all the national brands out</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The first one cut my head in 2 places.  </li>
      <li>Created too many nicks and cuts and left razor bumps/shaving burn!  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for having them!</li>
      <li>in my opinion, these blades are the same cheap blades that can be purchased anywhere else under the \\&quot;personal\\&quot; name brand.  </li>
      <li>Sharp, easy to clean off with a Q-tip &amp; last for alot of head shaves!!!</li>
      <li>I am still using the first blade, and it is still as sharp as the first  day.</li>
      <li>but these blades are fine and long lasting (10-15 shaves).</li>
      <li>In terms of smoothness, I really don&#x27;t see a difference in the mach3, Gillette fusion or this double blade refill.</li>
      <li>But it is close, and not that far off my Fusion razor.</li>
      <li>So I dusted off my old Trac II razor, bought a pack of these blades, and put the combination to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also got dull quickly!</li>
      <li>The triple blades were to close together and hard to clean.</li>
      <li>He was not able to use the razor because he could not find the right replcement blades.</li>

    <li> I bought a Gentlemen&#x27;s shaving Set for my husband years ago. He was not able to use the razor because he could not find the right replcement blades. Thank you so much for having them! It is so nice to see him using that beautiful razor again. As for the blades themselves... he says and I know because I felt his face, his skin was so smooth,. He said the blades just glided across his face. Shaving with Colonel conk Doubletrack Razor Blades makes for a clean, fast, comfortable experience. He is happy, and so am I!</li>
    <li> These blades seem to be really sharp. I was not too sure given the price. They fit my Mercur (?) razor and seem sharper than the blades that came with it.</li>
    <li> Created too many nicks and cuts and left razor bumps/shaving burn!  Picked these up for trips or quick shaves when I don&#x27;t have time to use my double-edge razor. Had much better luck with the Dorco two and three blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> good blades,  delivered quickly  Colonel Conk is the bomb</li>
    <li> I love those twin blades cartridge because they are less expensive than the 3,4 &amp; 5 blades cartridge and they are doing the same thing...shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, I wish they had the sliding ejector feature.</li>
    <li> These blades last a lot longer and do a better job compared to all the national brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;Better price too.</li>
    <li> If used with a headblade sport, do not buy.  These blades are garbage and useless.  The first one cut my head in 2 places.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that I&#x27;m not going to return them because I just tossed the entire package in the garbage.</li>
    <li> These are nowhere to be found in stores in my area, so I&#x27;m very glad to find them here.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought some really cool Cartier razors and searched and searched for blades - these have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;For me they last about 1 week on average with an excellent, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Gives a excellent shave. Have a heavy beard and I get about a week from the one blade. One of the best blades, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> These blades were delivered promptly and are as advertised. I had tried some more expensive blades before but find these blades to be very good at a significant cost saving. I would definitely buy these blades again from the same vendor. I have sensitive skin and cut easily but these blades are fine and long lasting (10-15 shaves).</li>
    <li> I got these for my HeadBlade razor because HB decided to only sell triple blades and they STINK!! The triple blades were to close together and hard to clean. Also got dull quickly! The Colonel&#x27;s(double)blades are WONDERFUL!!! Sharp, easy to clean off with a Q-tip &amp; last for alot of head shaves!!! I Will definitly buy Conks again!! And you get 10 of the Colonel&#x27;s for $9 bucks while with HB you only get 4 blades for $9 bones!!(or 3 four packs for $20 clams!!! Crazy!!) Im gonna stick with Colonel Conk blades from now on!!!</li>
    <li> These are pretty good blades and seem to shave just as well as the 4 to five blade razors out there. In terms of smoothness, I really don&#x27;t see a difference in the mach3, Gillette fusion or this double blade refill. (this is all in reference to my legs.... I prefer men&#x27;s razors)</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. I strop my blades and as a result I have been using the same cartridge for well over 6 months.</li>
    <li> Before these, I had never used an &amp;#34;old Style&amp;#34; TracII razor. As the razor folks kept adding blades I realized the shaves were getting worse not better. I ended up receiving a nice handle for a gift and it used the trac II style blades, and it was actually a better shave (and cheaper) than the Sensor or Sensor XL razors  I grew up with. If you want a better shave try the trac II. These blades are fantastic. They keep their edge for many more shaves than some of the other Trac II refils I have had, and are pretty cost efective  when compared to the latest and greatest cartridges.</li>
    <li> I ordered the package of ten blades on April 23rd (last month), and I received them in a short few days. I am still using the first blade, and it is still as sharp as the first  day. Needless to say I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Trac II blades only better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using my Trac II years ago when along came Mach III, then Quattro, then Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently abandoned my Fusion for a high-quality old-fashioned double-edge razor (a BIG improvement!), but there are places that the DE just won&#x27;t reach without the likelihood for nicks. So I dusted off my old Trac II razor, bought a pack of these blades, and put the combination to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say the combination is neither as close nor as comfortable as my new DE. But it is close, and not that far off my Fusion razor. And it is possible to reach places that I cannot reach comfortably and safely with the new DE. So I am finding the combination of the new DE and these blades in the old Trac II to be about as good as I could ask for. I will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> in my opinion, these blades are the same cheap blades that can be purchased anywhere else under the \\&quot;personal\\&quot; name brand.  I was not impressed at all.  the original schick are still the best for my razor</li>
