      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it and will by aha din with confidence.</li>
      <li>oh, i love my mango or shear butter to come in chunks if that make sense to the seller.</li>
      <li>Much better than shea and cocoa...</li>
      <li>Love the smell, texture feel.</li>
      <li>Love the quality of the mango butter.  </li>
      <li>this looked more processed to me.  </li>
      <li>smooth shiny lips, no nasty taste or smell, and no side effects.</li>
      <li>This stuff is good quality and shows up fast.</li>
      <li>Melts easier, whips easier and takes on fragrance easier since it&#x27;s scent is so light...</li>
      <li>No painful side effects.</li>
      <li>I had so many uses for this,works really well in recipes</li>
      <li>Lovely butter, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>ON TOP FOR DOUBLE PROTECTION AND MOST OF ALL</li>
      <li>One more thing to add, the package is a double seal conditioner, love it.</li>
      <li>Over a course of a 2 months my scars have faded tremendously.</li>
      <li>They are even more sensitive than me...will update when have that info.</li>
      <li>The Raw Mango Butter is a great choice for me to purchase.</li>
      <li>I had say its only okay.</li>
      <li>This is my first time buying mango butter.</li>
      <li>The low fragance was a plus because of being allergic to many products.</li>
      <li>It was 8 oz of coarse, but I promise you that you will need more.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought this</li>
      <li>Keeps my natural hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>when doing my lotion it does not work as I really wanted it to.</li>
      <li>&quot; WHEN I RECIEVED IT HOW EVER THE COLOR WAS ACTUALLY LIGHT YELLOW</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and healing.  </li>
      <li>WHERE IT WAS FROM, OR WHO THE SELLER WAS,OR HOW MUCH WAS PAID</li>
      <li>Really moisturizing and softer and easier to apply than shea or cocoa butters.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s high quality stuff!</li>
      <li>And I am not just over exaggerating this stuff really worked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I must say that I agree with the most recent reviewer that the quality and color of the mango butter is not what I expected.</li>
      <li>It has a very smooth feel once I mixed it with other oils.</li>
      <li>so I really should have gotten a larger size.  </li>
      <li>The wow factor kicks in when used.</li>
      <li>It was creamy and soft though.</li>
      <li>I added it to body butter and lip balm so far.</li>
      <li>This is worth the money spent and I will continue to use for my homemade body butter.</li>
      <li>I only bought a small tub to try it out but for sure this will become a vital ingredient to my body products.</li>
      <li>Wish it cam in a twist top wide mouth container, the snap off lid was difficult to open and close securely.</li>
      <li>It left my hands soft and moisturized, with no greasy ick.</li>
      <li>Has a faint pleasant mango aroma that does not affect flavors or the natural smell of other products such as cocoa butter.</li>

<li> The container was way to hard to get in and its not like butter it just to hard and</li>
<li> Lotion and soap are dangerous for my skin, and cause chemical burns, itching, peeling, hives, trouble breathing, etc.</li>
<li> It came in a bag with no container, the color was off and a stale smell.</li>
<li> AS SHOWN AND DISCRIBE ALSO THE PACKAGING WAS VERY POOR</li>
<li> Disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>

    <li> I got in a bind, and needed some mango butter for the shaving soap I make.  This stuff is good quality and shows up fast.</li>
    <li> Uses to make lotion and body scrubs. It&#x27;s high quality stuff!</li>
    <li> Lovely butter, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not the same quality I had purchased before. It came in a bag with no container, the color was off and a stale smell.</li>
    <li> I like it.  The bag seems a little smaller than the picture so I really should have gotten a larger size.  It was 8 oz of coarse, but I promise you that you will need more.  After the melting process it whips really nicely.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought this and I love it. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> Ive had butteryer and whiter</li>
    <li> My mango butter smell like cocoa butter.  I heard it&#x27;s not supposed to smell like Mango but why does it smell like cocoa. delivery was on point. Their customer service is great. i will have to do more research, oh, i love my mango or shear butter to come in chunks if that make sense to the seller.</li>
    <li> I must say that I agree with the most recent reviewer that the quality and color of the mango butter is not what I expected. I&#x27;ll be purchasing the organic mango butter instead.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would have a smell to it. I use this product for my hair and skin. It has a very smooth feel once I mixed it with other oils.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Once I touched it my fingers felt like I was touching feathers. It&#x27;s highly moisturizing. I used this to may some whipped shea butter and it came out BEAUTIFULLY.</li>
    <li> The stuff comes in a thick clear ziplock baggie. It is just like the picture shows. The wow factor kicks in when used. I am allergic to essentially the world. Lotion and soap are dangerous for my skin, and cause chemical burns, itching, peeling, hives, trouble breathing, etc. This stuff, nothing. I put it on and it moisturized..that&#x27;s all. No painful side effects. I even tried it as lip balm...smooth shiny lips, no nasty taste or smell, and no side effects. On my hands, it soaked in with a little rubbing (had to melt it with body heat and rubbing). It left my hands soft and moisturized, with no greasy ick. I cannot smell a scent and have had no allergic reactions to this whatsoever. The next test, the children. They are even more sensitive than me...will update when have that info. For me, this is a great price for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I had some dark spots on my face from old acne scars. Over a course of a 2 months my scars have faded tremendously. And I am not just over exaggerating this stuff really worked.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of the mango butter.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose as one of the butters I use when making lotion.  I would buy again!</li>
    <li> The mango butter was as described and it worked wonderful in our homemade lotion bars.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> ONLINE THIS ITEM IS SHOWN AS WHITE AND DISCRIBE AS \\&quot;MANGO BUTTER WHITE RAW\\&quot; WHEN I RECIEVED IT HOW EVER THE COLOR WAS ACTUALLY LIGHT YELLOW NOT WHITE AT ALL AS SHOWN AND DISCRIBE ALSO THE PACKAGING WAS VERY POOR IT WAS A WHITE PLASTICT CONTAINER THE BUTTER WAS JUST KIND OF THROWN INSIDE WITH WITH NO REGARD TO HOW IT LOOKED INSIDE,NO PLASTIC ON TOP FOR DOUBLE PROTECTION AND MOST OF ALL, NO PAPER WORK OF ANY KIND SAYING WHAT I ORDER OR WHERE IT WAS FROM, OR WHO THE SELLER WAS,OR HOW MUCH WAS PAID OR WHAT I HAD TO DO IF I HAD TO RETURN IT.THE PLASTIC WAS PUT IN THE BOX AND THAT WAS IT,I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANYMORE STUFF FROM THIS SELLER,NOT HAPPY.</li>
    <li> Very nice butter!!! for my hair, along with shea, coconut butter. Keeps my natural hair soft and healthy. I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;?</li>
    <li> Oh this is amazing stuff! I only bought a small tub to try it out but for sure this will become a vital ingredient to my body products. Color is snow white throughout. Consistency is chunky, almost as hard as cocoa butter but you can still break into pieces with minimal effort. Melts nicely on low double boiler or crockpot or when in contact with skin. Feels extremely silky to your fingers. Has a faint pleasant mango aroma that does not affect flavors or the natural smell of other products such as cocoa butter. I added it to body butter and lip balm so far.</li>
    <li> I use it for soap-making and lotion bars.  Comes in a resealable tub.</li>
    <li> I love this butter!!  Much better than shea and cocoa... Melts easier, whips easier and takes on fragrance easier since it&#x27;s scent is so light... Great moisturizer for hair and skin.... I have exema and I swear by this stuff</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mango butter! I have used it in my soap with great results. Even better used in my lip balm. It leaves a nice moisturizing benefit for both uses. Love it and will by aha din with confidence.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect product.  I love that it is odorless!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, texture feel. This is my first time buying mango butter. It is great on my skin. Really moisturizing and softer and easier to apply than shea or cocoa butters. Wish it cam in a twist top wide mouth container, the snap off lid was difficult to open and close securely.</li>
    <li> Awesome butter! This is worth the money spent and I will continue to use for my homemade body butter. Great body.</li>
    <li> This mango butter is of excellent quality. I used it for lotions and lip balm and was impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> Came just as described.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it for my hair and it feels amazing!</li>
    <li> This did not seem as white or a typical texture for the raw white mango butters I have used in the past.  While I bought \\&quot;raw\\&quot; mango butter this looked more processed to me.  The packaging does not say the product is raw even though that is what the product was listed as so maybe a mistake was made in shipping? Scent is not the typical almost neutral scent of mango butter, it borders on rancid.  Disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this!!!!!!  I had so many uses for this,works really well in recipes</li>
    <li> Very nice product, I&#x27;ve purchased this before- makes lovely lotion.</li>
    <li> The Raw Mango Butter is a great choice for me to purchase. The low fragance was a plus because of being allergic to many products. Also my Hair is soft and the mango butter mixed well with other oils. I will purchase again in the future. One more thing to add, the package is a double seal conditioner, love it.</li>
    <li> I used this to make my own body butter, it was great!  Very moisturizing and healing.  Worked great on my grandaughters eczema.</li>
    <li> My friend described the smell of this mango butter as &amp;#34;the chemicals in paint, for example when a room gets painted and they leave the doors and windows shut.&amp;#34;  It was creamy and soft though. I&#x27;m not sure if it is supposed to smell like paint drying.</li>
    <li> Seems to be just as avertised. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I had say its only okay. The container was way to hard to get in and its not like butter it just to hard and when doing my lotion it does not work as I really wanted it to.</li>
    <li> Rancid, smelly, had been melted and obviously sitting in a warehouse for a long period of time.  No quality check</li>
