      <li>I get better results using St Ives Oatmeal body wash</li>
      <li>i love amazon customer service.  </li>
      <li>yes, better no.  </li>
      <li>Love love love the smell of this body wash.</li>
      <li>For a drugstore brand there are better things out there for the price.</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact all products made from Moroccan Oil that I have tried have been outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit I originally purchased it because I liked the color of the container</li>
      <li>If it normally smells great it irritates me.</li>
      <li>The mild astringent effect of the argon oil is very refreshing - the astringent effect is not too strong compared to tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>I love this product, nice scent, it is a distinct smell, just like the shampoo and lotion</li>
      <li>Love this product - makes skin feel smooth - love the body lotion too - also use the shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>She did say that none of the Organix products are labeled as being good for eczema or recommended by dermatologists, but that this product is gentle and should be fine for my skin.</li>
      <li>and it was shipped very quickly ...</li>
      <li>Lathers well, easy to rinse off.</li>
      <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t lather well, isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Yes To Carrots body washes, and they all worked fine for me.</li>
      <li>your skin will feel so smooth and touchable.</li>
      <li>silky smooth wash</li>
      <li>it was definately worth it :)</li>
      <li>Keeps your skin soft and smells good.</li>
      <li>My skin was always soft and smelled so good after using this.  </li>
      <li>I also thought it was OK, at first.</li>
      <li>I love this product and the way it smells so much!</li>
      <li>Nothing special....</li>
      <li>I am a natural red head with very fair skin.</li>
      <li>It did seem to rinse off easier than Aveeno Body Wash, and it has a mild fragrance which I didn&#x27;t mind at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please understand, I have tried every body wash and lotion available - medical grade, contains oil of some kind, baby products, petroleum based salves.</li>
      <li>we love it and the price is great compared to local stores if we can find it locally.</li>
      <li>Came on time, smells amazing and left my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>keeps saying how soft my skin is  love it</li>
      <li>Smells great but not really strong.</li>
      <li>Absolute clean feeling after usage.</li>
      <li>Amazing help for winter dry skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast so you can take a shower quickly</li>
      <li>I have given OGX so many chances but after this I am not coming back.</li>
      <li>But with all the products available that are made for sensitive skin, you may want to stick with one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So soft, so smooth.</li>
      <li>back to this product it seem to work ok but</li>
      <li>Granted, I should&#x27;ve done this in the first place.</li>
      <li>This product does not seem to have enough Argan Oil in it to be more than a advertising come-on.</li>
      <li>I love this brand but this specific bottle made my hair very knotty and not smooth/shiny.</li>
      <li>Whatever it does is not make your skin feel better, dry and itchy</li>
      <li>It is a terrific product and am glad that I tried something new.</li>
      <li>I would buy this again,  probably at the drug store (no shipping);  it smells great and is moisturizing somewhat and that lasts as long as Olay or Caress,  or any other moisturizing body wash</li>
      <li>The deception highly annoys me and I&#x27;ll never buy anything from this company again!</li>
      <li>I really like all the products from Organix.</li>
      <li>The customer service rep wasn&#x27;t very helpful and didn&#x27;t seem to know much about it.</li>
      <li>It claims to be sulfate free but contains sulfonate, which is not sulfate but similar.</li>
      <li>much to my dismay</li>
      <li>I ordered it because it says that it&#x27;s sulfate free, yet it lists sodium laureth sulfate its second ingredient.</li>
      <li>I find it very moisturizing</li>
      <li>and it is not irritating at all.  </li>
      <li>Nothing has healed my existing conditions let alone amped up my skin as much as this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really like the way this body wash feels.</li>
      <li>I have the whole set</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s not targeted for individuals with dry or sensitive skin, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s safe to try if you&#x27;re in that group.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t create enough of a lather, so I end up using more than I should have to.</li>
      <li>..was hoping for a little more moisture or oil.</li>
      <li>Major improvement, even after the first use.</li>
      <li>This is very moistening without being sticky or oily and it leaves nice subtle scent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product, nice scent, it is a distinct smell, just like the shampoo and lotion</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m giving this item a 1 star because of the confusion of how it&#x27;s advertised. I ordered it because it says that it&#x27;s sulfate free, yet it lists sodium laureth sulfate its second ingredient. I can&#x27;t distinguish between the two messages and either was the Amazon representative that I just spoke with. 1 star for not clarifying on basic ingredients and for false advertising.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and live in northeast Ohio!!!  I have finally found something to ease the dry skin!!  I buy this regularly!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product - makes skin feel smooth - love the body lotion too - also use the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. My hands and feet would crack and bleed, my piglet-white legs would get ashy, I would get itchy scaley dry patches everywhere. I honestly thought all hope was lost to have sexy silky skin ever again. This body wash is the best thing that has EVER happened to my skin. I LITERALLY GLOW! Ya know how celebrities have amazing dewy smooth legs? I now have those!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please understand, I have tried every body wash and lotion available - medical grade, contains oil of some kind, baby products, petroleum based salves. Nothing has healed my existing conditions let alone amped up my skin as much as this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I am at it, I am going to say the OGX Aragon Oil conditioner took my hair to places I have only dreamed of! I have curly thin hair. After using their conditioner for about 2 weeks my hair curls nicer (I only air dry my hair), is crazy full and voluminous, and is soooo soft even after I use mousse (I have been using the same mousse for years so it isn&#x27;t the mousse).</li>
    <li> we love it and the price is great compared to local stores if we can find it locally.</li>
    <li> This is very moistening without being sticky or oily and it leaves nice subtle scent.  You only need a little so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Came on time, smells amazing and left my skin moisturized. I will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells wonderful and lathers nicely.  Doesn&#x27;t make me itch like some of the other washes do. Keeps my skin feeling  moisturized.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS BODY WASH !!!!!!! They do not sell it in the area I live in any longer so ordered it on line it was definately worth it :) will continue to order on line and it was shipped very quickly ...</li>
    <li> This body wash smells wonderfuland has the added benefit of argan oil. I recommend trying the lotion in the series as well.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Smells great!</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash!</li>
    <li> It claims to be sulfate free but contains sulfonate, which is not sulfate but similar.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff the smell is amazing I have the whole set my skin is softer since I&#x27;ve been using this product...</li>
    <li> I also thought it was OK, at first. It felt good and it smelled good. After my whole body started itching, I began thinking if there&#x27;s anything different I&#x27;ve been using lately and that was the only new product, so I looked into the ingredients. Granted, I should&#x27;ve done this in the first place. There is yellow and red dye in it among other questionable ingredients!!! God only knows why there would be red dye in it... its color is not even close to red... Amazon doesn&#x27;t list ingredients, but I just looked it up on Ulta&#x27;s site and the dyes are conveniently not listed even there! The deception highly annoys me and I&#x27;ll never buy anything from this company again! Even products that don&#x27;t claim to be organic are not so bad!</li>
    <li> I love this product and the way it smells so much!</li>
    <li> really like the way this body wash feels.Not drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> Although I have other body washes, I bought this product based on reviews on this and other websites. However, I was concerned because it does not specify that it&#x27;s made for dry or sensitive skin, nor that it&#x27;s dermatologist recommended, so I called Organix to ask questions before using it. The customer service rep wasn&#x27;t very helpful and didn&#x27;t seem to know much about it. She did say that none of the Organix products are labeled as being good for eczema or recommended by dermatologists, but that this product is gentle and should be fine for my skin. That wasn&#x27;t very reassuring at all, since I&#x27;d recently had issues with other products that WERE designed for atopic skin. I was thinking of returning it, but decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t notice anything remarkable about it, but it also didn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin, so that&#x27;s good. It did seem to rinse off easier than Aveeno Body Wash, and it has a mild fragrance which I didn&#x27;t mind at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s not targeted for individuals with dry or sensitive skin, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s safe to try if you&#x27;re in that group. But with all the products available that are made for sensitive skin, you may want to stick with one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Aveeno, Alba, Nature&#x27;s Gate and Yes To Carrots body washes, and they all worked fine for me. I did have an adverse reaction to Cetaphil Restoraderm products, both the body wash and the lotion.</li>
    <li> Best body wash ever, leaves body silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I received it in a timely matter. It desolves in the skin well. It works well with the body wash.</li>
    <li> I love this brand but this specific bottle made my hair very knotty and not smooth/shiny. Going to try a different flavor.</li>
    <li> https://youtu.be/bMs35QLmOyw</li>
    <li> I dont even have to use lotion if Im too lazy after the shower. So soft, so smooth. I waited a couple weeks to do the review because I wanted to see how it was after several uses. My skin is SO SOFT. Major improvement, even after the first use. DEFINITELY coming back for more, and I have already recommended it to several friends. Would it be weird if I convinced my boyfriend to use this? hehehe</li>
    <li> This made my skin feel so soft and I used the lotion as well.  Were I live, I haven&#x27;t found this product but CVS carrys the lotion. I loved this product.</li>
    <li> The price was perfect, and the shipping was fast, but it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered. I wanted body wash I ordered body wash the package slip said body wash. But the bottle definitely has Lotion big as day on the bottle. I received the wrong product.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Lathers well, easy to rinse off. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Absolute clean feeling after usage. Additionally, it is also a bonus that this company does not test on animals - which satisfies the animal activists that we all are in this household.</li>
    <li> Smells great but not really strong. The smell dosen&#x27;t linger after you use it. For a drugstore brand there are better things out there for the price. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my skin either..was hoping for a little more moisture or oil.</li>
    <li> great smell  silky smooth wash</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash by far!  My skin was always soft and smelled so good after using this.  I look forward to taking a shower know I am going to use this product.  I really like all the products from Organix.</li>
    <li> Keeps your skin soft and smells good.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for great body wash.If it normally smells great it irritates me.Not this body wash i love,love this body wash.  I raved about this product and regrettably had an allergic reaction.  Perfect for someone who does not have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Nothing special....but good.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  She is hypersensitive to many products on the market, and for some reason, this product works great for her without any side-effects.  Not to mention the scent is enjoyable as well.  Sadly, it is no longer offered at any of our local stores.  That is why we turned to amazon.  The product arrived on the estimated delivery date and undamaged.  As mentioned, my wife loves this product and we are glad we can still get it.  I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is wonderful.  The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t create enough of a lather, so I end up using more than I should have to.</li>
    <li> Wonderful best product ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> This body wash smells Amazing and it makes my skin feel so soft after showering! I find it very moisturizing and I will def be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I am a natural red head with very fair skin. Ogx is known to use a TON of fragrance in their products. I used this and my skin broke out in red bumps and I was itchy. The fragrance and dyes that they use are NOT organic and they are just as damaging as harmful sulfates and chemicals. I have given OGX so many chances but after this I am not coming back. It really is worth it to spend an extra $10 on a professional product.</li>
    <li> My skin feels like silk for 2 days after use.  Absolutely the best I have ever tried. Generally I do not endorse products at work, but I had to tell my co-workers about this.  Amazing help for winter dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccan Argan oil in my hair and I loved the results.  I wanted to try the body wash.  It was so smooth and gave off a wonderful scent  The body wash made my dry skin soft again.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel so soft my husband loves to touch my armsand keeps saying how soft my skin is  love it</li>
    <li> red the reviews and ordered this.  much to my dismay the pull day was a year old and had no scent at all.  BUT amazon saved the day and gave me a refund.  i love amazon customer service.  back to this product it seem to work ok but no scent at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast so you can take a shower quickly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this body wash. It smells so good and I never tire of the fragrance. I also purchased the lotion, shampoo, and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product does leave your skin soft and there is not oily feel to it.  Less expensive than many of the other products out there too!</li>
    <li> I am a Senior Citizen and was having problems obtaining a shine to my silver gray hair.  After only two usages of this shampoo, I could tell a difference in my hair.  My hair stylist has even commented on the difference the shampoo has made on my hair.  It is a terrific product and am glad that I tried something new.</li>
    <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry up the skin too much. The mild astringent effect of the argon oil is very refreshing - the astringent effect is not too strong compared to tea tree oil. It foams up pretty well, but probably not as much as some of those common brands do. The mild exotic scent is very perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t like stongly scented skincare products</li>
    <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t lather well, isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing.  I get better results using St Ives Oatmeal body wash and that is considerably cheaper.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again,  probably at the drug store (no shipping);  it smells great and is moisturizing somewhat and that lasts as long as Olay or Caress,  or any other moisturizing body wash I have used.</li>
    <li> This is just the greatest product . your skin will feel so smooth and touchable. it is just the best product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Got it on time.</li>
    <li> This shower gel and lotion are excellent.. As a matter of fact all products made from Moroccan Oil that I have tried have been outstanding.  This stuff is the least expensive I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  I&#x27;ll admit I originally purchased it because I liked the color of the container but it&#x27;s a great product.  I am having problems finding it locally so ordered several from your site.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful.  I have sensitive skin and it is not irritating at all.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to have enough Argan Oil in it to be more than a advertising come-on. Whatever it does is not make your skin feel better, dry and itchy yes, better no.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My sister ended up using it at. Very good product!</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell of this body wash. I use all the OGX argan oil products, and am stocking up.</li>
    <li> I have purchased countless bottles of body wash - they are all about the same.  Not this one!  This is BY FAR thebest body wash I have ever used!  This makes your skin feel divine.  Soft, moisturized. silky.  I will buy this product again and again!</li>
