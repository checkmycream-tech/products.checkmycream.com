      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
      <li>Love, love love this product...</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>They have also bought it and love it.</li>
      <li>Love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>With the use of this oil, my hair has never felt more moisturized and I am retaining a lot of growth from it.</li>
      <li>It smells more like olive oil than coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even planning on buying more :)</li>
      <li>When I received this product it was no longer an oil, more of a chunky cream.  </li>
      <li>I love it -</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
      <li>We can&#x27;t wait to see better results.</li>
      <li>The cocunt oil smells ok</li>
      <li>Love using it with braids, weaves, relaxers - you name it.</li>
      <li>order arrived quickly and I was very pleased with that.</li>
      <li>This is a very good hair oil and is actually my staple hair oil.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and product arrived in good condition.</li>
      <li>This one is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!  </li>
      <li>It smells good, though, and shipment was super fast.</li>
      <li>but it is so light.  </li>
      <li>when I use it, my hair is soft and it smells so good to me.  </li>
      <li>Upon the first application of this oil my hair was sooooo easy to comb thru!  </li>
      <li>Everything was great, been using this product for a long time</li>
      <li>F, so you can be sure that this is PURE coconut oil.</li>
      <li>This is a lightweight oil that I and my whole family love to use.</li>
      <li>The smell is not bad.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I have both recently starting using it and love it!  </li>
      <li>Hair growth has also been stellar!</li>
      <li>Since it is coconut oil, it is solid at room temp, so you have to run warm water over the bottle before use.</li>
      <li>I love this product so far.</li>
      <li>I complained again and they acted like I was lying because they &amp;#34;checked to make sure I got a good product&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Definitely a must have product if you want a more shinny, silky, and smooth hair.</li>
      <li>However the new product was also expired almost a year and was also rancid (though oddly not as awful smelling as the first product).  </li>
      <li>It helps tame some of the frizz, and smells great.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair very soft and pliable, easy to detangle, and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have fine, light brown, mostly straight hair naturally.  </li>
      <li>First heard about this product on youtube</li>
      <li>I sometimes use this as a hot oil treatment, and it works fantastically.</li>
      <li>For those interested in curl types: 3b-3c.</li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair SUPER soft and shiny!  </li>
      <li>You will need to set the bottle in hot water to make it pour easily because it does become sort of solid at room temp.</li>
      <li>And that was pretty much the end of it.  </li>
      <li>and my hair is super soft from it.</li>
      <li>Pure coconut oil solidifies in temperatures below 76deg.</li>
      <li>at first it was fine, arrived as expected and in good condition but for some reason it turned solid which is completely opposite of what should happen</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very think</li>
      <li>I can recommend it to everyone, who wants to improve their hairs.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much softer and my boyfriend, who can&#x27;t keep his nose out of my hair, really loves the way it makes my hair smell.  </li>
      <li>No one wants to put rancid oil on their hair.  </li>
      <li>Soft, silky, shiny hair all week!!!</li>
      <li>It such a rich product.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and thin, this product I feel like has made it stronger and definitely more soft.  </li>
      <li>so still not sure if my hair is growing &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; from it, but so far so good no complaints.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s how to use it: All you do is heat it up for about 15 seconds in the microwave, squeeze out about a tablespoon full (more if you have longer hair, my hair is shoulder length), put it in a small dish, microwave it for another 10-20 seconds until its completely liquid, then use your fingers and start by massaging it all over your scalp</li>
      <li>but i received an older version of this product.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell: parfume-like, if you will.</li>
      <li>I was told to buy this product by a friend, but wasn&#x27;t sure after reading a few reviews...</li>
      <li>Shampoo twice and use conditioner like normal.  </li>
      <li>After complaining to the company they sent me new product and refunded me.  </li>
      <li>I would only do this if I was going to use it as a hot oil treatment.  </li>
      <li>Wow, first of all I am an African-American woman who stopped using relaxer back in 2005.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certain it is different for others.</li>
      <li>and it is totally clear in color...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this oil a lot... have been using it for about a month and I have had some hair growth.The smell is not bad.You will need to set the bottle in hot water to make it pour easily because it does become sort of solid at room temp. This is actually not the oil I initally ordered ... I was sent the wrong item and one of the bottles was not sealed ... so I threw it out. I will order again but maybe not from the same vendor</li>
    <li> This oil so so awesome. My hair just loves it. It also gives my hair red highlights through out. With the use of this oil, my hair has never felt more moisturized and I am retaining a lot of growth from it.</li>
    <li> I love this product so far. I personally love the smell and it conditions your hair so well! As a naturally curly haired girl I&#x27;m trying to embrace my curls and be natural but it was always hard to do so because my hair would always be so frizzy; this product has allowed smooth and silky curls to emerge. As for hair growth time will just have to tell. If you get your oil and it&#x27;s hard DON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED! Pure coconut oil solidifies in temperatures below 76deg.F, so you can be sure that this is PURE coconut oil. All you have to do is heat up some water to almost boiling and submerge the bottle in it(with the lid closed tightly) give it a few minutes and you have liquid oil again! All around I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this oil after a shampoo while the hair is still damp. I dont even need to use a hair moisturizer anymore! Smells great and it is totally clear in color...I love it. I am tempted to try a shampoo of this brand also. Its great.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have both recently starting using it and love it!  We can&#x27;t wait to see better results.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it was no longer an oil, more of a chunky cream.  That makes me think the product I received was quite old and dated, maybe even expired.  Once I rubbed it between my palms it became an oil.  It leaves your hair oily, matted, and just plain gross looking.  I will never, ever buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Comes solid but melts on contact.  I use this for my face, body and scalp.  I can feel my scalp stimulation after massaging it in.  It makes my hair and skin soft.  I do not like the smell though.  It smells more like olive oil than coconut oil.  I still use it because it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff! Great oil with a nice scent. Love using it with braids, weaves, relaxers - you name it. And a little goes a long way. Hair growth has also been stellar! Will continue to use for as long as they make this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair oil and is actually my staple hair oil. I use it over a leave-in conditioner to lock in the moisture after I have washed or co-washed my hair. It makes my hair very soft and pliable, easy to detangle, and shiny. The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell: parfume-like, if you will. Since it is coconut oil, it is solid at room temp, so you have to run warm water over the bottle before use. I sometimes use this as a hot oil treatment, and it works fantastically. I definitely recommend this product for use on your hair. For reference, I have thick, curly, and long multi-ethnic hair. For those interested in curl types: 3b-3c. This is a great product, you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I experimented with this going to the gym one day and the results were amazing!If you are a natural curly with african-american/ethnic hair like myself,don&#x27;t hesitate to give this product a try!My curls were defined and well moisturized.Even through the sweating like a man at the gym,my curls were still intact and did not get frizzy!!!Can&#x27;t beat that,right ladies?!What a great product!:-)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001TI8XBU Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil]] I was so surprised how this product left my hair. It such a rich product. It&#x27;s very think and when yopu rub your hand it melts in your hands. Leaving it very easy to distribute on your scalp and throughout your hair. I leave it on at night while I sleep. It rinses out without leaving your hair greasey. I love it - My hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> **DISCLAIMER: I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive scalp**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order arrived quickly and I was very pleased with that. I used it for a good one week and a half, before I noticed my head was itching like crazy! I had heard that you can use it on your scalp. I tried to ignore it by using less and then slowly using little to none. It made my hair soft in the beginning and then I had an itchy head and rashes. So, all I can say is that it started off well but ended badly for me. I&#x27;m certain it is different for others.</li>
    <li> I use this product every other night then wash my hair in the morning and after I wash my hair I like it a lot. My hair is very fine and thin, this product I feel like has made it stronger and definitely more soft.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month so still not sure if my hair is growing &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; from it, but so far so good no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on my hair, but I got a rash around my neck line. I love the smell, but I can&#x27;t use it. Delivery was fast and product arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight oil that I and my whole family love to use. It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant or overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> I have fine, light brown, mostly straight hair naturally.  However, the winters here tend to dry out my hair terribly, leaving me with split ends and lots of frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve started using this product once a week and it leaves my hair SUPER soft and shiny!  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all either, at least not to me.  (My husband dislikes coconut smells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how to use it: All you do is heat it up for about 15 seconds in the microwave, squeeze out about a tablespoon full (more if you have longer hair, my hair is shoulder length), put it in a small dish, microwave it for another 10-20 seconds until its completely liquid, then use your fingers and start by massaging it all over your scalp and then I get it on the palms of my hands and massage it through the rest of my hair.  I do this until it has a sort of \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look and I can run my fingers through my hair without catching any tangles.  Let it sit however long you want.  I usually let it sit for an hour or two while I&#x27;m watching TV or playing on the computer.  You can even use it overnight if you&#x27;re sleeping on a towel.  Shampoo twice and use conditioner like normal.  I try to let it air-dry after I wash it, at least the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila!  Soft, silky, shiny hair all week!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love love this product...has my hair so soft and moisturized. First heard about this product on youtube it got great reviews so i decided to try for myself. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> My experience of using this product is succesful enough.  I can recommend it to everyone, who wants to improve their hairs.</li>
    <li> This hair oil smells great and feels great on my scalp.  No adverse affects such as hair lightening or clinging to hair.  Product does need to be warmed, as it becomes a solid as it cools.</li>
    <li> I bought Dabur Vatika Coconut oil and I must say it does what it say&#x27;s it does. My hair keeps growing like a weed and it hasn&#x27;t stopped. It&#x27;s good and more effective if you warm it up in the microwave. give it a few weeks for results don&#x27;t expect a miracle over night.</li>
    <li> Everything was great, been using this product for a long time ans it&#x27;s awesome for the hair and hair growth. Definitely a hair staple.</li>
    <li> Wow, first of all I am an African-American woman who stopped using relaxer back in 2005.  My hair has grown out a lot but has always been extremely dry.  I read the reviews on Amazon regarding this coconut oil and had to try it.  Upon the first application of this oil my hair was sooooo easy to comb thru!  I was floored.  Usually I have to spray detangling spray on my hair to comb thru it with ease but with this amazing oil I didn&#x27;t have to.  My hair is so much softer and my boyfriend, who can&#x27;t keep his nose out of my hair, really loves the way it makes my hair smell.  Some of the reviews stated that they heated the oil in the microwave.  I would only do this if I was going to use it as a hot oil treatment.  The oil is solidified in the bottle but once you squeeze it out into your hand, it melts upon contact.  I WOULD DEFINITELY REORDER THIS AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR DRY HAIR.  GREAT PRODUCT INDEED!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely a must have product if you want a more shinny, silky, and smooth hair. I&#x27;m even planning on buying more :)</li>
    <li> This stuff will have ur hair growing the min u put it on ur hair..I will buy again..I&#x27;m going to get this stuff for mom and sister..</li>
    <li> This is my go-to oil. I love that it has Henna in it, and the lemon to help prevent build up on my scalp is a PLUS! This one is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!  It does not have an overwhelming coconut scent; the scent is lemony and wonderful. If you try it once, you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the oil itself yet but I received it in the mail today.  The bottle that was sent to me was in a completely different bottle than the lime green one pictured here and had a totally different cap with no seal underneath. The oil was laid on its side so through transit it leaked all over the box to the point where I could see it on the outside before I even opened it.  It smells good, though, and shipment was super fast.</li>
    <li> I was told to buy this product by a friend, but wasn&#x27;t sure after reading a few reviews... But I thought I should go on and take a chance... I&#x27;m so glad I did, it was great on my hair... I put it in the night before I shampooed my hair... It was even shiner and softer than it normaly is... I now even use a little on my hair while it&#x27;s still wet after I shampoo... I&#x27;m truly glad I bought this product and will be purchasing more...</li>
    <li> The product image is not correct. I ordered this product assuming i will get the same product as displayed in the image but i received an older version of this product. Totally not acceptable. I am not going to buy or recommend this product to anyone. This is completely cheating from customer standpoint.</li>
    <li> Using this coconut oil made my hair really soft.  The only problem i had was that i wasn&#x27;t able to use all of the product quickly enough and it went rancid after a few months.</li>
    <li> at first it was fine, arrived as expected and in good condition but for some reason it turned solid which is completely opposite of what should happen so didn&#x27;t last any time</li>
    <li> i wasn&#x27;t impressed. it&#x27;s hard to wash out of my hair and the smell wasn&#x27;t bad it just wasn&#x27;t great either. it&#x27;s better for people with thick hair i imagine.</li>
    <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t match the product package, but the product works.  It helps tame some of the frizz, and smells great.  The only thing to watch out for is the temperature it&#x27;s stored at.  If it&#x27;s cold, just warm it up in the microwave.  Otherwise, you&#x27;ll have a hard time getting it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> If you want strong, beautiful shiny hair then you have got to try this product. I have recommended this to a bunch of my friends and family members. They have also bought it and love it. Love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!! i use it about once a week and my hair is super soft from it. Definately shampoo it out and don&#x27;t just rinse because you will be left looking greasy! I gave it 4 stars because I am not overly fond of the smell but it is not enough to make me stop using this product. I have made both my sisters use it as well!</li>
    <li> I hate writing bad reviews but the first product I got was expired almost a year and it was rancid when I got it.  After complaining to the company they sent me new product and refunded me.  However the new product was also expired almost a year and was also rancid (though oddly not as awful smelling as the first product).  I complained again and they acted like I was lying because they &amp;#34;checked to make sure I got a good product&amp;#34;.  I was offended, and took a picture showing the expiration dates to prove it.  And that was pretty much the end of it.  So, since I can only base my review on the product i&#x27;ve seen I would have to say its disgusting.  No one wants to put rancid oil on their hair.  I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I have never used oil on my hair before but i had noticed that hair was not as shiny as before. Therefore, i took a chance and ordered the coconut oil and I am very happy to say that my hair is shiner and more manageable</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I have 4b/4c natural hair that is very dry.  This oil is so awesome, when I use it, my hair is soft and it smells so good to me.  My son and daughter use the oil too.  My daughter has 3 hair not sure if it is 3a or 3b but anyway I thought that the oil might weigh her hair down but it is so light.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! Makes my hair shiny and scalp smell great! Leave it in overnight for best result. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> The cocunt oil smells ok and I bought it so it&#x27;ll make my hair shiny and stronger. It does wat it suppose to do and this bottle will last me a long time too</li>
    <li> Staple product, that is all I can say. Keep buying it, so it must be a great product for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I want to repurchase this product so that I can continue to see the good benefits of it over a prolonged period.</li>
