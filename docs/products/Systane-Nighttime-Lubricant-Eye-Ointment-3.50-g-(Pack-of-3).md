### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product, wish it would be cheaper though.</li>
      <li>Yes it is very good.</li>
      <li>Good buy on this wonderful product</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>THIS 5 STAR SELLER:)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It has changed my life for the better .</li>
      <li>It has the highest percentage of petrolatum that I have been able to find.</li>
      <li>Each morning I would wake up with a crusty buildup on my lower eyelid and below my eye, indicating that more of the ointment was still dissipating.  </li>
      <li>But I wish I had a refillable application device to put the petroleum oil in myself as that would lower the usage price tremendously.</li>
      <li>Plus, after applying you won&#x27;t be able to see clearly for a while.</li>
      <li>Several times a week I was experienced severe eye pain during the night from dry eyes.  </li>
      <li>I had some other kind</li>
      <li>Delivery was really fast.</li>
      <li>Ugh, I know, but in SoCal it is dry and this stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This product solved the problem and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECCOMENED</li>
      <li>It seems to help dry eyes, but I dislike the way that far too much comes out of the tube when you squeeze lightly.</li>
      <li>Use it every night for old eyes.  </li>
      <li>This helps keep eyes moist, but beware, if you put too much on, your eyesight will be blurry for several days.  </li>
      <li>Really helps prevent corneia abrasion from having dry eyes</li>
      <li>Only ointment long lasting enough to handle my dry eyes---and I&#x27;ve tried many others.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much to apply and put some on, and for the next 4 days my eyesight was blurry, as the ointment took a while to break down and dissipate.  </li>
      <li>I had years of eye discomfort and eye pain despite daily use of a prescription drug for dry eyes and frequent daily use of Systane drops.</li>

<li> Only minus is how hard it is to use the last small amount in the tube.</li>
<li> Too sticky and after 6 hours of sleep still left a thick stream over eyes.</li>
<li> This product sat in my night table for several years until I got over the creepy factor and used it again correctly this time and got immediate relief the next day .</li>
<li> at least I can sleep at night.</li>
<li> the only helps my horrific dry eye problem.  </li>
<li> Yes it&#x27;s creepy to put an oily substance in your eyes but forget about that and just do it !</li>

    <li> I had years of eye discomfort and eye pain despite daily use of a prescription drug for dry eyes and frequent daily use of Systane drops. Then I started using Systane Nighttime . Yes it&#x27;s creepy to put an oily substance in your eyes but forget about that and just do it ! This product sat in my night table for several years until I got over the creepy factor and used it again correctly this time and got immediate relief the next day . I do not have pain anymore . It has changed my life for the better .</li>
    <li> Without this product, my eyes would be grinding on sandpaper. It has the highest percentage of petrolatum that I have been able to find. But I wish I had a refillable application device to put the petroleum oil in myself as that would lower the usage price tremendously.</li>
    <li> Yes it is very good. I had some other kind and I was noticing some eye irritation.  Needed eye ointment without a preservative .  It has subsided and working well.</li>
    <li> Use it every night for old eyes.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Too sticky and after 6 hours of sleep still left a thick stream over eyes.</li>
    <li> This helps keep eyes moist, but beware, if you put too much on, your eyesight will be blurry for several days.  I didn&#x27;t know how much to apply and put some on, and for the next 4 days my eyesight was blurry, as the ointment took a while to break down and dissipate.  Each morning I would wake up with a crusty buildup on my lower eyelid and below my eye, indicating that more of the ointment was still dissipating.  I would recommend using a liquid instead of an ointment for simple dry eye, as the liquid will not cause blurrieness to the same extent-- I used the ointment as I had a corneal abrasion and the pharmacist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and works as promised.</li>
    <li> Delivery was really fast. The eye drops work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Several times a week I was experienced severe eye pain during the night from dry eyes.  This product solved the problem and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can no longer go to sleep without this as it keeps my eye lid from sticking to my eyeball. Ugh, I know, but in SoCal it is dry and this stuff is fantastic. Do you reading before you apply though as your vision will be blurry.</li>
    <li> Good buy on this wonderful product</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommends this ointment. It seems to help dry eyes, but I dislike the way that far too much comes out of the tube when you squeeze lightly. One tube was gone in a week or so. Plus, after applying you won&#x27;t be able to see clearly for a while. I&#x27;ll be going back to GenTeal gel, which doesn&#x27;t have these problems, although it does blur your eyes.</li>
    <li> Of all the nighttime Lubricants I&#x27;ve used this seemed to go on the smoothest.&lt;br /&gt;It was soothing to the eye, not abrasive.  And the container/tube seemed easier to &amp;#34;aim&amp;#34; to get the product into the eye than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> the only helps my horrific dry eye problem.  so soothing</li>
    <li> Really helps prevent corneia abrasion from having dry eyes</li>
    <li> TERRIFIC PRODUCT. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN, I HIGHLY RECCOMENED THIS 5 STAR SELLER:)</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and swears by it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as expected. Mineral oil iritates my eyes but this product contains the least of what I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Only ointment long lasting enough to handle my dry eyes---and I&#x27;ve tried many others. Only minus is how hard it is to use the last small amount in the tube.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, wish it would be cheaper though.</li>
    <li> I have very dry eyes plus my doctor told me that i have blefarite. Nothing helped me. This is the only lubricant which helped me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Now at least I can sleep at night. Love this product.</li>
