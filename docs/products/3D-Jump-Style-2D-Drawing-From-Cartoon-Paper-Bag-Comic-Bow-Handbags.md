      <li>I love this bag</li>
      <li>Adorable bag that my daughter loves to wear</li>

      <li>It is so adorable and unique.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect little purse for special occasions!</li>
      <li>This bag is super cute.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sit on its own very well</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t fit my wallet in it</li>
      <li>I barly can fit my hand in there without it getting burned by the matterial.</li>
      <li>Really fun stuff!</li>
      <li>You cannot fit a make-up bag or a large wallet into this.</li>
      <li>Giving to my 5 yr old niece who will LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Super cute, doesn&#x27;t hold more then a cell phone, small wallet and gum.</li>
      <li>The construction of this bag seems great and with proper care this bag should last for quite a while.</li>
      <li>This one didn&#x27;t get any comments from passerbys (which is a  first for me), nor was it functional.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not expecting the exact jumpfrompaper quality but come on.</li>
      <li>Clever!</li>
      <li>Other than that, this purse is cute and the shipping was pretty fast.</li>
      <li>It really does appear to be cartoon like.  </li>
      <li>The picture is very deceiving.</li>
      <li>The side part is a much darker gray than pictured.</li>
      <li>Be aware though it has a very chemically smell and should be aired out before using.  </li>
      <li>Ok they can&#x27;t control the chemical smell because of the factory it&#x27;s made in but at the very least please ship out a bag with decent stitching and a clean one without dirt on it.</li>
      <li>With a little tweaking, I was able to use this as a jumping-off point to building a functional model.</li>
      <li>It is too small to actually use it, but good enough for the cell and the credit card</li>
      <li>Even with the zipper expansion its still a tight fit for just my makeup and wallet.</li>
      <li>This is cute to bring with when you only need to bring a few items with you.</li>
      <li>Cute but very small.</li>
      <li>I am not even sure what I will be able to use it for. :(</li>
      <li>While the purse is really cute, the quality is bad and really cheap.</li>
      <li>Love the purse only problem is it&#x27;s very small</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 2 stars because of the poor customer service from this seller but otherwise the bag is really cute.</li>
      <li>The snap button in front couldn&#x27;t hold so tight and it makes the cover always come out, a purse for fashion &amp; fun only...</li>
      <li>It is worth the money if you are going to use it as a base for creating your own.</li>
      <li>kinda cute as a knockoff of the real jump from paper line, but it&#x27;s canvas and poorly made so it fell apart after 3 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s also kinda small, so it&#x27;s hard to fit things in it.</li>

<li> This was so flat</li>
<li> You can fit a small wallet, some sunglasses, cell phone and a lip pencil and lipstick, just small items.</li>
<li> This bag only fits like a lip balm and keys ( not whole wallet ) and maybe a tampon .</li>

<li> and  it arrived faster than expected.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thin and hard to fit anything in.</li>
<li> There are also some parts where the black outline is frayed.</li>
<li> At the very least stitch the bag properly.</li>
<li> and it is too stiff to hold anything</li>
<li> small space</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s so small.</li>
<li> but it is too small</li>
<li> It is small and also smells like chemicals.</li>
<li> I gave her this small handbag (its not so small.)</li>
<li> But people always think my bag is fake</li>
<li> The China seller shipped me a dirty bag, there are stitching issues on the handles and it smells like industrial chemicals.</li>
<li> and it smelled really bad.  </li>
<li> The smell when I received this bag was just awful.</li>

    <li> Looks very cute - but quite unusable - as the bag is almost 2-dimensional</li>
    <li> kinda cute as a knockoff of the real jump from paper line, but it&#x27;s canvas and poorly made so it fell apart after 3 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s also kinda small, so it&#x27;s hard to fit things in it.</li>

    <li> Clever! Holds what is important and is very trendy. Needs to be carried though. Doesn&#x27;t sit on its own very well</li>
    <li> I love this purse.  It is a great conversation starter when I am out and about!  It holds just enough - my wallet, cell, lip gloss and comb.</li>
    <li> My daughter thinks it is great fun to carry this around.  It really does appear to be cartoon like.  It is made well and fits a billfold and phone.  Perfect price for a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> She likes cute things so as a sugestion from my girlfriend I gave her this small handbag (its not so small.) She liked it!</li>
    <li> The most beautiful purse known to mankind. Amazing and unbeatable price! This bag will get noticed when you use it.</li>
    <li> Super cute, doesn&#x27;t hold more then a cell phone, small wallet and gum. Which is perfect for goingout. Quality is good.</li>
    <li> While the purse is really cute, the quality is bad and really cheap. I&#x27;m not expecting the exact jumpfrompaper quality but come on. At the very least stitch the bag properly. The China seller shipped me a dirty bag, there are stitching issues on the handles and it smells like industrial chemicals. Ok they can&#x27;t control the chemical smell because of the factory it&#x27;s made in but at the very least please ship out a bag with decent stitching and a clean one without dirt on it.

    <li> The purse is so cute.  Be aware though it has a very chemically smell and should be aired out before using.  I did order two of these and they were both smelly.</li>
    <li> I love it. But it&#x27;s so small. I thought it would be bigger , I have a lot of stuff that carry in my bags. This bag only fits like a lip balm and keys ( not whole wallet ) and maybe a tampon . But people always think my bag is fake</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a cute design but it is too small and it is too stiff to hold anything&lt;br /&gt;again don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
    <li> The snap button in front couldn&#x27;t hold so tight and it makes the cover always come out, a purse for fashion &amp; fun only...</li>
    <li> My wife gets many complements on her bag.</li>
    <li> This was so flat I couldn&#x27;t get anything in to it and it smelled really bad.  It&#x27;s cute though.</li>
    <li> It is too small to actually use it, but good enough for the cell and the credit card</li>
    <li> Nice and bright, great purchase. Second from this brand. Well constructed. Giving to my 5 yr old niece who will LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Get tons of complements, I love my bag!</li>
    <li> I love collecting handbags that are bizarre. This one didn&#x27;t get any comments from passerbys (which is a  first for me), nor was it functional. You could possibly slip a cellphone and maybe a money clip in here, but you will dislocate your fingers trying to get it out. It is worth the money if you are going to use it as a base for creating your own. With a little tweaking, I was able to use this as a jumping-off point to building a functional model.</li>
    <li> This bag is super cute. It was received in perfect condition. The construction of this bag seems great and with proper care this bag should last for quite a while. These are not meant for carrying a lot of things so it is the perfect bag for  a fun night on the town.</li>

    <li> This is cute to bring with when you only need to bring a few items with you. Even with the zipper expansion its still a tight fit for just my makeup and wallet. The smell when I received this bag was just awful. It smells like moth balls or something, I&#x27;ve washed it twice now and I can still smell it so I&#x27;m not using it until I can get the smell out.</li>
    <li> I loved this handbag as soon as I received it. It is so adorable and unique. However, I&#x27;ve given it for stars because there really is a limited amount of stuff you can put in it. Still a good bag, though.</li>
    <li> Love it.... it&#x27;s adorable</li>
    <li> The bag is not what I was expecting it to be at all. The picture is very deceiving. It is small and also smells like chemicals. I am not even sure what I will be able to use it for. :(</li>
