    <li> I love the vinylux polishes. They definitely have lasting power!!! I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on!

    <li> This nail polish is beautiful, long-lasting, and a great color for Spring!  The color is vibrant and pretty, and I love the staying power of Vinylux.  I used to get gel polish done at the salon every 2 weeks and since I started buying Vinylux polishes, I am no longer dropping $40 every time I get my nails done!  It dries quickly and lasts close to a week before it starts chipping.  I know they say it does not need a base coat, but whenever I do my nails with Vinylux, I start with Orly Bonder, then two coats of Vinylux, followed by the Vinylux top coat.  It really does dry quickly and it lasts longer than any other nail polish.  I do find these polishes harder to remove than regular nail polish so I just use pure acetone to take the polish off.</li>
