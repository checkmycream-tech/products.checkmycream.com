<ol>
      <li>The design is beautiful.</li>
      <li>my Aunt was happy to receive this</li>
      <li>A great gift...</li>
      <li>Durable and the coverage is great.</li>
      <li>This cap is more ideal if you didn&#x27;t have to wash your ears &amp; you need it as a protective covering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gotta make sure no steam or drops of water get up in there to ruin this beautiful mane of mine.</li>
      <li>This shower cap is very cute</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this shower cap!</li>
      <li>Love this shower cap, it is durable and who wouldn&#x27;t like to have a lil bling on their shower cap..</li>
      <li>Eh, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>I am ordering more...</li>
      <li>Cute shower cap but</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>the shower cap is cute.</li>
      <li>1st off, it comes in a cute container (pic attached) &amp;</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s super cute! ....</li>
      <li>Cute style and works fine.</li>
      <li>so it is easy for water to get beneath it.</li>
      <li>so if you want to wash your ears (which I recommend during a shower ;), you kind of have to also expose your sideburns section.</li>
      <li>But....the first time i used it the color on the rose stained my towels.</li>
      <li>Seems you either get useful or cute.</li>
      <li>Very well made and super cute!</li>
      <li>Comfortable to wear and love the red rose</li>
      <li>The cap itself is very cute and fashionable, but as for its actual purpose (to keep your hair dry) it does not do that great of a job.</li>
      <li>The cap itself is very pretty.</li>
      <li>So...as you can see with the photo, I decided to have fun with the photo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun shower cap, if you need a pick me up.  </li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re planning on running out the door right after taking this off, you will have indentations on your forehead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t let my hair get wet, and it&#x27;s cute.</li>
      <li>It fits very well and keeps the water off my hair!</li>
      <li>Well, I have a small size head, and short hair, and this one is just perfect.</li>
      <li>The cheap small ones at publix are better.</li>
      <li>I think it is just because the cap is very loose fitting</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have a problem covering my whole head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure pre-washing before using would avoid this mess.</li>
      <li>Its cute but its a little tricky to leave your ears exposed to wash.</li>
      <li>I have short hair, but I think there is plenty of room in it if I had much longer hair.</li>
      <li>I am buying another one with a soft liner on the inside and soft plastic around the elastic band.</li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t fit very tight.</li>
      <li>A very cute,way to keep your hair dry.  </li>
      <li>I have wavy long hair and it worked perfect except i was disappointed when i saw the red stream of color running down my neck and on to my white towels.</li>

<li> Its a plastic, transparent cap with a black mesh overlay so its double layered which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick hair but its only shoulder length</li>
<li> If I put a thick headband on under the cap, that helps a whole lot.</li>
<li> Keeps my hair dry.</li>
<li> But I suggest you just buy disposable shower caps if you want to keep your hair dry.</li>
<li> For me, if I even get close to the shower water, my hair will somehow get wet with this shower cap on.</li>
<li> Other than those 2 cons, I like it.</li>
<li> Elastic on the bottom is snug but not too tight.</li>
<li> Inside elastic is too stiff, scratching the head.  </li>
<li> the liner plastic is too stiff an not easy to work with</li>
<li> And the fluffy rim around it made it hard to wash the outer edges of my face.</li>
<li> I noticed a lot of shower cap reviews complain about caps being too small.</li>
<li> but I found it to be rather small and plastic is not flexible as it should be but very stiff.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel dowdy with this hanging in my bathroom!</li>
<li> :(</li>

    <li> A very cute,way to keep your hair dry.  The cap itself is very pretty.</li>
    <li> The cap itself is very cute and fashionable, but as for its actual purpose (to keep your hair dry) it does not do that great of a job. For me, if I even get close to the shower water, my hair will somehow get wet with this shower cap on. I think it is just because the cap is very loose fitting so it is easy for water to get beneath it. If I put a thick headband on under the cap, that helps a whole lot.

    <li> Cute shower cap but the liner plastic is too stiff an not easy to work with</li>
    <li> Well made, holds together well.  Flower does not feel like it will come off even after being snagged and yanked on. Elastic on the bottom is snug but not too tight. Comfy.  Keeps my hair dry.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is very cute but I found it to be rather small and plastic is not flexible as it should be but very stiff.</li>
    <li> Eh, don&#x27;t love it. I didn&#x27;t experience the flaking dots like everyone else did. But it didn&#x27;t fit very tight. Gotta make sure no steam or drops of water get up in there to ruin this beautiful mane of mine. And the fluffy rim around it made it hard to wash the outer edges of my face. The cheap small ones at publix are better. Seems you either get useful or cute. Never both.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to wear and love the red rose</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fun shower cap, if you need a pick me up.  Looks like it will hold up well.  I have short hair, but I think there is plenty of room in it if I had much longer hair.</li>
    <li> So...as you can see with the photo, I decided to have fun with the photo. 1st off, it comes in a cute container (pic attached) &amp; the shower cap is cute. Its a plastic, transparent cap with a black mesh overlay so its double layered which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick hair but its only shoulder length so I didn&#x27;t have a problem covering my whole head. I would&#x27;ve given this 3.5 stars out of 5 but that wasn&#x27;t an option. Its cute but its a little tricky to leave your ears exposed to wash. its bulky so if you want to wash your ears (which I recommend during a shower ;), you kind of have to also expose your sideburns section. This cap is more ideal if you didn&#x27;t have to wash your ears &amp; you need it as a protective covering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reason....the band leaves marks on your forehead. It eventually goes away but if you&#x27;re planning on running out the door right after taking this off, you will have indentations on your forehead. Other than those 2 cons, I like it.</li>
    <li> The design is beautiful. But....the first time i used it the color on the rose stained my towels. I would suggest you wash and rinse this mask several times before using. I have wavy long hair and it worked perfect except i was disappointed when i saw the red stream of color running down my neck and on to my white towels. :( I&#x27;m sure pre-washing before using would avoid this mess.</li>
    <li> Love this shower cap, it is durable and who wouldn&#x27;t like to have a lil bling on their shower cap..My friends all want one now!! I am ordering more...</li>
    <li> Cute style and works fine.</li>
    <li> I love this and now I don&#x27;t feel like I need to hide from my hubby when I&#x27;m wearing a shower cap. Very well made and super cute!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> A great gift... my Aunt was happy to receive this</li>
    <li> Inside elastic is too stiff, scratching the head.  I am buying another one with a soft liner on the inside and soft plastic around the elastic band.</li>
    <li> Love it! Durable and the coverage is great.</li>
    <li> This is one of two of the cutest shower caps I have ever seen!!!</li>
    <li> Did write my comments before!</li>
    <li> Love this shower cap! It fits very well and keeps the water off my hair! And it&#x27;s super cute! ....</li>
