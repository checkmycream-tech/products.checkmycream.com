      <li>We have used this since our children got braces 3 years ago and we love it.</li>
      <li>my teeth are stronger and more resistant to decay.  </li>
      <li>We bought the six bottles for $32, which isn&#x27;t the best bargain I&#x27;ve had on Amazon, but I figured they would last a while and would not go</li>
      <li>I also like the exact-pour mouth of the bottle that keeps me from taking more than needed.</li>

      <li>The taste wasn&#x27;t as strong as some mouthwashes.</li>
      <li>has a strong mint taste which stays with me all night.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
      <li>I ordered this product because it was alcohol free</li>
      <li>The taste is acceptable and being ahcohol free, does not burn or sting.</li>
      <li>However, ACT will put on Amazon the cheap way out with others, beware.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, and it works - why wouldn&#x27;t you use it?</li>
      <li>So far none of our kids has ever had a cavity, so I&#x27;m crediting our success to good brushing habits, limiting sodas and sugary foods, and ACT Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I gave it a shot, and then bought a full size bottle.  </li>
      <li>Right before bed, after brushing, swish a mouthful around for a minute and spit - you&#x27;ll be coating your clean teeth in fluoride protection.  </li>
      <li>- Gives you great breath  - Good amount of fluoride (not too much or too little for 2-3x daily use)  -</li>
      <li>enjoy this product for our whole family, We always&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
      <li>a rare for me.  </li>
      <li>There is also a fill line drawn near the top of the bottle, so you just squeeze until the liquid hits that mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
      <li>It seems that .05% flouride is the right amount needed every night to prevent cavities.</li>
      <li>You just squeeze the bottle until the mouthwash comes up to the line that marks the right</li>
      <li>It has a squeeze dispenser that gives you just the right about.  </li>
      <li>Then the neck of the bottle fills up with the right amount to use.</li>
      <li>The bottle is also pretty nice because you squeeze it and the fluid rises up into a portion of the bottle that holds it</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you&#x27;re getting a better deal for the 33oz bottles; you&#x27;re basically paying more for less effect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably not describing it well, but it&#x27;s smart, simple, and effective.  </li>
      <li>The flouride helps during the day to keep my soft teeth strong.</li>
      <li>I also like ordering from Preferred Mart, they ship very fast.</li>
      <li>so check locally first.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The fluoride concentration is higher.</li>
      <li>However, this product has a funny &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34; taste to it along with the mint flavor.</li>
      <li>I used the red flavored bottle for many years</li>
      <li>It came promptly, with a few uses of the product there seems be a good result with my teeth.</li>
      <li>Mess free, easy.  </li>
      <li>( always concerned with so much liquid).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obviously sugarfree but is also alcohol free.</li>
      <li>really* helped a lot with the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you need to use twice as much</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t use anything with alcohol in it because it burns too much.  </li>
      <li>This mouthwash has a measuring feature that keeps you from pouring too much.</li>
      <li>Its so much un-cool.  </li>
      <li>have un-fluoridated well water at our house, so adding the extra fluoride protection is important for our kids&#x27; developing teeth.  </li>
      <li>This has really made the difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a Dentist fan and have never been too enthused with paying too much for crowns and cleanings</li>
      <li>The mint flavor is really very well done.</li>
      <li>I find its better than other mouth washes bc</li>
      <li>And, it tastes better than other brands I have used.</li>
      <li>I like it a lot better than the other brands.</li>
      <li>I went with Walgreen&#x27;s online price and they were also too high</li>
      <li>it highly recommended this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
    <li> Two in the family using this product - recommended by our Dentist.  Excellent packaging - no spills etc.</li>
    <li> use it every night - awesome</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used ACT Rinse for years, at our dentist&#x27;s suggestion.  Right before bed, after brushing, swish a mouthful around for a minute and spit - you&#x27;ll be coating your clean teeth in fluoride protection.  It helps protect against cavities by restoring the enamel on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild minty flavor, not nearly as strong as Scope, and also come in Bubble Gum flavor for kids.  There is a slight saccharine aftertaste but nothing too unpleasant - especially for the protection this product gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have un-fluoridated well water at our house, so adding the extra fluoride protection is important for our kids&#x27; developing teeth.  So far none of our kids has ever had a cavity, so I&#x27;m crediting our success to good brushing habits, limiting sodas and sugary foods, and ACT Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Amazon&#x27;s Super Saver shipping, this 6-pack is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I was tempted to do a 1 star, but that isn&#x27;t fair, because this is a GREAT product, I love the results.  Why I was going to give an unfair 1 star?  This is a LOUSY deal, comes out to 7 bucks a bottle (after you add in the high shipping!).  I took the bait, and too late realized at a big box store the same size bottle was HALF THE PRICE!!!  My only grip!  Buy this product, but save your money and buy elsewhere at half the cost!</li>
    <li> No burning from alcohol.  Nice flavor.  Part of my regular oral hygiene regimen.</li>
    <li> Alcohol based mouth washes can actually promote bacteria in your mouth because that bacteria comes back stronger each time you kill them out using alcohol - in turn it gives you even worse breath and your bad breath comes back quicker after each use.    This however is a great mouthwash.    - Gives you great breath  - Good amount of fluoride (not too much or too little for 2-3x daily use)  - No alcohol    all in all, I love it. Will continue to use it as my mouthwash.</li>
    <li> A dentist once said, if everyone used this product at bedtime every night, dentists would go out of business.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30-yr old female and like this bc it pre-measures the amount you need (built into cap, you just squeeze it - it&#x27;s idiot proof), and I like the fresh (but not overwhelming) minty flavor. It&#x27;s like a spearmint in my opinion. It&#x27;s obviously sugarfree but is also alcohol free. It still kills germs, freshens breath, and MOST importantly, the fluoride in it does wonders in preventing cavities.</li>
    <li> This rinse is great for warding off cavities but it&#x27;s also fantastic for my sensitive teeth.  On my upper molars on the lingual side (the side of the tooth facing in toward the roof of my mouth) I have exposed roots that were crazy sensitive when I brushed them, so much that I would avoid brushing them.  To treat the sensitivity, my dental hygienist applied a topical fluoride treatment on that part of my molars after cleaning my teeth.  It *really* helped a lot with the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dentist always sends me home with a little trial bottle of this ACT alcohol-free anticavity fluoride rinse so I gave it a shot, and then bought a full size bottle.  After a few weeks of using it every night before bed, my teeth weren&#x27;t sensitive anymore and I no longer have to use sensitivity toothpastes.  Added bonus - my teeth are stronger and more resistant to decay.  It&#x27;s not a permanent cure, of course, so I continue to use it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus of the 18 ounce bottle is the 10ml dispenser feature... you squeeze the main part of the bottle until the top portion of the bottle fills up to the 10ml mark, and since I&#x27;m the only one using this bottle, I take the rinse right from that little bottle dispenser.  Mess free, easy.  The 33.8 oz bottle doesn&#x27;t have this, you instead pour into the cap up to the 10ml mark and the fluoride rinse doesn&#x27;t want to cleanly pour from the bottle, it likes to dribble down the side a bit, and then afterwards you have to rinse the cap out otherwise the fluoride will drip all over the bottle (I hope my description makes sense!).  So I do prefer this 18oz size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this fluoride rinse, and my dentist is very happy with how strong all of my teeth are.  This rinse works.  My grocery store sells the 18 oz bottle for $4, though there&#x27;s often a dollar off coupon for it, bringing it to $3.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every night before I go to bed.  Its the only ACT product recommended by the ADA - the other ACT products are all hybrids and do not have the ADA seal of approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t know, fluoride protects your teeth by making them harder - and the harder they are, the more resistant they are to cavities.  It&#x27;s quick, easy, and it works - why wouldn&#x27;t you use it?</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this brand of mouthwash, and I&#x27;ve used it daily for the past couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and it seems to help, or at the very least, doesn&#x27;t make anything worse!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this to help with my tooth sensitivity issues, and it definitely makes a difference after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Love using this product every night. The mint flavor is really very well done. The quality of this mouthwash is really good. The price here on Amazon...great!</li>
    <li> Beware of the ACT products that have the screw off drinking cap.  Its so much un-cool.  I think ACT has the BEST distribution system in the squeeze and use.  THIS PURCHASE HAS THAT!  I give it 5 stars...a rare for me.  However, ACT will put on Amazon the cheap way out with others, beware.</li>
    <li> I prefer non-alcohol mouthwashes because the alcohol ones are just too harsh, so I&#x27;m pleased with the minimal-burn aspect of this product. I also like the exact-pour mouth of the bottle that keeps me from taking more than needed. However, this product has a funny &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34; taste to it along with the mint flavor. It&#x27;s not truly offensive, but it is noticeable.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED 6 BOTTLES OF THE ACT ABOVE.  I RECEIVED 2 ALONG WITH 4 OF A DIFF. TYPE.  THIS IS JUST UNACCEEPTABLE.</li>
    <li> product is great. really helps having less cavities... I like this flavor compared to some other mint types. great product.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this on a regular basis, I have not had any new cavities. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended it, so I hope it works.  The seals on these bottles are total overkill.  I have only been successsful by ripping them off with needle-nose pliers.  They are so tight and strong that nothing else has worked</li>
    <li> This mouthwash has a measuring feature that keeps you from pouring too much. You squeeze the bottle after taking off the cap. Then the neck of the bottle fills up with the right amount to use. The taste is acceptable and being ahcohol free, does not burn or sting. I like it a lot better than the other brands. It is a little cheaper here than the drug store and with no tax -so far- and no delivery cost, Amazon is the best place to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Good price for the pack of six.  Smells great- leaves a minty taste and lasts for a while.  I find its better than other mouth washes bc it has flouride in it as well.</li>
    <li> My kids love this - and the engineering is fun and helpful!  I recommend for anyone who has kids.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Good product.</li>
    <li> I prefer this size over the larger one. The fluoride concentration is higher. Been using this for past 3 years. No cavities have happened. I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free so I swish it in my mouth for longer then 1 minute.</li>
    <li> Our kids use this every night and since they started it we&#x27;ve had no  cavities (almost two years now) -- I wish we had found it earlier....</li>
    <li> This has really made the difference.  I have gone from multiple cavities a visit to no cavities at my check ups.</li>
    <li> Great product .We enjoy this product for our whole family, We always&lt;br /&gt;get great check ups when we go to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Great stuff,plus my dentist highly recommended it .</li>
    <li> the product arrived in good shape. ( always concerned with so much liquid). Dr. reccommended this product and have used it for several years. Buying on amazon is so easy! No lines, no traffic, no wait.  Love it.! Thank you.!!</li>
    <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t as strong as some mouthwashes. The flouride helps during the day to keep my soft teeth strong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;d been a long time since my wife and I had used mouth wash, but our dentist recommended it and gave specifics about the bottle needing to have \\&quot;Fluoride\\&quot; or \\&quot;Anticavity\\&quot; in the title, so it worked out that this ACT product had both.  We bought the six bottles for $32, which isn&#x27;t the best bargain I&#x27;ve had on Amazon, but I figured they would last a while and would not go bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used it for at least a week now, and I must say there are at least three great things about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The bottle design is really innovative.  You squeeze the bottle and liquid squirts out into the top from two little spigots and then sits there for you to pour into your mouth from the bottle.  I&#x27;m probably not describing it well, but it&#x27;s smart, simple, and effective.  It saves the need to pour into a cap or a separate cup.  There is also a fill line drawn near the top of the bottle, so you just squeeze until the liquid hits that mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There is no alcohol in the product so the burn factor is limited.  I remember mouth wash being kind of painful. This still burns a little, but not nearly as much as the traditional product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Great taste.  It&#x27;s hard to go wrong with mint, but it&#x27;s still something to be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> do believe that I can kiss my dentist goodbye while I use this. In fact I read the book of the same name Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth and it highly recommended this. It seems that .05% flouride is the right amount needed every night to prevent cavities. I use this religiously now. I have not needed any dental work in many years. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dead serious about my mouth care. I use this after I rinse with Closys&lt;br /&gt;mouthwash Closys Alcohol-Free Oral Rinse, With Flavor Control, 32 fl oz (946 ml) (Pack of 2) and toothpasteClosys 1C-7-24F Fluoride Toothpaste, 7 Ounce both of which which kill bacteria. This comes after my Sonicare and Waterpik, which no one should be without Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a strong mint taste which stays with me all night. It coats the teeth with flouride, encouraging enamel formation over any soft spots. This is the best we have right now for at home oral care. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had gum and teeth problems for about 50 years and this seems to be helping. I&#x27;m not a Dentist fan and have never been too enthused with paying too much for crowns and cleanings so I&#x27;m always looking for something to help fight plaque and receding gums that can be done at home. The Water Pik and Sonicare help but I&#x27;ve recently read that bacteria needs to be fought and we recently started on a system that involves using ACT Anticavity Fluoride Rinse, Closys Alcohol-Free Oral Rinse, Listerine &amp; Crest toothpaste... all with the ADA symbol on the packaging... and you can find the process on an Internet search. I checked the price for the ACT online and the price I paid here was about 37 bucks for six or about 6 bucks a bottle and that seemed in the range. However, I found it at my local food store for under 4 a bottle so I paid about 14 bucks more for it here on Amazon so check locally first. I went with Walgreen&#x27;s online price and they were also too high and I never thought of checking locally... my mistake. The process seems to be working so it gets 5 stars. The bottle is also pretty nice because you squeeze it and the fluid rises up into a portion of the bottle that holds it so you don&#x27;t need to pour it into anything. Amazon has a larger bottle of this product but it does not have the ADA seal because the active ingredient is half the required amount so you need to use twice as much so I would recommend avoiding it.</li>
    <li> I love this rinse.  It has no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth dry.  And has a super pleasant taste to it when you&#x27;re rinsing. A part of my daily ritual.</li>
    <li> It came promptly, with a few uses of the product there seems be a good result with my teeth. The bottle is easy to use and is recommended those who want healthier teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a great fluoride mouthwash. Just make sure to by the 18oz bottles NOT the 33oz bottles. The 33oz bottles are formulated for twice a day use by watering down the formula and essentially cutting the fluoride content in half and is thus NOT ADA approved. The 18oz bottle on the other had have the ADA approved dosage of fluoride and is intended for just once a day usage, which is sufficient. Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you&#x27;re getting a better deal for the 33oz bottles; you&#x27;re basically paying more for less effect.</li>
    <li> The cap makes all the difference - you do not need to pour the mouthwash into a cup. You just squeeze the bottle until the mouthwash comes up to the line that marks the right dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is pleasant, too.</li>
    <li> Ever since this being recommended by our dentist it is all that we have used.  I have found out that killing all of the bacteria in your mouth is not a good thing.  ACT is the best mouthwash available.  And it doesn&#x27;t burn!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. We have used this since our children got braces 3 years ago and we love it. I also like ordering from Preferred Mart, they ship very fast.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 30 years now and it is the only mouth rinse that I will ever use. I used the red flavored bottle for many years but I now use the green spearmint flavor. Follow the directions for gargling for at least one minute after brushing and then do not eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product after 30 years of use. I always brush now with SENSODYNE PRONAMEL TOOTHPASTE prior to gargling with ACT Mouth Rinse after every meal every day.</li>
    <li> I need a rinse with the proper % of sodium fluoride in a properly ph balanced medium.  Unfortunately, ACT is the only product available with what I need that does not have glycerine in it, which is a knock-out additive. I say unfortunately because I also do not want dyes and sorbital added, which is what ACT has, but better than having glycerine.  Why can&#x27;t they make a version of ACT without the dyes and sweetener??? It&#x27;s a mystery to me. As soon as a proper rinse without the garbage comes along, I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
    <li> If your gum bleeds, it means you need extra care to your gums.  My dentist charge me like $40 cash for a fluoride rinse.  I bought 6 bottles of this and my gum no longer a problem after 6 month check-up.</li>
    <li> I have receding gums and I bought this mouth rinse at my dentist&#x27;s suggestion. It helps protect the exposed teeth (or teeth roots) against cavity, which is great, and has a pleasant minty taste - not too strong, there is no stinging sensation as there is no alcohol in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviewers said it helped with tooth sensitivity; unfortunately this was not my case. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I use this product based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation to fight cavities.  At the same time, this seller charged me $30 for a 6-pack ($5/bottle); I was at Target just the other day and they sell the same size bottle for $3.59/bottle.  I&#x27;ll be more careful next time.  Not everything on Amazon is cheaper than other places.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. It&#x27;s by far my favorite flavor and the only ACT flavor that I actually like. This is a good and effective fluoride product for those that believe in using fluoride.</li>
    <li> i had been using a mouth wash with alcohol in it and it dried my mouth. dentist said we should use a flouride mouthwash in our water pik. bought this and because it has a top that if you squeeze the bottle it fills the neck with the correct amount of liquid and you can tip it over and just that amount pours out and into the water pik container.</li>
    <li> Tastes good.  Doesn&#x27;t burn. Great bottle dispenser. Can&#x27;t use anything with alcohol in it because it burns too much.  Like the fact it had fluoride.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was alcohol free and they sent me the one with alcohol. Unfortunately I found out only after I opened a bottle.</li>
    <li> Based on my Dentist&#x27;s advice, I stocked up on this product.  It has a squeeze dispenser that gives you just the right about.  And, it tastes better than other brands I have used.</li>
