<li> Leaves my hair soft in a way other shampoos don&#x27;t.</li>
<li> My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much and as those of us that are wavy, thick haired women living in the South</li>
<li> Nice shampoo, but hate the bottle.</li>

<li> Smooths down my frizzies.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair heavy.</li>
<li> Not easy to hold onto and squeeze.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but after using it twice I&#x27;m throwing it away.</li>
<li> Both shampoo and conditioner was drying in the shower and was hard to comb my hair without having to add oils and leave ins.</li>
<li> I have thick, voluminous, wavy/curly hair.</li>
<li> It was impossible to comb through, and looks dry and lifeless.</li>
<li> but this was the worst.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Love Organix products!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, but hate the bottle. Not easy to hold onto and squeeze.</li>
    <li> This shampoo had the opposite effect on my hair, and I used it in combination with the conditioner and shine creme. It was impossible to comb through, and looks dry and lifeless. I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but after using it twice I&#x27;m throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Subscribe &amp; Save store purchase. Love this shampoo. Highly recommend. I am very picky about hair products. Great moisture. Good for Keratin treated hair, curly hair, dry hair.</li>
    <li> A great deal, I can&#x27;t find this brand for less than ~$8 in stores.</li>
    <li> This product was not bad but the effects didn&#x27;t last that much.  It&#x27;s also cheaper at Walmart if you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off with this instead of famous name brands but there are better and slightly more expensive options also.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo! Smells perfect, tropical and nutty. Leaves my hair soft in a way other shampoos don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Great value.  Smooths down my frizzies.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo!  Leave my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful smell!  I love the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> So I just tried this shampoo for the first time and can I just say WOW! I make soap for a living and know the wonderful properties of shea butter, as well as I&#x27;ve been putting argan oil on my hair for years from Sally Beauty Supply but this just takes the cake. It&#x27; very thick but not gloppy in the hair, and has a really wonderful almost coconut like smell to it. My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much and as those of us that are wavy, thick haired women living in the South know, that is amazingly key in the humidity. So far So good and on the Subscribe and Save you can&#x27;t beat the price! I will be using this for years to come.</li>
    <li> I normally sing praises on Organix Argan Oil Shampoos but this was the worst. Both shampoo and conditioner was drying in the shower and was hard to comb my hair without having to add oils and leave ins. Will never buy again</li>
    <li> Great vegan shampoo (also use the conditioner). I have colored hair and it does NOT strip the color. It&#x27;s nice to know animal was tested for this product.</li>
    <li> This gives my hair a lot of shine without drying out my sensitive scalp. Hydrates well  and cuts down on my dry time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was made for my hair. It&#x27;s perfect. I have thick, voluminous, wavy/curly hair. This may sound nice, but it can be a pain to tame. This shampoo helps.</li>
    <li> Good quality shampoo. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Have purchased more than once.</li>
    <li> The shampoo adds volume and it works well. I&#x27;d buy it again and&lt;br /&gt;recommend it. Nice consistency, texture and scent.</li>
    <li> One bottle had opened in the box and made a huge mess. Love the shampoo though !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make hair feel very nice and has sulfates</li>
    <li> No animal testing.  Doesn&#x27;t make hair heavy.</li>
    <li> Great seller great product</li>
