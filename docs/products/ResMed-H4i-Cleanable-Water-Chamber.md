      <li>Easy to set up and use.</li>
      <li>I believe it enables me to sleep better at night because it&#x27;s so clean - no lime deposits, no mold, etc.  </li>
      <li>Functions fine, just not any more cleanable than the original chamber.</li>
      <li>This one disassembles very easily for more thorough cleaning and is easy to reassemble, and seals very well</li>
      <li>It fits my Resmed S8 just fine.</li>
      <li>and it is very nice to be able to clean it out from the bottom, only one concern</li>
      <li>The huge benefit to this design is that the bottom metal plate locks in place via a hinge.</li>
      <li>Works well, easy to clean, rugged silicon gasket.</li>
      <li>I know that this product description does not tell you which models it will fit...</li>
      <li>The replacement tank for the S8 is no longer available.</li>
      <li>I cant say enough how happy I am with this water chamber</li>

      <li>so much easier to clean!  </li>
      <li>Much easier to clean than the original</li>
      <li>This product is worth buying</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have been super gentle opening and closing this one and have not dropped it once</li>
      <li>But this chamber is much easier to clean and works very well.  </li>
      <li>My first one broke within four months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to be able to clean this thing; the old one was SO hard to really get clean.</li>
      <li>As a C-PAP user, I had the original ResMed water chamber similar to this, except mine was a chore to try to clean.  </li>
      <li>Feel more likely that your able to really clean the entire water chamber especially the bottom.</li>
      <li>and I love that you can open it and clean it properly.</li>
      <li>I did manage to bend a tooth brush enough to almost clean out my non-cleanable water chamber.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone using the ResMed bipap or cpap machines.</li>
      <li>I ordered this water chamber, and it&#x27;s nice enough, but the bottom doesn&#x27;t open like it does in the picture--it doesn&#x27;t open at all.</li>
      <li>Well worth the few extra dollars over the original enclosed chamber.</li>
      <li>and I have not had a sinus infection since I switched from the old model.</li>
      <li>No regrets, whatsoever!</li>
      <li>By opening the bottom of the chamber, cleaning with Scope infused Polident and a small nylon brush the water chamber gets clean.</li>
      <li>Very good construction with a heavier base than the stock one</li>

<li> However, the design is flawed in that the hinge connections and plate connection tabs are super thin and break easy.</li>
<li> Definitely does not lower my opinion of the seller, just at poorly designed product but better than the alternative of being sick or buying a completely new unit from another manufacturer.</li>
<li> but one of the hinge attachments has already broken and it hasn&#x27;t even been 60 days.</li>
<li> You can now get rid of all that crude that builds up in a CPAP machine.</li>

    <li> I ordered this water chamber, and it&#x27;s nice enough, but the bottom doesn&#x27;t open like it does in the picture--it doesn&#x27;t open at all. Functions fine, just not any more cleanable than the original chamber.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough how happy I am with this water chamber it fit perfect and I love that you can open it and clean it properly.</li>
    <li> The replacement tank for the S8 is no longer available. So I contacted Res Med and they said to use this one, with the S9 cover, which also bought  and did as they recommended. However the solution does not work and there is no relief for backpressure- your sinuses just fill up until you open your mouth. Total bust! I contacted Res Med and got the issue to their tech staff but they have NO SOLUTION. I guess they just want me to by an S9.... that won&#x27;t be happening. Morally bankrupt company.</li>
    <li> so much easier to clean!  Feel more likely that your able to really clean the entire water chamber especially the bottom.</li>
    <li> Very good construction with a heavier base than the stock one and it is very nice to be able to clean it out from the bottom, only one concern and it has not been an issue yet. My thinking is that if the hinges if not aligned correctly when snapping close the bottom they may brake. There is a good heavy seal which take good amount of force to compress it.</li>
    <li> a device that works! You can now get rid of all that crude that builds up in a CPAP machine. It&#x27;s a blessing.</li>
    <li> This is leaps and bounds above the chamber that comes with this machine from factory.&lt;br /&gt;The star is taken because the machine should come with this chamber BY DEFAULT.</li>
    <li> This is a huge improvement over the original 4i Water chamber. It is very easy to keep clean and I have not had a sinus infection since I switched from the old model. However, the design is flawed in that the hinge connections and plate connection tabs are super thin and break easy. My first one broke within four months. I had dropped it once so I figured it was my fault and bought another. I have been super gentle opening and closing this one and have not dropped it once but one of the hinge attachments has already broken and it hasn&#x27;t even been 60 days. I&#x27;m hoping to get a replacement unit under the 90-day warranty claim. I will keep buying replacements as needed because it is cheaper than the 2 to 3 sinus infections per year I had using the original model, but the claim of \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; and \\&quot;durable\\&quot; is false advertising in my opinion. Definitely does not lower my opinion of the seller, just at poorly designed product but better than the alternative of being sick or buying a completely new unit from another manufacturer.</li>
    <li> So much better than the sealed units.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> As a C-PAP user, I had the original ResMed water chamber similar to this, except mine was a chore to try to clean.  So I was looking for an alternative, and I am glad I found this one.  This one disassembles very easily for more thorough cleaning and is easy to reassemble, and seals very well so there is no water leakage.  Well worth the few extra dollars over the original enclosed chamber.</li>
    <li> Much easier to clean than the original</li>
    <li> Works great, fits my CPAP machine perfectly. It is very easy to clean. Wish I had bought this years ago.</li>
    <li> As a CPAP user, this ResMed water chamber is totally wicked. The huge benefit to this design is that the bottom metal plate locks in place via a hinge. By opening the bottom of the chamber, cleaning with Scope infused Polident and a small nylon brush the water chamber gets clean. Excellent design. I think the plastic might actually be thicker on this chamber than the one I get through blue cross.</li>
    <li> Fit great with my machine. Easy to set up and use. I was worried about water coming out of the bottom upon first use, but seals great! I am excited about the ease of cleaning it as needed. I used my last chamber for maybe 3 years. I am pretty sure this one will hold up as good, if not better, than the original that came with my machine!</li>
    <li> I am glad to have found this product and it was mailed with quality. No regrets, whatsoever! This product is worth buying</li>
    <li> Fits my husband&#x27;s machine perfectly. He is pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for more than 5 years!!!  I have no idea when they released this for sale, but I found it on amazon, just this week.&lt;br /&gt;I have been bending bottle brushes and toothbrushes and everything else imaginable to try to get my water chamber clean.  My CPAP model is: ResMed S8 Elite(tm) II CPAP with Easy-Breathe and H4i(tm) Heated Humidifier.  I know that this product description does not tell you which models it will fit... but it fits mine, like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;there are no words to describe the sleep i had last night....</li>
    <li> Thank goodness they finally came out with this. It fits my Resmed S8 just fine. I&#x27;m so glad to be able to clean this thing; the old one was SO hard to really get clean.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to clean, rugged silicon gasket.</li>
    <li> awesome love it so nice to be able to get in there and get it cleaned</li>
    <li> This cleanable water reservoir is the best.  I don&#x27;t know why medicare won&#x27;t pay for one.  I believe it enables me to sleep better at night because it&#x27;s so clean - no lime deposits, no mold, etc.  I highly recommend this for anyone using the ResMed bipap or cpap machines.</li>
    <li> I did manage to bend a tooth brush enough to almost clean out my non-cleanable water chamber.  But this chamber is much easier to clean and works very well.  No leaks.  Most surfaces are easy to reach.</li>
