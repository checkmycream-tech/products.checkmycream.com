<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just got it ... for a couple hour AND  I like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really great product and works as it says it does.  I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  I am a very happy customer. It also arrived early! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the intention to lighten some spots on my arms that I find unpleasant. The darkened skin areas have always been rather bothersome to me and I have been waiting for the opportunity to find a product with great reviews at a reasonable price. I recently decided to purchase the Healthy Vibes Vibrant Lightening Cream and give it a go...I have been using this product for several weeks not quite faithfully and I am excited with the results I have seen. Not only have the spots been lightened, but they are almost completely gone! I am so happy to have achieved these results right in time for tank top season! I am now considering trying this product out on various other spots in hopes of achieving more great results. I purchased this product at a discounted price in order to try it out in my home and have expressed my honest opinions here.</li>
    <li> I have some recent acne scarring and some older sun damage. So, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. So far, so good. In only a few days of use I noticed a difference. So, I&#x27;m excited to see how my face looks after a few more weeks. It also leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> got this for my girlfriend. She has been using it for a couple of days and you can really see the difference in her face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good~~~~~~~</li>
    <li> best product ever !!! i saw in a week a huge difference. I strongly suggest this product. I used on bikini area and armpits and i can say that i have tried many product before but never seen like this one !!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement been using this for a birthmark and nothing yet it&#x27;s been a little over a week of using it and nothing no changes at all 😫</li>
    <li> I have used it for a week now and I noticed my skin looked slightly lighter. This is amazing, I also use lightening masks for more impact</li>
    <li> Bought this for underarm darkness. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything out there and this honestly seems to work the best. I used it once or twice a day for over 2 weeks and I was pretty happy with the results. I don&#x27;t think results are permanent, you probably have to keep using it for it to last. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles, I&#x27;m almost done with the first one but don&#x27;t see any result yet</li>
    <li> this is a excellent brightening cream just apply a very minute amount and see the effect.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to test and give my  bised review on. Im so excited about this product it&#x27;s safe to use daily. It help&#x27;s remove any and all unwanted acne scars, skin blemishes, excess pigmentation, and dark spots. It can help even out your skin tone and get rid of the marks. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long terms benefits of this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see where this is doing anything for my skin...but I need to use it longer to see if takes a while to kick in!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin.</li>
    <li> Used this for a scar and it didn&#x27;t work. All previous reviews must have been fake</li>
    <li> it works, that is all I can say.  I have used for a week now and has definitely shown lightening.  I did use more than the recommended times which is 2 times daily.  I used maybe 3-4 daily.  Had no problems at all with it.  I can tell a difference in using it. (I paid full amount for product, not on a freebie group)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> i am very sitisfied this item  ,  my skin is vibrant</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for a while. It does get absorbed well. It&#x27;s pretty thick so it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come out too smoothy so I usually get too much out than I need. It does have a residual feeling but it&#x27;s not oily. I haven&#x27;t seen an evident effect yet but I haven&#x27;t used it consistently  enough to judge. It&#x27;s hard to find this type of cream that can work on blemishes and dark spots without having too many toxic chemicals. It does have a good percentage of natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Bottle wasn&#x27;t full at all</li>
    <li> Nope. Didn&#x27;t work one bit.</li>
    <li> Work amazingly love it I will be repurchasing soon</li>
    <li> It does work, but not as dramatic of a result that I would prefer.</li>
    <li> Bottle was really tiny</li>
    <li> 1. Extremely difficult to get out of the bottle. 2. Did not work at all. I have a very light skin tone abd most women can relate when i say my tighs rub together.. Which has left a light brown area from chaffing. I used this product twice a day, for three weeks with ZERO results. I was fooled by the aweseome reveiws. And after reading more of them after purchase i realized i was tricked... Currently working on my return process.</li>
    <li> product as described work great!!!</li>
    <li> Still waiting for the results, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Please stay away from this. Being male i don&#x27;t use any skin care products. I have a dark area on my face like  a freckle and a red spot that will not go away. So i bought this hopping it would help....it didn&#x27;t even fade either mark. I have used it daily now 3 times a day for 3 weeks .Waste of money.  I followed instructions even had to ask a Girl friend so embarrassed. I challenge the 4 star reviews.</li>
    <li> I used the lotion  for 3 weeks and no results.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a week now and I can not believe the difference it has made on my birth mark. I use to have a really big birth mark that was bright red on my inner thigh and it bothered me really badly,so I thought why not try this and I have been using it and it has lightened up some.&lt;br /&gt;With no harsh chemicals I was not worried about it causing me to break out,it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients,so there is nothing to worry about using it on that area of my body.&lt;br /&gt;This also can be used under your arm pits and on your face along with other sensitive areas of your body that you can think of:) It is perfect for everywhere. I&#x27;m going to continue using it and even try it on my under arms to try to get rid of all the redness that a razor can cause and see how well it continues to work out:) So far I&#x27;m a happy customer and I hope you are too&lt;br /&gt;I received this a little or no cost to me to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I hope yours works just as well for you as it has worked for me:)</li>
    <li> I notice the effect after the third use of the cream. My face became softer, lighter, and some light wrinkles disappeared. Works for me perfectly.</li>
    <li> I think it is working.... Nice!</li>
    <li> As someone with a healthy sex life, I try to look good for my husband and keep up my hygiene.  I was given the opportunity to test Healthy Vibes Vibrant Bright All Natural Intimate Skin Lightening Cream, in exchange for my true and unbiased review, and was excited to try it.  Before this I hadn&#x27;t really given any thought to bleaching my intimate areas but thought my husband would get a kick out of it.  I have been using it for a week now and so far it is lightening my skin and things look bright and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and smells funny too. Would not recommend.. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like this skin lightener! It is safe for my skin and I have been using it for almost a month and have not had any side effects, but I do like to point out the fact that it works. It is very easy to apply and I love the fact that it is very lightweight and it easily absorbs into my skin. I have dark spots on my face (from acne scarring) and it has absolutely lightened up my acne scars. The ingredients in this bottle are effective and it contains no harsh chemicals, which was the main reason why I wanted to try it out; this skin lightener does not dry up my skin nor breaking me out. Overall, I am a satisfied customer. I was able to purchase this during the company&#x27;s promotion in return for my unbiased feedback, and this review is based on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have only been using it for about a week now but have started to see some difference already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day everyday on my armpits and have seen no results. I am really disappointed.</li>
    <li> it works!!!!  my spot seriously faded.  But i used 2 times a day, every day!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I&#x27;m ordering another bottle today.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, however, I&#x27;ve actually found a product that works even better and on a plethora of problem areas such as stretch marks, acne scaring, fine lines and wrinkles, age spots, cellulite, and it also helps to tighten loose skin. If you want more information about the product I found go to Torypeyton.nerium.com to see REAL results and REAL science. The coolest part about Nerium is that you can get if for FREE using our 3URFREE program.</li>
    <li> Lol almost paid 30 bucks for tgi and its freaking small smh i swear it better work or ima be pist off</li>
    <li> Works great! Recommend 100%</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about trying this cream because I&#x27;ve tried several lightening creams and never had one work. I had a darkness on my inner thighs and I was really self conscious about it. It was several shades darker than my normal skin tone. Like complete opposite ends of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product once a day for about a month and a half and my skin tone is completely even. I also want to point out that I skipped at least one day a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure about the reviews because most of them were like &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days and it doesn&#x27;t stink or burn. 5 stars!&amp;#34; Like, I don&#x27;t care about that. I care whether or not it evens out skin tone and it most assuredly does. The texture is like a normal lotion and it doesn&#x27;t have a smell though. That&#x27;s a big surprise with lightening creams. It also doesn&#x27;t make your hands s different colour, just the skin that actually needs lightening, oddly. There is a very slight tingling when you put it on, but by no means is it a burning which can be common with lightening creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that this bottle is tiny and kind of hard to get out. However, it&#x27;s lasted me quite a long time and did a heavy duty job in one bottle so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Good product wish it worked faster</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin more toned looking and evened out.  Easy to apply and go.</li>
    <li> I used this amazing product for a few dark areas on my body. I have seen the most change on my inner thighs. I have dark shading between my thighs due to chafing. I have used this product 2x per week and it has dramatically helped the discoloration go down. I am so impressed with this product. I do wish it was a larger bottle but I don&#x27;t mind it since it actually works! I have just placed a second order and I can&#x27;t wait to get the areas that I want to the shading I would like. I recommend this product 100% to everyone!</li>
    <li> Seen minimal results but need to use more frequently.</li>
    <li> this is nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; must have item</li>
    <li> very silky and easy to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any results what&#x27;s so ever</li>
    <li> So far so good. I was unsure of this product but it&#x27;s slowly working. I can see certain spots lightening up :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Even helped out the redness in a few small blemishes on my face.  It isn&#x27;t sticky our greasy, and makeup easily put on after full absorbed, but if your just doing this on your face...this could last four months.  It only takes a small drop and it covers all areas.</li>
    <li> This is a natural lotion that will not stain your clothes, it&#x27;s somewhat expensive but I&#x27;ve really had a great experience. I&#x27;m trying to remove some stretch marks from my back and this has really helped. I&#x27;m glad I bought this! Recommended for everyone</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t like the container its in! Can&#x27;t squeeze the cream out or shake it out. The cream is light weight and it doesn&#x27;t take much to spread. I have been using the on a dark age spot on my upper lip for two weeks now. I did take a before picture but much changed. I plan on continuing it for the spot and dark circles under my eyes to be far and will post my before and after pic.</li>
    <li> awesome just ordered 2 more bottles , bottles should have been bigger though and same price lol.</li>
    <li> The bottle says you should see results in as little as two weeks. I never saw a change in the pigmentation of the areas where I applied it. Also, I do not think the bottle was full when it was shipped. I only used a small amount each time because of the limited volume. I was really hoping to see a change. I have ordered two additional bottles and will post after applying and following the instructions for a second time. We will see. . .</li>
    <li> This really does work! It&#x27;s only been a week and I can totally tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I used this product on the darker areas on my face. In some areas it is working. I have not finished the entire bottle but I am noticing a difference so far. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> This item works great! I started to see results within 1 week, after the second week I could see a big change. I used it everyday, twice a day.</li>
    <li> Helpful for darkening skin under arms and around neck!</li>
    <li> Waste of money and time</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, not recommend.</li>
    <li> This works! If you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll see the results. Take a before and after picture so you can see the results yourself. I use it twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening. The new pump makes it so much easier to dispense. This is my second time ordering and will definitely keep on ordering</li>
    <li> Love this, it is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So far - waiting, just received. Shipped and delivered as promised. Good stuff. Would buy again !! Used to be black, now I&#x27;m Polish !!</li>
    <li> Excited to see how this turns out! Only used a few days so I haven&#x27;t seen much change. The lotion in creamy and and smooth on skin. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t have any foul odors like most lighting lotions!</li>
    <li> Really good quality~!. I&#x27;m really satisfied with this one!!!</li>
    <li> This product is  amazing and works so well and fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream on my hands to see if I can reduce the color of the age spots that keep appearing.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference, but maybe it will just take a little longer.  For the price, I am willing to continue to try it.  The fragrance is nice and feels like a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 2 weeks now on my intimate areas... and I am very impressed.  Works faster than anything else I have tried.  I put in on in the morning once I get out of the shower to let it soak in before putting on my clothes and occasionally, if I think about it before I go to bed!  Works very well... I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> Have used this item 4 times now and can alreay see a lightening of the skin.  I was given a discount on this item in return for an honest review.  I was skeptical but thought I would give it a try.  I have some skin on the top of my thigh that is noticibly darker than the rest of my leg.  And I see results!!  No burning or itching either.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Very effective at fading dark spots and discolorations for an even skin tone. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of sun spots on my face and i have to tell you, its actually working! Over 2 weeks the spots are now slowly fading. Which is awesome because they were pretty dark. I highly recommend this product for anyone with sun spots.</li>
    <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
    <li> It really did lighten up my private parts.  Just have to do it twice a day continuously.  I used it on my elbows as well, and they got soft and lighter.  This small bottle lasted over a month.  Ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have skin darkening on my face.  I am a warm toned causation person with freckles.  After having my forth baby I had skin darkening on my face.  I have a list of things to try to lighten these areas - one on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I decided to try this &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product.  I was disappointed to find that this product does contain parabens and a number of other non-natural ingredients, but I&#x27;m really not all that surprised.  Against my better judgement I tried a bit of this cream on the two areas on my face.  I used it twice a day for over two weeks with no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the fine print of the bottle says &amp;#34;all natural intimate skin lightening cream&amp;#34; - it says elsewhere on the bottle and on on Amazon to use anywhere, so why does it say &amp;#34;intimate?&amp;#34;  Would it have worked better in an area that doesn&#x27;t see the sun much? This stuff is a waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Every one use to tease me a lot in my school by seeing my face with dark spots .I bought this Skin lightening cream and applied twice a day for a week .My face looks very bright without any dark spots and I was really happy .This product contains no chemicals and made with all natural ingredients. Add colour to your life..don’t miss it.</li>
    <li> I know I should be grateful for any improvements at all, but I was hoping for slightly more noticeable improvements a little faster. Somedays I even ask myself if perhaps it&#x27;s just the cream film making it all look a little lighter? it&#x27;s that marginal of a gain. To top it all it came over a month after using the cream twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because a gain is a gain I&#x27;d give it 4 stars... except this cream has a FOUL smell to it! so using it in your underarms, inner thighs, or private regions is out of the question. If you do it would be at night before bed and forget about getting lucky :P  I personally had to only use it on visible areas because well the stink  I can&#x27;t imagine it in other areas, i cant picture sitting on this and getting sweaty with that smell anywhere. so a star deduction because I&#x27;m feeling generous.</li>
    <li> Used twice a day for seven weeks. No change. No fading at all. Does not do anything.</li>
    <li> Be patient...it will take some time, but gradually age spots and old acne scars begin to fade....keep buying this one, it will be one of your must haves!</li>
    <li> Great product but not enough in the bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month now and sadly, I have seen no change. I use twice a day on certain areas, as the instruction say. I really wanted this product to work, especially  due to the cost. Not so lucky this time.</li>
    <li> It does not work very fast it needs time I guess that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> it really works. I use it on some private areas and they are getting lighter</li>
    <li> Used and entire bottle and don&#x27;t see not the minimum difference. Terrible product, won&#x27;t ask for refund cause I don&#x27;t like wasting my time .</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding oil. I use it every morning and its perfect. I love how it smells and feels. Great purchase. Thanks.</li>
    <li> first timer but it doesnt upset my skin which is super sensitive so im gonna keep using on the dark spots and will see if there will be any difference</li>
    <li> Bottle too small no enough to tell a difference...but I enjoyed the moisturizing properties.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Not all that noticeable, but I haven&#x27;t kept up with what the directions say either.</li>
    <li> Let me tell ya, this stuff works wonders on my booty hole. Since using this product the selfies of my region have been getting lots of attention on grindr</li>
    <li> This is a cool, non-greasy lotion that you apply twice a day. In about a week, I saw a definite improvement on the spot I was attempting to lighten, though it wasn&#x27;t quite gone yet. I do expect to see it gone with continued use. Also, this cream is odor-free, so you won&#x27;t stink when you use it. I included a before and after to show you one week&#x27;s results. I&#x27;m quite pleased with it! I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> The soft, moist feeling....</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for a close friend of mine who has been telling me she wanted a product like this for quite some time now. She was so excited to learn that I got it for her. She has already put it to use and according to her, it is not greasy and rubs onto the skin very smoothly. It had no scent, and does not irritate her skin at all. In fact, she says it made her skin feel pretty soft afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: She says hat she stopped using it after a while, not because it didn&#x27;t work, but because it would stay wet on her skin all day. Instead of soaking into the skin, it seemed to just sit on top and it bothered her. But that was the only issue she had with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review</li>
