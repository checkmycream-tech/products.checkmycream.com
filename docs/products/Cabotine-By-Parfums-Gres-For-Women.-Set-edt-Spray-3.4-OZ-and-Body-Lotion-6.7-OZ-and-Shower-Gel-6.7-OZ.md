      <li>WONDERFUL GIFT SET FOR SOMEONE OF ANY AGE.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for warmer spring/summer days-- when wearing a heavier scent would be wayyyyy too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very Good quality</li>
      <li>The Product is good!</li>
      <li>My sister in law absolutely loved it!</li>

      <li>Beautiful classic fragrance.</li>
      <li>Probably a good idea to purchase perfume online with a scent that you are familiar with, unless you are an easy going risk taker with a sense of adventure  :)</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>They all love it.</li>
      <li>I GET SOOOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM MY PATIENTS ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>i remember when my mother gifted me this perfume on my birthday.</li>
      <li>I love Cabotine.</li>
      <li>Nice, light, .clean scent</li>
      <li>Love it love it</li>
      <li>I get so very many compliments on this fresh and clean scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is perfect for everyday activities, going to the gym, out for coffee with friends, or a light fragrance to wear to the office that is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Others always comment that it smells very \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This is my preference for a very fresh, clean, and light fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is light, floral, clean and the scent lasts.</li>
      <li>I always feel upbeat and clean after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being around the person who uses this scent I can say that it is a light and fresh scent that is not over powering.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very please to see it in amazon, specially with such a great price.</li>
      <li>I rec&#x27;d it about two days later and absolutely LOVE it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Their set is often more economical than buying the individual products.  </li>
      <li>Cabotine was launched the year I got married and my husband bought one for me.</li>
      <li>This fragance is awesome,i met my husband when i first put it on.</li>
      <li>I smelled this on a customer two weeks ago who came into my store to shop and promptly went on here to order it knowing that it would be EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a gift for someone who absolutely loves this scent and has been wearing it for years.  </li>
      <li>My daughter who was an airline attendant got me started on this years ago......</li>
      <li>This is such a wonderfully clean smelling shower gel, it is uplifting to the senses and acts almost like aromatherapy.  </li>
      <li>it gives the wearer an extra opportunity to enjoy the fragrance and also made for a complete gift as a gift giver.</li>
      <li>Highly receommended.</li>
      <li>It has a fresh scent and it last all day.</li>

<li> I have been obsessed to this parfum for years and can&#x27;t always get it for less than 75 dollars retail.</li>

I am a hard person to get fragrances for. I rec&#x27;d it about two days later and absolutely LOVE it! It is light, floral, clean and the scent lasts. My signature frangrance has been Realities for Women by Realities Cosmetics for years and I have had no luck finding another one I liked until now. Highly receommended.</li>
    <li> My sister in law absolutely loved it! The products were very nice presented in a lovely box, perfect if you are looking for a nice present.</li>
    <li> I have been obsessed to this parfum for years and can&#x27;t always get it for less than 75 dollars retail. I don&#x27;t know why I never thought of Amazon.com before for my fragrances. Chanel #5 is the next purchase from here. 3 largest bottles offered with shower gel and lotion ALL less than what they want in the stores for ONE bottle. Crazy, if I went to a retail shop like Nordstroms or Macy&#x27;s I would be so very very disappointed.  Thank you guys!!!!!!  Love it love it love it love!!!!!!</li>

This is definitely a fragrance that I always keep in stock for my fragrance collection.  I receive a lot of compliments on it.
