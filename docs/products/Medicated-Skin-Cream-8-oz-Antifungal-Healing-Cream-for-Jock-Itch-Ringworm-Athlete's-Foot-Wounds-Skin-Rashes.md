      <li>We literally use this on everything, it is quite effective at eliminating and soothing itches.  </li>
      <li>have given it 3 stars since it does temporarily alleviate the itching, but for what I paid for this stuff it should do more than that.</li>
      <li>but we did not want to risk me needing more time off work.  </li>
      <li>4 more times</li>
      <li>For me works like lotion, I was looking for more of a medicated cream.  </li>

      <li>The smell is pleasant, not having much of an odor, and thankfully you receive quite the tub of product.  </li>
      <li>After showering and before going to school, we placed All Stop to the areas immediately creating relief and an easy recovery.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it is easy to use, fast, and effective.  </li>

      <li>ringworm (got to love camp!), and many other origins of itches and scratches.  </li>
      <li>super Pine-Sol</li>
      <li>$30.00 is worth it to me.  </li>

    <li> This product does exactly what its says it will do.  My skin was feeling really funny after my   trip to Europe this summer.  Had no ideal what the problem was.  Explored online and decided to   get this product.  Problem was ZAPPED right away.  All stop Medicated cream really works. Thanks  again Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had somehow contracted a case of ringworm. Never having experienced anything like this before&lt;br /&gt;I researched and found this recommended. It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> My husband tried it for almost 4 weeks and it just made my husbands rash much worser then what it was. If you have senitive skin be aware. I personally did not care for the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with unbearable itchy athletes foot for 6 year spending hundreds on prescription and otc creams.  Used this all stop one time and had 90% improvement overnight.  4 more times and i cant even tell i ever had a problem.  I would definitely reccomend it.</li>
    <li> For me works like lotion, I was looking for more of a medicated cream.  And the crystals that form are annoying and don&#x27;t all go away in the microwave!</li>
    <li> this cream tryed it on my ringworm and it made things worst,contacted the company and requested a refund,i say the best thing to treat ringworm is with tea tree oil,</li>
    <li> I picked this up because I have been itching like a flea bag. I have incontinence caused by nerve damage, and wear diapers about 90% of the time. I developed some serious itch in the \\&quot;crotchular region\\&quot; which I believe to be jock itch due to the moisture in that area. I have tried this cream, and find the granules (looks like rock salt) contained in the cream to be annoying, and somewhat painful in such a sensitive area. Though it does somewhat relieve the itching, it appears to be irritating my skin, and doing nothing to permanently alleviate the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given it 3 stars since it does temporarily alleviate the itching, but for what I paid for this stuff it should do more than that. I would have been better off with one of the cheaper powders. I&#x27;m usually a bit leary of these \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; remedies being 90% of them are quack medicine anyway. I just hoped that this was a good one based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t already used half of it; I would request a refund. Now I have to pay to go to the doctor on top of what I paid for this. I think I will stick to actual FDA approved treatments in the future.</li>
    <li> 8/1/12 -I ordered the cream Sunday, received on Wednesday.  I did not even pay for express shipping.  We thought My 4 year old had ringworm, and we had been using [[ASIN:B001269GK6 Lotrimin AF-Lotrimin Anti Fungal Jock Itch Clotrimazole Cream, (2 Pack) 12g Tube (2 pack)]] for 8 days with no improvement. I opened the jar and the first thing I thought of it smells like a camp bathroom super Pine-Sol like? I suppose its because of the pine and tea tree oils. I am not a fan of of those smells and it&#x27;s pretty strong.  There are grainy clear crystals.  Almost like a crusty part of lotion.  My son said the lotion was itchy.  I called Q-Based solutions they said it was MSM a white sulfur that contains antifungal properties.  They said it dissolves with heat by either rubbing it in or heating the cream up.  I will say I did not notice the crystals in his clothing so it must have been true.&lt;br /&gt;Their website states:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Kill Ringworm Fungus Now&lt;br /&gt;Stop the Itch, Burning and Inflammation&lt;br /&gt;100% Guaranteed 48 Hour Results\\&quot;  [[ASIN:B001VISR78 All Stop Antifungal, Antiparasitic Medicated Skin Cream - 8 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using cream on a Wednesday.  It was not cleared up by Friday (48 hours)  We started an oral antibiotic on Friday.  It had faded a little on Friday but we did not want to risk me needing more time off work.  Low and behold the rash cleared up by Sunday. He was back in daycare on Monday.  We were still using Lotrimin the whole time.  What worked?  I am not entirely sure.  I wish that I had tried the cream from the get go. $30.00 is worth it to me.  The oral medication we got was Griseofulvin.  It was an oral suspension.  It was over $100.00.  I feel that compared to the cost of the medication, I should have ordered this cream sooner as if it was what did the trick, I could have saved my self time off work and one hundred bucks.  Once it cleared up we discontinued use about 2 days after as I do not really like the smell.  I will keep it in my cupboard as it was quite a large jar and it may be something I need again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/3/13 Almost a year later I thought I would give an update, it turns out I do not believe my son actually ever had ringworm.  It was really bad eczema.  We changed wipes from diaper, to the \\&quot;adult ones\\&quot; about the same time the rash appeared.  After months of battling it, we stopped using the wipes and the rash went away.  I would say this product did not help exema.  Can&#x27;t attest at all for helping with ringworm as his Dr now said he probably never had it.s it was quite a large jar and it may be something I need again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/3/13 Almost a year later I thought I would give an update, it turns out I do not believe my son actually ever had ringworm.

Can&#x27;t attest at all for helping with ringworm as his Dr now said he probably never had it.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all so.i am give it a1star I am so disappointed never a will buy this product again sorry</li>
    <li> I did not like this cream at all...it is too gritty.  it drys on your skin and leaves a film like calamine lotion with very grainy texture then the grains fall off.  Put it on at bedtime and woke up during the night feeling like sand in the sheets.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Med skin cream seem work.</li>
    <li> I was in a high skin-contact sport for years where ringworm was prevalent. Lotramin, all the others never worked will. This stuff nixes it within days. Yes, its grainy, yes, it smells medicinal, but it works AMAZING. If you or your kids are in wrestling, jiu-jitsu or other sports, with high skin contact, you NEED to have this in your closet. Best product I&#x27;ve ever seen for ringworm.</li>
    <li> It is definitely very soothing and does what it says it will do.  It is a  very nice and helpful product.</li>
    <li> My family absolutely loves All Stop!  Trust me living in a household full of boys brings a fare share of foot funguses, random rashes, ringworm (got to love camp!), and many other origins of itches and scratches.  Not to mention it is easy to use, fast, and effective.  Just recently my youngest son developed athlete&#x27;s foot from the locker room and developed horrible red patches and uncontrollable itchiness.  After showering and before going to school, we placed All Stop to the areas immediately creating relief and an easy recovery. We literally use this on everything, it is quite effective at eliminating and soothing itches.  I make my kids tote it around for every camping expedition; you never know when you will need it. Usually we see results around three days of application.  The smell is pleasant, not having much of an odor, and thankfully you receive quite the tub of product.  I can continue to use this kid after kid, infection after infection.  It is a must have for the family medicine cabinet.  Try for yourself!  5/5 stars!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I had a ring worm on my neck from recused cat. this cream helped it heal a lot! one jar should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> The product is too grainy to use.  The MSM is not desolved and leaves little &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; wherever you apply it.</li>
    <li> It does EXACTLY what is says it does. Use it as directed as well as other needed precautions when dealing with skin fungi and you will be more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> I put it in the microwave and it got rid of most of the grittiness.  It did work for the rash I had.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a red skin &amp;#34;heat rash&amp;#34; in my crotch since I was a teenager in the late 70s.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of treatments.  All Stop cured it.  It took six months of applying 2-3 days a week (when I got done with the gym).  New skin grew back and looks normal.  it&#x27;s also incredible on athlete&#x27;s foot.  I put some between my toes, put on my socks, and a day later it&#x27;s all healing and itch free.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I believe that I have ringworm in my hair because I had it around the nape of my neck. My hair constantly has an odor after two days of washing and because I&#x27;m not of white descent I can&#x27;t wash it quite as often. I tried to tell numerous doctors about it but since I&#x27;m not bald, nor have patches, they don&#x27;t seem to believe me. Therefore I figured I&#x27;d try this product and finally something helps! It also cleared up my remaining ringworms!</li>
    <li> Used for about 2 weeks on a bad jock strap itch problem. If you are persistant and keep using this product it will work. Note, the product has some type of very small type solid balls in them. Weird feeling at first but not 4/5 star demotion because if it.</li>
    <li> Ugh!  The one item I bought to fight mites that didn&#x27;t work as promised and aggravated the problem.  A complete waste of money! Very displeased!</li>
    <li> THE ONLY THING I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE, WAS THE SMELL.</li>
