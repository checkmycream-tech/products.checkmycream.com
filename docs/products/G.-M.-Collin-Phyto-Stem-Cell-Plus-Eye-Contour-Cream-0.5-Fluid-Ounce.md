<ol>
    <li> No change noted at all after 3 weeks. I am very dsappointed since i have used other products by GM Collin that were excellent. Would nver purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This eye counter cream is the best I have ever used....my eyes would be puffy every morning...not anymore...only need to use a tiny bit for both eyes...great for mature eyes...saw a difference right away...should last at least 4 months....used to buy it my Salon but doesn&#x27;t carry this eye cream any longer...so happy I could get it on Amazon because I cannot live without it</li>
    <li> All I have to say, is simply try this product.  You will love it.  It is creamy and not greasy at all.  The GM Collins Phyto Stem Cell+ Eye Contour Cream goes right into my skin.  My make-up does not smear or skip from using this product.  I have tried a few of GM Collins eye creams but the Phyto Stem Cell is my favorite.  It is less expensive than some department store brands that run $100 or more.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very creamy and smells nice.  I like it a lot.  Does it work?  I don&#x27;t really know, but my skin feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been using product for a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a great eye cream.  I&#x27;m 35 and don&#x27;t have too many problems with my skin but I wanted to start to protect it.  This cream is very light, goes on like silk and moisturizes all day.  It&#x27;s great under makeup and makes my eyes seem brighter.  It really works!  The only problem is that I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Excellent results . I use the rest of facial products in the line and am pleased with the results from using GM Collins.  Great value for money as a little does the job.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was expecting.  It arrived in closed packaging and was good quality.  The last Collin product I purchased ( Cleanser) arrived in a package which had been opened.  Since I don&#x27;t trust a product which has been opened, especially if it is used on the skin, I can&#x27;t use it.  I will be sending it back...very unhappy.  A word to the suppliers - please made sure the cosmetics are packaged correctly!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews however I&#x27;ve tried everything from A-Z , pharmacy to Neimans and this cream is the best. Puffy eyes are gone the next day if not hours. I bought this cream for my mother as well and she can&#x27;t be without it. She keeps one bottle as a back up at all times, it&#x27;s that amazing!!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is part of the GM Collin Phyto Stem Cell line and provides excellent results.  You will see marked changes under and above your eyes within a week to 10 days.  Some maybe even sooner. I don&#x27;t have crows feet luckily but If I did I&#x27;m pretty sure those would be diminished as well.  I love this line, it really does work miracles.  And...about 40% cheaper on Amazon compared to their website or salons.  A little bit goes a long way btw.</li>
    <li> one of the best seller, definitely recommend with A++ satisfaction</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, and I like this one the best.  I like the GM Collin line, and think this softens the crows feet and wrinkles below my eyes.  Very expensive in the salons, but Amazon has the best prices anywhere!</li>
    <li> Great eye cream, I&#x27;ve used it for some time now and definitely notice a difference in the fine lines and the skin around the eye is \\&quot;brighter\\&quot;. Also almost 1/2 the price on Amazon vs Spa.</li>
    <li> I have been using GM Collin ever since a trip to a spa in Tuscon several years ago. I still use many of the products in this line which are fabulous as well, but this one is really special.  Love the feel of the serum and I think it helps with hydration and smoothing under the eyes.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the supplier gave me a bottle that had a shelf life of only 3 months!!</li>
    <li> This product is okay, no great shakes. I won&#x27;t reorder, but will search for something else. Sorry for me. Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> Great products!  Last a very long time! Just a small amount each day.  Great for older skin so many products only work if you have no wrinkles.  Leaves me with soft, smooth skin at 73 I don&#x27;t need makeup and get compliments all the time. Can&#x27;t go wrong with any of this product!!</li>
    <li> I think that Collin makes a nice product, but for the money, I would find a different Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;The Packaging is deceiving and what you get is not what you see!&lt;br /&gt;Product Nice, Value not so nice!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product and I am satisfied</li>
    <li> I like their products; I just need things with more kick</li>
    <li> Works for me. Refreshing in the morning. Lasts for many hours.</li>
    <li> This eye contour cream has such a nice smooth application that I actually look forward to putting it on morning and nights.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered prompt and sealed in original box. Great product!</li>
    <li> This eye cream works amazing. It has really brightened the area around my eyes and helped to soften the lines. I also love the fresh clean smell!</li>
