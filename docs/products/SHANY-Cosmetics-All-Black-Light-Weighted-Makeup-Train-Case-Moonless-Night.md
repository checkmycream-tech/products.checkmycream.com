      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to carry around and</li>
      <li>I would strongly advise against purchasing this item.</li>
      <li>and i love the products!if youre looking to start your makeup kit, this is the right way to go!</li>
      <li>but it works fine without them.  </li>
      <li>But, with the mess at airport now, this case it perfect.</li>
      <li>When you opened the case, there was a huge chalk mark (looks like the number 84) on one of the trays.</li>
      <li>The outside was not of great quality either.</li>
      <li>This case isn&#x27;t heavy and has perfect storage space.</li>
      <li>I just received it today and as soon as I opened it, it felt cheap.</li>
      <li>but it was cheap</li>
      <li>I enjoy the strap as well, its comfortable and doesn&#x27;t make it feel im carrying a load over my shoulder.</li>
      <li>I have gone threw so many caboodle&#x27;s, train cases, I have even tried tackling boxes but they never hold up or not the right size</li>
      <li>The quality of the items is amazing, and you get so much for such a good price.</li>
      <li>When the case came in I was super excited that I dropped it</li>
      <li>It has different shapes and good depth for everything.</li>
      <li>For the price you can&#x27;t really beat this case :)</li>
      <li>so I had to super glue the dividers</li>
      <li>I love the print of this case which still looks professional but fun!</li>
      <li>The only thing is the handle is kind of flimsy at times</li>
      <li>Liked the outside and the size, but the dividers for the trays were quite shabby and were falling apart by the time it got shipped to me.</li>
      <li>The case is easily my favorite part - so professional looking, yet durable.</li>
      <li>Never again will I spend money on a shany product but what did I expect for $35 right,</li>
      <li>/&gt;Before I opened the case, I thought I&#x27;d made the right investment.</li>
      <li>When I opened the case the dividers fell apart, like someone made them right before delivery</li>
      <li>I was going to just hot glue the material, however realized the box did not close in alignment either.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what it is.  </li>
      <li>I will be returning this item as I am sure the person I give it to will feel the same as I do even though they picked it out.</li>
      <li>Having this case makes me feel very organized!</li>
      <li>Def reccomend to anyone looking for a high quality case and very travel friendly.</li>
      <li>Easy enough return process.</li>
      <li>Quality, sturdy case and rather large.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s lighter but here&#x27;s the downside it&#x27;s made with cardboard and rubber stickers and feels very flimsy.  </li>
      <li>Even if something doesn&#x27;t cost much workmanship should be something disregarded.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very comparable to the $100</li>
      <li>:  Cheap construction, especially the interior.  </li>
      <li>Like another reviewer said the dividers were falling apart and didn&#x27;t fit into the slots - it was too short.</li>
      <li>The case lining keeps my makeup from sliding around too much.  </li>
      <li>The dividers did not hold together well and the rubber glued on the inside of the case was not sticking to the case very well either.</li>
      <li>the dividers are made of particle board and the material liner for the dividers were completely peeled off right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I will need to super glue them back on (which I should not have to do).</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I love how its black!</li>
      <li>or I have a hard time getting my makeup to fit right.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for more serious usage or traveling simply because I think it would fall apart quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is a Fantastic little makeup case.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product, and I would advise spending a little extra money to buy something more durable.</li>
      <li>I had purchased this to give to my daughter as a Christmas present and was very ashamed by the quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This case is as expected in that it is the correct size, shape and color however it is very cheaply made and rickety.  It is MUCH cheaper than most cases of similar design which would excuse the exposed glue and cheap material however the fact that it is flimsy enough that it can be difficult to close made it a little too cheap to excuse.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t really beat this case :) I love that it isn&#x27;t super heavy, so traveling with it isn&#x27;t too difficult. It hold all my makeup that I need well and I have room left over for other stuff too.</li>
    <li> Talk about a bargain! This case literally has everything you will ever need to do your makeup. The quality of the items is amazing, and you get so much for such a good price. The case is easily my favorite part - so professional looking, yet durable. Win/win!</li>
    <li> Good bargain! Very comparable to the $100+ train cases. Quality, sturdy case and rather large.  The dividers did not work at all but it works fine without them.  The case lining keeps my makeup from sliding around too much.  I would recommend it for this price compared to the expensive brands that you would pay triple for.</li>
    <li> When I got this case, it was double the size of what I actually needed. It looked nice, but when I opened it, it appeared a bit flimsy and I questioned its durability. In the end, I returned this case, mostly due to it being too big. Easy enough return process.</li>
    <li> my best friend got this for me cause she knows that i want to be a professional make up artist one day and i have tons of make up and i do other peoples makeup from time to time so she bought this for me for my birthday and its just perfect its so light weight , stores so much stuff, and its durable , i love it</li>
    <li> 34.99 for a great train case! Usually a sleek black train case start of at $50 and up. So I figured I should get this cause I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to find it anywhere else.  When the case came in I was super excited that I dropped it but to my surprise it didn&#x27;t get dinged! Yay! So I knew this case was durable. I enjoy the strap as well, its comfortable and doesn&#x27;t make it feel im carrying a load over my shoulder.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Shany came out with something so chic! Black is very classy! I love the price because I have a hard time spending money on things that are rediculously priced! This is the perfect size for my makeup, and I have a lot!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CASE...PERFECT SIZE AND VERY STURDY FOR TRAVEL...IT FITS ALL MY TRAVELING MAKEUP FOR AN AWAY TRIP...MY MAKEUP IS VERY SAFE IN THIS..WOULD RECOMMEND 100X!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a kit like this for ages. its portable, durable, and and i love the products!if youre looking to start your makeup kit, this is the right way to go!</li>
    <li> I love the case so much, the detail of it and the feel is really nice! Anyone I believe would be just as happy with it as I am!</li>
    <li> always wanted a box like this, so this deal is good....its black so it won&#x27;t get dirty...so getting this is always a plus because makeup can always spill and get dirty so easily and this is just awesome.</li>
    <li> This is the best case by far on the market. I have bought several different cases in my day and this is the only one that has held up and stood the test of time. Fits everything you could imagine and then some more!! Def reccomend to anyone looking for a high quality case and very travel friendly.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know a ton about makeup you don&#x27;t need a ton of makeup. If you do have a ton of makeup you need a place to put it. I help the drama clubs with their makeup and the school asked me what makeup I would need. I gave them a list and this as well. This is perfect for when I&#x27;m rushing on kids&#x27; makeup. Everything has it&#x27;s place and everything gets puts back in its place or someone loses a hand! This case isn&#x27;t heavy and has perfect storage space. It has different shapes and good depth for everything.</li>
    <li> This train case looked nice when I opened the box but when i opened that case the dividers were falling a part. I was not sent a return label so I had to super glue the dividers and there are scratches along the edges of the case when you open it that I cant do anything about. Over all it will do the job but it was cheap and I don&#x27;t think it will last long at all....... Low quality</li>
    <li> I purchased this case for my 11-year-old daughter for a Christmas gift. It arrived in a timely fashion and was packaged appropriately. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything extravagant based on the price, perhaps department store quality. The dividers are fiberboard wrapped in foam. All were laying loose in the bottom of the case and approximately 70% of them were warped and the foam covers were falling off. In addition, the liner was pulling away from the interior of the case. I am appalled this product made it out the door!! Thank goodness I checked everything before I placed the gifts in the attic!! I will NEVER purchase another Shany product!</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas present for my daughter and although she likes the size of it, you have to be careful opening and closing as it is not high quality like the one I bought at Sephora for 30.00 more.</li>
    <li> I just received it today and as soon as I opened it, it felt cheap. Like another reviewer said the dividers were falling apart and didn&#x27;t fit into the slots - it was too short. When the trays were pulled out, it&#x27;s flimsy and hits the side of the case. I processed a return the same day I received it... It&#x27;s also bigger than the dimensions described. It was a litte bigger, but I didn&#x27;t mind. However, the description needs to be corrected. The case I received was 14 x 8.5 x 10... something along those measurements.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift. My friend liked that it had dividers that she could create her personalized compartments.  Have had no issue with quality of material just yet mentioned in some of the other reviews.</li>
    <li> The lining looked like it had been thrown into the makeup case with no regards to the appearance.  The lining on the dividing tabs were all coming unglued.  I had purchased this to give to my daughter as a Christmas present and was very ashamed by the quality.</li>
    <li> Huge and fits everything well!</li>
    <li> It is small and not that heavy so it&#x27;s easy to carry around and plus it comes with a strap which makes it even easier to carry. Since the case is black and not noticeable if its is dirty.</li>
    <li> This is a Fantastic little makeup case. My Daughter gave me this for Mothers day and I love it. I was using one of the bigger roll around cases for traveling and when going by car or bus it is great. But, with the mess at airport now, this case it perfect. I can carry everything I need. All of my cosmetics are organized and they don&#x27;t get all broken up. One trick I do use when traveling by airplane is pack your cosmetic sponges around your eyeshadows for extra padding, this helps ensure they don&#x27;t get totally ruined by the apes handling the luggage. This case has held up extremely well. I recommend it to everyone. Linda W</li>
    <li> I love how its black! goes with everything. great storage for makeup. lots of things fit! and price is pretty good. can&#x27;t complain about that. highly recommend. don&#x27;t bother with other drug store type storage this is the one you need!</li>
    <li> The packing wasn&#x27;t an issue, arrived on time as estimated by amazon; However, the product delivered was pooooooooor quality. Never again will I spend money on a shany product but what did I expect for $35 right, wrong! Even if something doesn&#x27;t cost much workmanship should be something disregarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I opened the case, I thought I&#x27;d made the right investment. When I opened the case the dividers fell apart, like someone made them right before delivery (adhesive didn&#x27;t hold the bond between the foam they wrapped the cardboard with) and the linings on the pull out shelves was all jacked up. Never again, I say... Never Again. Now, I will spend $110 on the sephora case.</li>
    <li> I was absolutely disappointed in it. I opened it and the thing was falling apart already. The areas where it was glued were falling apart. It was not worth what I payed for it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Needed a larger make up box for my daughter than what I could find in the stores. Liked the outside and the size, but the dividers for the trays were quite shabby and were falling apart by the time it got shipped to me. Nothing a little glue won&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> Pros:  Low cost.  Lot&#x27;s of Space.  Good organization possibilities.  Nice, good looking exterior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Cheap construction, especially the interior.  I had to re-stick a bunch of the padding and, generally, the internal trays and unfolding mechanisms are of dubious construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:  It is what it is and you get what you pay for.  I was expecting something on the cheaper side and that&#x27;s exactly what it is.  That said, it is perfect for my daughter:  Fit&#x27;s all her make up and accessories nicely, keeps her organized, etc.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for more serious usage or traveling simply because I think it would fall apart quickly.  But for sitting in a bedroom, keeping a teenager happy and looking cool?  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I have gone threw so many caboodle&#x27;s, train cases, I have even tried tackling boxes but they never hold up or not the right size or I have a hard time getting my makeup to fit right. With this one I will never have to worry about that again. Great product!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat Shany&#x27;s prices for quality product.  I use Shany every day! I love the print of this case which still looks professional but fun!</li>
    <li> I have the mac makeup case and it&#x27;s pretty heavy so I decided to get this one...it is bigger than mac and it&#x27;s lighter but here&#x27;s the downside it&#x27;s made with cardboard and rubber stickers and feels very flimsy.  The dividers inside the box does not line up so the it un useable, too short so it does reach both side so it sort of useless.  I tried peeling of the rubber inside the dividers than it exposed the board.  But my mac case was $200 and this is only 35.  So I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This case makes taking your makeup on the go easy. i like that it is all black, so that if you wanted to personalize it, you still could.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed, gave it as a gift and the inside literally smelled like some type of glue and many of the segregation pieces were unglued and coming apart. The outside was not of great quality either. I found something from Caboodles 15 dollars cheaper and much better quality. I returned this and Amazon was great about it as always.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! especially the brushes that come with it! there so great! i also love the box! the makeup is great quality!</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup case around for the price! Quality materials and the adjustable grids make for creative organization. The lock &amp; key also protects your cosmetic investments!</li>
    <li> This case would be perfect for any makeup artist! I really liked the box itself. It is sturdy and easy to use! It very useful! Having this case makes me feel very organized! This case is very handy to use for traveling. Check it our for yourself! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> the dividers are made of particle board and the material liner for the dividers were completely peeled off right out of the box.  Poor adhesive.  I was going to just hot glue the material, however realized the box did not close in alignment either.  VERY disappointed. Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> I knew for $40 the make up case will not be very good quality. The exterior is sturdy and can hold up the contents inside the case. However, I was disappointed the layered trays inside  is made of inferior quality cardboard. The cardboard was wrapped in rubber but it wasn&#x27;t glued properly. This goes with all the adjustable dividers to organize your make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought of returning it but decided to keep it. For what I will be using it for, occassional make up gigs, it will do.</li>
    <li> I just received this make up case that I purchased as a gift. While I realize it is only $30, it is deplorable. When I received it, the outer box was slightly damaged. I just chalked it up to boxes being shifted around and such. When I opened it, I was shocked at the poor quality. When you opened the case, there was a huge chalk mark (looks like the number 84) on one of the trays. There is glue visible on the sides of the case. The dividered are foam covered pieces of cardboard and the foam was coming off the dividers. I will be returning this item as I am sure the person I give it to will feel the same as I do even though they picked it out. I would strongly advise against purchasing this item. While it is a cheap makeup case, the quality is so poor that I cannot get past it. Do not buy this case.</li>
    <li> I do like this product and it does hold a lot of make up. Cons- the removable inserts are cardboard wrapped in padding. Nice concept as they slide in and out easily, however all of the padding has lifted from the cardboard. I will need to super glue them back on (which I should not have to do). Overall, I am happy with it, but I would suggest shopping around for better quality.</li>
    <li> All of the Shany Cosmetics Train cases are great and I am INLOVE with this one. The only thing is the handle is kind of flimsy at times</li>
    <li> Although this case was not very expensive, the quality of the merchandise was not up to par as I expected it to be. When I received this product, the outside of the case had scratches on the metal. On the inside of the case, the dividers were of poor quality. The dividers did not hold together well and the rubber glued on the inside of the case was not sticking to the case very well either. For 40 dollars I at least expect it to not be coming apart every where. I ended up returning this. I would not recommend this product, and I would advise spending a little extra money to buy something more durable.</li>
