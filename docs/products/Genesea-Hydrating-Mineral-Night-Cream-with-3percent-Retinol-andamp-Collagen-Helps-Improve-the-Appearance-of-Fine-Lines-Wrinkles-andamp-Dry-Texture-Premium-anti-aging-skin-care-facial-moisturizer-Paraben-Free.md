<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good moisturizer. Feels good when I put it in. No unpleasant fragrance. Multiple orders and not changing anytime soon!</li>
    <li> This is so amazing and so creamy, So nice to put on my face at night. I will for sure be buying more. Thanks</li>
    <li> Really is a fantastic product.  It is thick and rich but not oily or greasy</li>
    <li> This product might just make me look 20 years younger!  Honestly, because I can actually use it.  It is amazingly light (not gummy on your skin) and spreads nicely.  After just a few days, I can already see the difference in my face.  As someone who has lost a lot of weight, age is not my only issue.  I already see a refining of the grooves in my cheeks and to me, that is amazing!  I have VERY sensitive skin so other products have caused more harm that good.  I am having absolutely NO trouble using this, it feels good going on, I am not having the itchy skin syndrome.  I will be recommending this and I am sure I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> Very good cream, only used it for about 4 nights now, but my skin is super soft, and it smells good too. Will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love this night cream! I have only been using it for 4 days and already I notice a difference in my skin. It glides on smooth, smells wonderful and my skin feels super soft. I generally have dry skin (T-zone oil), and am loving how this cream feels.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I have tried a few Really expensive hydrating creams, This cream is Awesome and budget friendly. My face looks refreshed in the morning. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have use a lot of products over the 40+ years and what I can tell you this product has made a huge difference in the softness in my skin.  Ladies, as we get older we lose that &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; skin.  I have been using this Genesea night cream for 4 days and believe me I have sent thousands over the years on beauty products.  Amazing product, love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now I absolutely love it. My skin is so much softer and I don&#x27;t have dry flakes under my nose anymore. Can&#x27;t wait to try all their products.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Genesea Intense Hydrating Night Cream for about a week now and I am very impressed with this product. I am already noticing a smoother softer look to my face. I also have a red blotch about 1/4 inch round on my face that appeared about 4 years ago which I have tried and tried to get rid of it to no avail. Now just after a weeks use of the Genesea Night Cream it is actually getting lighter in color. I am so delighted about this. Another problem area I have is on my lower right leg. It is red and hot to the touch at times. I decided to apply the cream to this area as well and it is also showing signs of improvement. There is a light pleasant odor to the cream which I was a bit apprehensive about, as perfumes tend to trigger migraines, but this did not affect me in the least. The packaging is quite lovely. Normally I hide everything in the bathroom cabinet, but the jar is so elegant looking it is sitting out on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this cream like two weeks ago i like the smell and the first nigth I use it really love it my face is so smooth feels great i will continue use it to see the resolves.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, and she loves it!!  She uses it every night and says that it makes her skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this cream for about a week now and I love it! It smells AMAZING and my face already feels softer!</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream for a week now and I can notice an improvement already in my skin.  There is no greasy feeling at all and it absorbs right into the skin on my face and neck, and has a wonderful light scent.  I will continue to use it nightly and can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement in my skin after a month or two.  I highly recommend this product and cannot wait to try the other products in this line! Fast shipping, beautifully packaged and a product that really works!!!  5 Stars!</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m approaching 60 my skin is drying out.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products to help my aging skin.  Usually the ones I&#x27;ve tried are greasy or have too many perfumes in it.  Not this one!  Wow I&#x27;m just amazed at the non-greasy feel on my skin and in the mornings my face feels smooth and soft.  I know it says for nighttime but I&#x27;ve started putting it under my makeup and I cannot believe how smooth the makeup glides on and stays in place all day without drying out!  I am so impress with this night cream</li>
    <li> Product was okay not as good as I expected.  3 stars is a gererous review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream for about a week and I can honestly see/feel a difference. My face was getting really dry and it seems to be drinking in the moisture and feels so soft.  I think I will try other products in this line.</li>
    <li> It has been about 2 weeks since i received my product. The product arrived fast and in a beautifully designed bottle and box, top of the line classy. I was selected to leave an unbiased opinion. I have been using the product daily since its arrival and have some outstanding results to share. I have been using another high end product (rhymes with antique) for years. Genesea BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER!! It feels natural and nourishing on my skin. I see results with the daily use of this product and I feel incredible. It makes washing my face and looking in the mirror joyous. I, without hesitation recommend this product to all, both males and females. It feels fresh going on and is bringing my skin back to life (my smile as well). In my opinion you can&#x27;t beat this product. Go get your&#x27;s and then go tell your friends. Genesea Combined the perfect blend of the earths purest elements and the knowledge and expertise of scientists and truly hit it out of the park. Way to go Genesea, Thank you for bringing back my skin, smile and confidence.</li>
    <li> I love how my face feels using the Genesea night cream right before I got to bed. It is so lightweight and absorbs quickly that I don&#x27;t have to worry about sliding off of my pillow! When I wake up my face still feels hydrated despite the heat running all night during this nasty cold winter.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products in the past, but stopped because they smelled so bad I couldn&#x27;t get to sleep. I will continue to purchase and use...price point is good ... just unhappy that I have spent money on other products that were inferior and they will be tossed in the trash.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream feels on my face and the way it makes my skin look. It leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and well moisturized. I use it on my face and neck and a small amount goes a long way. Interestingly enough, I also rub a little of it on the tops of my hands and especially on my cuticles. After application the cream does not dry out - my skin retains its moist supple feel. I use the cream under my foundation and when I am not wearing foundation. The fragrance is very mild and pleasant and I would recommend this cream to anyone looking for a moisturizing treatment for their skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best Night Cream ever!!!  It makes my face feel amazing!  I have tried a lot of creams, and I will definitely reorder this and recommend this to my friends.  Love how it makes my face look smooth and younger!</li>
    <li> The reason I decided to pick this cream up was to start a good preventive skin care for my some what &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; skin, I&#x27;m 28. I like that the cream seems to do what it&#x27;s stated to do. It moisturizes and kinda plumps up my skin when I wake up, but the only drawback for my skin is that it tends to be on the combo/oily side and I find this cream can be too rich for me. It feels heavy when I wake up. Maybe I am using too much? I will have to modify how much I use and see how that goes, but I would still like to continue using it for preventive care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a bit nervous to try a new skin care product because I do have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve only been using Genesea Mineral Night Cream for about 5 days now but I&#x27;m liking it already. I&#x27;m especially sensitive to parabens and SLS and I&#x27;m glad there are none of these bad chemicals in this product. So far I haven&#x27;t had any bad skin reactions. It has a nice clean botanical scent. The texture is creamy and velvety and it spreads on very easily. It soaked right into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling on my face. This is a high quality product that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> No difference in my skin what so ever!</li>
    <li> Finally a night cream that works wonders for anti-aging but doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Hallelujah only took 15 years to find. This is a breakthrough product I never thought I would hear myself say that about anything!  My skin is already looking noticeably younger and not accompanied by zits at 40 years old. This product has my vote and then some.</li>
    <li> Made my face breakout.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!  Absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel.  I have been using this cream nightly on my face for awhile now and my skin feels so hydrated and silky smooth. I love the feel and it smells great!  I definitely see an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. I am 65 years old and have used a lot of products on my face over the years and I can honestly say this is one is at the top of my list. 5 Stars!!</li>
    <li> I love this Night Cream!  My skin is soft, hydrated and my skin tone has improved.  It is making a huge difference. I highly recommend this product for someone who is looking to change up their products.  It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I find this cream is very deep moisturizing and excellent for dry skin. I use it every night after cleansing my skin. This cream will be added to my definitely order list and the price is really good.</li>
    <li> This cream has a pleasant smell just like the anti-wrinkle cream and goes on smoothly. I like how my face feels in the morning. It works well with the serum for a non flaky dry face, which is the problem I was having. I have sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any breakouts from this, so that is a plus!</li>
    <li> This cream is so luxurious and smells wonderful...my skin has become noticeably smoother after only a week of use.  I have used so many different skin care lines in the past, but this will be the product line that I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> Love, Love!!!.... My new cream!!</li>
    <li> helping to fix up my wrinkles. I use this at night. Very moisturizing and firms. I&#x27;m using this at night with OZ eye gel and vitamin c serum in the morning</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I have sensitive skin but this moisturizer makes my skin feels perfect, it&#x27;s not too heavy and smells good. For sure will buy again.</li>
    <li> Genesea is a wonderful product: it gives my skin a necessary nourishment, smoothness &amp;amp; rejuvenation. Irena A.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two weeks.  Saw results within one week.  Excellent cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my 64 year old dry skin in just once month - it&#x27;s healthier, has a glow and doesn&#x27;t feel dried out anymore!  I also use the Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream during the day and the Purifying Facial Peeling Gel once a week or so!&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/1/15:  While waiting for the Anti Wrinkle Cream to come back in stock, I use this cream during the day - nothing replaces the benefits of using Genesea products!!!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin very soft with no breakouts, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love the light fresh sent of this cream.  I am very sensitive to scents bothering my dry eyes and this does NOT at all.  I have been using faithfully in the evenings for about a week and my face is so smooth and soft.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have never tried any of these type of creams before. However over the last month or so I have been working later and later and not getting as much sleep so I started to look for something that would help with the morning face. I stumbled upon this and immediately began using it. I&#x27;ve gotta say I like the immediate application of it as it leaves a cool sensation on the face. I put it on a couple hours before bed. I focus around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m loving the results! Even after only 2-3 hours of sleep a night I am looking refreshed in the morning and my skin looks smoother. Definitely am going to keep using this cream!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week.  I am 50 plus and never really took care of my skin.  I love how my face and neck feel hydrated and rejuvenated.  It is amazing what GENESEA can do to your skin.  It goes on smoothly, smells fresh, and feels great.</li>
    <li> Best! Not feeling greasy. Good absorption.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this nite time skin cream....it feels soooo silky on my face as I hv very dry skin plus it smells heavenly once I&#x27;ve applied it !&lt;br /&gt;My face feels hydrated even in the morning when I wake up!  Recommend trying this cream ✔️</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the GeneSea Night Cream for the past couple of weeks and I REALLY like it.  It does a very good job hydrating my skin, and with all the cold weather lately, dry skin was a big problem, but not any more!!  It is very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and feels smooth and silky when applied to my skin, and I really like that.  I&#x27;ve noticed a visible difference in the fine lines and wrinkles.  Many of them are gone!  I&#x27;ve noticed my husband using it too.  With the reasonable price, and high quality of this Anti-Aging Night Cream, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this from Amazon instead of the super expensive products at the department stores.</li>
    <li> Let me give everyone a quick run down of this new cream (personal experience). First off, I really like how it smells.. it&#x27;s not overwhelming and has a very gentle aroma which i really like.  The product itself looks great on my shelf and I&#x27;m actually impressed with the fact that this contains original dead sea minerals from the source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very good on the skin, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and absorbs really well. I use it a few times a week before I sleep just to maintain healthy skin appearance and it does it really well.  My skin feels tighter and healthier, i feel like it gives it a nice armor of skin protection and good minerals to nourish it. Best of all, no alcohol or parabens which are horrible for any skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very satisfied - this bottle should last me at least a month but i&#x27;m definitely purchasing again.. it&#x27;s a really good dead sea cream and great value.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My wife loves it. Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> I got this item because I love the Boto anti-wrinkle cream by Genesea, so I got this item to use at night. I found that it is thick and rich, but it goes on smoothly on my face and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy, and when i wake up, my face isn&#x27;t greasy either, just moisturized. It does smell nice, but I just wish it had the same scent as the Boto anti wrinkle cream. Other than that, i&#x27;m surprised by how well it&#x27;s working with my skin.  I&#x27;m mid 30s</li>
    <li> I just turned 40 and I will tell you that I can tell in my skin. I need extra moisture for my face and this ant-aging night cream is doing the trick. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I love that it is thick and moisturizing. My mother was over the other day, I had no makeup on and she complimented me on my skin. She does not give complements freely. I&#x27;m noticing that my skin looks moisturized not just at night when I apply it but in general it&#x27;s looking more healthy. It has some glow again and isn&#x27;t looking dull or dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Finally a night cream that is actually doing it&#x27;s job. 2 weeks in, can definitely tell a difference.</li>
    <li> In February I purchased an expensive cleanser, toner, day moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t get a night cream.  So when I saw this, and it&#x27;s great reviews and price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I really like it! It smells great, has a great consistency, and my face feels hydrated in the morning.  I liked it so much that I decided to give Genesea&#x27;s day/wrinkle moisturizer a try.  I just got that this week, so I don&#x27;t have an immediate opinion as of yet.  I am 46 and feel that I should be using anti-wrinkle/aging cream, but not sure my sensitive skin likes the ingredients that help with aging.  However, my sensitive skin LOVES this night cream.  A definite keeper!</li>
    <li> Not too scented and absorbs well.  I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume scent.  Seems to be doing some smoothing of the skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer for night time. Love the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I just got my first jar of night cream after using a MUCH more expensive brand for years. One of the reasons for trying this Hydrating  Night Cream was, not only the money but my old brand would &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; up on my skin (don&#x27;t know a better way to describe it). So, with some hesitation, I applied the Genesea. It immediately soaked  into my skin and did not &amp;#34;pill up&amp;#34; on my face, even in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I have Lupus and with age, it is more frequently effecting the skin on my face so, I&#x27;m not just a normal 20 year old using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I want to find more products made by Genesea as I stumbled on this surfing Amazon.</li>
    <li> did not notice any different after I apply on my face. very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Genesea Night Cream for two weeks now. I was meaning to write my review the very next day after using it for the first time because I saw amazing results right away - but then I decided to wait it out and see what more it can do. And I was right! This is the best hydrating night cream I&#x27;ve ever used so far! It lives up to its name - my face feels so hydrated! I have combination dry and oily face and this does exactly what it says - hydrates my skin and more! I am now using this with the Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator and it&#x27;s even more effective. I woke up today with my skin tight, smooth, hydrated. I love the smell as well - it&#x27;s not overpowering and it gives my skin luxurious scent, on top of the soft, silky feel it leaves my skin. It is lightweight and non-greasy. I can&#x27;t wait to see more effective results on my skin! I highly recommend this specially if you are looking for the best skin regimen. I finally found mine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this silky night cream for a few weeks, and it seems to help with my skin tone and texture.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it goes on smooth, and the fragrance is very light and refreshing.  Being over 40 I&#x27;m starting to notice a change in my skin, and I definitely needed some moisture with the dry winter heat in our home.  This night cream has helped with the wrinkles and fine lines on my forehead, under eyes, and neck.  You can&#x27;t put it close to the eyes, but close enough that it helps.  This is a very high end product that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone looking to improve their skin texture and tone.</li>
    <li> I have only used this cream for three nights but already see and feel a difference! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, but love the smell and how smooth it goes on.</li>
    <li> It’s amazing!  I saw the difference after two days.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Since i have been using this a short time I am not able to assess a difference.  My skins feels good upon awakening, but not much different than other good quality products,. I will gladly submit anew review if other people comment that my skin looks great. Though I am older I have taken good care and worn serums and sunscreens daily.  I was most impressed with the manufacturers immediate follow up after the purchase, They were very thorough with the proper application of the product.  I am sure other have noticed the small print for product application..  So I welcomed the precise instructions.  They get  4 stars for their customer service followup.</li>
    <li> I love this night moisturizer.  This is truely moisturizing.  I did not have any breakouts.  In the morning, it still feels smooth on my face.  I find this better than my shiseido benefiance.</li>
    <li> Just started using it it feels rich and moist.  So far so good</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream.  It remains to be seen how much it really likes me, but I think I can tell a good difference in just one week.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin this caused break outs for me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at the beginning but it works. My skin is getting much better and my husband has also noticed.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong and bothersome. It doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing enough.</li>
    <li> My order arrived the day before yesterday,  and I just tried it for the first time last night.  So far, so good.  I really like the thick and creamy consistency, and it only takes a little to go over the whole area.  It also seemed to absorb really well without being greasy!  This morning my skin seemed to be very soft and nice feeling.  The scent is very pretty too.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I use it every night before bed and my skin feels great when i wake up in the morning. It leaves it feeling nourished and gets rid of fine lines. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I like the night cream so far.  I will be trying other products.  It is a good product for the price of department store creams which cost $100.00 or more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff my face is so smooth</li>
    <li> I purchased both day and night creams and they are superb! They feel like silk going on and I&#x27;m thrilled to have discovered them. I already told one friend who went right to Amazon.com and ordered her own.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such luxury at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This cream is great it reduces the fine lines within a week you can notice a difference</li>
    <li> This is the best product  line I have ever found to plump up my very dry skin! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful night cream, hydrating, easy to use, beautiful jar.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again.  Thank you, Genesea!</li>
    <li> The 2nd jar I received is not the same cream I received the first time.  The scent, color, and texture is different.  The cream in the first jar I received was a peachy like color and had a whipped like quality with just a hint of fragrance.  The cream in the second jar I received is white and feels thicker and the smell is overwhelming.  It actually resembles the Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream and produces the same results....breakouts for me.  Just when I thought I found the perfect cream.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> Your skin is so soft after you use this. Skin looks nice</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! Been using it for almost a month now and I immediately noticed how moisturized my skin was. Fast forward to now and my skin is glowing and soft. Pores are smaller, and seems naturally brighter. Win win!</li>
    <li> It is as good as others moisturizing creams I have used.</li>
    <li> smells great too, love this stuff, worth try ladies.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the silky texture of this product.  I use this on my neck and chest and tops of hands.  I love how my skin feels when I wake up in the morning.  Thanks for making me look and feel younger!</li>
    <li> As almost an octogenerian, I have tried many night creams in the past including high level Skinceuticals and GloTherapeudics. The Dead Sea Anti Aging Night Cream competes amazingly well with the high end very expensive products. I will never go back to using anything else again. The subtle fragrance is lovely and not overwhelming and the cream is very hydrating and cost effective as you do not have to use very much to achieve complete coverage of the face and neck. I love the way that my skin absorbs the application and it never feels greasy. Wrinkle fee facial skin without blemishes is my objective and this product does it very well. The popular price point is always a benefit and I won&#x27;t have to waste money on those higher priced items again.The packaging is very attractive and the cream container looks beautiful on night table. So pleased that I was able to find this wonderful product right here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love, love this night cream! When will you have the Boto anti wrinkle cream available again???</li>
    <li> fantasitc.. works so fine to me</li>
    <li> I immediately noticed the improvement on my skin. The fine wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin looks fresh.</li>
    <li> I just love how smooth it makes my skin feel. I have been using it now for a week. I was previously using regenerist  by Oil of Olay. This is my new choice for nighttime skin care.</li>
    <li> I usually use Le Mer but this is now my go to cream. When I booked  facial the facialist told me, I don&#x27;t know how old you are but you have beautiful skin. So glad I found this and the price is right.</li>
    <li> My wife said this has been wonderful the past couple of nights when she has used it.</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever.  I have to specify that I have been selected by the Genesea Company to leave an honest opinion about these two creams.  First, I have to say that I received both creams about a month ago, and I have been using them every single night since.  I am almost 46 years old, and my skin is a combination of dry and normal.  Although I do not have excessive wrinkles, fine lines started showing up around the eyes, forehead along with those so called &amp;#34;expression wrinkles&amp;#34; !  Before coming across Genesea&#x27;s creams I have used expensive, as well as less expensive creams and I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with any of them.  After only one night of using the product I noticed a difference in my skin: being very smooth, and moist.  Now, after four weeks of using these creams, without wearing any make up foundation, my friends are complimenting me on my skin&#x27;s appearance and are asking me what I am using!  I have been recommending these creams to them, and hence my decision to write my first review!  I cannot say that this product eradicates the wrinkles, but it does smoothness the fine lines, and definitely keeps your skin moisturized.  I love the smell, and how smooth it goes on, and most importantly how my skin looks and feels!  The price, the packaging, and the delivery are great as well!  Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this cream is the wetness - touching it felt like cool water - extremely hydrating, and living in a southern climate - I need that, not to mention my age - also the richness allows me to use it less often, I found I don&#x27;t need to use it every night because of that richness...for the price - you sure can&#x27;t beat this one...</li>
    <li> The product left my skin feeling quenched and was effective at smoothing out fine lines of dryness on my neck and softening the crease above the bridge of my nose. I also found it a nice moisturizer on the tops of my hands. Thank you for a quality product. My only loss of one star is the jar packaging as it allows the product to oxidize and lose potency too soon.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product wish they had a day cream for younger women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very Impressed with this Dead Sea Anti Aging Night Cream. This cream has definitely met and exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;First off I will begin with the packaging and presentation: Beautiful box and container, so visually I give it a 5 star plus product for presentation alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next and most important is the cream itself. The texture is smooth, silky and feels fresh when applied to my skin. No burn or unpleasant overbearing fragrance, which is very important to me as I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;m very happy with this cream and I&#x27;m excited to see how my skin looks and feels with continued use. I definitely will recommend this product to my friends. In addition my daughter loves it too, so I know I&#x27;m going to have to buy some more very soon.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this hydrating cream. She has used a number of different products at different price points, and NONE of it has worked as well as this product has. She noticed a difference in her skin after just a few days of use. It applies very easily and is not overly greasy or have a strong odor. This hydrating cream is a definite win! I would strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to slow the aging process on the face!</li>
    <li> Not as hydrating as I had hoped but still a great value.</li>
    <li> My skin gets super dry during the winter time and needed a face night cream that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I have sensitive combination skin so alot of night cream products that I&#x27;ve used in the past didn&#x27;t work for me. Genesea night cream not only smooth out my skin, I don&#x27;t break out, which is very important to me. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been an expensive face moisturizer for years but I thought I would give this a try, I will never go back to the other product. I saw more results with this product in three weeks then I ever saw with the other. I am so glad I came across this great product.</li>
    <li> Great complement night cream to the Genesea product line.  I&#x27;ve tried other dead sea product before and I like Genesea the best.  Quality ingredients without the garbage fillers.</li>
    <li> Just started to use the Genesea night cream for a few weeks and it&#x27;s work nice. I have seen improvement</li>
    <li> I do not like this product at all.  It does not rub in and leaves a film on your face.  I have used it 3 times and I feel no difference at all the next day.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now.  I love it. It&#x27;s been cold and dry and my skin stayed moisturized.</li>
    <li> This intense hydrating night cream is better than I expected. The soft, mild scent is very nice, not over-powering like some others I&#x27;ve tried. The smooth, creamy texture is easy to spread onto my face and hands. I was afraid it would be too &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; and leave my face greasy...BUT, it did NOT. This is a very nice night cream and for anyone looking for one that works like the higher priced creams...I&#x27;d highly recommend this Genesea Intense Hydrating Night Cream.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a night cream as I ran out of my origins face cream with an anti-wrinkle agent in it. Also, I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with my face cream so I was looking for something different. My other face cream never felt like it was moisturizing my face well enough and I didn&#x27;t care for the way it felt on my skin. I took a chance in trying something a little different and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results so far as it&#x27;s only been 8 days since purchasing this dead sea anti-aging night cream. The day I received it, I started using it right away at night. I really don&#x27;t like heavy perfume smelling lotions and creams so I was really impressed as this has a very light and airy fragrance which I loved. I really like the consistency of the night cream with collagen as it wasn&#x27;t greasy. It&#x27;s super light weight and feels very soothing on my face. After just using this product for only 8 days, my skin feels completely moisturized and soft. It looks visibly less tired. My face is sensitive to many things and so far this product has not irritated my skin in any way. I highly recommend trying this anti-aging night cream as I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
    <li> The winter is really dry and I can feel it sucking the moisture out of my skin. When I decided to use the night cream, I can feel the immediate difference to my skin and it lasts. The cream is not greasy it feels refreshing when I put it on and my skin looks good. There are a lot of choices out there and I am happy I made this choice.</li>
</ol>
