      <li>But great value.</li>
      <li>They have a good grip and serve the purpose.</li>
      <li>good quality.</li>
      <li>I was filled with excitement when the order came in and the clips are working wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Loved that they&#x27;re nice and smooth on the bottom and don&#x27;t snag your hair.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought 100</li>
      <li>I think the quality is good enough to feel confident about giving them to someone as a gift.</li>
      <li>These are nice, stronger than most I have seen &amp; purchased earlier.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and are great for making hair accessories that are not extremely large.</li>
      <li>they broke pretty easy and</li>
      <li>I got them quickly but a firmer/sturdier package would have gotten them to me unharmed.</li>
      <li>I found a few bent ones that I may not be able to use but they seem pretty good.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Many of the clips are crooked - including some that I have not used!</li>
      <li>exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Should hold glue well for the produce use.&lt;br /&gt;Fundraiser item intended.</li>
      <li>otherwise I would not have had enough considering that they break easily</li>
      <li>There is nothing to say really.</li>
      <li>They are also a lot smaller than I expected, but that was my own fault.</li>
      <li>The clips are a little smaller than I thought, but that was my own fault for not checking measurements.</li>
      <li>First, I only received 96 out of the 100 I ordered, of which 68 were bent and unusable.  </li>
      <li>THEY ARE CHEAP QUALITY and not worth the a penny.  </li>
      <li>these work on bows very well since my bows are not big and obnoxious these are pefect for them to glue to</li>

    <li> These are nice, stronger than most I have seen &amp; purchased earlier. Not a fan of the curve in it. But great value. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These clips are just as advertised. There is nothing to say really. I plan to use them to make flower clips for hair, for myself or to give away. I think the quality is good enough to feel confident about giving them to someone as a gift.</li>
    <li> yes they meet my expectations</li>
    <li> Forgot to write a review for these when I ordered them, but they&#x27;re just what I expected.  Arrived on time and are great for making hair accessories that are not extremely large.</li>
    <li> Made about 100 flower hair pins with these. Loved that they&#x27;re nice and smooth on the bottom and don&#x27;t snag your hair.</li>
    <li> They are not very sturdy. I&#x27;ve had a few break while trying to bend them straight. Would not buy them again. They are also a lot smaller than I expected, but that was my own fault.</li>
    <li> Prompt service and exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Should hold glue well for the produce use.&lt;br /&gt;Fundraiser item intended. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Great product for a wonderful price! Bought these to make my daughter&#x27;s hair bows and was tired of spending so much on the clips at craft stores! So happy I found these!</li>
    <li> good quality. I will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! I was filled with excitement when the order came in and the clips are working wonderfully! The clips are a little smaller than I thought, but that was my own fault for not checking measurements.</li>
    <li> I found a few bent ones that I may not be able to use but they seem pretty good.</li>
    <li> I bought these clips for retwisting locs. I have used them a total of three times. Many of the clips are crooked - including some that I have not used! They have a good grip and serve the purpose. I am glad I bought 100 otherwise I would not have had enough considering that they break easily and some were shipped crooked.</li>
    <li> DO NOTTTTT BUY THESE!!!!!  THEY ARE CHEAP QUALITY and not worth the a penny.  First, I only received 96 out of the 100 I ordered, of which 68 were bent and unusable.  28 were possibly usable, but given the lack of quality, it would be an embarrassment and an insult to my customers.  This is a lesson learned, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t use it. they are poor quality. I still have it somewhere in a box. they broke pretty easy and actually alot of them came broken.</li>
    <li> Just got them .. Look Great haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet tho</li>
    <li> Great value for the quality!!!</li>
    <li> 90% of them were brokEn are not usable.</li>
    <li> these work on bows very well since my bows are not big and obnoxious these are pefect for them to glue to</li>
    <li> The clips were the size indicated. There were no rusty clips in my bag but a few were bent out of shape from the poor packaging. I got them quickly but a firmer/sturdier package would have gotten them to me unharmed.</li>
