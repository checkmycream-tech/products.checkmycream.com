      <li>I don&#x27;t know about adding 16 times more volume, but it does an amazing job regardless, adding slightly more than the one in the yellow tube and adding much more length.</li>

      <li>Did not get fabulous length or volume as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>same great formula</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think is a mascara invented that with give your eyelashes a smooth non made up look- ):</li>

      <li>I am a makeup junkie and generally have good luck with Maybelline mascaras.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be anything special.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what mascara to buy that would really make my eyelashes pop</li>
      <li>My wife uses this product after she researched the different types of Mascara and found that this product has just as good of reviews at MAC equivalent.</li>

      <li>Out of all the new Colossal releases, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many from the Colossal line but always go back to the one in the yellow tube, which is amazing!</li>
      <li>well..i picked this up in hopes that it might do what it claims and seeing that it has my trusty colossal name</li>
      <li>It really fans out, separates, and makes lashes look a lot longer!</li>
      <li>but I just put the tube in a cup of hot water while I&#x27;m putting on the rest of my makeup</li>
      <li>I really recommend it!</li>
      <li>My wife has tried many different mascaras and this is one of her favorites around this price range.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite mascara! It really defines the length of my lashes</li>
    <li> loved it... so happy with the mascara... amazing... CAME IN FAST ON POINT NO ISSUES WITH SELLER, WILL BUY AGAIN FROM SELLER....</li>
    <li> I think this is my new favorite mascara</li>
    <li> A friend who uses this now has great eyelashes. They&#x27;re are long, I will be buying me a couple of these</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just not loving this. It leaves my lashes brittle &amp; it does not have a natural look. In addition, my number one criteria for mascara is that it be build able- this is not.</li>
    <li> Loved it! It&#x27;s amazing, but it&#x27;s &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;. Perfect for the night!</li>
    <li> Did not get fabulous length or volume as I was expecting. Its just a regular mascara.</li>
    <li> It is 2 thick and makes a mess of your lashes</li>
    <li> I was a traditional covergirl pink and green tube and I love this new one.  It does make lashes longer than the old school pink &amp; green tube so I think I will stick with this one moving forward.</li>
    <li> I am usually a fan of all maybelline mascaras and try every single one that comes out to the market. This particular mascara didn&#x27;t give me as much volume and I felt it separate the lashes to much. If I combine it with the mega volume then it works awesome but not by itself</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to mascara, and this certainly pleased me! I bought it based on reviews, and get tons of compliments when I use it!</li>
    <li> Best cheap mascara ever!</li>
    <li> Over the last few years I think I&#x27;ve tried every Maybelline mascara there is to buy and I think this is my favorite exclamation it has the right balance of length and fullness and isn&#x27;t impossible to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I do not like this mascara it is very dry.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite mascaras.</li>
    <li> love love love this!! im so &amp;#34;pumped&amp;#34; about this mascara! i always buy the newest maybelline mascaras becuz they have the best in my opinion..well i always turn back to my colossal..the others are good but my origianal colossal has always been my favorite and i always go back to it..well..i picked this up in hopes that it might do what it claims and seeing that it has my trusty colossal name i figured i would try it out and im so happy i did..this is my new favorite mascara!! i didnt think i would find one i loved more then my colassal but this takes the cake! same great formula but the brush is more advanced and delivers even more great results..bigger bolder voluminus lashes..its not clumpy or too wet,i love everything about this mascara and im so happy they made this..so if ur like me and u love the original then try this out and i promise u will not be disapointed..</li>
    <li> My wife has tried many different mascaras and this is one of her favorites around this price range. Gives her lashes length and volume!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara now!</li>
    <li> Not quite a wonderful as some reviews have suggested, but overall very good.</li>
    <li> Of course, everyone is different, but I was excited to try this to be let down. I didn&#x27;t find it to be anything special. For me, it just sat on my lashes... no volume, no length, and smudged badly. Oh well</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what mascara to buy that would really make my eyelashes pop so I bought this one and another more exspensive one for like 30 bucks and this one is wayyyyy better!! I highly recommend this one its perfect!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome and easily my new favorite mascara!!!! It really fans out, separates, and makes lashes look a lot longer! I&#x27;m thinking the brush picks up on &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; lashes because when I use this, I see a whole lot more lashes than I usually see without any mascara or when Ive used other mascara&#x27;s, so they kind of make me feel like I put on some falsies with all the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; lashes! Kind of cool. Creates a lot of volume without any excessive clumping and doesn&#x27;t weigh lashes down. Definitely would recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> At first, I was really excited when I found this mascara. It was cheaper than any of the local stores. I&#x27;ve used Maybelline for years and figured I would give this a try. This mascara dried out within about 2 months and got very clumpy and thick. I&#x27;m not sure if it was due to the wand getting gunked up or what.</li>
    <li> Maybe it came dried out I dont know.  Will not buy it again though.  The brush gave me high hopes but hardly anything goes on my lashes when applied.</li>
    <li> To start, I never seem to have much luck with maybelline mascaras. This formula is really wet, and makes my eyelashes stick together a lot. Even upon initial application it starts flaking and smudging on me. It&#x27;s hard to apply on lower lashes. After a few hours there&#x27;s so much flakes under/in my eyes and it looks bad and is uncomfortable. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My 2nd favorite mascara after the yellow tube one. What this one does is lengthen your lashes way more than it adds volume. So I use them both. I use this one first to lengthen my eyelashes and the yellow one to add volume. This alone won&#x27;t do much for you. Unless you already have naturally voluminous eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have found, goes on thick and lasts all day!  Arrived quickly as well...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear make up, but whenever I do, I receive many compliments.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product after she researched the different types of Mascara and found that this product has just as good of reviews at MAC equivalent. She loves it and it way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, and I sell cosmetics. Super long long long lashes and does end up under my eye crumbs at end of day. I&#x27;ve used this for a year</li>
    <li> Goes on great stays on great :)</li>
    <li> This mascara is so-so. I liked the brush and how easy it went on but I didn&#x27;t like the lack of volume. It gave me nothing.</li>
    <li> From reading the other reviews I had high hopes that this product would be the upgraded version of my favorite yellow bottle of Colossal but sadly it was not. Theres just something about the brush &amp; formula combination of the classic (yellow bottle) Colossal mascara. As a makeup artist &amp; overall makeup junkie, I have tried a hundred or more different formulas of mascara. My favorite being Dior Diorshow mascara but at over 30$ a bottle plus shipping its hard to afford the constant purchases. The original Colossal mascara was the closest, actually even a little better than Diorshows formula, that Ive found! I guess my hopes were set to high with Pumped Up Colossal, its just not the same.</li>
    <li> Best mascara on the market (at a reasonable price). Volume is what I was looking for and I got it!!  It does not clump , I have used nothing but this product since the day I tried it.</li>
    <li> Other than 3D mascara, my Asian lashes need this product to be seen</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Makes my lashes very thick and full. But washes off with just water! Which I love because waterproof mascara rips my lashes out</li>
    <li> i like this Mascara, &amp; it arrive very soon after purchase.</li>
    <li> this mascara definitely gives you volume but the brush head was a little too big to work with for me. I have sparse, short lashes so it was sometimes difficult to reach everything with a huge wand. but I really liked the formula.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind a big wand!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup junkie and generally have good luck with Maybelline mascaras. I&#x27;ve tried many from the Colossal line but always go back to the one in the yellow tube, which is amazing! However, when I saw ads for this one I couldn&#x27;t resist; I am always interested in mascaras that promise big volume. Happily, this did not dissapoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Gives great volume!&lt;br /&gt;* No flaking or smudging; lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;* Lengthens lashes&lt;br /&gt;* Defines lashes and fans them out; multiplies my lashes&lt;br /&gt;* Great black color&lt;br /&gt;* Nice formula consistency--not too watery or dry&lt;br /&gt;* Love the pink and yellow tube! I know, kind of superficial and has nothing to do with the mascara itself, but it&#x27;s such a bright, eye-catching color that it&#x27;s a plus in my book&lt;br /&gt;* Affordable--buy from drugstores, much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* I notice a slight almost chemical/marker-ish smell when I take the wand out of the tube. However, the scent does not last and IS NO BIGGIE, just something you may notice&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s a little tough to remove with my current makeup remover (Publix brand) but other brands may be more effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this. I don&#x27;t know about adding 16 times more volume, but it does an amazing job regardless, adding slightly more than the one in the yellow tube and adding much more length. If you&#x27;re a fan of the yellow one and/or looking for a new mascara to try, then you must pick this up! Wal-Mart didn&#x27;t carry this yet so I bought mine from CVS for around $7.50, however when Wal-Mart and Target do pick this up it will probably be around $5-$6. Out of all the new Colossal releases, this is my favorite. I think it&#x27;s even replaced the yellow tube as my new HG. Hopefully they won&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be waterproof mascara, but it smudged a lot with any perspiration. I did get good volume though.  I&#x27;ll stick to my usual, The Colossal Volum&#x27; Express waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent mascara. It lengthens my lashes but I have to apply several coats of it before I see any real results. It works though. I got it on sale so it was a good bargain for what I paid.</li>
    <li> Finally I can have the long lashes i&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> Perfect, messed up and didnt get waterproof tho..</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara before and I love it. Normally I pay about $9 for it so finding it for $5 is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. Makes my lashes look so long! It does tend to dry out quickly but I just put the tube in a cup of hot water while I&#x27;m putting on the rest of my makeup and it&#x27;s good as new. And by ordering on subscription means I never run out.</li>
    <li> Love! I&#x27;ve been on the mascara hunt and willing to pay the big bucks, I want big full lashes with mascara that won&#x27;t flake and make me want to poke my eyeballs out! This mascara does not disappoint. I thought it was love with mascara forevers extravagent lashes at 25 a pop it was getting tiresome every 3ish weeks; this is just as good at 8 max. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The first day I used this, I really like it. It seemed to lengthen and thicken my lashes. Although it seemed like the mascara was drier than other mascaras (like when you get to the end of a month of using it). The next day it clumped so bad and flaked all over my face throughout the day that I had to remove it while at work. It definitely thickens your lashes because it leaves a ton of mascara on your lashes. I&#x27;m thinking maybe I got an old product? I purchased at a grocery store so it must have been sitting in a warehouse for awhile before displaying. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the non-waterproof. Sad because I thought it was going to work great!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought WOW finally a mascara that works.. Well,not for me- I hate for my eyelashes to look all clumpy and caked  with mascara. which is just what I get with this mascara- I sorta thought for the price this is going be amazing if it works without making my eyes look all made up- it does not-- it clumps just like all the others from expensive and not so. In order to not look all clumpy I have to wipe off most of the mascara (which is a waste) before applying to avoid the clumps...    So back to the drawing board. I don&#x27;t think is a mascara invented that with give your eyelashes a smooth non made up look- ):</li>
    <li> perfect love it my favorite mascera ❤ i naturally have my eye lashes long so this makes the full nd long</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this, being a huge makeup lover. The product looks amazing, and the first time i used it i was not disappointed! However, i never got the same effect after that because the brush got all messed up in the container... It looked to me like they made it too big for the tube and it got compressed in there and flattened out on the side ):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if it was just the one i got or if it was just the way they make them, but the other reviews seem to be very positive, and if theirs are working the way mine did the first time i can see why!! I will give it four stars, because if it werent for that this would have been my new favorite for sure.</li>
    <li> Love love love this mascara! I only have to use one coat for my lashes to be super long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a really dark, jet black, and I personally love that about this product. It is a little runny, but I also prefer that too. For the price, it&#x27;s a steal and now my go-to mascara (after switching from L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Manga Mascara.)</li>
    <li> Incredible, as I read in the reviews. I loved!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it goes on easily, plumps and lengthens my lashes without the spider leg look.  It drys fast and is waterproof too.</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara it just makes my lashes so big!</li>
