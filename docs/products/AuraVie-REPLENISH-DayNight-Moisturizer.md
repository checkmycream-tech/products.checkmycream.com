<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my face feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I&#x27;ve been in the beauty biz for many years.  My skin is a combination of dry to somewhat oily.  This cream is not oily or waxy and absorbs well. No greasy feeling.  BUT...use it in both the am and before bed.  Works well under makeup too. And beware, the higher priced moisturizers are not necessarily better. In fact, most aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> really liked this product.  cheaper to buy at amazon.  have used it for awhile.  works well with the other auravie products.</li>
    <li> This is the third order of this product... It has worked wonderfully for me. I look 10 years younger</li>
    <li> i have ordered this before ,so when I found it on amazon at a better price I jumped at the opportunity to get it. good product !</li>
    <li> I ordered AURAVIE, receiving a kit of three items.  I saw nothing about returning the product in 10 days.  I later received a bill for 97 bucks, plus.  Called and was told they would give me a discount.  Seeing that VISA only handles complaints within 100 miles of purchase, I relented and will pay the reduced rate.  I am not all that certain that my bill will be reduced, but you live and learn.  I told them they should read the critiques of their practices. Had this been a nicer company, they may have had a good customer.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE,  THE PRODUCT IS NOT WORTHY.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream on a trail bases, it turned out to be the most effective skin care I will ever use.!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a year.  It is a good product for the money and love having it delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> I ordered the pre trial product for $4.95. I started wearing it and after a couple of weeks my teen said \\&quot;MOM I think that new face cream you bought is working! Your skin is looking better!\\&quot; She is always very blunt even if it hurts my feelings. I also was noticing the difference. I AM HOOKED! The only negative is you will be charged $97.00 if you don&#x27;t return it! It did upset me a bit BUT the results were  amazing I quickly got over it!!</li>
    <li> A scam, don not buy ..waste of money</li>
    <li> Tried several others and so far this works the best for me  This says it all why the necessary amount of words??</li>
    <li> I use this product all of the time , will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used Aura Vie REPLENISH, Day/Night Moisturizer for at least 5 years and probably longer. I usually purchased ahead so I never ran out. This last year I was so DISAPPOINTED when I placed a call and could not locate the company any longer. I did try to locate the company on the internet but was not successful, until one day, as I was purchasing an item on Amazon there was AuraVie on the screen!  My lucky day!  I placed an order for several AuraVie Replenish Day/Night Moisturizer, right then and there.  AuraVie Replenish Moisturizer is a very light to the touch product. It goes on so easily and is absorbed quickly. My skin responds very well to this product!  It is very light pink in color and has a very light and refreshing scent. Hopefully, Amazon will continue to carry this product for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Karla B.  8/28/15</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great!  My skin feels a lot smoother and I think some of the wrinkles are not quite as deep as they were before.</li>
    <li> I started using this product along with the cleanser and the skin revitalizer and saw a difference in my skin in just a short time of using it..</li>
    <li> I first used this product a few months ago and have been very happy with the results.  It is not greasy and a little does a lot. It smells clean not like perfume.</li>
    <li> I like the Auravie products but due to the problem with trying to straighten out an order shipped on 5/2/2014 for $97.88 that I did not authorize it is not a company I want to continue to do business with! The customer care person needs to get another job (say in  the warehouse). After him trying to talk fast enough to talk over me and did not manage, I finally told him to shut up and listen to what I had to say. When I finished, his remark was did you read the fine print and I said are you telling me you have something hidden in the fine print I should have seen,. his statement was it authorized us to send out the order. He finally agreed to me returning the order! At my expense, I did send it back with signature required and returned to me on sent out 5/12/ 2014 at 10:44am and I received a letter from AuraVie at 12pm.  I sent an e-mail stating I would do my best to not have any further transactions with their company. Thank You for asking Sandra L Zabroski</li>
    <li> Nice and soft on face. Leaves it nice and moisturized. Easy to place coverup on over it. Liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product previously.  I have found this to be true to the advertisement.  It also does not irritate my eyes .</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! My husband answered (ironically) an Amazon survey and one of the offers was a free sample of AuraVie - just pay the shipping. There was no mention on the invoice that we would be charged for the product for any reason. So a little over a week later we were charged $97.88, which we didn&#x27;t authorize. There are many complaints on the web regarding this kind of unscrupulous tactic used by this company. BTW, the product doesn&#x27;t work any better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and it is way too expensive!</li>
    <li> This product does not make my skin break out like most creams/serums that I have tried.  I have been using it for over a year now and love it.  I have received many complements on my skin and have been told that I look very young for my age - AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Service was immediate&lt;br /&gt;Product amazing</li>
    <li> I continue to use this product even though I have not noticed dramatic results.  I am hoping for good results in the future.  I will continue to use this product and hope to see results in my skin.</li>
    <li> Is very different the original Aura Vie creams we used to get.  It is clearly a fake.</li>
    <li> This is the day facial cream I use for few years. It could be used for nighttime and is very practical for travels since you need to pack only one jar. Keeps your skin smooth and helps with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I will like to order large size if possible&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the order an each month but I do understanding of concept.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about six months ago and I liked it right away. Then I tried another product that everyone was talking about so I bought just one jar &amp; serum and eye cream. Well, one month was enough, I wanted to get back to AuraVie. I&#x27;m seventy and everyone I meet says I don&#x27;t look it, true or not it doesn&#x27;t matter because I like everything about AuraVie and will not change any more.  yvonne</li>
    <li> Great price! Order from, Amazon not the main, company. Wonderful products</li>
    <li> I did not achieve amazing results but I do think over time my face has improved. Probably worth the money</li>
    <li> Very clean and easy to apply .  Use twice daily!</li>
    <li> Love it is everything that I expected. I have very mature complexion, and this product improves the an  softens of my lines, wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. I hear some great reviews on this but it did not work on me. Its a nice cream and it does help moister your skin, but that all. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Why Amazon allows this company to operate through them I do not understand. I ordered what was supposed to be a free trial for $4.95 and was signed up for monthly shipments at $97.88. No where was this stated. At best these people use deceptive business practices. Trying to deal with their Customer Service is worthless. They are well practiced with unhappy customers. Do a quick search and review the complaints before you buy.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results I have seen after using this product for the past year.  My lines and wrinkles are much less noticeable using this product.  It is the first product I have used and actually noticed a difference.  I will continue to use it and recommend it to friends and family!</li>
    <li> I use this at night and love how my skin feels.  Great moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations of this cream.  It smells wonderful, but I did not notice any different results than any other cream.</li>
    <li> I got this product for a friend b/c she was very please with it</li>
    <li> It is very bad products. Do not waste your money. It did not work at all and also they are not honest.</li>
    <li> Do not buy directly from this company. Their business practices are legal, but deceptive. Their ads for the &amp;#34;risk-free trial&amp;#34; say nothing about signing you up for monthly auto shipments at $97.88 a month, nor does the ad say anything about having to cancel within 10 days to avoid being charged for your &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; trial. You have to go to the Terms and Conditions (listed as only &amp;#34;T&amp;C&amp;#34; at the bottom of the trial website I was on; how many would know what T&amp;C stands for?) and read about those charges a couple of paragraphs down. Having said that, I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon or any other site because I don&#x27;t want AuraVie getting any money in any way from me.</li>
    <li> I was suckered into paying a small fee for a trial period and got stuck with having to pay for a product I don&#x27;t want. I did cancel during the listed time period, but did not realize until then that I would be charged $38 if I did not return the product. The cream irritates my skin and caused me to break out with deep cystic acne (which I haven&#x27;t had that problem before) and I&#x27;ve never used the cleanser or toner. The serum I have used and I actually like it, but for $68 alone I think I&#x27;ll pass on repurchasing it. I had better moisturizing with the Aloe line at the body shoppe.</li>
    <li> I love love all the AuraVie products&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for several years&lt;br /&gt;This is the best moisturizer cream for my face. Use day and night!!</li>
    <li> I ordered a sample of this product from a popup ad that kept appearing in my browser. The charge was $3.50 supposedly for shipping. The next time I tried to use my credit card it was blocked. When I call my credit card company I was told it was blocked because of a suspected fraudulent charge of $4.95 that was put there by this company. I did not authorize this charge and don&#x27;t know what it was for. I received the sample products consisting of 3 bottles/jars. Two weeks later my credit card was blocked again because this same company put a charge of $97.88 on my card.  I called Auravie and was told that I had 10 days to examine the product and either pay 97.88 or return the product and the 10 days had passed. I was also told I had been enrolled as a member of their company and would receive this product monthly and be charged 97.88. I was able to get the amount reduced to 48.84. I was read a notice that is supposed to be on their website that is supposed to explain this. My credit card has been voided and a new one on the way because it was compromised. Also they claim that their website is secure. The first screen did have \\&quot;https\\&quot; showing a secure site. The second screen only had \\&quot;http\\&quot; so I did not enter information into that screen. I would advise anyone not to give your credit card number to this company.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using their line for quite sometime now. Would highly recommend trying this moisturizing cream, along with the face wash and toner.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin! The 3 part regiment is a bit above what I would spend, but it really makes my skin feel and look great when I use it every night.</li>
    <li> Love this multipurpose moistrizer -- clean and silky. Never sticky. Feels good on my dry skin. It works great day and night.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product it left my face smooth and I could see my wrinkles going away and leaving my skin nice4.</li>
    <li> Love this product Don&#x27;t care for the face cleanser though. Have used these products.  These are too pricey for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately two years and they work very well, are easy to use and are very reasonably priced when purchased through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product for aging and dry skin.</li>
    <li> Nightmare! Do Not give them your credit info, or you could be very sorry. Amazon should protect it&#x27;s customers and stop selling these products. The Justice Department and the FBI should raid the headquarters and make them refund people&#x27;s money.</li>
    <li> Does not do what it claims! Don&#x27;t waste your time of money only Laser or a face lift can get the results that they claim.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is light, smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out...I have bought several and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this cream.  It goes on easy and makes my skin feel fresh.  I think I get better results by using this cream as well as the MH3 N Dulge Extreme Regeneration moisturizer.  When used together my sink looks better.</li>
