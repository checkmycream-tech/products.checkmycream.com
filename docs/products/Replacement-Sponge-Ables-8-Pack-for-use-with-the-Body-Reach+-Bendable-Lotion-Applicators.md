      <li>Thanks for keeping them available.</li>
      <li>As long as its working without my help, 5 Lovely Stars!</li>
      <li>so when I order the second batch I stitched them up all the way around to make sure they held after washing them after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!</li>

      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply lotion to one&#x27;s back and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>The first time after using for several times they started to separate</li>
      <li>I like that they are large and cover a big area.  </li>
      <li>Really can apply lotions to the back and reach everything with ease.  </li>
      <li>Pads are good size and work well, however last oonly 2 times each and are expensive if using them every day as I do.</li>
      <li>The pads last for a very long time &amp; work exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I am using them for an expensive medicated cream, and can&#x27;t reach the spot of application,  I would have liked a much smaller applicator.</li>
      <li>No sharp edges, stays flat and can use again and again , and again.</li>

<li> The handle sucks if it gets wet</li>
<li> I have looked all over for something to apply medication to an area on my back that is difficult to reach.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not very often I am disappointed with an Amazon order. But the ad for this product is deceptive in that it says lotion applicators and has the pictures with the handles but all I got was the pads. It says Body-Reach+BENDABLE LOTION APPLICATORS. I looked it over thoroughly and there were no applicators.</li>
    <li> The quality was great and product is very practical; gets job done. Easy to use with right or left hand.</li>
    <li> Bought these to go with the applicator.  They are great, spread the lotion evenly and don&#x27;t absorb, so there is no waste.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Really can apply lotions to the back and reach everything with ease.  A fine idea and fine product.  No sharp edges, stays flat and can use again and again , and again.</li>
    <li> These pads are soft but strong, and they are easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Easy to rinse; holds lotion without dripping. Recommend.</li>
    <li> The sponges are for use with the bendable lotion applicator, which is an excellent product. The sponges are delicate.  I found that if you remove them from the applicator when they are wet,they don&#x27;t tear and will last a long time. If you try to remove them when they&#x27;re dry, they do tend to tear.</li>
    <li> Very good needed to put lotion on my back because of eczema so this helped a lot. I was very happy still got and I&#x27;m am still using it</li>
    <li> Sponges are good but bar not bendable nor can sponges be connected to bar.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot, this is the second time I have ordered them.  The first time after using for several times they started to separate so when I order the second batch I stitched them up all the way around to make sure they held after washing them after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Product.</li>
    <li> This did not come with the handle like I thought so they are not much help. I guess you have to read the fine print before you order this. It showed the handle so I assumed they came together. I have not bought the handle yet so can&#x27;t really say if they are good or not.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I had a STROKE that affected the right side of my body, I&#x27;m also right handed, learning to use my left hand and I though that this would help solve the problem of putting lotion on hard to reach areas of the body like my back and shoulder.  Big mistake!</li>
    <li> These are great for those hard to reach places like your back and shoulders. Goes with the following: 18&amp;#34; Semi-Flex Body Reach Bendable Applicator</li>
    <li> these last a long time</li>
    <li> When I try to reach my back over my shoulder with this wand, it torques sideways. Also, the handle is very slim and slippery, so it is hard to grasp and maneuver. It takes some effort to wash my back and apply lotion. I&#x27;m getting to where I almost dread the time and the effort it now takes just to take a shower. It works better reaching my back if I go in from my waist. Coverings of pads tend to separate from being torn from the applicator to rinse off soap and lotion products. I think I would like something like a long band with handles on both sides better. Will continue look for a way to get soap and lotion onto my back effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Pads are good size and work well, however last oonly 2 times each and are expensive if using them every day as I do.</li>
    <li> This was EXACTLY what I was looking for! I absolutely love it and use it daily, especially during these winter months.</li>
    <li> Great to have replacement sponges!</li>
    <li> I have looked all over for something to apply medication to an area on my back that is difficult to reach. This is perfect and the applicators are washable and can be reused.</li>
    <li> Not much to say on this stuff. Just an add on to the wand, which is great. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
    <li> Need the pads to use with the body reach, they do not come with it</li>
    <li> I bought the applicator, and it came with 2 sponges, and they clean so easily that it may be quite some time before I need to break into this pack, but it&#x27;s good to have extras on hand.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Best ever. Use for lotion and scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Also great, need these for the fabulous tool</li>
    <li> This is the perfect accompaniment for the Body Reach for which it is made. We purchased it for my husband and he loves it. No more coordinating schedules so I can rub cream on his back.</li>
    <li> No problems with the attachment to the Super-Flex Body Reach.  Stays put as it should and holds the lotion for proper application.</li>
    <li> The way the handle bends is just what I was looking for. The sponges are not flimsy, They last a long time.  I can reach every part of my body  with lotion now. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> These are extra pads for the bendable lotion applicator.  I like that they are large and cover a big area.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! The pads last for a very long time &amp; work exactly as advertised. I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Great replacements for my bendable wands.  Easy to put on and take off and work well for the purpose they were intended.</li>
    <li> The white lotion applicators are durable and washable.  I would recommend these to someone else.  Great to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I am using them for an expensive medicated cream, and can&#x27;t reach the spot of application,  I would have liked a much smaller applicator.</li>
    <li> Great items and so good to have when the mid back needs tending.</li>
    <li> this item doesn&#x27;t last long when used daily, I normaly use this item twice daily, and it lasts about 2 - 3 weeks before it comes apart. so far I haven&#x27;t found a sponge that can absorb as good as this while adequately applying my liquids or lotions evenly.</li>
    <li> Excema. Hard to reach on my back. Was very helpful in spreading medication..</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the product,I can,t reack my back so I have to inconvenience my wife so I bought this product from my DERM. The handle sucks if it gets wet it&#x27;s very slippery and becomes useless. The handle should be no skid</li>
    <li> Bought for GrandMother-In-Law. I would pay anything not to have to rub lotion into her legs! As long as its working without my help, 5 Lovely Stars!</li>
    <li> I really love this product so I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star. It is very easy to install on the wand so getting extras was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Arrived safely.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect to get to those hard to reach spots on your body. The sponge ambles allow you to apply whatever lotion, cream or ointment you like.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does what it says it does. It&#x27;s nice to finally be able to lotion my back.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since safety pins.  Easy to apply lotion to one&#x27;s back and lasts a long time.  I am so glad someone came up with this as it has made life much easier.</li>
    <li> Work great with the applicator sold separately.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, reasonable price.  Thanks for keeping them available.</li>
