      <li>This stamping set is amazing and has so many images to choose from!</li>
      <li>but that is an added expense if you don&#x27;t already own one.</li>

      <li>When I  received the plates,  the package was not damaged in any way but many of the plates were visibly scratched under the protective film.  </li>
      <li>Really cute designs.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>I love these plates.</li>
      <li>I am so excited about this set, my daughter loves it!</li>
      <li>They have nice clean engravings for easy transfer.</li>
      <li>They stamp SO well and SO cleanly, even without stamping polishes!</li>
      <li>SUCH gorgeous plates!</li>
      <li>This came very quickly.</li>
      <li>I have not used any of these yet or removed the film, but you can see the plates themselves are not of good quality and will not transfer a good image due to the scratches.  </li>
      <li>This is good and complete Item</li>
      <li>I love these plates, so many possibilities plus they stamp very well.</li>
      <li>really pretty I love them.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is still good for the price.</li>
      <li>Too cool.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and in pristine condition.</li>
      <li>There are more sets &amp; as I said before the plates are very nice but the Case is hard to get in and out of</li>
      <li>I own other brands and this goes to the top of my inventory.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cool,  and fun to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the clear images and the prints are pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Fun to work with and loads of designs to choose from.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I love all my PUEEN products and this is no different!</li>
      <li>There is so much design on each plate that you can make limitless designs on your nails!  </li>
      <li>Pretty designs on all the plates</li>
      <li>This is my first set of Buffet plates</li>
      <li>I was also able to give or sell the individual ones I&#x27;d ended up not using to others</li>
      <li>Pretty designs but doesn&#x27;t imprint very well.</li>
      <li>and they arrived really fast.  </li>
      <li>Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>Some of the plates work very well while others just don&#x27;t want to work at all.</li>
      <li>All the images seem to stamp very well.</li>
      <li>Many different designs to choose from for different styles.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I noticed is that some of the stamps are a bit large to fit a standard length nail</li>
      <li>Getting the stamper positioned just right to avoid any gaps can be a challenge with regular design in shape of rectangle.  </li>
      <li>Good product , came before the estimated date but apparently came mislabelling because I fail Series requested product, I can think that was mislabeled</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that some of the stamps are to large to fit a standard length nail.</li>
      <li>Every image comes out crisp and sharp.  </li>
      <li>You can combat this with a marshmallow stamper (soft squishy white stamper) by squishing the stamper while picking up and applying the image</li>
      <li>Nice pattern but sometimes hard to find the right for my client, not easy for short small nails</li>

<li> I have average size and rather short natural nails, and it takes me several tries with other plates to get the coverage needed.  </li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, so not sure how deeply etched the images are or well they transfer.</li>
<li> so I whittled down my collection to my favorites.</li>
<li> but still I stay with this collection , and hope soon to send to ask for the missing collection</li>
<li> I hate having to take the time to undo my nails because I wanted a certin look and was totally let down when the stamp would only work partially.</li>
<li> My one complaint though is that, I am missing plate 82</li>
<li> the images are not to thick</li>
<li> I have used some very bad plates in the past.</li>

    <li> Too cool. Fun to work with and loads of designs to choose from.  Worth the price.  Get the stamping polish from Konad to avoid headaches with polish. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this set, my daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, so not sure how deeply etched the images are or well they transfer. However I haven&#x27;t noticed any big scratches on the plates. My one complaint though is that, I am missing plate 82 (instead I received two of plate 92). Overall, it is still good for the price.</li>
    <li> super loving these plates!! the images are not to thick and i just love pueen stamping plates i have most of them!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Great designs, easy to use.</li>

    <li> okay plates ..the grooves in the design need to be deeper.</li>
    <li> This stamping set is amazing and has so many images to choose from! Pueen please release more of these!</li>
    <li> I got this set for my sister&#x27;s birthday.  It&#x27;s really cool,  and fun to use.  We used a ton of patterns to test them out and they all stamped nicely.  She was very happy with her gift, and I am planning to order one foe myself.</li>

    <li> The stamps work great! They have nice clean engravings for easy transfer. My only complaint is that some of the stamps are to large to fit a standard length nail. You can combat this with a marshmallow stamper (soft squishy white stamper) by squishing the stamper while picking up and applying the image but that is an added expense if you don&#x27;t already own one.</li>
    <li> These stamps work well as they have nice engravings for easy transfer. The only thing I noticed is that some of the stamps are a bit large to fit a standard length nail but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Great stamping plates. All the images seem to stamp very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on the positive reviews and my past experience with Pueen stamping plates. When I  received the plates,  the package was not damaged in any way but many of the plates were visibly scratched under the protective film.  I have not used any of these yet or removed the film, but you can see the plates themselves are not of good quality and will not transfer a good image due to the scratches.  Over 8 of the plates have damage that will make them unusable.</li>
    <li> Some of the plates work very well while others just don&#x27;t want to work at all. Even my hubby thought some could use a deeper etch so the paint had somewhere to go. 2 stars because most my plates didn&#x27;t work so well while others did. I hate having to take the time to undo my nails because I wanted a certin look and was totally let down when the stamp would only work partially.</li>
    <li> really pretty I love them.</li>

    <li> I love these plates. I love the clear images and the prints are pretty cool.</li>
    <li> Great stamped images. Great value</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T GET OVER THE SELECTION OF DESIGNS IN THIS SET.</li>
    <li> This came very quickly. Really cute designs. Love them in a Cass.</li>
    <li> Stamps easily!  Many different designs to choose from for different styles.  I was also able to give or sell the individual ones I&#x27;d ended up not using to others so I whittled down my collection to my favorites.</li>
    <li> I got my plates today and promptly started testing them.  Every image comes out crisp and sharp.  Love the size of the images because they cover all my finger nails without any struggles. I have average size and rather short natural nails, and it takes me several tries with other plates to get the coverage needed.  Getting the stamper positioned just right to avoid any gaps can be a challenge with regular design in shape of rectangle.  With this pueen collection I don&#x27;t have to aim perfectly to get the full coverage.  I own other brands and this goes to the top of my inventory.  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Received these as a Christmas gift.  I have used several of the plates and all designs I have used have picked up well on the stamper.  The plats are etched well.  There is so much design on each plate that you can make limitless designs on your nails!  Happy I received these!</li>
