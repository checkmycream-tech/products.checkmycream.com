      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>This powder is a very good product.</li>
      <li>but some fly by nite outfit in Bermuda.</li>
      <li>Great for preventing body odor.</li>
      <li>It absorbs oil without leaving a sticky residue, smells nice and gives hair volume!</li>
      <li>so I looked for a good deodonrant body powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend this Shower to Shower Powder if you are looking to a good powder for after a bath or shower.</li>
      <li>and now she smells good again and has stopped (some) of her complaining.  </li>
      <li>This is our favorite powder and it was a good price!</li>
      <li>The best powder for having fresh feeling and smelling nuts....</li>
      <li>Great Buy, I Love this product.</li>
      <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t think bottles of powder should squirt.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As powders go, I have always liked Shower to Shower.  </li>
      <li>Nice to not worry about running out.</li>
      <li>This fresh absorbent powder works great for whenever and wherever you need to spruce up.</li>
      <li>With more and more stores no longer carrying this product in their stores, this is very convenient and the price is great!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love Shower to Shower body powder.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The almighty dollar rules the day once more.</li>
      <li>Overall, an excellent product!</li>
      <li>I love Shower to Shower Body Powder, and this is my favorite fragrance of the line.  </li>
      <li>I was able to get some for her</li>
      <li>It smells clean and fresh and this is a really good price for the product.</li>
      <li>And, it&#x27;s easy to reapply in the Ladies room if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Excellent product, won&#x27;t change it for nothing, fresh scent, lasts for the day, keeps skin dry</li>
      <li>This scent has a light lavender scent to it.  </li>
      <li>Love the fresh fragrance.</li>
      <li>In our humid climate you need this to keep you relatively comfortable</li>
      <li>The seller was great; the items were exactly as described, very fast shipment, very well priced, I would purchase from the seller again.</li>
      <li>This original has a magic formula that works for really any areas that need freshening.</li>
      <li>The powder is fine and of good quality - it does not clump up when applied to dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This is so much smoother than many of the powders I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I know and love produced by a very time tested company Johnson &amp; Johnson</li>
      <li>Very silky and has a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>So glad that Amazon can help me to keep dry and with a nice sent too.</li>
      <li>This powder not only smells great but really works as intended.  </li>
      <li>Before going to bed instead of using a sticky roll on for the evening, the powder feels cool and fresh.</li>
      <li>They got the packaging right even though it&#x27;s trademarked by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</li>
      <li>Shower to Shower is not the underboob-sweat-killing answer to your prayers that maybe right now you are convinced it might be.</li>
      <li>I received exactly what I purchased, and received the item in a timely fashion.  </li>
      <li>and so when it gets that hot, I sweat like any person would.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>This was a great buy and it arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
      <li>Love the product anyway, but even better, it arrived about 3 days earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable, the delivery was fairly quick, and the product was as advertised: brand new and undamaged.</li>
      <li>I certainly will reorder it when I run out.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Highly recommend - no issues</li>
      <li>I use it everywhere - under my chest, my thighs, in my underpants, everywhere that you want to feel extra fresh.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>Have not been able to find this product locally, so I ordered enough to last for a while.</li>
      <li>My housemates and I just tried it and now we smell like old people, but old people in the 1980s I am serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I work in an office and need to look professional - not like I am sweating -</li>
      <li>Not the fresh lavender scent I had expected.</li>
      <li>This is the only scent i like (morning fresh).I use it on hot summer days and helps you feel dry.</li>
      <li>I am a 42 year old female who lives in the suburbs of Philadelphia.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used it, a quantity of 4 is a little too much.</li>

<li> Needless to say, it gets really hot and humid here in the Summertime.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;one container is not worth my time or gas.</li>
<li> (and this would have been forgivable if the scent hadn&#x27;t made me angry by instantly evaporating any semblance of youthful sex appeal from my person, so keep in mind that I am a LITTLE biased) you need to be careful when applying because it might accidentally end up in your mouth.</li>
<li> far as how long it lasts, in the worst heat, this last for about 2 or 3 hours.  </li>
<li> i have used this product for years and find that very few stores carry the line.</li>
<li> Shower to Shower powder is hard to find in my area.  </li>

    <li> i have used this product for years and find that very few stores carry the line.</li>
    <li> As powders go, I have always liked Shower to Shower.  This was a great buy and it arrived earlier than expected.  If you like the product, this is a can&#x27;t miss.  If you&#x27;ve never used it, a quantity of 4 is a little too much.</li>
    <li> This powder not only smells great but really works as intended.  I would recommend this especially if you tend to sweat.</li>
    <li> Best powder in the market. In our humid climate you need this to keep you relatively comfortable</li>
    <li> Highly recommend - no issues</li>

    <li> Just as described! Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> Mom has been using this for years but couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  Thanks to Amazon I was able to get some for her and now she smells good again and has stopped (some) of her complaining.  :)</li>
    <li> This is our favorite powder and it was a good price! I would recommend this Shower to Shower Powder if you are looking to a good powder for after a bath or shower.</li>
    <li> Not the fresh lavender scent I had expected.</li>
    <li> I love Shower to Shower body powder. It smells clean and fresh and this is a really good price for the product. I had been using it for a couple of years, then suddenly, my Houston Walgreens and then my grocery store stopped carrying it. I was very happy to find it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware! This is not the Shower to Shower I know and love produced by a very time tested company Johnson &amp; Johnson but some fly by nite outfit in Bermuda. They got the packaging right even though it&#x27;s trademarked by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Pity. The almighty dollar rules the day once more.</li>
    <li> I am going to do a public service here and tell you to only buy this powder if you are seeking to bring back memories of your grandparents. My housemates and I just tried it and now we smell like old people, but old people in the 1980s I am serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also (and this would have been forgivable if the scent hadn&#x27;t made me angry by instantly evaporating any semblance of youthful sex appeal from my person, so keep in mind that I am a LITTLE biased) you need to be careful when applying because it might accidentally end up in your mouth. Honestly I don&#x27;t think bottles of powder should squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. Proceed with caution, Amazon shoppers. Shower to Shower is not the underboob-sweat-killing answer to your prayers that maybe right now you are convinced it might be.</li>
    <li> Slight funky smell,  when I sweat it just made a paste opposed to helping me stay dry like advertized.  In the garbage they go.</li>
    <li> Have not been able to find this product locally, so I ordered enough to last for a while. The price was reasonable, the delivery was fairly quick, and the product was as advertised: brand new and undamaged.</li>
    <li> Shower to Shower powder is hard to find in my area.  The seller was great; the items were exactly as described, very fast shipment, very well priced, I would purchase from the seller again.</li>
    <li> The best powder for having fresh feeling and smelling nuts....my girlfriend loves to smell my nuts and yours will too!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, won&#x27;t change it for nothing, fresh scent, lasts for the day, keeps skin dry</li>
    <li> With more and more stores no longer carrying this product in their stores, this is very convenient and the price is great!</li>
    <li> This is the only scent i like (morning fresh).I use it on hot summer days and helps you feel dry.Great for preventing body odor.</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old female who lives in the suburbs of Philadelphia.  Needless to say, it gets really hot and humid here in the Summertime.  I am a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; person (meaning, I am always warmer than everyone else around me) and so when it gets that hot, I sweat like any person would.  I work in an office and need to look professional - not like I am sweating - so I looked for a good deodonrant body powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this deodorant powder after I dry off after getting out of the shower.  I use it everywhere - under my chest, my thighs, in my underpants, everywhere that you want to feel extra fresh.  This scent has a light lavender scent to it.  Actually, I don&#x27;t even like the scent of Lavender but for some reason, I like this.  Once you put it on, after a minute, the scent dissipates so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume scent if you wear that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how long it lasts, in the worst heat, this last for about 2 or 3 hours.  But, in my air conditioned office (even though I am in the heat on my way to and from the office), it lasts almost all day.  And, it&#x27;s easy to reapply in the Ladies room if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this daily (winter and summer) for about 4 years now and I absolutely can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I purchased, and received the item in a timely fashion.  I would purchase this item again</li>
    <li> If this is the only product you use for body powder than you might as well buy a few together and save some $ ...&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;ve used my four I&#x27;ll just order another pack of four.  Driving over to Walmart every 2 months or so to buy&lt;br /&gt;one container is not worth my time or gas.</li>
    <li> Nice to not worry about running out. Love the fresh fragrance. Perfect.</li>
    <li> This is so much smoother than many of the powders I have tried.  I certainly will reorder it when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love Shower to Shower Body Powder, and this is my favorite fragrance of the line.  The powder is fine and of good quality - it does not clump up when applied to dry skin.  Overall, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great Buy, I Love this product.Will order again. Thanks</li>
    <li> This fresh absorbent powder works great for whenever and wherever you need to spruce up. Before going to bed instead of using a sticky roll on for the evening, the powder feels cool and fresh. No time to wash your hair (blondes), sprinkle this powder on your roots, rub in and wipe away excess with a towel. It absorbs oil without leaving a sticky residue, smells nice and gives hair volume! Side note, the other fragrances don&#x27;t work as well on hair for some reason. This original has a magic formula that works for really any areas that need freshening. Oh, forgot about feet/shoes - powder is not too silky like baby powder so feet don&#x27;t slide around in shoes and not sticky like Gold Bond.</li>
