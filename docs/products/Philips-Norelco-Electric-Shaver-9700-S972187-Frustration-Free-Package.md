      <li>Apart from the impressive design, what matters the most to me, is the great job it does.</li>
      <li>Great, a good close shave</li>
      <li>The cleaning machine is not as good as the Braun.  </li>
      <li>The included carrying case is comparable to Braun&#x27;s, hard-sided, and superior to Panasonic&#x27;s; none of them have room for accessories like a cord,</li>
      <li>The included carrying case is comparable to Braun&#x27;s, hard-sided, and superior to Panasonic&#x27;s; none of them have room for accessories like a cord,</li>
      <li>the shaver is cleaned well and smells good, that i like a lot.</li>
      <li>I have never used an electric razor that shaves as good as this one.</li>
      <li>The shaver does a good job.  </li>
      <li>Love the cleaning feature, and is great in the shower.</li>
      <li>The cleaming system is something that I have wanted to acquire for many years; does a great job of cleaning the shaver.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall very satisfied</li>
      <li>Was very satisfied with customer service.</li>
      <li>This product delivers every thing  that it advertizes to do in my opinion, i am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly close shave, to be sure, but the Braun Series 7 are superior in terms of closeness of shave, and ease of use of the cleaning features.</li>
      <li>I own a Braun, Panasonic and now the Norelco 9700 shaver.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-cleaner/charging station is nice</li>
      <li>The absolute best electric shaver on earth!  </li>
      <li>Also, the travel case is nice but has no room for the charging cord or the trimmer attachment, so you have to pack those separately.</li>
      <li>The razor is also lighter and the three speeds is a nice feature.</li>
      <li>I also like the way the blades come off to allow a nice rinse out under the faucet.</li>
      <li>shave itself is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve experienced, the battery lasts forever (in my case close to a week of shaves without recharging), and it&#x27;s the quietest electric I&#x27;ve ever used - orders of magnitude quieter than the Panasonic or Braun.</li>
      <li>Great unit works super .</li>
      <li>Good build quality , nice smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>and you have a bright clean sterile shaving head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and have been shaving for 30 years and most of that has been on Norelco products.  </li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Clunky storage/charger takes up valuable counter top space.</li>
      <li>I have used Norelco electric razors for many years.</li>
      <li>The 1290X had a better switch.  </li>
      <li>The Braun does a much better job of cleaning the shaver heads.  </li>
      <li>i am glad Philips added that to series 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got this Philips Norelcro the top line $300 shaver to replace my Panasonic ES, an $80 shaver.&lt;br</li>
      <li>get one, you will love it...</li>
      <li>I expect I&#x27;ll get used to having to charge it more often.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, the shaver is just okay.</li>
      <li>When I phoned Philips to inquire about this, I was told it would be ok to leave the shaver pluged in, no harm would come to the shaver/battery.</li>
      <li>Will it be better?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, sure, after 6 months, the razor itself still works but the charger/cleaner does not.  </li>
      <li>don,t wash your face before you shave and you will love it.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cleaning unit work great and very quite.</li>
      <li>--let me give them more money&amp;#34; path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>much better than Braun</li>
      <li>Switched to this shaver from another 3 blade Norelco and this has given me a much better shave.  </li>
      <li>Husband loved this one better than the first one he had.</li>
      <li>A dry shave is a great convenience travelling though, so it&#x27;s good to have both options.  </li>
      <li>A dry shave is a great convenience travelling though, so it&#x27;s good to have both options.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sanitize like Braun&#x27;s alcohol cleaner, but I&#x27;m not convinced that having something generating hot alcohol vapor on your bathroom counter is a good idea</li>
      <li>I was just as happy with a four year old model.</li>
      <li>The beard/moustache/sideburn trimmer is not integral to the shaver, but it&#x27;s far more robust and effective than the pop-up kind, and switching heads is a snap.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to overlook the trimmer.</li>
      <li>can just as easily rinse it under running water.</li>
      <li>Sure, it &amp;#34;pretended&amp;#34; to clean--went through all the motions and noises of cleaning--but no, it didn&#x27;t actually clean anything.  </li>
      <li>The Braun has the best cleaning system hands down.</li>
      <li>the Panasonic for 1/3 of the price was as good as this one once new.</li>
      <li>My previous Norelco had a built in flip up trimmer which was excellent.  </li>
      <li>the one previous to this was 1280x was the best i have ever used</li>
      <li>Fine product but pricey</li>
      <li>shaves well and quick better than bruan</li>
      <li>Quiet, sleek, easy to use, and you get a great shave.</li>
      <li>My husband is a HUGE fan of this shaver.  </li>
      <li>easy to clean</li>
      <li>and this razor gives him a close smooth shave with zero irritation.</li>
      <li>Not too easy to disassemble and reassemble to clean.</li>
      <li>was making a grinding sound.</li>
      <li>I would also have to say this model feels cheap compared to the 1290X.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-close shave and comfortable shape</li>
      <li>It took a few times for him (and his skin) to get used to it, but now it is the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
      <li>Great razor no need to have to take 4 hours to dry.</li>
      <li>For those times you need to shave more than once per day, there is no irritation &amp; the shaver gives a very close &amp; smooth shave.</li>
      <li>B006W2SYGM Philips Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System (Series 8000)</li>
      <li>It gives a clean shave just as a razor would but think on the go.</li>
      <li>I clean the shaver after every use.</li>
      <li>the first time in 50 years of shaving with almost every kind of shaving gear, I really can report no negatives with this shaver.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Superb shave and shaver. A previous user of multiple electrics, including Panasonic&#x27;s ES-LV81 [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System for Men]], Braun&#x27;s 799c [[ASIN:B00BWRLJ6O BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]], and a Norelco 1280 and 1290x [[ASIN:B006W2SYGM Philips Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System (Series 8000) (Frustration-Free Packaging)]], and just recently a DE (double-edged) razor user again after a few years hiatus.  After switching to a DE razor, I never thought I&#x27;d use an electric again, much less a rotary; the new Norelco solves all my prior issues with these shavers - which were either too noisy, too irritating (or too dangerous), too slow, too messy, or too ineffective. The 9700 is quiet, fast, efficient, convenient and comfortable, and provides as close a shave as my DE razor using my artisan shaving soaps (a wet shaver), as well as a more consistent and even shave - and the new head design just seems to glide over your face and leave nothing behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in 50 years of shaving with almost every kind of shaving gear, I really can report no negatives with this shaver. The cleaning system is as good as Braun&#x27;s (and cartridges are less expensive, non-alcohol based and last longer - reportedly 3 months vs. a month), and better than Panasonic&#x27;s (which requires a separate water tank, can be smelly, and really needs distilled water).  The 4 hour drying time is not an issue because I&#x27;m not going to be shaving again in 4 hours, but if you really wanted to the actual cleaning only takes ten minutes, so you could rinse and shave again after the cleaning cycle is done before drying was complete.  It doesn&#x27;t sanitize like Braun&#x27;s alcohol cleaner, but I&#x27;m not convinced that having something generating hot alcohol vapor on your bathroom counter is a good idea - I&#x27;m not planning on sharing my shaver, and my soap isn&#x27;t sanitized either.  Having a cleaning station at home is very convenient because you just rinse the shaver and drop it in the station when finished shaving, and automatic electronics take care of the rest.  On the road, you just pop off the top plate with the shaving heads, rinse under hot water, and pop back on - finished cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve experienced, the battery lasts forever (in my case close to a week of shaves without recharging), and it&#x27;s the quietest electric I&#x27;ve ever used - orders of magnitude quieter than the Panasonic or Braun. The beard/moustache/sideburn trimmer is not integral to the shaver, but it&#x27;s far more robust and effective than the pop-up kind, and switching heads is a snap. Norelco has cleverly made this a system razor, so other snap-on attachments like the beard/hair trimmer or facial brush (I think available in Europe, soon here) will work as well, without having to purchase another device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This design also lets you change out individual comb/cutter sets in the event one is damaged or you don&#x27;t want to change the entire head, something not possible on most earlier Norelcos. A complete set of cutters/combs is about $10 more than Braun&#x27;s cartridge head, about $20 less than Panasonic&#x27;s foil/cutter set (as of right now); and you get about a year of shaving with any of them with similar use (mine has been less than this with all of them, but it depends on your beard and how frequently you shave). Display is large and easy to read, and appears accurate for percentage of charge left; an electronic travel lock effectively disables all buttons for travel or storage.  Another well thought-out feature is the 3-speed motor, allowing adjustment for skin sensitivity. I really haven&#x27;t had to use anything over the lowest speed yet, resulting in an extremely comfortable shave for my more sensitive face.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all wet shavers, you can&#x27;t use it as a corded razor, but unlikeits Norelco wet predecessors, you can connect a cord to recharge it on the road, without carrying around a bulky charging base, and charging is quick (less than an hour for a full charge, or maybe five or ten minutes for one shave).  And unlike the earlier Norelcos, the shaver itself (as well as the cleaning station) has an automatic cutoff so you can leave it plugged in after it charges without wrecking the battery.  The included carrying case is comparable to Braun&#x27;s, hard-sided, and superior to Panasonic&#x27;s; none of them have room for accessories like a cord, although that&#x27;s probably a good idea considering the jostling it will get in your airline baggage and the potential damage to its plastic exterior - Panasonic&#x27;s case is the least protective of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dry and a wet shaver, so it works either way, but I have come to prefer a wet shave as more comfortable (for me); nothing like a shaving scuttle and warm lather, a habit I got from my DE shaving days.  A dry shave is a great convenience travelling though, so it&#x27;s good to have both options.  As a dry shaver it should be at least as effective as its SensoTouch predecessors (previously the 1200 series, now 8000), and reportedly as comfortable, but I have not personally tested it yet.  The new heads for this Norelco are those used on the new 8000 series, so the shaves should be identical, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive (though comparable or cheaper than the top-of-the-line Braun or newest Panasonic - [[ASIN:B00BWRLJ6O BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]], [[ASIN:B00FPQ70Z2 Panasonic ES-LV95-S Arc5 Wet/Dry Shaver with Cleaning and Charging System]]) but you only buy quality once - highly recommended!nnect a cord to recharge it on the road, without carrying around a bulky charging base, and charging is quick (less than an hour for a full charge, or maybe five or ten minutes for one shave).

    <li> When I receive shaever it was damage I was not happy</li>
    <li> This product delivers every thing  that it advertizes to do in my opinion, i am very satisfied with my purchase. it goes beyond that</li>
    <li> My husband is a HUGE fan of this shaver.  He replaced a Braun CoolTec shaver that he had for less than a year and the difference between the two is night and day.  It;s really hard to believe that the shave can be this much closer with the 9721.  The battery life isn&#x27;t quite as long as with the Braun but the quality of the shave far makes up for that.  You will not be disappointed!!.</li>
    <li> Not good as a body shaver, but very clearly smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about 2 weeks now and I would have to say that does shave better that the 1290X which it replaced, especially in the neck area.  I am not particularly fond of having to use the cleaner. It takes up a lot of room on the counter and takes a long time to complete a cycle (4+ hours).  Frankly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that necessary.  I just rinsed out the old model with water and that worked fine.  I would also have to say this model feels cheap compared to the 1290X.  It&#x27;s very light weight and the plastic feels like very low quality compared to the predecessor.  I also don&#x27;t care for the on/off button on this model. I keep accidentally hitting it while I&#x27;m shaving and turning the shaver off.  The 1290X had a better switch.  I do think the trimmer works better than the one that&#x27;s incorporated into the 1290X, so long as you can find it.  All in all, a good shaver, but overpriced for the apparent quality and compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Using the cleaner system that came with this one. Not too easy to disassemble and reassemble to clean. Have had several Norelco razors and those head assemblies seemed easier. Had to contact customer service shortly after receiving as one of the disks on head was making a grinding sound. By express mail had not only a new head system but a whole new razor. Was very satisfied with customer service. If purchase another razor would get Norelco again however would get one of the less expensive models. This one was not worth the additional cost.</li>
    <li> Have been a Norelco customer for a while.  In my opinion, this is their best razor. Also, it appears that the cleaning system has finally risen to the excellence level of the razor itself</li>
    <li> Great unit works super . But the shaver head comes off a little too easy. Cleaning unit work great and very quite.</li>
    <li> Well, the Shaver is excellent however what I didn&#x27;t know at first was that the head had to be removed to attached the cutter for the Sideburns. That is very hard for me to do since I only have one arm there is no real good way to handle the Shaver and detach plus attach the cutter. I would never have bought the thing had I known or further researched, my bad one, but again, the shaver is great for that the reason of giving 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Product designer here - I have been using Philips shavers for over 10 years. This is one of the best in terms of form and function. I have been using this model for over 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-you can charge it without the charging stand or cradle. This is the major improvement from the last version so you can take only the AC adapter with you when traveling&lt;br /&gt;-nice rigid travel case&lt;br /&gt;-close shave and comfortable shape to hold&lt;br /&gt;-3d head reaches all areas well&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-cleaner/charging station is nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the trimmer is a separate attachment, not integrated as in previous designs&lt;br /&gt;-there is no cover for the rotary head so if you travel, you will get lots of dust inside the travel case&lt;br /&gt;-the LED readout shows % of battery left NOT the number of minutes! This is a huge disappointment as previous versions showed # of minutes. How am I supposed to know how much time is left when you show me a %? For this reason the next lower model is probably good enough&lt;br /&gt;-once you start a cleaning cycle you can&#x27;t pause it. If it stops you have to restart it.&lt;br /&gt;-I only charge and clean about once a month in the base and rinse under the sink daily. The solution can be pricey if you use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very satisfied and I hope they keep making improvements</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very close shave and absolutely no irritation.  I purchased during Dec. 2015. and just changed the blades on 5/8/15 after about 4-1/2 months.  The instructions state the blades should last about a year, but I noticed a considerable change for the better after I changed the blades.  This is a great shaver.  For those times you need to shave more than once per day, there is no irritation &amp; the shaver gives a very close &amp; smooth shave. RDF</li>
    <li> get one, you will love it...may even kiss it a few times...shaving is no longer a problem.</li>
    <li> So far so good.nice shave.. Cleaning fluid leaked during shipping</li>
    <li> Pros:Good build quality , nice smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: price , the device is getting warmer whille in use.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted to replace his older Norelco razor and decided to purchase this one.  He is very happy with this purchase and enjoys the fact it cleans itself.  He has very sensitive facial skin and this razor gives him a close smooth shave with zero irritation.</li>
    <li> This razor is making a loud, piercing winding noise. I did not expect this from a $300 + razor. Was I sent a rebuilt razor? It was supposed to be brand new. I am not happy.</li>
    <li> I cannot charge the shaver. At first the shaver has a little power. But it cannot be charged now. How can I fix it?</li>
    <li> Husband loved this one better than the first one he had. It gives a clean shave just as a razor would but think on the go.</li>
    <li> shaves well and quick better than bruan</li>
    <li> Fine product but pricey</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and so far he loves it! It took a few times for him (and his skin) to get used to it, but now it is the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
    <li> I have used the old style Norelco for many years and think this new cleaning tank is an expensive waste!! Here is what I do and it will work for any Norelco shaver. I have a small plastic upper ware cup which I pour approximately 1/2 inch of 70 or 90% proof alcohol which can be purchased at your drug store for around $3.00 or less for a good size bottle. Once a week I run the shaver with the head into the alcohol for 20 or 30 seconds. Then open the head and run water thru it and you have a bright clean sterile shaving head. Try it and you will see that it works.  Been doing it for years!!&lt;br /&gt;Dave Garber</li>
    <li> Switched to this shaver from another 3 blade Norelco and this has given me a much better shave.  The stubborn upper lip hair was easily taken care of and the 3 speed setting is a nice touch.  If you have used the previous shaver with the self cleaner that dipped, this system is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean and it looks pretty sharp sitting on the shelf.  The only drawback is the buzzer attachment.  My previous Norelco had a built in flip up trimmer which was excellent.  I found the attachment style with this unit to be terrible.  Otherwise its a great shaver and it&#x27;s easy to overlook the trimmer.</li>
    <li> The absolute best electric shaver on earth!  I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers all my life, and really didn&#x27;t think that they could much improve on the Arcitec I bought some eight or nine years ago.  Was I wrong on that call.  Using this incredible product is like having a laser cutting your beard as opposed to blades.  That&#x27;s how close it is.  And it&#x27;s virtually silent compared to the last shaver.</li>
    <li> Great, a good close shave</li>
    <li> Actually am using philips shaving machines since long time the one previous to this was 1280x was the best i have ever used and when i decided to buy a replacement head i found the price almost equal this new model so decided to buy the norelco S9721 and really big difference between the 2 products as the new one always the head is displaced while shaving because it is made of plastic so i really recommend everyone wants to buy to choose the 1280 x he will never regret&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco for years.  This shaver delivers a close shave with no irritation.  The cleaming system is something that I have wanted to acquire for many years; does a great job of cleaning the shaver.</li>
    <li> My first Philips shaver.It&#x27;s have a nice look but the shaving is not clean. By midday it always looks like I need to shave again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband. Seems not bad.</li>
    <li> I need Norelco to send a new triple head assemblely with the v cutter,3 new heads,the complete head assemblely to shave with, for 330.00 I&#x27;m not to impressed on the quality of the triple head ,I need you to send out a replacement head assemblely today or refund 330.00 credit,after 22 days this happened.</li>
    <li> Its not worth the price. I got this Philips Norelcro the top line $300 shaver to replace my Panasonic ES, an $80 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for over a month now and not impressed. the Panasonic for 1/3 of the price was as good as this one once new. The quality of the shave is good, but not 3 time better than the cheaper shaver if correlated to the price.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is horrible. It works very poorly with short hair. Panasonic was much better.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system/charging station works great. I clean the shaver after every use. the shaver is cleaned well and smells good, that i like a lot. The station looks cool and takes little space.</li>
    <li> I tried to use it, but my face broke out after every use found out cleaning solution is not a disinfectant. Also it left parts of my neck untouched...contacted Phillips to return it under their 6-week guarantee without a problem.</li>
    <li> The shaver machine not completely short beard, works very slowly and need more power to cut the beard, to shave have to use a manual razor</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric razors for many years. Most recently I had a SensoTouch  3D and before that an Arcitec. First off, I would say that the 9700 provides a noticeably quieter and closer shave than the previous models. The razor is also lighter and the three speeds is a nice feature. Overall I am very happy with it. One of things that has improved over the SensoTouch is the charging. In that model, you had to have it in its stand to charge it--no plugging in directly to the razor. This was a problem if you traveled for longer than a single charge would last in that it forced you to pack the stand which is unwieldy and somewhat fragile. The 9700 allows you to charge directly to the razor. This feature does not interfere with your ability to use the razor for a wet shave, however. I also like the way the blades come off to allow a nice rinse out under the faucet. Much better than the old flip up models.The cleaning station is OK if you have room for it on your bathroom counter, but is not necessary to clean the razor. I also like the separate trimmer attachment. Yes I know it takes a little extra effort to pull off the razor blades and snap on the trimmer, but for the performance you get over the old built in trimmers, it is well worth it. My few quibbles with the product are that the on/off button is not a membrane touch but rather has to be depressed until it clicks. It seems a little flimsy and plastic and I worry if it will hold up over time. Also, the travel case is nice but has no room for the charging cord or the trimmer attachment, so you have to pack those separately. I would have preferred these to be all packable in one case. That said, the 9700 is really the first electric I have owned that can really be compared to a blade shaver, straight or safety; it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric razor that shaves as good as this one. Wow, even after a few month of using this Norelco 9700 I&#x27;m still amazed at how closely it shaves compared to my old one (10+ years old). I haven&#x27;t used a regular razor since using this new Norelco and I never will again. And my skin is very happy to hear that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco Spectra 8894xl since the spring of 2003. It still has the original Lithium Ion battery, and it still holds two hours worth of battery charge. The 9700 definitely offers a closer shave. It&#x27;s tough to tell from that of a blade. It&#x27;s also much lighter and easier to handle. I expect I&#x27;ll get used to having to charge it more often. With the included stand, it isn&#x27;t any trouble to do so. I don&#x27;t find the stand to be excessively large, as some of the other reviewers have. Everyone has different priorities, though. If you want a quick, convenient, really close shave, this may be for you.</li>
    <li> Great razor no need to have to take 4 hours to dry. Braun&#x27;s razor cleans and drys much faster.</li>
    <li> wasnt wowed when i switched from razers</li>
    <li> So far it performs very well.</li>
    <li> much better than Braun</li>
    <li> Clunky storage/charger takes up valuable counter top space. Expensive to replace fluid cleaner.</li>
    <li> Very good and just what I was hoping for. Holds a charge for a nice long time too, so no need to charge after every 2nd or 3rd shave.</li>
    <li> I like this very much. I would like a closer shave though. Just should not expect razor close.</li>
    <li> Too much technology here with the cleaner etc. can just as easily rinse it under running water. For the price I wasn&#x27;t impressed and returned it.</li>
    <li> I own a Braun, Panasonic and now the Norelco 9700 shaver. The Panasonic LV-95 and Norelco 9700 are very close in comparison when it comes to to the actual shave. Both are superb! In my opinion the braun dry shave cannot compare to the gel/cream shave you can get with the Panasonic or norelco. The Braun has the best cleaning system hands down. The Norelco 9000 series cleaning system has a 4 hour drying cycle, which is ridiculous to say the least. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t have 4 hours to sit around and wait for a shaver to complete its cycle. When I phoned Philips to inquire about this, I was told it would be ok to leave the shaver pluged in, no harm would come to the shaver/battery. Any comments?</li>
    <li> Unquestionably the best electric shaver I have ever had. Although it might be a little pricey its full value. Quiet, sleek, easy to use, and you get a great shave. Love the cleaning feature, and is great in the shower.</li>
    <li> Well i was using norelco 3D before this and when it finally stopped working after 5 years of loyalty, i decided to try Braun cause i was under the impression that it is &amp;#34;stronger and more muscular&amp;#34;, my facial hair is thick and it grows fast. I used Braun 7 7900cc for two weeks and i couldnt wait to return it; What i first noticed about the shaving unit was the cheap sense of touch and an awful design.the annoying vibration  leaves your hand numb after each shave. It is very very noisy and even noisier cleaning, although cleaning is so efficient, this owes to the structural differences between foil and rotary system. what i liked about Braun was, unlike my old norelco 3D, it has the direct plug in charger feature. i am glad Philips added that to series 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my new Philips Norelco, the shave is very close and particularly does a better job than previous philips shavers while shaving under the neck area, which is usually not optimum for electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;very quiet and very efficient and quiet cleaning. Yes you can use water to clean it, but it doesnt give you the fresh scent on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Yes they had to put the clipper as a seperate accessory, which fits perfectly into the travel bag, no hassle for me. Apart from the impressive design, what matters the most to me, is the great job it does. no hair pulling when your shaving the side (unlike Braun) and no unnecessary vibration. you can actually shave and clean without waking the whole neighborhood up!</li>
    <li> It was a great shaver with an excellent battery life. But something went wrong. After almost 6 months of usage, the shaving heads group started disconnecting from the unit while shaving. It was very annoying. I had no other choice than return to my old brand.</li>
    <li> First of all, the base charger/cleaning unit is a complete piece of junk. After docking the shaver and running it through a cleaning/charging cycle, four of us spent two hours trying to figure out how to release the shaver from the docking unit. We ended up breaking apart the docking unit to get the shaver out, so I could at least use it. We read the instruction manual (what a joke to even call it that) dozens of times, and it told us nothing. It&#x27;s absolutely the epitome of poor engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the shaver is just okay. I&#x27;ve bought every new Norelco or Braun shaver to hit the market for the past twenty years, and while this one is perhaps the best of the Norelco lineup to date, it&#x27;s inferior to the latest Brauns. It&#x27;s a fairly close shave, to be sure, but the Braun Series 7 are superior in terms of closeness of shave, and ease of use of the cleaning features. I always want to like Norelco best, but unfortunately this one won&#x27;t be replacing my Braun this time around.</li>
    <li> Great electric shaver. If you know how to use it it&#x27;s almost as close as a blade</li>
    <li> Does not shave as close as I had expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect device &amp; gr8 delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using norelco razer for over 40 years this the best ever.remember don,t wash your face before you shave and you will love it.</li>
    <li> Kudos to their advertising department. There R&amp;D did not come through. I was just as happy with a four year old model. Expected more for the $$$$.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver......would buy again</li>
    <li> The shaver does a good job.  The cleaning machine is not as good as the Braun.  The Braun does a much better job of cleaning the shaver heads.  I spoke to Norelco and they said I should run the shave head under water before placing in the cleaning machine.  I never had to do anything even if my beard was heavy.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my husband for his birthday. He loves it!</li>
    <li> An electric shaver for the 21st century ... It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> shaver good cleaner sucks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed, for both Norelco and myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit worked out of the box and did a decent job shaving and cleaning.  The blades, which supposedly last 1-2 years, did dull rather quickly.  But that&#x27;s a case of &amp;#34;your mileage may vary&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m really not knocking any points off for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, the real problem is the cleaning system.  It broke.  After 6 months.  That&#x27;s right:  six months after my purchase, it stopped feeding the liquid into the cleaning unit.  Sure, it &amp;#34;pretended&amp;#34; to clean--went through all the motions and noises of cleaning--but no, it didn&#x27;t actually clean anything.  Replacement liquid didn&#x27;t solve the problem.  Completely manually cleaning out the charging/cleaning receptacle didn&#x27;t fix anything.  Taking apart the razor, heads, foil, and manually cleaning them out (which contained a lot of stuck hairs from 2-3 weeks of &amp;#34;faking it&amp;#34;) didn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, sure, after 6 months, the razor itself still works but the charger/cleaner does not.  The thing is, this was purchased together.  That&#x27;s unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco used to mean quality.  I swore by them for years.  I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and have been shaving for 30 years and most of that has been on Norelco products.  But, some of the shame should be on me.  I had an 8000 series that stopped charging after 15 months.  Silly me, I took that as an excuse to get the newer model and got just 6 months out of that one.  Yes, shame on me for going down the road of &amp;#34;it broke--let me give them more money&amp;#34; path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, see if Amazon has a &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; offer where you can have a new one shipped to you automatically every 6 months.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to a new Panasonic.  Will it be better?  Time will tell.  I don&#x27;t have long to wait, though.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it and uses it almost everyday</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it does not perform any better than my old SensoTouch 3D Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retired my SensoTouch 3D Shaver because the replacement heads got way too expensive - for those of you still using this shaver, you can change it to the same head as the 9000 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One regret that I have is not going with the 9400 because I really don&#x27;t see the need for a digital readout for remaining battery life, whereas the bar display on the 9400 is more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high and low speed adjustment is a bit of a gimmick - who would shave at less than full speed and power?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just received a warranty replacement cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning fluid pump in the cleaning unit failed - the little electric motor shaft corroded right through and the impeller fell off - see photo of the pump motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2:&lt;br /&gt;I have changed from 4 to 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The head attachment to the body has become so loose that when the slightest sideways force is applied while shaving the head partly detaches and the drive coupling screeches.&lt;br /&gt;I compared it to me old 3D shaver and there&#x27;s clearly a design change - the head attachment on my old 3D shaver is very secure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be contacting warranty support for them to resolve this, and will update with the outcome.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Cuts very close and evenly.</li>
    <li> Best eclectic shaver. I think its worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Highly recommend. Just goes to prove you get what you pay for.</li>
