      <li>So So pretty!</li>
      <li>Colorful pink, but not too bold or bright.</li>
      <li>This color is also a great hot pink!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice summer color and is a deep but bright pink.</li>
      <li>Will make you smile.</li>

      <li>Very vibrant and fun, but not obnoxious.</li>

      <li>Love this color, I wore it in October for Breast Cancer Awareness the entire month!</li>
      <li>Have already used and is exactly as it looks on screen.</li>
      <li>this was the first time I used the OPI gel polish</li>
      <li>Dries fast under the lamp.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Now it isn&#x27;t very noticeable</li>
      <li>She has been using GelColor OPI for a year now and really loves the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This pink is great for dark skin tones.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark, and stays on for 2 weeks or more but have to redo because of the growth line.</li>
      <li>Fun color that totally hit the mark.</li>
      <li>To take it off I usually use my nail drill to get the top layer off, and if I&#x27;m in a hurry...</li>
      <li>Its a nite intense hot pink</li>
      <li>but if you wanted to use a clear polish it might be noticeable.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I had to redo my manicure and pedicure was because my nails had grown so much.  </li>
      <li>She boast to her friends all the time that she does her nails professionally &amp;#34;@ home&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>OPI is definitely my least favorite.</li>
      <li>Other brands don&#x27;t match exactly</li>
      <li>This polish leaves my nails chip free and shiny for at least 10 days.</li>
      <li>like opi products but the down fall it will only dry in a uv light dryer if you can find one that works</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these.</li>
      <li>This product had sand grains, and did not dry correctly, only lasting about a week (following her normal routine).</li>

<li> It does on very thin, so unless you want see-through color you need to put on about 5 coats.</li>

<li> The reason for giving it a 4 is because it does bleed through the base coat to your nails.  </li>

    <li> So So pretty! Love this color, I wore it in October for Breast Cancer Awareness the entire month!</li>
    <li> I love OPI gel polish and this color in particular. Its a nite intense hot pink but it doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark, and stays on for 2 weeks or more but have to redo because of the growth line. The price was good and delivery very prompt. It was well packed in a bubble&lt;br /&gt;wrap envelope.</li>
    <li> OPI gel color is great! It stays looking perfect and super shiny for weeks.  The only reason I had to redo my manicure and pedicure was because my nails had grown so much.  This color is also a great hot pink!  Taking it off can be a challenge if you don&#x27;t file the surface a bit first.  Great product</li>
    <li> like opi products but the down fall it will only dry in a uv light dryer if you can find one that works</li>
    <li> Fun color that totally hit the mark. I wore it for my friends wedding and she loved the color. Very vibrant and fun, but not obnoxious. I brought to my friends house who was doing my nails for the wedding and 2 other girls used it that evening cause they loved the color so much. Definitely will wear again!</li>
    <li> this color went on great and was better than I expected.  this was the first time I used the OPI gel polish and I was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great summer color!. Love OPI Gelcolors. I use them exclusively since they seem stronger than other brands of gel nailpolish.</li>
    <li> This is a real pretty color for going into spring and than summer. It is a medium to darker rose pink and goes great with all your lighter color clothing.  The reason for giving it a 4 is because it does bleed through the base coat to your nails.  Now it isn&#x27;t very noticeable but if you wanted to use a clear polish it might be noticeable.  I have used this off and on for two years because it is such a versitile color and I don&#x27;t usually use clear polish.</li>
    <li> I have used Red Carpet, Gelish, CND and now OPI gels to do my nails. OPI is definitely my least favorite. It does on very thin, so unless you want see-through color you need to put on about 5 coats. It also takes longer to soak off as opposed to the other brands. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy another bottle of OPI gel.</li>
    <li> I love it , however, the color wasn&#x27;t as bright as I expected but I will still wear it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Disappointing as color isn&#x27;t always accurate.</li>
    <li> It was perfect and the exact color I was looking for and matched the OPI polish perfect. Other brands don&#x27;t match exactly</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. Unlike other Gel polishes I have not had any issues with bubbles or anything else.</li>
    <li> Opi stays on longer than any other of the gel nail polish. Everyone comments when I wear this color.</li>
    <li> Love the gel polishes that OPI offers. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these. I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>
    <li> Such quality nail polish. All it needs is ONE coat and you are good to go! I apply two for nail strength, but it is the best gel color I have!</li>
    <li> The bottle came empty. I have never had problems with OPI gels from other sellers.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect spring and summer color with just the right amount of shimmer.  It also stays on for 10 days plus (when used with OPI base and topcoat for gels).  I got lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  It came in just a few days after ordering.  Have already used and is exactly as it looks on screen.</li>
    <li> The color is bright but beautiful.  I received many compliments.  Goes on even and without any problems. Peerfect for all your summer accasions.  Will make you smile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of uv gel polish and this is the first time I tried OPI.  The polish goes on very easily, nice consistency.  And it lasts as uv gel polish should (weeks).</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a beautiful hot pink polish - THIS is the one for you!! It is super pretty for Spring and Summer &amp;lt;or anytime really&gt;. It looks especially great if you have a tan! Easy to apply. Dries fast under the lamp. To take it off I usually use my nail drill to get the top layer off, and if I&#x27;m in a hurry...I drill it all off. This polish lasted 16 days before I had to re-do my nails due to growth - but they looked like I just did them the day I took it off! OPI is amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using the CND Shellac system at home.  I wanted a different color, so tried the OPI Pink Flamenco Gel Laquer.  It works great with the CND top and bottom coats, as well as the CND light source.  I will continue to buy the OPI products to enhance my color selection!</li>
    <li> The pink color is very nice. When I looked at samples of this color, there appeared to be a shimmer, however there is now shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more of a subtle pink, so if you are looking for a brighter &#x27;summer&#x27; pink, this might now be what you want! Again, it&#x27;s still a very nice color! :)</li>
    <li> Polish was easy to apply.  I used two coats and got nice even coverage. Colorful pink, but not too bold or bright.</li>
    <li> Ordered for wife.  She has been using GelColor OPI for a year now and really loves the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; OPI products.  This product had sand grains, and did not dry correctly, only lasting about a week (following her normal routine).</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, but it&#x27;s still a gorgeous shade.  I&#x27;ve purchased the regular nail polish to use on my toes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product at a nail salon but the supplier did not have this in stock so I had to substitute with a different color. The salon product is great in color and wears wonderful - that was why I chose this one from Amazon. I will try to get this color at another time. I would recommend this product if you can get it.</li>
    <li> I like the polish - its a good consistency and easy to apply so that you get a nice even coat of color. The pink looks just like the image shown. Its a matte color - personally I would like a bit of sheer or sparkle in it, but it does look as advertised.</li>
    <li> My perfect pink color!  I use this with the OPI base coat and OPI top coat.  I am constantly using my hands to tear cardboard boxes at work, washing my hands constantly, etc.  This polish leaves my nails chip free and shiny for at least 10 days.</li>
    <li> Late review on this item.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased it last year and as a gift to my dear sister. She liked it very much!&lt;br /&gt;And more purchase on this brand nail polish!</li>
    <li> Love the color---receive many compliments on it---hope OPI does not discontinue this color!</li>
    <li> Great color.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This pink is great for dark skin tones.  It&#x27;s a really nice summer color and is a deep but bright pink.</li>
    <li> Great coverage! Love this color!</li>
    <li> I have always liked opi polish and they have great colors and now in the gel polish and this color is one of my favs</li>
    <li> Great Purchase&lt;br /&gt;My wife is loving it. She boast to her friends all the time that she does her nails professionally &amp;#34;@ home&amp;#34;....lol I Will recommend to friends so that they too can purchase.</li>
