<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good soap, not drying, and it is natural - all good!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft and is very moisturizing</li>
    <li> Great price for my favorite soap.</li>
    <li> This smells so good, lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and feels like it really moisturizes.  All that and it doesn&#x27;t have all those harmful chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> Nice soap, smells good and fresh!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I&#x27;ve been using toms for years. Now I buy it on Amazon 6 bars at a time</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine creates wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this bar soap and was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Olive oil is the key ingredient that makes this soap so gentle and non irritating.  I love the soft scent.  It lasts just as long as other well known bar soaps. Highly recommended.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive but I really believe it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a soap for my dry skin. I don&#x27;t use a liquid soap when I take a shower but almost all soaps make my body&lt;br /&gt;dry and itchy, especially during the winter season. I&#x27;m happy now to find this soap. It&#x27;s perfect for me, not too much moisuture but completely not too dry. This soap helped my itchy skin after showers. The only thing is the size of this soap. If it&#x27;s a little bit bigger, it will really worth to buy continuously.</li>
    <li> Not much to say it&#x27;s soap. Good deal I guess</li>
    <li> First tried this as a free sample.  It keeps the skin moisturized even in winter or after multiple showers in one day.  Amazon subscribe and save prices make it possible to purchase this, as store prices are just too high.</li>
    <li> This nice soap is; light with no film. Can be used daily without break out of {my skin}.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LAST LONG TOO</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over a year now. Last year I was diagnosed with some skin issues. I cannot say enough about this product. It has actually help with my problem. They make a great product and I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Nice soap but not extra moisturizing</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used the Tom&#x27;s deodorant bar with sage, but I we like this bar much better. The smell is great, and it really does seem to help moisture the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent value- soap smells so nice</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I really like soap that is soft, creamy, reasonably priced and I especially like this type of soap in cold weather when it&#x27;s dry. This is my favorite of all the different brands I&#x27;ve tried for a moisturizing soap. It&#x27;s worth a little extra and not as pricy as a specialty soap.</li>
    <li> As part of a drive to move certain household and personal products down the natural route, I gave the Tom&#x27;s of Main moisturizing bar a try and have not been disappointed. It has a light natural fragrance without being overpowering. The bar will fit in small to large hand without an issue. It suds easily allowing the least use principles to shine through. It does not leave a soap film on your skin making one feel itchy (by drying the skin). One side note, the principles of the company are solid. I tend to buy more from companies who take pride in helping / giving back to the community and Tom&#x27;s of Main has a solid reputation in the area. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not too much to write about soap from a man&#x27;s perspective, other than it does the job well.  I mainly got this because of my wife is into organic stuff and avoidance of unnecessary chemical exposure through diet or other means...  This soap has a nice scent that is not overwhelmingly intense.  The price is higher than conventional soap but not unreasonable.</li>
    <li> I used to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap, but then a budget crisis forced me to look at all ways to save money, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is expensive, so it had to go.  But, finding what soap to go TO was difficult.  We wanted something natural.  We tried Ivory, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, and it left a film on my body that came off on my clothes.  Plus, though inexpensive, the bar was gone in a couple of weeks.  I tried Dove Sensitive, but just didn&#x27;t feel clean.  However, at the same time, it felt harsh.  Plus, I didn&#x27;t like the lather.  I was getting frustrated trying to find a good soap.  There was no way I could handle the smells of the other soaps--Olay, Irish Spring, Dial, etc.  Reaching the end of my rope, I saw this Tom&#x27;s soap in Target one day, and it was much less expensive than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but it was still more than the others.  I decided to try it, but wasn&#x27;t expecting much, especially since I knew Tom&#x27;s had been sold to one of the big corporations (and I was sure they ruined the whole line by letting go of the principles and standards Tom and Kate had).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I surprised.  This soap (Daily Moisture) is amazing.  The lather is just right, and the smell is mild and pleasant.  But the biggest plus is one I just recently realized.  We started using this soap in the summer, and it felt great on my skin.  Now that it is winter, however, I&#x27;m realizing that this is the first winter (of my life!) I do not have dry, cracked, and bleeding hands.  And, the skin on my legs is not dry and flaky like it usually gets in winter.  I have to attribute this to the soap, as nothing else has changed.  Oh, and my husband loves this soap, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find this soap on Amazon, because shortly after I originally bought it at Target, they raised the price to more than what a bar of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was!  But, by then I could not give up this soap.  So, we now get it on Amazon--delivered by subscription so it&#x27;s even less expensive.  I never want to be without this soap.</li>
    <li> I have become very sensitive to the alcohol in foaming soaps. I received a small bar of TOM&#x27;s Soap as a sample in one of my amazon orders. I started using it and the difference was remarkable! My hands went from dry red and cracked to silky smooth. The scent is very light and natural. Unfortunately, I ran out of the sample and went back to a foaming handsoap... Hello again! dry red and cracked skin! I&#x27;m sticking with Tom&#x27;s soap-this stuff is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap!  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make me itch, leaves my face very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I did not like this soap at all.  really dried out my eczema. i couldnt use it, had to trash it.  i was disappointed i liked the smell and the brand but not good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The soap has a nice scent and seems gentle.  I won&#x27;t buy them again, though, because the bars don&#x27;t last very long.  They&#x27;re small, they get very goopy in the shower so they wash away down to nothing in a short period of time.  I feel like most of the time I&#x27;m dealing with these awkward little soap chips.</li>
    <li> Not as described - even though I selected &amp;#34;Pack of 6&amp;#34; from the selection, I was only sent 1 bar for the price.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS. THIS IS GOOD AT BEING MY SHOWER SOAP. IT GETS THE DIRTY STUFF OFF OF ME AND CLEANS MY BUMHOLE. MOISTURIZES NICELY TOO. 10/10 WOULD BUMHOLE CLEAN AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Love Tom&#x27;s products. This one really leaves skin feeling really good. I order mostly Tom&#x27;s products for dental as well as other products.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of the scent of these bars; however, I do like how they work.  In the shower it feels like  a regular bar of soap and at first I was afraid that it was going to leave my skin feeling dry and tight.  This is the first soap product I&#x27;ve used that made me feel like I didn&#x27;t even need to use lotion afterward!  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, and the acne on my back and shoulders looks better than usual, too.  I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it will only get better with continual use!</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference compare to the Ivory or other moisturizing soaps, the sign of dry skin on my legs are all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not melting too quickly, one bar lasts quite a long time for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells light and good, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! A great, straight-forward product!!! Fast shipping and works wonderfully!  No assembly required and looks great! No Complaints at all! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best soap I have ever used. I had used Kiss My Face soap for years so I was hesitant to try Toms and I am so glad I did. I have all of my family and friends using Tom&#x27;s now. Great soap!</li>
    <li> We really like this bar soap.  It does not dry out the skin</li>
    <li> This is my favourite soap. Bought it once at Rite Aid because it was on sale; immediately loved the smell and the thick lather. Boyfriend came out of the shower that night too and immediately commented on the &#x27;nice new soap&#x27;, proclaimed it an instant favourite and asked if we could continue to buy it instead of the Dove Bars I had been buying. The only downside is that it&#x27;s more expensive than other drugstore soaps. A two-pack at Ride Aid costs anywhere from $6-8 depending on which part of the city you&#x27;re in. Slightly cheaper to buy in bulk on Amazon, and once I spent the $13 I can forget that I did and get over it.</li>
    <li> I love Toms bar soaps. The unscented version is what I normally get. I tries this because it was on sale. I have sensitive skin but can normally handle scented products if they are all natural. The smell of this soap is unnatural and triggered migraines. This usually only happens to me with synthetic fragrances. I had to wrap the batch in double plastic bags and gave it to a friend. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  So much lather; so clean; so pure.  Buy it; no regrets only smiles :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of Tom&#x27;s products, because I&#x27;m not a particularly &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; kind of girl, but I have a 2 year old, who always wants to use daddy&#x27;s soap bars, so I&#x27;ve been choosing more natural soaps to try out and see if we can live with using them, and feel safe with our son swimming them in his bathwater. Turns out this is a great soap! Super hydrating - doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of every drop of moisture, but also still leaves you feeling clean. The scent is super subtle, which is great. I think we might have found our new go to shower soap!</li>
    <li> I got the &amp;#34;Daily Moisture&amp;#34; soap, which smells nice and makes the whole bathroom smell fruity floral. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really drying and makes my skin itch after every shower. So I gave it to my husband to use since his skin isn&#x27;t sensitive like mine. After trying it, he told me he wasn&#x27;t a big fan because it was drying for him too.</li>
    <li> Great soap use it every day.</li>
    <li> Read or saw somewhere that lavender increases a mans libido - I just think it  has a great smell and nice feel..</li>
    <li> We try to use organic as much as possible. Love this soap! It doesn&#x27;t melt fast and our skin isn&#x27;t dry. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film either. Just a real good soap.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  On time, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great for toddler skin. If you put it in a soap holder instead of in the tub It will last a month. It doesn&#x27;t make the water cloudy at all. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on her precious skin. If I want to relax in the bath , I sometimes use the soap. It is so relaxing. but mostly I only use it on her. I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for years and  still love it. I especially love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. It is very important to me that this brand does not test on animals! A+++</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizing soap I use regularly.  It does not dry your skin and makes good lather and lasts as well as most soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love these soaps, very good for sensitive skin.  Good value buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry skin, and have used nearly every soap and cream on the market.  This stuff solves my problem.  Great product!</li>
    <li> If your looking for bath soap that will moisturize your skin, I&#x27;d skip this. While I will say it&#x27;s better than say Dial soap, my skin was still noticeably dry and ashy a few hours after a shower.  I then tried Dove.  Yep!  That&#x27;s the stuff.  No ashy looking arms anymore.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Dove, do it.  It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> Good soap.. does not dry out skin for most part..Pretty natural soap.. There is one other I like better but it cost more too...</li>
    <li> My review is focused on the moisturizing aspect of this product. I have dry skin so I normally use the Dove brand soap. For a change, I thought I&#x27;d try Tom&#x27;s moisturizing bar and was disappointed. Since it has &amp;#34;moisturing&amp;#34; in its name, I thought it would be comparable to Dove but it leaves my skin feeling dry. Comparing it to Dove, there is no comparison, I find Dove to be the best mainstream soap bar on the market aside from some glycerin soap bars. I really cannot tell a difference between Tom&#x27;s moisturing bar and other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, non-moisturizing soap bars. Other than that, the soap cleans well and the smell is pleasant. Just really disappointed in its moisturizing qualities, or lack thereof.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome product....wish I could still get this in stores around here!</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s has a full line of products. I only use this soap, but I like it. The scent is pleasant without being over powering. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin during the winter months. I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bars are almost too big to handle comfortably at first. 4oz should be 4oz, but this bar just feels bigger then some of the grocery store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy it by the case.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful!  It&#x27;s very smooth and lathering.  I will purchase again as long as the price is right.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I few years ago I got a free sample in an amazon order, I&#x27;ve been using it since then. Gave it out as gifts and now 3 other families use this soap. I&#x27;d say the free sample paid off for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset because I ordered the lavendar scent and I received olive oil and vitamin E bars instead!</li>
    <li> Love love love this soap!!! It smells amazing and leaves your skin so soft!!  My entire family likes it too!</li>
    <li> This soap has a mild scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. I rt the best deal by using Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the store, and my favorite soap ever.</li>
    <li> No odor and excellent value!</li>
    <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like regular soap. It was more expensive than regular soap, but it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great soap! Silky smooth and nice scent. Lathers well and doesn&#x27;t feel drying.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a pleasant smell that&#x27;s not over powerful this may be for u. If u are allergic to a brand like zest then Tom of main would work since it&#x27;s non allergic and won&#x27;t make your skin itchy.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of soap my husband will use due to his sensitive skin. His favorite is the lavender. Even when we travel he will take it with him.</li>
    <li> I like Tom&#x27;s soap because it is more natural than a lot of the  others.  It also helps keep my skin moist. My spouse also likes it for the same reasons.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap.  It makes my skin feel soft and clean.  My only complaint is that the bar dissolves too fast.  I seem to be replacing the bar more often than I did with traditional bars of soap.</li>
    <li> I am sure it is a quality product and so on. I am just not impressed at all. Does not seem to clean very well. Only lasts a short time. Just not very impressed.</li>
    <li> love this bar soap. No residue! clean and smells fresh</li>
    <li> I love these soap bars better than anything Dr. Bronner (my gold standard) puts out!  The bars last a *long* time, at least 3x the length of my dearly beloved Lavender bars from Bronner.  The smell isn&#x27;t as nice, but the price is a little bit cheaper, and the soap leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I got this on sale fo a very good deal. Otherwise, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and any other soap I tried. Before, I was using dove, so when I run out, ill move to the other... unless I find this for same price.</li>
    <li> I Love this soap. It&#x27;s Very moisturizing and has a very nice scent.  I recommend it for a natural soap.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this bar of soap in hopes of finding a new product to use in order to switch out my usual shower gel.  I’m trying to steer clear of harsh chemicals and artificial/synthetic ingredients and thought I would try out Tom’s soap.  I was skeptical that this bar of soap would leave my skin feeling clean and moisturized but it actually does.  It has a soothing smell and creates a rich cream lather.  My skin tends to be fairly sensitive but I haven’t had any irritation from this soap.  I’ll definitely be buying more and looking into additional Tom&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> We only use Tom&#x27;s of Maine soap!</li>
    <li> Just love this product because I no longer have to deal with dry, scaly skin especially on my legs &amp; arms after bathing.  The fragrance is so clean and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I usually buy cheaper soaps or use leftover hotel soaps but as soon as the weather got colder I noticed my skin was getting dry and itchy. I immediately looked for a different soap and found Tom&#x27;s of Maine had a great olive oil soap. This soap also has Vitamin E in it so it is doubly healing. It has a light fruity fragrance which is not at all offensive and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin scented either. I also find that when using this soap I don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer. So even though the soap is a little more expensive than I normally pay I actually feel like I&#x27;m saving money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> When I shower in the winter time, my skin gets creepy-crawly dry and itchy. About the time my skin starts feeling better, it&#x27;s time to take another shower and the cycle starts all over again. Sound familiar? I decided it was time to find a solution so I did a little research online and found a recommendation for Tom&#x27;s of Main soap. I was impressed with the number of positive reviews on Amazon so decided to take a chance and buy some, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. For me, this soap doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of my dry skin after showering. However, it&#x27;s at least a 90-95% improvement so I&#x27;m extremely happy. I would highly recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
    <li> We loves anything Tom&#x27;s of Maine. This soap smells great and the bars are huge, much bigger than a regular bar of soap!</li>
    <li> May be a bit expensive, but it is totally worth it if one has dry, sensitive skin. It&#x27;s the only product that I&#x27;ve found that does the job.</li>
    <li> Pricey, yes, but lasts a long time and very easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I am big into the organic homeopathy lifestyle... So why stop at the bathroom? The soap you use integrates itself with every orifice on your body. This soap is natural and uses quality well researched ingredients. The soap does not leave a filmy residue or over oil the skin. This is the ONLY soap that actually prevents all acne for me. I have gone to many different stores looking for Tom&#x27;s as Target stopped carrying the soap. I now exclusively order through Amazon Prime 6-bars at a time for me and the household. You will not regret the daily moisture or lavender.</li>
    <li> First time I use it. I bought because a good experience with Tom&#x27;s toothpaste. I was surprised with the moisturizing effect of the soap, it is the best I have tried. It feels really good and clean. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using it, best bought as a pack for saving. With subscription in Amazon, even more savings.</li>
    <li> I bought the Daily Moisture type; I like it and the price is decent for the product (it has great ingredients), but it&#x27;s unfortunately very drying on my skin, which is what I was hoping wouldn&#x27;t happen with the Daily Moisture kind.</li>
    <li> I buy this soap by the case need I say more. I was buying Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s lavendar soap and picked up the olive oil soap by mistake and been hooked on it since.  It has a nice suttle pleasant fragrance and it moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Three stars because I don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing. Smells great though.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s soap last a long time.  Definitely a good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this soap and think it is great. It leaves your skin soft , no residue and moist. Plus it doesn&#x27;t,t have any chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> This soap is better at moisturizing and still leaving you skin feeling really clean then any other I&#x27;ve ever used. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I do love these soaps.  Very inexpensive and they don&#x27;t make me feel like I washed with essence of fiberglass.  :)</li>
    <li> Amazing soap. Little to no scent. Leaves your skin soft and moisturized. Not filmy. Worth the cost!</li>
    <li> been using this for about a year now and love it!</li>
    <li> I love this soap! No chemicals but you still feel clean. The smell is light and fresh. I will definitely be buying it again!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap and it cleans great. Nice to know I am not using any harsh chemicals on my skin. Can even be used on the hair!</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizing soap bars I&#x27;ve tried so dar. Abd price is certainly reasonable, and delivered right to your door. Cannot ask for more...</li>
    <li> Good soap with a pleasant smell. To me it smells like candy. The soap itself was in plastic inside the box, and the set was shrink wrapped. I buy bar soaps to reduce plastic, so this was not for me.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that can crack in the winter. This is one of the safest soaps I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not drying whatsoever, and has a pleasant fragrance. It&#x27;s all I use now.</li>
    <li> Yes it is just soap but I have sensitive skin that usually gets dried out from other soaps.  I used to use other more popular brands that contain moisturizes and were made for sensitive skin but until I tried Tom&#x27;s I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.  I know it is just soap and it is not that big of a deal but it is nice to not have dry damaged skin and that&#x27;s what you get with this.</li>
    <li> I have this dry area on my face and when I make an effort to use this soap on my face in the morning it clears it up for the rest of the day. Must be magic!</li>
    <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter and this did not make it any better at all.</li>
    <li> ok soap for washing hands - but not so sure about bathing - once you wash it off it leaves hands feeling sticky and dry.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few soaps that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands in the winter.</li>
    <li> Nice, large bar of soap with great lathering qualities.  Does not dry out your skin. Would purchase again.  Not a bad price, either.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. Satisfies my need for a moisturizing soap.</li>
    <li> Smell is not overpowering and I like not having all the added chemicals.</li>
    <li> I thought when I first purchased a bar of this soap at a local store that it might make my skin oily - NOT SO. It moisturizes without making you icky sticky, and it smells great. Great price here on Amazon compared to my local stores.</li>
    <li> Soap lathers good. For me it is good for face and body. It does not have lots of scary ingredients. I like most Toms products. Soap and smell choices are a very individual choice though. For me, personally I loved this soap for months... then hated the smell of it when I was pregnant... Now I love it again.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to leave my skin much softer than my regular soap and has a wonderful smell. On the skin the fragrance is too faint to detect but my skin feels wonderful. I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems with this soap.</li>
    <li> Great deal for a 6 pack!</li>
    <li> Great product. I like the product. Smells great. No allergic reactions. I would recommend the product to anyone who wants to avoid mystery materials in soaps which have not been fully tested.</li>
    <li> I was using Tom&#x27;s products from before this one was new to me and i really love it and will continue to buy. Side note it smells great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I am very impressed at the quality-to-price ratio! It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of this product to produce a rich, long-lasting lather so one bar lasts me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap you choose may not be the only issue. It may also be the water. I would like to suggest that you add 200-300 mg of ascorbic acid (pure vitamin C) to your bath water and facial cleansing water. It neutralizes 100% of chlorine and chloramines in water. These chemicals are used to disinfect our water. However they also dry and irritate the skin and lungs. I also suggest installing a shower water filter. I use the Sprite 2 slim line. Water filters will remove the  chlorine but not the chloramines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to the ascorbic acid powder that I use to bathe and shave in. When I shave I add it to a large bowl of water.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Nutribiotic-Ascorbic-Powder-Bioflavonoids-Ounce/dp/B000I4DETC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1412714079&amp;sr&#x3D;1-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;ascorbic+acid+nutribiotic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this info helps.</li>
    <li> This as a lot cheaper than buying in store and a lot more to last a while.  Love the soap!</li>
    <li> Great deal! This soap is great, smells good, and works great on sensitive skin. Love Tom&#x27;s of Maine!</li>
    <li> I really like this soap.  The smell is delicious.  Makes my skin feel clean and smooth.  Seems to be a better price than a lot of natural soaps.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!! It leaves your skin silky and it smells so delicate and clean. I was worried it would be weird smelling because it&#x27;s natural but it actually smells really nice! I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and bought it in bulk!</li>
    <li> I like this soap.  It is reasonably priced for an non chemical soap and it works great.It also does not leave much residue on your shower and tube making cleaning a little easier.  I would recommend this soap to anyone who wants to have good priced and good quality non-chemical soap.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap! Normally, bar soap makes my skin feel dry, but the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand does not. I love the gentle exfoliating bar soap from Tom&#x27;s too.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it lathers well but I feel it is the most moisturizing bar soap I&#x27;ve ever found. If it has a scent, it is too light to really detect. Great bar soap for those with dry sensitive skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> A lot of natural soaps I think can be expensive but with Toms of Maine you get great quality natural ingredients at a fraction of the price. The unscented sensitive works just as well as Dr. Bronners baby mild, and it comes out to basically half the price. Overall, Toms of Maine is a great company with several natural products to choose from. I was surprised that apparently they got bought out recently and are now owned by Colgate-Palmolive. I certainly hope that they don&#x27;t start &amp;#34;improving&amp;#34; any of the tried-and-true formulas. Which is exactly what happened when Clorox bought out Burts Bees and started re-formulating everything and now it&#x27;s all junk.</li>
    <li> It leaves me clean and soft but not overly fragrant.</li>
    <li> I liked the soap wish the bars were bigger</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap, works well and is exactly what the description states. I use many Tom&#x27;s products and have never had any issues with them.</li>
    <li> This soap is great got it because I&#x27;m allergic to the chemicals in the non organic soaps and it works great!</li>
