      <li>Turned into a beautiful light ash brown.</li>
      <li>When I was done with the 60 minute process time, it didn&#x27;t look like anything had happened, but when I was done rinsing and using the 3 step shampoo , it was amazing.</li>
      <li>THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I just used it and it worked amazingly.</li>
      <li>You have to follow every steps to have the best result you might have dry hair after but with good conditionner will help.</li>
      <li>I have bleached my hair so many times before, to the point of my hair breaking off and snapping like a rubber band.</li>
      <li>but when my hair drys it still looks healthy.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use part C, because that&#x27;s what makes the color come out.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this brown.</li>
      <li>you might get a better result because there&#x27;s lest pigmentation to remove.</li>
      <li>you might just love the way your hair looks after B4.</li>
      <li>So, I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon.com, but Fred Meyer carries it for a couple bucks more.</li>
      <li>After 3 weeks I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and ordered a box.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I should have bought one more.</li>
      <li>but I was able to cover it up with some ammonia free dye.</li>
      <li>Just protect your clothing and if you condition afterward with a regular good smelling conditioner the smell will go away!</li>
      <li>and I have fine hair</li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s a very light golden brown.</li>
      <li>I had originally.</li>
      <li>I went from a bright red to my light brown</li>
      <li>I ordered this to remove bright red hair dye from my hair</li>
      <li>I love it so much.</li>
      <li>The product arrived fast and removed most of the dye</li>
      <li>LOVED IT WORKED WONDERS ON MY BLACK HAIR :)</li>
      <li>you will have to buy a bright color to match the part of your hair where B4 was applied if you have long roots.</li>
      <li>To tell the truth, i expected better and lighter results, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to take the color out.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to be aware that if your hair is long, you might need more than two.</li>
      <li>Shipping came very fast.</li>
      <li>it was loreal hi color in red that super Rihanna bright red</li>
      <li>I had bleached my hair and put red on top of it</li>
      <li>Also, the condition of my hair is excellent, which seems positevely weird...</li>
      <li>First.</li>
      <li>I did exactly what it said to do.</li>
      <li>Worked exactly ad</li>
      <li>Perfect help when hair wrongly colored.</li>
      <li>Product worked exactly like it said it would.  </li>
      <li>and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I think it works better on red or light hair in general.</li>
      <li>This product took three years of bright red out, and it made a three-year-old black fade to light brown.</li>
      <li>I used the colour B4 extra strength after I had let my bright red hair fade for a couple weeks</li>
      <li>I had Privanna bright red hair for almost 5 years and had, had enough of it.</li>
      <li>I went from darker red, to light orange.</li>
      <li>so if you can handle that I definitely highly recommend!</li>
      <li>No matter how much I washed it, people could tell.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend colour B4 and would use it again!</li>
      <li>The product works and it works really</li>
      <li>As for the smell, it didn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair bright red, brown, and every shade in between every few weeks.</li>
      <li>I was amazed I was able too bleach my hair afterwards with little damage</li>
      <li>It is safe to use dye right after, and overall it was WAY less damaging than bleach.</li>
      <li>Its very strong and only intensifies when you get it wet to shampoo.</li>
      <li>You really should have healthy hair when you use this, it left my hair very dry</li>
      <li>My hair right now  was red</li>
      <li>I got lucky and I only had to do it once; my hair looks like someone ombre&#x27;d it with the light brown in the bottom where the black was.</li>
      <li>I will recommend for people to wait and see your color result, than go buy the new color for your hair.</li>
      <li>my hair was more blonde and pink was a pastel color.</li>
      <li>but after I used On my hair it left it feeling kind of gross and rough</li>
      <li>It came in a week early!</li>
      <li>It had clear instructions and even a description of how it works.</li>
      <li>Unlike bleaching,  my hair is soft and completely undamaged.</li>
      <li>so she was almost natural color.</li>
      <li>It will not change your natural hair color.</li>
      <li>I was absolutely surprised with the results.</li>
      <li>Umm wow.</li>
      <li>My roots are my natural color</li>
      <li>I went from a dark auburn to my original blonde with 1 treatment.</li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde and it worked so well.</li>
      <li>When it started fading, I dyed my whole head natural black.</li>
      <li>black one time and used the product exactly as directed</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re trying to go blonde, this won&#x27;t turn your hair blonde unless your natural color is blonde; It only strips out the color you dyed on.</li>
      <li>My hair was previously dyed black and is now a lighter version of my original hair color.</li>
      <li>but if you have very dark hair, don&#x27;t expect much.</li>

<li> Things to remember do not color your hair with any permanent dark hair color right after using this product, It will grab whatever the color is and make your hair real dark, Let me explain, if you choose a red it will turn your hair to the darkest shade of red even if you pick and see a light red on the box, it will turn dark almost black again....</li>
<li> I decided I wanted  be blonde, which is almost impossible when you have had bright red hair for that long because the hair follicle is stained.  </li>
<li> My roots became blonde, when I naturally had dark brown roots.</li>
<li> My natural hair color is dark brown</li>
<li> but that was because of how porous they are and how long I had been coloring my hair red.  </li>
<li> so I was expecting some good results, but was disappointed.</li>
<li> No other complaints other than smell</li>
<li> a Couple days later I did cut off about 3 inches because after bleaching my hair was very dry.</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s already a shade closer to orange or your hair was dyed before (if it&#x27;s pink, blue, etc.)</li>
<li> Did nothing at all for my black hair, only dyed my red hair</li>
<li> This is the only product that actually lifts the black permanent hair dye off.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t wait too see it dry.</li>
<li> a 4 of 5 is because it does dry your hair out.</li>
<li> And if it&#x27;s dark, it will only fade the color to an orange or copper-ish color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had bleached my hair and put red on top of it and when it started to fade I bought this to get it back or at least close to the bleached color I had originally. The product arrived fast and removed most of the dye but it&#x27;s been a week and my hair still smells so awful from the hair stripper. Its very strong and only intensifies when you get it wet to shampoo. No other complaints other than smell so if you can handle that I definitely highly recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVED IT WORKED WONDERS ON MY BLACK HAIR :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my black hair. I recommend the color remover from jheri redding.</li>
    <li> This defied my expectations in how well this would work. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair bright red, brown, and every shade in between every few weeks. It took my hair to the brassy blond is was when I bleached it. The color is a slight ombre from color build up, but it&#x27;s not orange like I anticipated. Unlike bleaching,  my hair is soft and completely undamaged. The one caveat of this product is it smells like a mix of rotten eggs and garbage.</li>
    <li> Works great!! My daughter colored her hair blue and after that a mahogany red.. It was the only product that we tried that took all of her colors out of her hair so she was almost natural color. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I colored my hair in black for a few years ... not helped this product. black is... black!&lt;br /&gt;The product was sent earlier, so the seller is ok, but this product for black hair is not the solution... for me :(</li>
    <li> It came in a week early! I just used it and it worked amazingly. My hair was previously dyed black and is now a lighter version of my original hair color. That is to be expected because of the dyeing, though. It had clear instructions and even a description of how it works.</li>
    <li> Worked well!! Just be sure to be aware that if your hair is long, you might need more than two. And if it&#x27;s dark, it will only fade the color to an orange or copper-ish color. If it&#x27;s already a shade closer to orange or your hair was dyed before (if it&#x27;s pink, blue, etc.) you might get a better result because there&#x27;s lest pigmentation to remove.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly ad I hope. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Perfect help when hair wrongly colored.</li>
    <li> I have dye my hair a lot of colors...  My hair right now  was red it was loreal hi color in red that super Rihanna bright red I use color B4 and now my hair is honey blonde  this is the best hair colour remover that I has use I love it&lt;br /&gt;Btw My roots are my natural color</li>
    <li> This product took three years of bright red out, and it made a three-year-old black fade to light brown. I am a natural blonde and it worked so well. I got lucky and I only had to do it once; my hair looks like someone ombre&#x27;d it with the light brown in the bottom where the black was. If you&#x27;re trying to go blonde, this won&#x27;t turn your hair blonde unless your natural color is blonde; It only strips out the color you dyed on. You really should have healthy hair when you use this, it left my hair very dry and it made my hair stink for about a day. It smells pretty bad. Make sure you use part C, because that&#x27;s what makes the color come out. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> So, I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon.com, but Fred Meyer carries it for a couple bucks more. I was absolutely surprised with the results. When I was done with the 60 minute process time, it didn&#x27;t look like anything had happened, but when I was done rinsing and using the 3 step shampoo , it was amazing. I went from darker red, to light orange. Not what I wanted but I was able to cover it up with some ammonia free dye. It is safe to use dye right after, and overall it was WAY less damaging than bleach. If you are skeptical, don&#x27;t be. I have bleached my hair so many times before, to the point of my hair breaking off and snapping like a rubber band. Those days are gone... I will never bleach again after using this stuff. It smells horrible, but so does hair dye or bleach or any chemical beauty product. The reason I gave it a 4 of 5 is because it does dry your hair out. I suggest a hair mask immediately afterwards. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Product worked exactly like it said it would.  I went from a dark auburn to my original blonde with 1 treatment.</li>
    <li> it works really good but after I used On my hair it left it feeling kind of gross and rough when wet but when my hair drys it still looks healthy.</li>
    <li> It worked as stated, took the darkest brown out of my naturally blonde hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product if you want to remove a permanent hair color. You have to follow every steps to have the best result you might have dry hair after but with good conditionner will help. I did&#x27;nt have damage after all.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work the way it said it would. It just turned my hair orange. I&#x27;m now Back to dark brown!</li>
    <li> so....i bought 2 b4 hair colour removers and i  used them both the same day. From black hair, i went to a reddish brown. That&#x27;s all. To tell the truth, i expected better and lighter results, but it&#x27;s ok. I am satisfied with this brown. As for the smell, it didn&#x27;t bother me that much. It smells bad indeed but it&#x27;s not this disturbing. Also, the condition of my hair is excellent, which seems positevely weird...&lt;br /&gt;Anywayz, i recommend this product but if you have very dark hair, don&#x27;t expect much. I think it works better on red or light hair in general.</li>
    <li> SMELLS SO BADLY. Took a couple days to get the smell out, I wish I knew this before hand. but dont get me wrong THIS STUFF WORKS, ive used color oops, bleach, you name it. This is the only product that actually lifts the black permanent hair dye off. I love it so much. Just not the smell so prepare to do it outside. Im dying my hair blue soon and this is exactly what I needed. My hair used to be jet black, and my nautral hair color is a brownish red. (picture)</li>
    <li> Awesome Product!!! It removed the black off my colored hair, left it on my hair for 1 hour. This is not a hair coloring so remember that!!!!  It will not change your natural hair color. I&#x27;m Talking about my experience with this product, I&#x27;m not sure if it does the same for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING- Things to remember do not color your hair with any permanent dark hair color right after using this product, It will grab whatever the color is and make your hair real dark, Let me explain, if you choose a red it will turn your hair to the darkest shade of red even if you pick and see a light red on the box, it will turn dark almost black again.... can&#x27;t emphasizes enough don&#x27;t use permanent hair color unless it matches the color result from B4....if you do color your hair, use a semi permanent color. you will have to buy a bright color to match the part of your hair where B4 was applied if you have long roots. My result was honey blond. I will recommend for people to wait and see your color result, than go buy the new color for your hair. you might just love the way your hair looks after B4.</li>
    <li> It did strip part of my colour. My roots became blonde, when I naturally had dark brown roots. Then it became orange for a couple of inches, and then it was as red as it was before til the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It dried out my hair a lot, but that was something I was expecting anyway. And it STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was good though.</li>
    <li> Did not work!!!! very disappointed</li>
    <li> I only had deposit-only color on my hair so I was expecting some good results, but was disappointed. I repeated the process twice and in the end my hair was almost the same (I even used a blow dryer both times over my shower cap to help it process). But that&#x27;s not even the reason my rating is so low... I read people saying this stuff stinks and thought it couldn&#x27;t be that bad... What I didn&#x27;t expect was that my hair would smell like rotten eggs for TWO WEEKS. Like, bad. No matter how much I washed it, people could tell. My roommate opened the windows, some people asked what that smell was. It was bad and I felt self-conscious the entire time.</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all for my black hair, only dyed my red hair black one time and used the product exactly as directed, didn&#x27;t do a thing but make my hair smell for weeks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to remove bright red hair dye from my hair I had tried a couple different products but this one definitely did the trick. Does smell pretty bad but it&#x27;s worth it to take the color out.</li>
    <li> Oh lawd the smell lol, but the product did what it says it does. I went from a bright red to my light brown (I actually got to keep some of my highlights I had from my previous color) I will definitely buy this product again if I ever want a change and then undo my change like I often do.</li>
    <li> I had Privanna bright red hair for almost 5 years and had, had enough of it. I decided I wanted  be blonde, which is almost impossible when you have had bright red hair for that long because the hair follicle is stained.  I used the colour B4 extra strength after I had let my bright red hair fade for a couple weeks and this product works!! In one use with the box it stripped the red out of my hair and I was left with a blonde brassy color.  My ends were at a pink color but that was because of how porous they are and how long I had been coloring my hair red.  I did the colour B4 a second time in a row (u can do up to 3 times in one day I believe) my hair was more blonde and pink was a pastel color. I was amazed I was able too bleach my hair afterwards with little damage and I have fine hair I continued to condition it and a added hilites a Couple days later I did cut off about 3 inches because after bleaching my hair was very dry. The product works and it works really well follow the directions to the tee I did exactly what it said to do. I would highly recommend colour B4 and would use it again! The only thing I can say is the product does stink like a perm and if u get on your clothes it will discolor them like bleach.  Just protect your clothing and if you condition afterward with a regular good smelling conditioner the smell will go away!</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing layers and layers of dye. My natural hair color is dark brown but I dyed my hair red using the loreal hilift color in magenta. When it started fading, I dyed my whole head natural black. When I wanted to go blonde, I used this product. Turned into a beautiful light ash brown. The smell is the worst!</li>
    <li> Omg just started using it On my very dark black hair and it took all my black out after having four colors of soft Black dye on it and now it&#x27;s a very light golden brown. Can&#x27;t wait too see it dry. I will recommend this hair color remover. It&#x27;s awesome And does the job. I will buy this agein when i need it</li>
    <li> Umm wow. This stuff saved my life. I had a bad hair color at the salon. Dyed it red out of a box and hated it. After 3 weeks I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and ordered a box. It took out ALL the red and left my hair one even color. I&#x27;m so impressed I wanted to write a review!</li>
    <li> It was really great. It worked. I should have bought one more. Cause my hair is longer. There is two things I didn&#x27;t like. First. The rotten egg smell. But that&#x27;s okay. Next was.. It was like after a week it looked like my hair turned darker again. But it might be because I should have bought two instead&lt;br /&gt;Of one. Shipping came very fast.</li>
