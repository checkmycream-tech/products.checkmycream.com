      <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>THIS did give me the hands free drying I wanted.</li>
      <li>Cool, Warm &amp; Hot.    </li>
      <li>I was excited about finding this product at such a good price.  </li>
      <li>but I have to lay a certain way for most of my head to receive the air.  </li>
      <li>The dryer does not provide full converage evenly so it must be rotated so that every portion of your hair dries evenly.  </li>
      <li>It gets very hot, and wasnt that noisey for me.</li>
      <li>Pro 1:This dryer gets HOT!</li>
      <li>i own this item and got it from a local drugstore</li>
      <li>I wanted something smaller and more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Oh how much more simple and more convenient having a soft bonnet dryer would be!    </li>
      <li>The minimum standard it meets is that it has a nice large, adjustable bonnet</li>
      <li>I wanted to invest in a dryer that was more portable and still gave me the drying options of a hood or standard dryer.  </li>
      <li>Definately loud (quite light the bonnets at the salon or louder)--watching Tv not agood option Bc of noise.  </li>
      <li>The first time that I used it the plastic around the ring that attached to the hose separated, causing an air gap.  </li>
      <li>This dryer gets way to hot.</li>
      <li>I purchased this locally and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>The dryer does not hold the hose, bonnet and plug as well as the hot tools.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the Hot Tools one, as it holds up very well, has a large storage compartment, and never otherwise had a problem with it.</li>
      <li>I figured that for the price, it was worth ordering a new one.  </li>
      <li>This can be cumbersome if you have large rollers (for roller wraps) in your hair.</li>
      <li>The bonnet is large enough to fit over my large rollers, so this product served</li>
      <li>The high heat setting was too hot.  </li>
      <li>The hair that was dry wasn&#x27;t as silky as I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.</li>
      <li>I used it for 5 years before the bonnet tore and had to replace the whole thing.</li>
      <li>But the real deal breaker for me is the cap.</li>
      <li>And speaking of blowtorches, this thing is a real fire-</li>
      <li>Even fully open the bonnet barely fit over my rollers.  </li>
      <li>Really love this dryer since I can wear bonnet behind my ears and still watch my favorite shows while drying my hair.</li>
      <li>Not only is this dryer convenient,light weight it is also very powerful.  </li>
      <li>If anybody out there knows where I can purchase a Carel (not the new ionic one, it also gets too hot) hair dryer</li>
      <li>I have used hard bonnets with this kind of wattage before and they were not too hot, but this one overheats it seems.</li>
      <li>None of them have very good reviews and are either less wattage and/or more expensive.  </li>
      <li>There are 3 settings, cool, low and high.</li>
      <li>Noisy, needs better heat adjustment, goes from cold, to more than medium hot to Sarahara wind.</li>
      <li>It is too big and floppy, it wont stay on my head right.</li>
      <li>The lo and high settings dispersed the exact same amount of air.  </li>
      <li>It did take a long time to dry hair, so I looked for something with more wattage and came across the Revlon Amber Waves.</li>
      <li>The dryer gets way too hot, even on low.</li>
      <li>Especially the 800 watts, I haven&#x27;t really seen any soft bonnets with this much wattage.  </li>
      <li>The bonnet, even on low setting, is way to hot to handle.</li>
      <li>It is LOUD!</li>
      <li>Also because the air does not circulate properly you can feel the hot air coming out in the bac</li>
      <li>high was too warm for extended use (though not as hot as other reviews led me to fear), \\&quot;cool\\&quot; was too slow drying.</li>
      <li>it works ok for roller sets, but not wraps or any other flat styles.  </li>
      <li>I replaced my old soft bonnet hair dryer with the Revlon Amber Waves RV671AW Professional Ionic Dryer.  </li>
      <li>The blower did not fully expand the bonnet to circulate the air completely.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed that the connnection to the soft bonnet detached within 2 times of use.    </li>
      <li>Of course this made the entire process that much longer.    </li>
      <li>I suggest you have ibuprofen at the ready following each drying session to relieve the headache</li>
      <li>This dryer is so loud I can&#x27;t even bear to turn it on</li>
      <li>This dryer is very loud, does not change heat setting from high to low, does not circulate heat through plastic bonnet well.  </li>
      <li>I use larger than average in some spots but even using the smaller rollers it fit tightly and was not that comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t like the fact that I have to keep adjusting the bonnet so that certain areas can get dry.</li>
      <li>One plus about this product however is that the quality of the cap is a little better than the other I have seen.</li>
      <li>Yes, the temperature can be hot, as described in other reviews, but it can be adjusted which I do over the course of each drying with all types of ionic dryers except handheld.</li>
      <li>There are two major flaws in the engineering of this dryer</li>
      <li>I take that back, it appears the Belson soft bonnet hair dryer has been received well.    </li>
      <li>I take it that heads-up was a sarcastic inside joke on the part of a disgruntled Revlon technical writer for this product as any normal person would most certainly find it impossible to enter REM sleep sitting beside an aircraft carrier preparing for take-off.</li>
      <li>Not only is the dryer loud as an elephant, it does not dry evenly.  </li>
      <li>only problem is the hose comes loose from the cap if you move around too much</li>
      <li>For instance, if the hose was connected to the bonnet at the left side of my hair, the left side would dry but the right side remained wet.</li>
      <li>After comparing it to my two other dryers (one soft and the other hard top) it is the sleekest.  </li>

<li> Finally, the connector on the hose leading from the motor is extremely fussy when trying to get and keep it connected to the bonnet, and the hose itself is so inconveniently short that it just barely avoids requiring you sit with it on your lap during operation.</li>
<li> The cool blows cold air and the low and high</li>
<li> The bonnet seemed very large and roomy (though I was, admittedly, using a very small curler).  </li>
<li> I found that it dried my hair well and left it soft and shiny.  </li>
<li> This product is similar to other hair dryers of the $30 variety under different brand names.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think it would work well with long hair unless you plan to sit with it on all day.</li>
<li> The medium heat was also hotter than I expected and kept it on low so not to burn my head.    </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Midland quality and midland design.  This Revlon Hair Dryer it made for periodic use.  In my opinion it would not hold up well for weekly applicaton.  The storage for the bonnet is not practable.  This unit is inexpensive and it&#x27;s design and quality match.  This product is similar to other hair dryers of the $30 variety under different brand names.  For this price it serves a purpose.</li>
    <li> This dryer is generally unsatisfactory---barely meeting any minimum standard of adequacy, however, because there are so very few bonnet or hood models on the market, I feel forced to make do with it. The minimum standard it meets is that it has a nice large, adjustable bonnet and it does dry my hair (although so would mere air if my life required nothing more of me than drying my hair, or as would a blowtorch if I were rather rushed and anticipated no future need for hair or eyebrows) as long as I re-position the hose every 15-20 minutes or so to ensure heat eventually reaches all four quadrants of my head. And speaking of blowtorches, this thing is a real fire-breather,---and that&#x27;s on the  inappropriately-labeled \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting. I don&#x27;t dare try , or need, the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting, except, perhaps, if I decide to multi-task it as an iron for my 100% cottons. Make sure to have a towel draped over your ears, arms and shoulders if your upcoming schedule does not include being airlifted to a hospital burn unit. Further, there is a warning in the user&#x27;s guide not to sleep during the dryer&#x27;s operation. I take it that heads-up was a sarcastic inside joke on the part of a disgruntled Revlon technical writer for this product as any normal person would most certainly find it impossible to enter REM sleep sitting beside an aircraft carrier preparing for take-off. I suggest you have ibuprofen at the ready following each drying session to relieve the headache you&#x27;re likely to experience. Finally, the connector on the hose leading from the motor is extremely fussy when trying to get and keep it connected to the bonnet, and the hose itself is so inconveniently short that it just barely avoids requiring you sit with it on your lap during operation. That said, enjoy!</li>
    <li> My pain problem with this product is that the air is not circulated throughout the cap. So the front usually ta es longer to dry which is a bit annoying since i have to stay under the dryer longer than necessary. Also because the air does not circulate properly you can feel the hot air coming out in the bac and i have to use a towel to prevent it from burning my s in.  Also, the dryer is extremely noisy.  One plus about this product however is that the quality of the cap is a little better than the other I have seen. But still I would recommend the Select Pro Gold dryer any day.  That is the best one I have come across, the only problem is that they have stopped manufacturing it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Revlon Amber Waves RV671AW ionic soft bonnet dryer to replace a hard bonnet ionic dryer that dried my hair in 30 minutes. I wanted something smaller and more comfortable. I followed the instructions for expanding the bonnet, I moved the bonnet to four different positions on my head and after an hour, the crown of my head still wasn&#x27;t dry as the crown of the bonnet never allowed any air even with additional attempts to expand it. The hair that was dry wasn&#x27;t as silky as I&#x27;ve experienced with other products. Yes, the temperature can be hot, as described in other reviews, but it can be adjusted which I do over the course of each drying with all types of ionic dryers except handheld. Amazon was wonderful handling the refund!!!</li>
    <li> I had to return this hair dryer.  It did not thoroughly dry the hair and the noise was unbearable.  It sounded like the parts were rattling.</li>
    <li> I purchased the dryer about a month ago because I was tired of my hard-top dryer. Sitting straight under a dryer for an extendend amount of time (hours) is boring and rigid. Hard tops just aren&#x27;t as flexible as the bonnets and for this reason I have rated the product with four stars.  It was an extremely good buy for under $35 with S+H.  There are two major flaws in the engineering of this dryer but the price should indicate that something will be sacrificed.  Con 1: It is LOUD! I don&#x27;t mean adjust the volume to low and it won&#x27;t bother you; I mean wear earbuds and turn them to max volume. Con 2: The dryer does not provide full converage evenly so it must be rotated so that every portion of your hair dries evenly.  This can be cumbersome if you have large rollers (for roller wraps) in your hair. You&#x27;ll need a friend to help you rotate the bonnet so that the rollers don&#x27;t come out. Pro 1:This dryer gets HOT! This is my favorite feature because I want to get away from the heat ASAP.  *Do note that you should probably protect your face and earlobes though. Pro 2: The dryer is well designed.  After comparing it to my two other dryers (one soft and the other hard top) it is the sleekest.  It organizes back just as you take it out--very simple! Pro 3: The price is unbeatable.  It is an efficient machine, if not noisy, that does its job.</li>
    <li> I was excited about finding this product at such a good price.  I do not like my poker-straight hair, cannot afford a perm so I have to roll my hair, and it is very uncomfortable sleeping on rollers -- even those spongy things.    As soon as I received the Amber Waves, I washed and rolled my hair.  After struggling for about ten minutes to keep the hose connected to the bonnet, I gave up and went to bed for another uncomfortable night on rollers.  The hose connection is terrible and the hose is so short that I had to put it on the arm of my recliner and had to hold my head funny, but it still would not stay connected.  Back to the drawing board, Revlon!</li>
    <li> This dryer gets way to hot. So hot that it actually made my  scalp feel numb. There are 3 settings, cool, low and high. The cool blows cold air and the low and high there really is no difference because they are both very very hot!Fan is also extremely loud and makes churning noises. Also the tube does not fit into the cap properly and keeps on coming out. Returned this item. Find another dryer. Fan is also extremely loud and makes churning noises.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other poor reviews posted here.  I so badly wanted a soft bonnet hair dryer for ease of hair styling.  I typically use jumbo rollers 2\\&quot; for my hair and partially dry my hair using a blow dryer before rolling my hair up in curlers and then finish the drying/styling process.  Oh how much more simple and more convenient having a soft bonnet dryer would be!    I was so disappointed.  Even fully open the bonnet barely fit over my rollers.  Granted I use larger than average in some spots but even using the smaller rollers it fit tightly and was not that comfortable.  The high heat setting was too hot.  I had to put a small towel between the bonnet and my head because it burned.  The medium heat was also hotter than I expected and kept it on low so not to burn my head.    It only dried one side of my hair at a time.  For instance, if the hose was connected to the bonnet at the left side of my hair, the left side would dry but the right side remained wet. The blower did not fully expand the bonnet to circulate the air completely.  So I would have to move the bonnet to the other side to finish drying my hair.  Of course this made the entire process that much longer.    I hate this product and after reading the reviews of other soft bonnet hair dryers, it appears there isn&#x27;t one made that works well at all.  I take that back, it appears the Belson soft bonnet hair dryer has been received well.    I am going to give a hard bonnet hair dryer a try and this time I will try one that has been given much better reviews.  I am pleased, however with Amazon&#x27;s return policy.  At least I am  not stuck paying for junk.</li>
    <li> Really love this dryer since I can wear bonnet behind my ears and still watch my favorite shows while drying my hair.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that the connnection to the soft bonnet detached within 2 times of use.    Other than that the product is awesome. Very HOT!    It has 3 Settings. Cool, Warm &amp; Hot.    Great product.</li>
    <li> I used to have the Hot Tools bonnet dryer and loved it. I used it for 5 years before the bonnet tore and had to replace the whole thing. It did take a long time to dry hair, so I looked for something with more wattage and came across the Revlon Amber Waves. The dryer does not hold the hose, bonnet and plug as well as the hot tools. In fact, I have to store the bonnet outside the compartment for that because storage area is too small. The bonnet, even on low setting, is way to hot to handle. I have used hard bonnets with this kind of wattage before and they were not too hot, but this one overheats it seems. I cannot stand anymore than 5 minutes max with this on because the heat burns my head. I cannot dry my thick, curly hair in that time, and my head hurt for the rest of the day after I used it, so it is another waste of money to me. I would recommend the Hot Tools one, as it holds up very well, has a large storage compartment, and never otherwise had a problem with it.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old soft bonnet hair dryer with the Revlon Amber Waves RV671AW Professional Ionic Dryer.  This dryer is very loud, does not change heat setting from high to low, does not circulate heat through plastic bonnet well.  Also, hose constantley comes loose from bonnet.  I also have to use a towel around my neck to keep the extreme heat off my neck.  Unfortunatley I did not read prior reviews and ordered by name recognition (Revlon). I do not recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this locally and I absolutely love it. It is great if you have Short to Normal/Shoulder Length Hair. I don&#x27;t think it would work well with long hair unless you plan to sit with it on all day. Its a wonderful compact dryer with a sleek design. Great for travel!</li>
    <li> .I have (thick/fine) waist length 2a brown wavy hair, and I have used this product once.  It took approximately one hour to dry my towel dryer (very towel dryer) hair while rolled in [[ASIN:B0051E3426 Conair 62502z Medium Spiral Rollers, 10 Pack, Colors may vary]].  The bonnet seemed very large and roomy (though I was, admittedly, using a very small curler).  The bonnet did not heat 100% evenly but it did heat throughout; I repositioned 3 times.  Of the three heat settings, I preferred the middle---high was too warm for extended use (though not as hot as other reviews led me to fear), \\&quot;cool\\&quot; was too slow drying. Definately loud (quite light the bonnets at the salon or louder)--watching Tv not agood option Bc of noise.  Wished for longer hose, but this was manageable. Hose will detach from bonnet for easier positioning, and has adjustable elastic, still I had difficulty pulling it over head without upsetting rollers.  This was a major improvement from the silly [[ASIN:B000WQ7TAG Hairware Portable Dryer Bonnet]] that I purchased previously (horrrrrid thing that ripped atfirst use and whose seller never responded!).  THIS did give me the hands free drying I wanted. Its not the holy grail of dryers, but I&#x27;m content.</li>
    <li> After my last soft bonnet dryer broke, I was desperate to find a replacement.  This looked great on paper (or should I say screen.)  Especially the 800 watts, I haven&#x27;t really seen any soft bonnets with this much wattage.  However, 800 watts means nothing if the heat doesn&#x27;t reach the front of the cap.  Also the cap was flimsy.  The lo and high settings dispersed the exact same amount of air.  And the \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; travel case meant the dryer was a pain to assemble.  Needless to say I immediately returned it.</li>
    <li> Dryer works well only problem is the hose comes loose from the cap if you move around too much</li>
    <li> Not only is the dryer loud as an elephant, it does not dry evenly.  I wanted to invest in a dryer that was more portable and still gave me the drying options of a hood or standard dryer.  it works ok for roller sets, but not wraps or any other flat styles.  the bonnet attachment broke off the bonnet the 3rd time I used it so now tape hold it together.  BAD INVESTMENT.</li>
    <li> Noisy, needs better heat adjustment, goes from cold, to more than medium hot to Sarahara wind. Hose falls off  with little movement.</li>
    <li> The Revlon Amber Waves RV571AW dryer was an excellent purchase.  Not only is this dryer convenient,light weight it is also very powerful.  With my old hair dryer, it took at least one hour to dry my hair.  The Revlon Amber Waves dryer cut the dry time almost in half.    This was a very good price for the value. Amazon eleminated going to discount stores for this purchase.  It was simply the best.</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low for a decent hair dryer and was hoping this would be it, but I&#x27;m so disappointed. The dryer gets way too hot, even on low. The next setting is cool, but that&#x27;s not warm enough to dry my hair. I have to keep going up and down on the dial that I&#x27;m afraid will evenutally break from all the adjustments. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that I have to keep adjusting the bonnet so that certain areas can get dry. Drying hair should not be this complicated!!   I am probbly going to keep this dryer for the simple fact that I need one. If anybody out there knows where I can purchase a Carel (not the new ionic one, it also gets too hot) hair dryer please let me know. I&#x27;ve looked everywhere.   ***UPDATE*** I am not keeping this dryer. In fact, I boxed it up today and off to the UPS store I went! I will never be satisfied with this dryer, so why keep it? My fragile hair and skin just can&#x27;t tolerate the heat this thing puts out.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to attach bonnet to hose.  Cheaply made.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone. Had to purchase a hard bonnet type to replace it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has the loudest fan I&#x27;ve ever heard. It&#x27;s cumbersome to use, and with it&#x27;s parallelogram shape, it&#x27;s impossible to sit on it&#x27;s end. I used it three times before the fan started rattling and sounding as though it is shifting gears. This is an awfully expensive hair dryer (about $40) to be dissatisfied with.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer and I would reccomend buying it. It gets very hot, and wasnt that noisey for me. This dryer on the higest setting is too hot for me, but it was perfect on the lower setting. The bonnet is large enough to fit over my large rollers, so this product served it&#x27;s purpose for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer expecting quality and what i received was the loudest dryer ever maed.    This dryer is so loud I can&#x27;t even bear to turn it on basically i wasted my money because I can&#x27;t use the dryer for the noise.</li>
    <li> I owned this dryer already and wanted to get another one because the cap was getting brittle around the edges and was scratchy on my forehead.  The hose also kinked up and wouldn&#x27;t go back in.  I found that it dried my hair well and left it soft and shiny.  I figured that for the price, it was worth ordering a new one.  The first time that I used it the plastic around the ring that attached to the hose separated, causing an air gap.  I also noticed that this one is ALOT louder than my other one.  At least before I could watch TV, now it&#x27;s just too loud.  I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going back.  My only dilemma is, which one should I get.  None of them have very good reviews and are either less wattage and/or more expensive.  Unfortunately, I gave away my old one when this one arrived.</li>
    <li> i own this item and got it from a local drugstore and i only use it for when i need to do a weekly deep  conditioner on my hair.if you want a good hair dryer to do rollersetss hairstyles get a hooded one is best</li>
    <li> The compartment to store the cord and bonnet is too small.  But the real deal breaker for me is the cap. It is too big and floppy, it wont stay on my head right. The air blows into the cap in the back and the top/front and other side does not get heat distributed evenly. The cap blows up like a balloon with heat but I have to lay a certain way for most of my head to receive the air.  I hate the cap. Does anyone know of you can purchase a different cap and use with this dryer?</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  This is the first order that I remember being disappointed in .  I would not recommend this one .  J.Price.   re: Revlon Amber Waves RV671AW      Hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent buy.  I use it once a week and the curls come out great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace one that I purchased from Sally&#x27;s years ago.  The motor in this one is strong.  And it drys / sets the hair very quickly.  The only downside is that the base vibrates a lot.  You will need to watch it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t vibrate off the edge of the table/counter because once it is on and placed on it&#x27;s feet it moves.</li>
