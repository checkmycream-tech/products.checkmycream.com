      <li>Have them ready for next year&#x27;s block party.</li>
      <li>Fun, but only five of the eight designs are ones that people like to actually put on.</li>
      <li>There are a ton of the other ones, so still worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Contacted seller and they personally loaded another complete order and sent them off.</li>
      <li>My only gripes are: These are backwards when you apply them and out of 30 people one had a skin sensitive reaction ( only reason I am rating a 4 ).</li>

    <li> They were just what I expected. Easy to apply with just a wet paper towel and lasted through perspiration. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Nice.  Worked as intended</li>
    <li> I used these to draw attention to my booth at a street fair. They were a big hit, and quite attractive. I had some sponges and water on hand for very easy application. It did take 2 or 3 attempts to get it right, but luckily there was a friendly teenager to guide me. I plan to re-order whenever I have another booth.</li>
    <li> long lasting - kids loved them</li>
    <li> Got these for the grandkids to play with, I am sure they&#x27;ll have a blast. May even stick some on the adults too.</li>
    <li> These were great.  We used them at a week-long family reunion during the 4th of July week.  All four generations got involved and had lots of fun.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great tattoos! Easy to apply and enough variety to please everyone. We gave these away at our Fourth of July party this year and they were a big hit. Everyone had fun applying them - especially the adults. They stayed on all night with the exception of ones placed on the back of people&#x27;s hands. After a few hand washings they began to peel off, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Someone also brought the glitter version of these tattoos to our party. I liked that they had different designs, but want to mention that the glitter was hardly noticeable. So if you want a lot of variety get both and mix them together!</li>
    <li> kids loved the tattoos last year,they go on pretty easy,and wash off very well,perfect for the younger kids .</li>
    <li> Great for kids and adults! Easy to apply (and somewhat more challenging to take off-be prepared to scrub).  Lots of fun.</li>
    <li> TRIED THE TATTOOS ON 07/04/2014,LARRY</li>
    <li> I got so many of these , my kids and I LOVE THEM. Fun Fun Fun</li>
    <li> Great tattoos, go on easy with a little water, lasted all day, made our 4th of July a lot of fun!</li>
    <li> Bought these as an accessory for a race outfit; they&#x27;re great. Easy application (as long as you remember to take the plastic cover off) and they lasted for about five days. Be warned; there are a lot of them.</li>
    <li> Nice Item as described</li>
    <li> worked well, pretty basic</li>
    <li> Smaller then I thought but lots of fun.</li>
    <li> These stickers wouldn&#x27;t even stick. They crumbled against water. Waste of a few bucks!</li>
    <li> Great add to the 4th of July party 2014 for the kids to feel part of the group.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect party gift or fun addition to a holiday outfit. The tattoos are cheap and last the whole day!</li>
    <li> These were a hit at 4th of July.  I definitely recommend getting these tattoos.  They come off easy with rubbing alcohol and will leave lasting memories. My only gripes are: These are backwards when you apply them and out of 30 people one had a skin sensitive reaction ( only reason I am rating a 4 ).</li>
    <li> The tattoos were great for any patriotic gathering.  The adults loved them as much as the kids.  The only problem was that every now and then it was difficult to remove the backing without disrupting the tattoo.</li>
    <li> the tattoos work and are easy to apply. they do their job, but the America tattoo comes out backwards when applied - not patriotic</li>
    <li> Needed some tattoos that could be licked on women during a costume photo scavenger hunt bike ride and these worked as expected.</li>
    <li> We used these on July 4 and the kids (and adults) liked them.  No problems once we knew what we were doing.</li>
    <li> I think the original order may have been short (thought now I&#x27;m not so sure). Contacted seller and they personally loaded another complete order and sent them off. Received in a couple of days. Tatoos (haven&#x27;t tried yet) seem to be great quality, a little larger than a quarter dollar (maybe an inch or so accross?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought to hand out at Holoween 2013.</li>
    <li> Fine for our 4th of July party - note that the map of the USA is backwards once it goes onto your body....  cheaply made but what do you expect for fake tattoos?  Worked fine otherwise.</li>
    <li> When you put the USA tattoo on, it is completely backwards! Just a warning. There are a ton of the other ones, so still worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Have them ready for next year&#x27;s block party. They will be a hit!</li>
    <li> Fun, but only five of the eight designs are ones that people like to actually put on.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipping.</li>
