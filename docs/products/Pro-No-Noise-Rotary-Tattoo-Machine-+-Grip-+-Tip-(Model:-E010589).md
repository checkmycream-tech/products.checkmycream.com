      <li>great buy</li>
      <li>AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT</li>
      <li>and they happily gave me good customer service about this tattoo machine.</li>
      <li>Good machine for the price.  </li>
      <li>If your looking for a good rotory machine, don&#x27;t choose this one.</li>
      <li>I am more then happy with my product</li>
      <li>/&gt;It looks even better then the given picture!</li>
      <li>this is a great lil machine and is built strong.</li>
      <li>this is a d^^^ nice gun.</li>
      <li>It&amp;#34;s nice</li>
      <li>When my boyfriend and I purchased this tattoo machine we kind of had a problem with putting this machine together.</li>
      <li>no matter how cheap ...arrived on time but product isn&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>I bought alot of merchandise from Amazon and am pleased.</li>
      <li>Definitely a worthwhile machine.</li>
      <li>since learned my lesson and ordered some better</li>
      <li>but for now it won&#x27;t be touching skin...</li>
      <li>this is my 7th gun &amp; gotta say its my favorite already, the no noise part helps alot doesnt bother others, works for hours on end, &amp; holds up to whatever punishment i give to it even with 18rl at 8v for 4 to 5 hours</li>
      <li>Have done 3 tatt&#x27;s and they all cam out pretty good.  </li>
      <li>happy so far.</li>
      <li>The motor works fine on this machine...</li>
      <li>But, it makes a great cheap back up just get you by.</li>
      <li>overall, it&#x27;s a great addition to my equipment</li>
      <li>and I did enjoy the no noise motor.</li>
      <li>Cheap, burns out quick; chuck ALWAYS strips.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super quiet and surprisingly lightweight.</li>
      <li>The tube it comes with doesnt even fit right.  </li>
      <li>this has honestly sold me on using a rotary gun, having used only magnetic coil guns this is by far better quality all around.</li>
      <li>BUT THE BEST PART IS THE COMPANY THT STANDS BEHIND IT</li>
      <li>Used it once and doesn&#x27;t work....not even worth the price</li>
      <li>Works ok I had to secure the bottom where the mag clips are other than that it works fine.</li>
      <li>have used this type of gun for a long time very dependable easy to use and set up nice gun</li>
      <li>Spend a little more money and get something better.</li>
      <li>Wiring snapped on inside of machine on my first use.</li>
      <li>First of all this machine took forever to come</li>
      <li>This clearly states light weight, n noise rotory tattoo machine.</li>
      <li>and after I finally received it the tube that come with it doesn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
      <li>Whole machine rattles now.</li>
      <li>It does have a silent motor and goes smoothly</li>
      <li>how well it&#x27;s held up with how much use it gets.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>Considering it was shipped from china it was delivered fast.</li>
      <li>This rotary is smooth and simple period.</li>
      <li>After I found a tube to finally fit the machine just cuts off in mid use.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t tighten the tube down for safe handling.  </li>
      <li>Worked fine the first tattoo, next day set it up it idled low</li>
      <li>Runs to high.</li>
      <li>I tried the exact same tube and needle set up on my other machines and had drastically different results as it seems like this rotary has more of a &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; action when it moves the needle rather than a true &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; like coiled</li>
      <li>i used it it never really turn smoothly</li>
      <li>Neither the tube that came WITH the machine, nor any of my other tubes will fit into the chuck.  </li>
      <li>but its a pretty heavy gun and cramps my hand up more than my last gun.</li>
      <li>Even for the cheap price it&#x27;s not worth it; well you get what you pay for and with this machine</li>
      <li>Well, 1st off it took nearly a month to receive it from date of order.</li>
      <li>tubes dont fit properly...too tight!</li>
      <li>No tube I had including the one that was sent with it would fit in the vice and after trying several different power supplies and clip cords and checking against other machines it never once started turning.</li>
      <li>Apparently, the chuck was never tested at the factory.  </li>
      <li>Good gun hits very hard but the tight screw broke sec on time</li>

<li> Not highly recommended, but does the job.</li>
<li> but now I have a case for my other machine as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> ANY OTHER ITEM FROM THIS COMPANY THEN DO IT</li>
<li> but the machine hit too hard to do proper shading and color packing.</li>
<li> u think it would be tight the tube would move</li>
<li> This was literally a waste of my money.</li>
<li> With the power supply turned all the way down the machine still hit way too hard</li>
<li> For at least a little while...</li>
<li> The screw failed, stripped out, the third time I used the machine</li>
<li> but the fact that it sprayed the ink while I was tattooing made the gun nearly impossible to use, ruined the stencil and nearly ruined the tattoo.  </li>
<li> ignore the negative talk.</li>
<li> an was very hard to tighten&lt;br /&gt;every</li>
<li> I have broken my hand years ago, and the weight of this cramps up my hand.</li>
<li> and I would get annoyed hearing him do it all day.</li>
<li> No good for business AT ALL!</li>
<li> This thing stinks.</li>
<li> worked well, came with metal tip that was dirty</li>
<li> But after assembling and using I was disappointed.</li>

    <li> The gun works like a champ, no doubt about it but for some reason sprays ink like a madman.  I tried the exact same tube and needle set up on my other machines and had drastically different results as it seems like this rotary has more of a &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; action when it moves the needle rather than a true &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; like coiled machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did find is that it put in the ink quite solidly and evenly no matter which ink I used (National, Star Brite, or Kuro Sumi) but the fact that it sprayed the ink while I was tattooing made the gun nearly impossible to use, ruined the stencil and nearly ruined the tattoo.  I plan to try a couple other tests with this using different set ups but for now it won&#x27;t be touching skin...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to actually use it yet but did check it  as soon as it came in but I&#x27;ve got to say it is almost as loud as my other guns I have no idea where the no noise concept came from</li>
    <li> tubes dont fit properly...too tight!</li>
    <li> delivery was a pain *don&#x27;t order it over the holidays* overall, it&#x27;s a great addition to my equipment and i&#x27;ll definitely be buying another one. It&#x27;s super quiet and surprisingly lightweight. i&#x27;m really impressed with how well it&#x27;s held up with how much use it gets. Definitely a worthwhile machine.</li>
    <li> Tube vise was stripped.....tried to loosen it out of the box, and it snapped.&lt;br /&gt;Have since learned my lesson and ordered some better machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll drill it and retap later.</li>
    <li> I personally like rotarys and i gotta say this one isn&#x27;t evpensive and runs like a champ. Has so for the last 3 weeks of use. If it holds up over long term I&#x27;d have to say 4 the cost this is a d^^^ nice gun. Considering it was shipped from china it was delivered fast. Def. happy so far.</li>
    <li> Worked fine the first tattoo, next day set it up it idled low and  i thought it was the tip and needle and changed it but didnt work at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this machine in Feb 2013 and it seemed to be in excellent condition. However, upon setting the machine up I found it to be unusable because the hole that the tube vise screw should feed into was stripped. This was literally a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> The motor works fine on this machine... however the components other wise, such as the thumb screw and even the size of the tube is bad.  The tube it comes with doesnt even fit right.  The screw failed, stripped out, the third time I used the machine and I couldn&#x27;t tighten the tube down for safe handling.  Do not buy.  Spend a little more money and get something better.</li>
    <li> Personally, I favor and prefer rotory tattoo machines over coil. This clearly states light weight, n noise rotory tattoo machine. Well, 1st off it took nearly a month to receive it from date of order. When I opened it, I was impressed. But after assembling and using I was disappointed. The action is very low, the movement is not a straight up and down. But a back and forth. And the weight. I have broken my hand years ago, and the weight of this cramps up my hand. And the pain associated with a coil machine is just as equal as this also. If your looking for a good rotory machine, don&#x27;t choose this one. This does not reflect onto amazon. I bought alot of merchandise from Amazon and am pleased. Just not with this machine.</li>
    <li> This machine works best as a paper weight. First of all this machine took forever to come and after I finally received it the tube that come with it doesn&#x27;t even fit. After I found a tube to finally fit the machine just cuts off in mid use. I&#x27;ve tried adjusting this thing every way I can think of and it still won&#x27;t work. Even for the cheap price it&#x27;s not worth it; well you get what you pay for and with this machine you don&#x27;t get a thing. Save your money.</li>
    <li> It does have a silent motor and goes smoothly but its a pretty heavy gun and cramps my hand up more than my last gun. it is a great deal though and I did enjoy the no noise motor.</li>
    <li> This rotary is smooth and simple period. Because ur a tattoo artist not a mechanic for God sake. Just what it takes.</li>
    <li> This thing stinks. No tube I had including the one that was sent with it would fit in the vice and after trying several different power supplies and clip cords and checking against other machines it never once started turning. time to return it.</li>
    <li> When my boyfriend and I purchased this tattoo machine we kind of had a problem with putting this machine together. We didn&#x27;t receive this product on time and I did have to contact the seller and let them know the problem and they happily gave me good customer service about this tattoo machine. After I let the seller know I didn&#x27;t not receive this item on time the seller happily sent me another without me having to pay for another one.</li>
    <li> Cheap, burns out quick; chuck ALWAYS strips. But, it makes a great cheap back up just get you by. Not highly recommended, but does the job. For at least a little while...</li>
    <li> Good gun hits very hard but the tight screw broke sec on time i used it it never really turn smoothly an was very hard to tighten&lt;br /&gt;every time u think it would be tight the tube would move</li>
    <li> Good machine for the price.  Have done 3 tatt&#x27;s and they all cam out pretty good.  Like the machine alot!</li>
    <li> have used this type of gun for a long time very dependable easy to use and set up nice gun</li>
    <li> worked well, came with metal tip that was dirty</li>
    <li> Works ok I had to secure the bottom where the mag clips are other than that it works fine.</li>
    <li> this is my 7th gun &amp; gotta say its my favorite already, the no noise part helps alot doesnt bother others, works for hours on end, &amp; holds up to whatever punishment i give to it even with 18rl at 8v for 4 to 5 hours</li>
    <li> ignore the negative talk. this is a great lil machine and is built strong. runs like a sewing machine. great buy</li>
    <li> Runs to high. Wiring snapped on inside of machine on my first use. Tube grip screw stripped second use. Whole machine rattles now. No good for business AT ALL! Would give zero stars if possible</li>
    <li> Used it once and doesn&#x27;t work....not even worth the price no matter how cheap ...arrived on time but product isn&#x27;t good</li>
    <li> this has honestly sold me on using a rotary gun, having used only magnetic coil guns this is by far better quality all around. HEavier then I was expecting it to be but it doesn&#x27;t feel that way when holding it for use.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TATTOO MACHINES I HAVE EVER ORDERED AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT AS WELL BUT THE BEST PART IS THE COMPANY THT STANDS BEHIND IT THEY TOOK CARE OF MY ORDER AND HAD ME VERY HAPPY WITH THE OUT COME IF YOU ARE THINKING OF ORDERING THIS OR ANY OTHER ITEM FROM THIS COMPANY THEN DO IT YOU WILL B VERY HAPPY WITH THE OUT COME OF YOUR ORDER THANKS A LOT TATTOO ARTIST WORLD YOUR ARE THE BEST</li>
    <li> I bought two of these machines.When doing outline work it performed well but the machine hit too hard to do proper shading and color packing.With the power supply turned all the way down the machine still hit way too hard</li>
    <li> This product had taken awhile to get here but it got here! :D&lt;br /&gt;It looks even better then the given picture! I am more then happy with my product however the box they sent it in belonged to a different tattoo machine but now I have a case for my other machine as well.&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> My husband does tattoos, and we don&#x27;t have a big house and I would get annoyed hearing him do it all day. I can&#x27;t hear him at all now!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even had a chance to try it out yet, and already there&#x27;s a problem.  Apparently, the chuck was never tested at the factory.  Neither the tube that came WITH the machine, nor any of my other tubes will fit into the chuck.  I looks as though the hole was never burnished, leaving a metal ridge in side.  It&#x27;s not worth the time and expense to send it back to China to have it replaced, so I;ll try to burnish the hole my self.  I seems to me that this is the type of issue that just shouldn&#x27;t arise.</li>
    <li> it don&#x27;t even work, the grip in the picture looks nothing like the one i got and i didn&#x27;t get a tip</li>
    <li> It&amp;#34;s nice i have it in my hands work excellent.. i will in contact for a another purchace,, and the price is excellent</li>
