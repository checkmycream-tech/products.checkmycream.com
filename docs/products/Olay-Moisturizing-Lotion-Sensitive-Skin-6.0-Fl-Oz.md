<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is what I normally buy at Walmart.</li>
    <li> The wife digs it and when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I used to use this lotion when I was younger and really liked it. So I bought it again, and it is horrible. Maybe they changed the formula but it clogs up my pores and leaves my face feeling really gritty. I would like to mention that I have very fickle and sensitive skin. Maybe if your&#x27;s is not, it will be great for you. I am bummed I bought the three pack! The extra two jars will make a great donation to a local food bank that distributes toiletries.</li>
    <li> Great, old school product! It moisturizes my dry T-Zone after a brutal winter really took its toll on my face. I don&#x27;t just use it at night, but during the day when I know I&#x27;m going to just be around the house. You can feel your skin being hydrated the minute it&#x27;s applied. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found no other moisturizer that works so effectively and my face is feeling softer and hydrated after just spending the day with it on my face, watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> As with nearly all Olay products, they are nice for moisturizing and give one soft feeling skin, but whether it really firms the skin or not, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to determine.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any firming of my own skin since using this product, but then perhaps because of my age, my skin is past the point of saving from the ravages of time and mother nature.  It does make my skin feel soft and refreshed though before I nod off into a fantasy dreamland of seeing myself as I was at 39, 49, or even 59 again.</li>
    <li> What a steal! 3-Pack costs as much as 1 count of similar products. The cream is thick but can be absorbed very quickly. Strong scent.</li>
    <li> The cream smells great and is absorbed by the skin quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I never break out or suffer dry skin over night in this Colorado dry air. It&#x27;s what I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> My go-to night cream.</li>
    <li> I normally LOVE Olay products, so I was very excited to get this deal. I was so disappointed! The cream smells SO HORRIBLY STRONG that I avoid even using it. When I force myself to, I hold my breath. Then I need to breathe out of my mouth only, until the cream \\&quot;dries\\&quot;. The smell is so sickeningly sweet its outrageous! I cannot speak to the firming effects as I cannot use it consistently enough to reap any benefits. Do Not Waste Your Money! Instead get Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream For Face &amp; Neck. It is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, despite being 56 years old, so this gives me just enough moisturizing to keep my skin hydrated, even in winter.</li>
    <li> Very nice night cream, though it was only $6.00 at Target, which is cheaper than here.</li>
    <li> Love this product and have been using it for years.  Very creamy and light, has a nice subtle fragrance and stays on a long time.  A little sticky on the pillow if it&#x27;s not absorbed fully.  A good value too compared to the other expensive night creams.</li>
    <li> great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> My mom used this for YEARS! She looked great up to the age of 72 years of age. No wrinkles, and smelled wonderful. I&#x27;ve used Purpose face lotion for many many years. Started using it in my early 20&#x27;s along with the soap as recommend by my dermatologist when I had acne issues. Well recently I decided to try my hand using a derma roller with terrible results. After deciding to stop, my face was VERY dry and irritated. Might sound silly but after my mom passed , I kept her Olay jar tucked away in my make up drawer. I LOVE the smell and find it very comforting. Always warmed my heart to open it and see her last finger print where she dabbed out some for her face. I found it while looking around and thought that I should use it as well. Went out the same day and bought this and the daytime formula as well. Just within a few days, my face was so hydrated and smooth. Not sure why I didn&#x27;t do this earlier in my life, but I&#x27;m certainly using it now.</li>
    <li> I love this, been looking for it everywhere. Good night cream. Not for day wear or it could cause break outs, I use it mostly around my eyes and cheeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this really firms that much, but you can&#x27;t expect a miracle in a bottle ESPECIALLY at this price point. However, it definitely does moisturize my face and I can tell it has slowed the progression of additional wrinkles. My eyes feel a lot better in the morning after I use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Target for just a smidge more than $5. I was indecisive about getting this product at first - On the one hand, I&#x27;ve always done really well with Aveeno products for my sensitive skin... But it is really pricey in the long run. And on the other hand, this was an extremely affordable product and I figured if it didn&#x27;t work out than it would be no major loss. But I&#x27;m glad I bought it! For the price this is a surprisingly good night cream. It glides right on and absorbs quickly; It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling slimy/greasy afterward. I&#x27;ve also not experienced any break outs or rashes, which is definitely a good sign! It does a pretty good job at moisturizing, though I do still use an eye cream for a little extra hydration in that area. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making any dramatic improvements (firming) yet as I&#x27;ve only been using it a short duration, but so far I&#x27;m really liking the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I guess could be a negative: The smell. I don&#x27;t personally mind the smell and think it&#x27;s quite pleasant - smells like baby powder - but I can see how it could aggravate someone with perfume sensitivities and what-not. That said, if you&#x27;re EXTREMELY sensitive... it would definitely be best to go with something unscented or prescribed by your dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, for the price, this really is a good product. Planning on continuing to buy it once mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting a good deal. Found them cheaper at Walmart. Smells a little funny but my skin like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference within 48 hours.  The scent is not the most pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Really great face cream. I use this daily (during the day and alternate with another Olay product at night) and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product along with some additional products by same manufacturer all arrived ahead of schedule which was a great plus.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product of Olay. it&#x27;s so sticky, feels just like cheap moisturizer. I will never buy it again nor recommend anybody to buy it.</li>
    <li> This cream is a great night time moisturizer. It is a little too heavy for me to use during the day. It has a pleasant scent, and it is not over bearing.</li>
    <li> This product was received quickly.  I have purchased Olay numerous times in a store, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised on how smooth the product feels when applied.  The price is outstanding.  It does have the \\&quot;typical\\&quot; Olay fragrance which I don&#x27;t love, but the fragrance seems to disappear quickly.  The Olay is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m 59 years old and I think this Olay Night does a good job.  The price at Amazon was fantastic and I&#x27;m happy I purchased Olay Night.........</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for years, very satisfied - The multi pack and the discounts are what satisfied me - very happy with transaction</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream morning and night for several years, and it&#x27;s fantastic! I used to live in SW Florida, and now live in the mountains; it&#x27;s served me well in both climates. I&#x27;m surprised how unleathery my skin feels after all my time in the sun; and now during the cold winters it helps my face stay hydrated and not get chapped. I started using this product right out of college, and now a decade later it&#x27;s still the most important part of my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It feels smooth &amp; seems to work as indicated. It has a strong smell, but I love the smell, it is very fresh &amp; clean. I&#x27;m using it day &amp; night because it goes well under makeup. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Retinol is the only chemical proven (to my satisfaction) to improve skin appearance, but compliance is poor because it burns. I&#x27;ve used Olay Night as a mixer for Renova, Neutrogena or Roc retinol products for years, and it is the perfect soothing partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that you have to spend hours explaining to people why your skin looks unusually good for your age.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it will come in 3 packs which costs as much as 1 count of similar products. But I only received one pack. Rest 2 packs never came. Very Disappointed....</li>
    <li> I chuckled when reading reviews of this product from people who didn&#x27;t like the scent. For me, this is the classic Olay scent from my childhood, when Olay was known as \\&quot;Oil of Olay\\&quot; and their signature product was the pink Beauty Fluid, which also shares this scent. For the scent alone (and the memories it conjures up) I would love this product, but I can also attest that this is an excellent night cream offered at a very reasonable price. The cream is not greasy or heavy at all and it absorbs quickly. In the morning my skin feels smooth and hydrated. I have rosacea and therefore fairly sensitive skin and this product does not bother me at all. It also has not caused any breakouts, which I cannot say about other \\&quot;night cream\\&quot; products I have tried. I honestly cannot say I have noticed any firming, but I have noticed that my skin looks better in general. If you like the classic Olay scent and you want a good quality night cream, then I think you will be pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 3 years.  It is my go-to moisturizer to use at night.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
    <li> When another reviewer said it was the same-smelling good old Oil of Olay night cream that my mother used, I had to give it a try.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel good going on--rather sticky-- and I didn&#x27;t see any positive result from using it,  I guess they have come a long way in night creams in 40 years!  Can&#x27;t beat the price though!</li>
    <li> I get this for my Mom who, at 92, has been using this for years and swears by its performance. Given how she looks at 92, I have to agree that it does seem to work well!  It&#x27;s not as heavy as other creams she&#x27;s used, absorbs well, and she loves the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I can get it in a 3-pack for a great price, and have it shipped right to her. No matter how old you get, it&#x27;s always nice to have the opportunity to make your mom happy!</li>
    <li> I can use most Olay products but had allergic reaction to this one and couldn&#x27;t really use it, but it doesnt even seem to be a good moisturizer, it is very like the Oil of Ulay original lotions before it became Olay. the regenerist line is much better and more expensive,</li>
    <li> Pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a couple days but I love it already! It makes my skin so soft and its none greasy. I have sensitive skin that breaks out whenever I put anything on it. I haven&#x27;t had that problem:). Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love the night cream.  Makes your skin glow in the morning. I just love the moisture it puts back in my skin.</li>
    <li> This has such an unpleasant smell, I threw it all out.  Horrible!  Can&#x27;t stand smelling this at night when I&#x27;m trying to sleep!  Very, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My favorite night time cream.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face and other areas.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice and it does not give me allergies as other fragrance lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they make a body lotion with this smell. I also use this on my grandmother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Have always bought Olay products.  Have used this night cream for years and love how it works and feels.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Night of Olay has been my only moisturizer for 20+yrs. I&#x27;m always complemented on my skin &amp; have used Noxzema &amp; Oil of Olay my whole life. This was a fantastic price. I&#x27;m finding it more &amp; more difficult to purchase this \\&quot;basic\\&quot; product, I don&#x27;t go for all the \\&quot;rejuventating\\&quot; items. Product arrived early &amp; am very pleased. Will shop again. Thx</li>
    <li> Firms and softens my skin wonderfully and although I am usually allergic to nearly everything. It has not caused me to break out at all.</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy.  Non greasy. Absorbs well into newly cleansed skin.  Wonderful after this harsh winter.  I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay has been my face product for more than 45 years and am told I do not look my age. Am in my late 60s but still have to ask for my senior discount, so have no desire to try any other product. Seems to be working just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. It is not greasy and I can see my wrinkles are disappearing for almost a month of usage, especially around my mouth and and neck.</li>
    <li> Works very very well, I&#x27;ve been using it for years! Skin looks very smooth and has a beautiful glow every morning</li>
    <li> I am 40 now so I have started using things like this. I do see what all the hype is about as the appearance of my eyes has noticeably improved.</li>
    <li> nice to  have my favorite creams shipped to my house and I don&#x27;t have to go out. Will continue to use this service</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Very moisturizing and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products since I was a teenager.  I&#x27;m now in my early 30s, a workaholic, a drinker and a smoker yet I&#x27;m complimented often on how much younger than my years I appear.  Good genes aside, I believe firmly it is the result of my Olay use.  I started off with the daily moisturizer but wanted a night cream that would provide skin-improving ingredients while I slept.  Before I found this product I used others which seemed to cause break-outs save one - the Neutrogena night cream.  I believe in consistency so, as soon as I discovered the Olay night cream, I made the switch.  No regrets.  It provides just the right amount of moisture without that greasy feeling.  In fact, if you look carefully at the ingredients, you will discover it is essentially the same as the classic daily moisturizer save one additional component.  I must confess I do have an occasional break-out but, since I can&#x27;t say definitively it is the cream, I will not blame it on Olay.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream on the market. Happy I found a three pack to buy on Amazon at such a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a real person reviewing this. The olay I purchased from Rite Aid works great. I used it for two nights and my skin feels softer. I&#x27;m not sure about the slight wrinkles, that might take longer. The am going to use this every other night. Also great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. Put it on mostly at night. It is quite thick. I prefer this to the ones that come in a bottle which are much more like a runny liquid. Those last you longer as you use less of them but somehow they seem to evaporate faster on your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream.  It&#x27;s been my favorite for many years.</li>
    <li> bought this for my arms. Seems to work a little but nothing major</li>
    <li> They must want to unload all of these, because the price is unbelievable.  I got two orders before they run out.  Works just a well as most creams.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many night creams, and this one really feels like it&#x27;s making my skin firmer!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is powdery without being too strong, and feels luxurious putting it on.  It&#x27;s a reasonable price considering so many are charging the price of Ipods!  Excellent buy and you can find it in the drugstores easily.</li>
    <li> I used to use this cream regularly. It does have a scent, but I actually love the smell as it relaxes me. Which is odd because normally I&#x27;m sensitive to perfume smells. The cream is thick and makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I haven&#x27;t been using it in the last year, but I found a tiny bit left in a jar I had and plan to go back to buying it again. It&#x27;s my favorite of the moisturizing creams I&#x27;ve used in the past. I don&#x27;t like the day time cream with SPF 15 as much as this one (partly because of the difference in smells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious about some of the newer anti-aging ones but since people have reported allergic reactions to those, I&#x27;m nervous to switch.</li>
    <li> So far so great. This was an incredible deal and so far I love the night cream. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It just reminds me of olay. My face feels great and I love that I feel like I am hydrating my skin every night to stay young looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using OLAY for many years ,so I like it. Great price also.</li>
    <li> The only face cream I use</li>
    <li> Great for fine lines.</li>
    <li> I use this every night its not greasy and who doesn&#x27;t love olay is what my mother used and her mother used and now they only keep making this product better I ordered this online, because I really like how much I get for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a love/hate relationship lately with Oil of Olay because they discontinued my favorite cleanser (you can see my other reviews for that whole debacle) but I have to say that I love this firming cream. I hope they never change the formula. I&#x27;ve noticed in the last few years the jar lid looks different but the ounces are the same. I also noticed the price went up about 20¢ but that seems reasonable compared to the rising price in other items. I have been using this firming cream since about 2007. I just really like it, I&#x27;m convinced it works well. My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> always use Olay products</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how effective this is because the smell made me give up after a few days. I used it before bed but the smell made it difficult to sleep.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive product that leaves your skin soft and firm.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am 20 almost 21 and was panicking because I actually got large wrinkles under my eyes almost overnight. (I think a huge factor was the makeup I was using) but I put this on generously over night all over my face and around my eyes and it really made a difference over night. In the morning I could already see improvement in the under eye wrinkles, they looked firmer and less noticeable,and still do several hours after waking up. My overall face and complexion simply looked beter and healthier, very fresh, after using this, I typically use a basic sensitive skin Olay moisturizer but this was a big difference. I recommend it to anyone with a problem already as a first try to fix it or someone looking for prevention.</li>
    <li> I misordered this, thinking it was another of the Olay \\&quot;line\\&quot;.  The cream is thick and rich but has an unpleasant smell.  As a result, I haven&#x27;t been using it as regularly as I should; so, it would be unfair to comment on its results.  Will add further comments in the future if I become a regular user.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, I usually buy it at Target or CVS but when I went the last time they had raised prices significantly so I looked on Amazon. This is a great deal. This cream works great!</li>
    <li> Smells nice - but not too much smell.  Feels good going on.  Seems to firm my skin somewhat.  Moisturizes well.  What&#x27;s not to like?  I previously used Olay Regenerist, and loved it.  This seems like a very good substitute - and quite a bit cheaper!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It helps with the aging skin on my neck as well as areas where I have some mild to moderate psoriasis. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Olay night firming cream goes on thick and is very smooth to the touch. Olay is a name you can rely on.</li>
    <li> I’ve used this as my night cream for about three years, and I am really impressed with it. It has a light scent, but the scent is pleasant. It does a fantastic job of moisturizing; my skin feels great after it is applied. I use this product in conjunction with Oil of Olay Complete Daily Moisturizer (I’ve written a review of that, too). I’m in my 40’s and people routinely are surprised when I tell them that; they think I look much younger. I attribute much of that to a good skin care routine and this product.</li>
    <li> it firms the skin,its oil free and smell nice.. olay products are the best,, i have normal skin and this cream really works .. thank you :)</li>
    <li> Excellent. I used the product for a couple of years and aj ways had good results.&lt;br /&gt;AKL</li>
    <li> The order came before expected and it was just what I had been looking for. Some stores don&#x27;t carry it and at others it cost more unless on salel, but when you need something you can&#x27;t wait for a sale. It came right when i was running out of the last I had and now I have enough with the three to last the rest of the year. I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, but this smell is mild and doesn&#x27;t affect me the way others more and less expensive have in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have used for several years and I really like it. That I was able to order it through Amazon and have it delivered to my home was wonderful. By the time you add the price of the item and then the freight costs it ends up being the same price(in some cases a little more) than the price I would pay at the store. In this case the price was about the same, but the convenience of the ordering made it likely that I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
    <li> These were gifts for friends.  I heard about this product and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say.  I really cannot rate it</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay. I&#x27;m 25 and have pretty nice skin to start, but I get super dry during the winter in Boston. Olay is my go-to for being nice and thick but never greasy. I don&#x27;t dry out or break out with Olay, I love the smell, and I feel like my skin looks better when I use Olay (placebo effect or real? eh...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Great price. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before at other merchants and you can&#x27;t beat this price.  Same smell &amp; texture as any other comparible firming face cream. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> came in the time mentioned and product was as described. I love this product so much...the moisture is so great that ur skin just drinks it in. There is no greasiness at all. Price was very reasonable too. Forever a customer</li>
    <li> In a nutshell I just love all Olay products. If its Olay I know it is good.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Olay moisturizer  for over 30 years and would not change.&lt;br /&gt;Only used night cream for 2 years and I don&#x27;t feel the need to try any&lt;br /&gt;other brands.  Nice on Olay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a zillion years. I love Olay products.  This face cream is inexpensive yet much better than other brands.</li>
    <li> Classic Oil of Olay scent. Very nice, reminds me of my childhood. This makes my skin very soft. It is very thick. I have only used it 2x, so IDK if it really is firming, but it is nice for sure. I have very sensitive skin and this stuff did not make me break out. I usually break out at first use if I am going to have a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I use only Oil of Olay and so this was a terrific bargain.  If you don&#x27;t use it, you should try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used basic Olay night cream since it came in a black glass pot way back in the 80s.  This is the same rose scented pink cream, except now it&#x27;s called \\&quot;night firming cream\\&quot;.  In an entire aisle of face creams, this one is one of the less expensive ones, and I like that they&#x27;ve kept the formula the same all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smooth it on my clean, dry face before bed, focusing on the skin around my eyes.  It absorbs quickly and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any anti-aging ingredients, which I&#x27;m allergic to.  My face is soft, smooth and hydrated when I wake up in the morning, and I credit my minimal wrinkles to using this cream all these years (I&#x27;m 50).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before going out in the cold and wind, I apply it to my face and it protects against windburn and chapping.  I also use it on our kids if they get chapped faces from the winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a fan of emu oil, which I think reverses the signs of aging more than this cream does.  But for basic moisturizing, this is my favorite cream.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price. Used for two years now. My face glows each morning. Will continue use it. Highly recommend. Good for sensitive skins too.</li>
    <li> I am mostly interested in buying natural skincare products- especially for my face, but I haven&#x27;t found a natural night cream that has done the job of keeping my skin fully moisturized.  I ordered this because of all the rave reviews.  I think this cream does a great job of overnight moisturizing, but I have a hard time with the heavy scent (older lady perfume smell).  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, then the product will be just fine, because it does work well.  I may just be sensitive to the scent, as I normally go natural with body products.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so I was never a big facial cream/lotion user.  This dries and absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy feeling.  Your face feels very soft after use.  I use it during the day and at night.  I gave one of the jars to my mom and I think we will both be ordering more very soon!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I was using Clinique Moisture Surge for a long time, but I decided I wanted to try something that is just as good &amp; budget friendly. I purchased one container of this amazing product from Target &amp; have been using for a week now. I have to admit, it is working better than Clinique. My skin is very smooth &amp; soft, and I do notice some lines under my eyes are looking less noticeable. Now whenever I get out of the shower, I get so excited to put on this product. I love the smell &amp; everything about it!</li>
    <li> It feels nice and smooth, but it has an unpleasant, spent smell. I always liked the classic olay scent- it reminded me of my mom and my preschool teacher. This stuff doesn&#x27;t even smell like my granny, it smells like my granny&#x27;s old creams she hadn&#x27;t used in 20 years that sat in her bathroom closet. I can&#x27;t use it with that smell, so I can&#x27;t testify as to the firming component.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for quite a while.  I love the line. I should be paid for an Oil of Olay ad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 but I was lucky enough to inherit my mom&#x27;s natural resistance against white hair and wrinkles (Yay!!!) But I do use a day cream with sunscreen and a firming night cream, because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with giving mother nature a little help, lol. I love this little cream! It makes my skin feel so relaxed and supple when I wash my face and apply it on my face and neck every night. It absorbs quickly and its not greasy. Lots of people complain about the fragrance, but luckily, I love that clean, powdery smell, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face. In terms of texture, it&#x27;s not as satiny smooth and lightweight as a more expensive product would be, but it&#x27;s not horribly thick either. Just be careful not to apply too much and it will not feel gooey or sticky at all. I am very prone to acne breakouts and this cream does not make me get pimples. When I wake up in the morning my skin looks great: No greasy spots, blotches of dry skin, or ugly enlarged pores, etc. It looks like I already took a shower. I never got results like this with any other night cream, and I have used more expensive ones, but none of them beats this little wonder! I love it!</li>
    <li> It feels very smooth and stay for 6-8 hours. For me it works.</li>
    <li> It helped clear up my acne without leaving any dark marks behind. I was using this in combination with aspirin mask and they worked and brought about a complete change in the appearance of my skin within a week. I use the aspirin mask sparingly though just once or twice a month. It does not dry my skin out like other night creams do nor does it make my skin oily. I have combination skin and it works well for most of my  problems like wrinkles, redness, scarring, blackheads and open pores. This is the only cream that actually shows results overnight for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect night-time cream, have used for ten years, plus (probably much longer), no oil to clog pores, feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel tight immediately upon applying. Good product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this to be honest. I was just starting out building a skin care regimen and bought this after a bad experience from another name brand night cream. I can go to bed looking worn out like my skin has really been through something and wake up smooth and glowing.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried so many, and they have made me break out, or made my skin very greasy. This product does neither, and leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> As with most Oil of Olay products, this is a high quality cream that doesn&#x27;t cost a premium price.  It has a scent, but one that I like.  I use it at night as it would be too greasy during the day, but it will certainly become a part of my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for one week, but I have broken out in pimples on my chin. I am 46 and have not had pimples  like this since I was in my teens. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay does not leave your skin feeling oily, and a little bit goes a long way. Keeps skin soft and flexible.</li>
    <li> The package of 3 saves me time. No need to re-order frequently. Shipping box was exact size. Product was well preserved.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and everyone has always told me how pretty my skin looks.  Not greasy.  I will use it forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used oil of Olay night cream and other facial creams for years.  I love it. People always stop me and comment on how pretty my skin is. I am 65 yo  and I won &#x27; stop now.</li>
    <li> great lotion, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or gunky on my skin. Feels so smooth and luxurious, i love it! Keeps my skin&#x27;s dry patches from flaring up, while not being too thick or making spots too oily for daily use. I also personally, really love the scent- but if you are bothered by scents you might want to reconsider.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother. She loves it. Great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I loved the original night time cream and hoped I would like this one! WRONG!!! The cream smelled really bad to the point where I couldn&#x27;t stand it! Do not waste your money and stick with the original.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom. She requested this brand so I&#x27;m assuming she likes its performance. She said it has reduced the appearance of age spots in combination with the day cream. It was recommended by her doctor. The price was definitely right for me.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning before I apply my mineral face powder. It provides plenty of moisture for my skin, plumps up my face and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.  The moisture lasts all day!!  I no longer have to wear foundation, and I am 45 years old!</li>
    <li> I does what it say it will, moisturizes and firms. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and would go out of my mind trying to find an alternative.</li>
    <li> When I received this package I only had one 2oz product and didn&#x27;t get the other two</li>
    <li> My mom is 85 and tells me she always use Olay and she looks amazing.  So I am following the same step.</li>
    <li> I have had dry skin since I was a teenager. Strange as it seems. I have tried everything, mostly clean and clear stuff which I later discovered to be better off for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed is that Aveeno is better for dry skin and Clean and Clear is for oily skin..just throwing it out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno though is too pricey for me, I use this product everytime I get out of the shower which is normally twice a day. So you can imagine I run out pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom gave this jar to my dad and my dad gave it to me. I have been using it for 2-3 years now and it trumps everything ..La Mer, Revlon Eterna, Lush cosmetics (I have tried their pricey moisturizers too) or Aveeno (which is WAY too greasy and pricey for daily use). I am comfy spending my hard earned money for Olay, since my parents have been using it since I was a child, the smell brings back fond memories of my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway to cut it short, I have been using this since my late 20&#x27;s and now im in my early 30&#x27;s it is pretty good. My skin doesn&#x27;t flake like it used to especially in the winter. I am very grateful for this product.</li>
    <li> Most if not all firming and/or lifting products do feel drier on the skin - probably because most are oil free - and they do not VISIBLY  lift or firm anyway - so I mix with almond oil (no smell, no staining, and washes out in laundry) Now almond oil is about $10.00 for 16 oz (on Amazon.com) and is food grade.  I mix with face and body lotions/creams for better results in moisturizing because I have elderly skin which means drier and thinner and of course more wrinkles.  The last firming cream I bought at Walmart was their own  Equate brand for $5.00 and mixed with Almond Oil - so you see you can have very good products and save money.  Or alternatively you can apply a few drops of almond oil to face and body before applying the lifting face cream or hydrating body lotion.</li>
    <li> Nice combination of hydration and firmness as desired in the face skin as we get older. Gave one to my mom and she likes it also. Will most likely re-order when we&#x27;re out off supply.</li>
    <li> my skin is sensitive I use this morning  and night it keeps my face moist without irritation!</li>
    <li> Love this!  It absorbs fast.  The smell is wonderful.  It feels lush and fancy.  The price is excellent and Olay is classic.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night for the past month, and it works great. I originally purchased this to help with red patches on my face. The patches have gone down considerably since then, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or bad reactions to it. (Which is a good thing, since I have very sensitive skin.) It also does a nice job keeping my face moisturized.</li>
    <li> I feared buying this as there were so many reviews saying that the odor was too much, but I took my chances and purchased it because others said it worked well. I love the smell, it reminds me of what my mother used to smell like when I was a child and she used these products. I am almost 30 and wanted to make sure that I was taking care of my skin before any real damage was done, and so far it has done a wonderful job. I am only on my second day and already my deeper lines on my forehead are reducing. I am extremely pleased and I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.</li>
    <li> Price great! Product great.I like that I am stocked up for awhile and the price rocked! Oil of Olay is so great! I like that the cream is light and no residue build up in the AM!</li>
    <li> i think is a great formula,great night cream because dry  faster and help with skin problem works normally. works for me  ok,thanks</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using Olay for a long time. it suits me well. i love Olay and will continue using it..</li>
    <li> I really like this product, would recommend. quality and healthy products for skin care, made from environmentally friendly raw materials using advanced technologies</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product for long as it was thick and hard to apply.  I did not see my neck wrinkles smoothed out like they do with the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream I have used for several years.  I bought the 3 pack of the Firming Cream for the price, but I found you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> what is shown is completely disfferent.&lt;br /&gt;I ordred this product and indeed three came but bulked packed in a clear plastic and not in boxes as shown.</li>
    <li> great love the olay products this product works as it saids</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, love it</li>
    <li> great night cream! My skin is a little dry, so I am using it for day and night. It is not worse those expensive product, even better.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels but the smell is so strong and gross.</li>
    <li> I found this cream to be fantastic. It was nourishing and made my skin feel great and seemed to keep my skin hydrated even after I awoke in the morning after applying it at bedtime. I definately recomend this cream for dry and mature skin and intend to use it for a long time in the future.</li>
    <li> This is good for a basic night cream. I use it every other night - I use retinoid products on the alternate nights and for some reason when I apply this over retinoid it all gunks up and peels off my face.</li>
    <li> If feels great when I put it on my face.</li>
    <li> I needed a really good facial moisturizing cream for winter. Judging by the reviews I was sure that this would be a winner for me. Plus I liked using the beauty fluid in the summer for soft dewy skin so I figured this cream would be just as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. this cream didnt deliver. It left my skin dry and with a white overcast. I trashed the jars. Try and get a sample before committing to a full jar.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Noticeable different within just a few days. I love the smell. I bought 6 of them to make sure U stayed stocked up. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is just great. It&#x27;s inexpensive relative to other night creams. Sometimes I think beauty products have to cost a lot for me to believe they will work. I took a chance one day and I will never buy a more expensive one. I add a couple drops of rosehip seed oil to my moisturizer and emsulsify it in my hands. Then, I apply it to my face. It feels like your skin is taking a drink.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to other reviews, this stuff has an awful strong perfume smell. I do not like it, and my husband really does not like it. He it stinks.</li>
    <li> Love Oil of Olay products</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, it works really well on my skin. The smell is alright, but the product is rich and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I use night of olay morning &amp; night..  It works well for firming the skin and the cost is low.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for two decades on my very dry, very sensitive skin, and I love the coverage and that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which the Olay Age-Defying product does), and instead makes my skin feel silky smooth. It&#x27;s getting harder to find this product in stores, so when I find it, I stock up.</li>
    <li> Buddies for many years. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. Get it.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this for years and swears by it so my sister and myself ordered this 3 pack and shared it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price here on Amazon.  A little dab of the stuff everyday may take years off those wrinkles.....  Mom knows best!</li>
    <li> Could not exist without it - a lifesaver for skin!</li>
    <li> this cream is light enough to use everyday, I added some essential oils to this and I love it will buy again.</li>
</ol>
