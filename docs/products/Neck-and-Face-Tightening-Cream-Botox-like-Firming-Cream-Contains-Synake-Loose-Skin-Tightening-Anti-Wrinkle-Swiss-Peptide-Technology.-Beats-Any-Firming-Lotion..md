      <li>I love the smell of this cream.</li>
      <li>So my neck was ignored too many years.</li>

      <li>I’m glad to be able to support a company that manufactures in the US, and buy a product that is additive and alcohol free, in addition to not being tested on animals.</li>

      <li>Pink Madison is the best..</li>
      <li>Pink Madison has the best skin products out there.</li>
      <li>Pink Madison cream did very good!</li>
      <li>So far this product has been a great value</li>
      <li>I have also spent hours on Amazon looking for the best products for my chin and neck..</li>
      <li>and my skin feels smooth and looks healthy.</li>
      <li>The pump is easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t leak like some do at times.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product if you have some crows feet, fine lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>Tomorrow I am going to use it under my make up and put it on my forehead and the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell, without being so overpowering that it would cause a headache if your are sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love Pink Madison firming cream great alternative to Botox without the hefty price.</li>
      <li>I like the way it leaves my skin feels smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>is so nice you really don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on the counter instead of cramming it in a drawer every night where you might forget about it.</li>
      <li>Which is important to me  because I forget things if they aren&#x27;t where I can see them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I am so happy with it that I plan to have it on hand constantly.</li>
      <li>So many creams I bought were promising results and cost me MUCH more but didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>First, this is the most unique dispensing system I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because there are so many reviews are so positive, but I find no results.</li>
      <li>The bottle has a nice pump action applicator that doesn&#x27;t dispense too much cream (which I would describe as more of an orange gel).</li>
      <li>The cream is helping them start to fade, she is very pleased with that, as she has tried many products and none of them has helped her the way that this cream by Pink Madison has.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t anticipated noticing a difference this quickly, but can tell that my chin(s) are much tighter and my jaw line is more defined.  </li>
      <li>Pink Madison just keeps making their products better and better!</li>
      <li>The bottle is unique, you just press down on the top and the gel like product comes right out the top.  </li>
      <li>I really like that this cream is free from silicones, parabens, additives, fillers and alcohol, all things I try to avoid in my skin care.  </li>
      <li>The skin did shrink back on its own</li>
      <li>After this is finished, I&#x27;ll see if it makes a difference after using the whole jar and would be willing to update my review if it is more positive.</li>
      <li>The cream isn’t greasy or drying, and one little pump from the cool container provides good coverage.</li>
      <li>I am trying to put in review for the seller right away..</li>
      <li>I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>I loved using it on my neck to combat the slight signs of ageing.  </li>
      <li>But my skin does look better and looks younger after using this cream.</li>
      <li>At my first use I saw and felt a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>I bought this firming cream after trying Pink Madison’s apple stem cell anti-aging serum, which I really liked.</li>
      <li>Pretty packaging.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With regular usage of this cream I am sure that I will see results.  </li>
      <li>I just got it in the mail and tried it for the first time.</li>
      <li>and I really like it!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I was only able to use it twice.  </li>
      <li>and I was really hoping it would!</li>
      <li>only use a product on one side of my face because I try many of these</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s convenient and makes certain you use the right amount.  </li>
      <li>The actual product itself is also one that I love.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pink Madison just keeps making their products better and better! I keep coming back to them because of the quality of the ingredients and the fact that they actually do what they say. The skin tightening cream is no different, after a few weeks of using it, I can feel my skin becoming a bit firmer and a little bit tighter. It soaks right in and doesn’t leave behind any greasy and gross residue. That was big for me, since I use this on my legs, bum and a little on my face, its essential that I don’t feel like I’m sitting on a slip and slide. This is perfect for me. I love the pump too! It helps so much with dispersing the product you don’t get too much or too little. I can’t recommend it enough!!</li>
    <li> All people have the desire for young looking skin, as I have gotten older this has become more of an issue. Pink Madison’s firming cream that I can use on my face, hands and stomach has been a godsend. It contains a Botox –like patented ingredient called Synake. The benefits of finding a skin cream that does not irritate my sensitive skin, and gives me the outstanding results of skin tightening and makes my beginning wrinkles less apparent, words alone are insufficient. It is made without using animal testing. Other creams I have tried caused my skin to break out in blemishes, or simply were ineffective in making my skin look younger. Being 57 years old, I really would like to maintain my younger looking skin quality for as long as possible. With regular usage of this cream I am sure that I will see results.  It also comes with a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> There is a lot to love about Pink Madison firming cream. I got my cream in the mail a few days ago and am already noticing a slight difference on my cheeks. I put a little bit on my face in the evening before bed. I normally get crow’s feet and that is where the real difference lies. My bags didn’t completely disappear, but the lines are noticeably smoother. One thing that I really like was that it wasn’t oily like a lot of other products I have tried, its smooth and comfortable. Simple and easy to use, I’d definitely recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Skin Tightening Cream every morning and night for two weeks and seeing firmer skin on cheeks and forehead, where I was starting to see fine lines. The bottle has a nice pump action applicator that doesn&#x27;t dispense too much cream (which I would describe as more of an orange gel). I like the way it leaves my skin feels smooth and silky. As an added bonus, I&#x27;ve noticed that i have less breakouts where I apply the cream. So far this product has been a great value and I plan to get more for female friends and family.</li>
    <li> I bought this because there are so many reviews are so positive, but I find no results. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Just got this cream. The first time I applied it, I noticed a little tightening and moisturizing. I have now been using for a few days. I am very pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this cream, the lines on my neck looks tighter after a few days use. And the skin on my face appears fuller. I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try! BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> I am currently on a weight loss journey and am always looking or something to help me along the way. When working out I like to wear a waist belt to help further flatten my tummy. I often look to social media for weight loss tips and noticed that other women wearing waist belt were also using firming cream prior to their workouts. The results were amazing so I thought I&#x27;d try one myself. I wanted to look for a brand I trusted so I went with Pink Madison&#x27;s Firming cream. Upon receiving it, I already knew I would be in love. The packaging let me know that all of the ingredients were still active since it is very air tight. I also liked the package because it is a pump, I hate sticking my fingers into creams especially after I&#x27;ve gotten a manicure! After only a few days of trying the product, I must say my stomach is looking tighter. Though I haven&#x27;t used it on my face (only on my tummy) I know it will deliver incredible results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pink Madison&#x27;s Firming Cream for a little over a week and already I am noticing the fine lines around my eyes and lips are disappearing, my skin feels like silk. I swear it looks as if my pores are getting smaller and I am noticing a lift in my chin that was not there before. it really is tightening my skin. I have received several compliments from coworkers and college students, they know something is different but no one can figure it out yet. I love the container, it has a great pump feature on top so just a little product comes out to the top, no need to worry about all of it on your finger right away and if I pumped to much out I just leave it there, put the lid back on and use it the next time. The firming cream is a gel and goes on smoothly, a little bit goes a long way. I only need a small dab on my finger to cover my whole face and neck. A really great feature that I have not tried yet is this cream can be used all over, its not just for your face and neck!</li>
    <li> Like the tightening feeling but still waiting to see visible results !</li>
    <li> Lasted me 3 days, was not worth the money, barely any product in the container</li>
    <li> I already use Pink Madison Skin Firming Serum, so I figured that I&#x27;d start using the Pink Madison Firming Cream since I LOVE the firming serum. I use it directly after the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually in commercials for a spa that does collagen treatments, but I don&#x27;t use their treatments. I use Pink Madison Firming Cream and Serum and I look at least 5 years younger than my real age. I look younger at 33 than I did in my mid-20s from the firming treatments from Pink Madison. You feel the firming and see the results within seconds (no joke!). It is such a cool feeling and you know you&#x27;re not wasting your money when you can see the results immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the name fool you! Pink Madison has the best skin products out there. I have purchased again and will again and again!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to use this cream when it was offered to me during a promotion for my honest opinion, but have I have used this product line before and was very happy with the results so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly in a very secure package.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is so nice you really don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on the counter instead of cramming it in a drawer every night where you might forget about it. Which is important to me  because I forget things if they aren&#x27;t where I can see them.&lt;br /&gt;This pump is very different and I really like it! You push down and just the correct amount comes out the top of the pump, so there is no waste and it is so much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;It is an orange color which I found to be kind of different.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the cooling effect you get from it and you can almost immediately feel the tightening.&lt;br /&gt;I only use a product on one side of my face because I try many of these and I like to see the results of each. I have used this for 2 days and i can see a huge&lt;br /&gt;difference in the right side of my face as far as tightening.</li>
    <li> this product is ok.  the packaging is HORRRRRRRRRIBLE.  I was only able to use it twice.  The pump gets stuck and after second use it no longer dispenses at all.  It is by far the worst product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews. I have also spent hours on Amazon looking for the best products for my chin and neck.. I&#x27;m 28 and come from a long line of Turkey necks. I already have lines in my neck that appeared within this past year. I praise the cream God&#x27;s this works. Don&#x27;t want to look like my 50 year old mom at 35! I&#x27;ll.update soon! If it works as well as I&#x27;ve read I plan to stock UP!!! UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using this product for three- four days n it&#x27;s wonderful! Smells fresh, pump is awesome gives the perfect amount, and using it am and pm I&#x27;m Seri g less n less gobble gobble n lines then before. I will def buy more! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a week but I do think it tightens</li>
    <li> too expensive  does not tighten  very small quantity</li>
    <li> It worked , but  for the price very little in the container. Not really impressed.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars. The truth is, I don&#x27;t know if it works, because I just started using it.  I need all the help I can get!.  I like the fact you can use makeup over it.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for over 2 weeks now.  Not really seeing much of a difference..I&#x27;m sadden..I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pink Madison&#x27;s two other products- Stem Cell &amp; Bamboo tightening.  And, I use it with the Stem Cell, hoping to enhance the results.&lt;br /&gt;  After this is finished, I&#x27;ll see if it makes a difference after using the whole jar and would be willing to update my review if it is more positive.</li>
    <li> l I did not receive a discount price but I am a happy customer anyway.  I have just opened my second bottle and I think I see results already.  I always give a product at least 30 days and begin using with caution because I have super sensitive skin.  No irritation and I do see firming.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use and will update my results.  I hope it stays in stock!</li>
    <li> At my first use I saw and felt a difference in my skin.  I loved using it on my neck to combat the slight signs of ageing.  The bottle is unique, you just press down on the top and the gel like product comes right out the top.  It absorbs right into my skin and feels very soft.  I did not notice any scent to the product.  I really like that this cream is free from silicones, parabens, additives, fillers and alcohol, all things I try to avoid in my skin care.  I look forward to using this product until the container is empty.  Pretty packaging.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I just got it in the mail and tried it for the first time. It works wonders. The gel is orange and lightly scented, but it leaves absolutely no residue on your skin. It helps my skin feel nice and firm again, yet soft to the touch. The pump is easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t leak like some do at times. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how much this unique gel can help my skin to firm up on my neck and jawline. I&#x27;m not getting any younger, and I can use all the help I can get. If you are looking for that one particular item that will work, this is it. AND, if you don&#x27;t like it, or you feel that it doesn&#x27;t work for you, Pink Madison will send you your money back. You really can&#x27;t lose with this product. Give it a try. I&#x27;m so very glad that I did!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to know if this cream really works. The pump dispenses the correct amount to eliminate guess work... but unfortunately it only lasted less than a week, and I wasn&#x27;t even using it twice a day, since I was already using another product.&lt;br /&gt;Rip off? I believe so. The container was probably more than half empty. I already returned the product and received a reimbursement.</li>
    <li> I did not get any firming action from this product &amp; after using it everyday twice a day it made absolutely no difference in my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it because of all the positive reviews on Amazon.  It also contains chemicals so Im after 100% Organic blends. I will&lt;br /&gt;have to begin reading the ingredients before I purchase anymore skincare.  It appears most all these companies use chemicals&lt;br /&gt;or synthetics in their skincare products, but we get enough of that in our toxin environment we live in.  Don&#x27;t need it added to skincare&lt;br /&gt;or lotions etc.  I returned for a refund.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing product like it alot!! Skin looks great with no make-up on.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all. I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews. Used two containers without any results.</li>
    <li> Worthless,,,a waste of money. It did not firm my skin at all.  The pump was the best part of the product.</li>
    <li> This orange gel-like substance is like a miracle gel. I use it at the outside corners of my eyes, my upper lip and between my brows where I had fine lines and some wrinkles. I have been using it twice a day for just a week and have noticed a remarkable difference in the elasticity of my skin. It had tightened up and firmed diminishing those pesky imperfections a little more each day! I also use it on my neck and chest area with the same noticeable results. It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and has a very pleasant scent. I would recommend this product if you have some crows feet, fine lines and wrinkles you would like to get rid of!</li>
    <li> I noticed crepe-y chicken neck one day in the mirror and was immediately on line to see what I could find.  I&#x27;m a redhead and have really sensitive skin. My issue over the years is that when I used typical moisturizer on my neck I got clogged pores or red marks. So my neck was ignored too many years. I&#x27;ve used this product (not as vigilant as I should be) and noticed a difference even though I&#x27;m not 100% compliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely re-order. Unlike some other reviewers, I received no discount to review the product-but that sounds like a smart idea!</li>
    <li> Just received this week so no idea if this will work or not.  But I&#x27;m not sure if I like the way it comes out of the jar.  Sometimes it&#x27;s a pain to get the lotion out.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t notice any difference and the jar is almost empty.  Don&#x27;t care for the lid - confusing as to how to use it - so I just take it off.  I love the smell of this cream.</li>
    <li> Skin feels tighter and has a light and good smell. Have being using for about 2 weeks on my stomach, happy with it so far. Need to buy more. i like the pup.</li>
    <li> What a rip off! I got this May 29 I used it twice a day as I was suppose to only 1 pump each time it is now June 9 and its empty! I spent 39 dollars you would think you get 1oz as said on the bottle NO YOU DO NOT only the top off the lid had lotion really no joke I took it apart to see if I could get more out the bottom has NOTHING!!! Its an empty shell to push air You would think for $39 you would get enough for at least 1 month. What a rip off!! No where near 1oz of product.</li>
    <li> It made my skin a little softer but no difference in wrinkles or tightening of skin.  Not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Used entire jar which only took about 3 weeks and saw no change at all.  The product is also VERY sticky on your skin and beads off if you use it in the morning under makeup.</li>
    <li> Possibly the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face and neck!  It actually does firm my loosening jowl area.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> This product is more like a gel instead of cream ...which is ok ....works really well and it doesn&#x27;t take alot !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  make  any  difference</li>
    <li> I bought this firming cream after trying Pink Madison’s apple stem cell anti-aging serum, which I really liked. The firming cream is orange, gel-like and has a very light, pleasant fragrance. So far I’ve used it on my face and neck, but it can also be used on other areas of the body, like hands or stomach. I apply it after washing my face before bed, and although it’s only been a few days, it seems like the lines in my neck are less deep. The cream isn’t greasy or drying, and one little pump from the cool container provides good coverage. I’m glad to be able to support a company that manufactures in the US, and buy a product that is additive and alcohol free, in addition to not being tested on animals. And the fact that Pink Madison provides a full refund if you’re not completely satisfied is kind of amazing.</li>
    <li> I love The Skin Tightening Firming Cream by Pink Madison. It is a pump application which I love, and the product does not leave a greasy feel on your hands. It is easy to apply and all of that alone helps to make this a great product. The actual product itself is also one that I love. I have used it for three days and I can already notice the difference on face and my lines and wrinkles are fading. My neck area also looks tighter. My daughter has been using it on her stomach and thighs and she loves t as well. She had a baby about a year ago and has still been working to get rid of some stretch marks. The cream is helping them start to fade, she is very pleased with that, as she has tried many products and none of them has helped her the way that this cream by Pink Madison has. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product twice so far, but I&#x27;m already really liking it. My skin feels smoother already! I haven&#x27;t noticed any real firming yet, but I think I will after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love Pink Madison firming cream great alternative to Botox without the hefty price. I am a 49 year old woman that works 12 hour night shifts and you can really see the fine lines and my skin is starting to sag a little around the mouth area with the lack of sleep and long hours really does a job on your skin! I started using pink madison firming cream and all I can say is WOW! It comes in a jar with a very cute pump lid and comes out just a little at a time,put on your fingertips and put on your face .It comes out as a pink gel with a soft scent. Immediately I felt the tightening of my skin and the gel absorbs Immediately and my skin feels smooth and looks healthy. My fine lines are less noticeable .Iv&#x27;e been putting it on my thighs and stomach for my cellulite.This product should be in every woman&#x27;s bathroom! I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> For what you pay for this, it needs to be bigger. I can&#x27;t say if this work or not due to not enough product to go around.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:af6c5d357a605d08b1158d9ad684af02]] Amazing product! First of all, the presentation of the bottle is impressive. The entire top is a pump, and pressed down, a drop-size of the cream comes out. All you need is a couple pumps of this cream to cover your entire face. The orange color cream is thick in texture but when applied, feels light and subtle. This cream contains Synake which is a synthetic form derived from snake venom and is an alternative to Botox. It&#x27;s used to fight wrinkles and signs of aging. I don&#x27;t know about you, but using this cream is definitely a lot cheaper than Botox and a lot safer. This cream isn&#x27;t only for face but can be used for hands, stomach and any areas of the body that needs tightening. It effectively reduces the sagging of the skin. You&#x27;ll see a significant difference in just a week with everyday use. I&#x27;ve been using twice a day, in the morning and at night, specifically on my neck. I&#x27;ve noticed that my neck is more defined and the lines aren&#x27;t as deep. I purchased this cream at a promotional value to product test. I definitely prefer this cream from Pink Madison versus other anti-aging creams you&#x27;d find at department stores.</li>
    <li> Great product. Am disappointed to see it is not available any more.</li>
    <li> Used this item twice a day every day and saw absolutely no results!  Waste of money</li>
    <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
    <li> It does work in smoothing out lines on my forehead, my skin looks tighter and more &amp;#34;glow-y&amp;#34;. The only thing it didn&#x27;t help with is one annoying fine line on the right side of my mouth and I was really hoping it would! But my skin does look better and looks younger after using this cream. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize, so you&#x27;ll need a moisturizer as well.  I use this mainly for my face because 1OZ doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot of product for the rest of the body. I still like it and will continue to use it because at least I&#x27;ve had some really good results with it. So many creams I bought were promising results and cost me MUCH more but didn&#x27;t deliver. Pink Madison cream did very good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month or so. I am completely astonished by how well it works.  I had  hip replacement surgery done last year and my thigh swelled up enormously.  Then I lost around 25 pounds.  After the swelling went down and the weight loss evened out my inner thigh was very bad. Loose skin that literally would shake. The skin did shrink back on its own but I still was not satisfied. I had tried other creams but I was not satisfied with the result. Then I found Pink Madison firming cream. I started using it and it has a very unique applicator that you press against the area and a metered amount of creamy lotion comes out. You can spread it with the applicator or use your hand to rub it into your skin. I have already seen a marked improvement in the texture and tightness of my skin. I am so happy with it that I plan to have it on hand constantly. I use it on my arms and knees too. You really can use it anywhere you have a problem. This is one product that I would definitely recommend to friends, family and anyone who needs a lift here or there.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.  First, this is the most unique dispensing system I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It&#x27;s convenient and makes certain you use the right amount.  I&#x27;ve used this product for two days and so far like the difference I am seeing.  I hadn&#x27;t anticipated noticing a difference this quickly, but can tell that my chin(s) are much tighter and my jaw line is more defined.  I believe with continued use that the appearance of a sagging chin that comes with age will reverse itself.  It has a pleasant smell, without being so overpowering that it would cause a headache if your are sensitive to fragrance.  I also used some on by belly area to tighten/tone left over skin from pregnancy.  I was fortunate to receive this product to review at a discounted price in exchange for n honest and unbiased review.  Tomorrow I am going to use it under my make up and put it on my forehead and the fine lines around my eyes.  I love it!</li>
    <li> 3 applications, to soon to tell if it works. UPDATE.... ONLY GOT 7 OR PUMPS OUT OF ENTIRE JAR! CALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT A FULL JAR .</li>
    <li> Actually, you don&#x27;t have to go any further than this product...I have tried COUNTLESS products&lt;br /&gt;aimed at targeting lifting of the neck...This one is the best...Please don&#x27;t spend anymore of your&lt;br /&gt;hard-earned money on anything else..Pink Madison is the best..You don&#x27;t have to &#x27;stop at the neck&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;in using Pink Madison..Apply it along the jaw and around your cheeks; especially in the folds..</li>
    <li> expensive product with small amount. no sooner than you use its gone. no results</li>
    <li> I am writing this review....its too early to tell...it feels good and softens face...I have to use before I can tell more...I am trying to put in review for the seller right away..I will order more if I can tell a difference..</li>
