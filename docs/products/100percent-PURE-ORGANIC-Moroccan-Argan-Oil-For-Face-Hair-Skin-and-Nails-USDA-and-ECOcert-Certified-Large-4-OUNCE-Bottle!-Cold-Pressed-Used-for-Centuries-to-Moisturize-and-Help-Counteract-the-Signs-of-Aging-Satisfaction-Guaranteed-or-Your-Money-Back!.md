    <li> I spent hours reading through various Argan oil listings on Amazon before I decided on this. I ended up ordering another genuine organic Argan oil from Mountainroseherbs and found that they both have the same smell, same absorption, and same wonderful emollient effects. This is the real deal. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust any other brands but this and the Mountainroseherbs brands.</li>
    <li> okay...i am not sure if all the reviews here are fake or not but this is not argan oil&lt;br /&gt;i buy my argan oil usually in morocco itself and since i have not been there in awhile and ran out&lt;br /&gt;i has no choice but to try amazon. I compared the consistency, beyond the smell and texture is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;if this was 100% argan oil this should be no difference than the oil i brought from the villages in essaouria, morocco&lt;br /&gt;from the women that actually make this stuff. This stinks and is like water. Argan oil has a thicker texture and smells nutty&lt;br /&gt;BUY THE REAL STUFF, don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap. The real stuff is like magic..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil before but the product only had a little oil in it so it didn&#x27;t do the job. A friend of mine who owns a salon told me to only use an organic, pure argan oil and about Ammara so I tried a bottle, let me tell you I&#x27;m sold. I noticed a difference right away!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for ways to be healthy naturally and I was lucky to find this tidbit of a treasure.  I really love Ammara Argan Oil!  I&#x27;ve used it in my homemade body butters, conditioners, before coloring me hair, and alone on my skin.  I am over the moon with the results!  My skin has a healthy glow, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It is soft and supple and even some of my scars are beginning to fade.  It does wonders for my natural hair keeping it  soft, shiny, and frizz-free.  I use it every day and I must say that I feel simply beautiful from head to toe!</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff!!  I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman (LOL!) and I use this daily on my face and neck.  It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky and my skin is looking better and better.  I will definitely reorder this when I need it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is quite amazing.  I have been using it as a face moisturizer for about 3 days and already see the difference in my skin&#x27;s texture!  I recently changed my entire face-care routine, since I&#x27;ve suffered with adult acne through most of my twenties. At the recommendation of a skincare professional, I added this oil to my night routine and the results are great. Plus you can use it for a ton of other things too - buy it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. This is a great price for the amount of organic oil you get!</li>
    <li> Thanks for all of the tips on using the Moroccan Argon oil- they are very helpful. I am enjoying the product immensely</li>
    <li> Top Quality. I am so glad I went with this brand. It is of excellent quality. I&#x27;ve used it every single day since I received it. I use it on my face after my toner. I use it on my hair &amp; skin and I also use it on my cuticles. I am very pleased with the quality and will be purchasing more in the near future. You also get a lot of oil for the price (4 oz). Great price, awesome quality.  I am truly a happy customer.</li>
    <li> actually is good we have seen different after we start using it</li>
    <li> It is helps frizzy hair and keep  hair smooth even in humidity.</li>
    <li> I had a scar from my shoulder in May 2013. It is healed and faded due to the use of this oil.</li>
    <li> I heard about Argan oil and wanted to try it before the holidays. I decided to buy a bottle of Ammara brand, because it is certified certified organic. When I received the package, it was a luxurious packaging, with an extra cap in case I decided to use the oil on my hair. I followed the direction on the label, for skin application. I used the oil as a moisturizer in the morning and at night. The oil is absolutely amazing. Within 3 days, my wrinkles seemed to fade away. My skin looks smoother. But that was not all. I tried the Argan oil, the same way people recommended me to use the brand Moroccanoil and I was amazed. Unbelievable. Straight hair, classy look, beautiful hair, shorter styling time. I keep my oil in the shower and use it every morning on my skin and on my hair. I bought a few bottles for Christmas. What a luxurious and elegant gift.</li>
    <li> The best product you will ever invest it. Within a week my daughter and I saw a significant difference in our skin, hair and body. Baby soft skin. A must have for a woman.</li>
    <li> I use it to make beeswax hydrating cream for dry skin. This oil gives my skin a very soft texture. I love it. Seller has promptly processed a returned bottle, and send me another one.</li>
    <li> I use it as a daily moisturizer, my skin drinks it in, and then my face is very soft, not greasy at all</li>
    <li> This oil is of such exceptional quality. I have never found a product that has worked so well on my hair. The fact that it moisturizes the skin as well is an added bonus for me. I have sensitive skin, and I have not experienced any irritation whatsoever. Thank you for a product that finally IS what it is claimed to be.</li>
    <li> leaves your skin very smoothe.</li>
    <li> SO FAR GOES ON SMOOTH AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SILKY!</li>
    <li> The odor from this particular bottle of oil smelled more of a strong olive oil.  I am using it more for my hair then using on my body or anywhere that the fragrance overwhelms me.  I&#x27;ve purchase other brands that smelled better, and that&#x27;s what I will continue to use on my body.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil! It came very quickly and was packaged so extremely well. The box it comes in is fancy and the bottle is so beautiful as well. I plan on buying more of this for myself and for gifts! I appreciate the extra long dropper/dispenser, as it makes it easy to reach to the very bottom of the bottle, so none of the product is wasted. I also appreciate that this item is 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil and Ammara is a company in the USA that does not test their products on animals. I have extremely sensitive skin, so finding products that don&#x27;t cause me to break out has proven to be difficult. I love putting this on my face, body and hair. My skin is so very soft and has a baby-like feel to it! It adds just enough shine and removes any frizz from my hair, without feeling too greasy or oily. My husband even loves it as well and can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was for this top shelf product! I&#x27;m a very pleased customer and highly recommend this to everyone. I would give it 10 stars, but 5 will have to do:)</li>
