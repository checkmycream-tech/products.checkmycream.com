    <li> Protects your nail polish perfectly.</li>
    <li> Being a busy mom, I never painted my nails since they took too long to dry.  But this gives your nails a great shine and dries SUPER fast, I love it!</li>
    <li> A few minutes and your color is ready to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of top coats and this is by far the best!!!! It makes regular Polish look like gel bc its so shiny and it dries so quick! Stays in place for 7 day minimum for me protecting my polish from chipping</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else and I don&#x27;t care how expensive it is - it dries quickly, with high-shine, and makes the polish last. Even an iffy manicure looks great and glossy topped with this.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Good to Go&amp;#34; is a great choice for a fast-drying, glossy polish to seal off your color application.  Great to use alone or with a color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of top coats, a few that are fast drying. This one has been the best protecting and fastest drying top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It even helps to even out the final coat of nail polish giving your manicure the perfect final touch.</li>
    <li> Excellent products! I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie.</li>
    <li> It really does penetrate the coats of color to dry the nails faster. Best fast drying top coat I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I like all of essie&#x27;s products.It  prevents chipping and it helps dry a lot faster than the polish on its own.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this top coat after staring at the $10 price tag for a long while. Well i&#x27;m glad I broke down and bought this because it saves so much time and makes my nails look great. It took my nails about 2 minutes to dry, it wasn&#x27;t completely dry I dropped something and tried to catch it and the edge of the object dented my nail slightly. But within 10 minutes of doing my nails, I was able to flat iron my hair with no chips, smudges, dents, or impression marks. In addition to drying fast, it also made my nails super shiny which looks amazing over opaque nail finishes.</li>
    <li> Good to go is my all time favorite top coat! It dries so fast and the finish almost looks like you got a gel manicure! I recommend getting the essie quick dry oil too to make the process faster! My nails never looked so good!</li>
    <li> I just bought this a couple of days ago and it really is awesome!!! I am horrible with painting my own nails because I don&#x27;t wait long enough for the coat to dry and my nails never look perfect like at the salon....until I found this product.  I used it and waited maybe 2 min. didn&#x27;t sit in front of a fan or a light and my nails look perfect! Great shine and they really do look like I just had them done at the salon, I wish I knew about this product earlier.  I will make sure I always have this at home.  ;)</li>
    <li> This is some of the best top coat I&#x27;ve used.  It dries very fast and goes on very smooth!</li>
    <li> This top coat does dry fast, but it doesn&#x27;t set until like 10 minutes after. I usually do my nails right before I go to sleep so I know that in the morning it is fully dry and hard. But i do wait 10 minutes before going in my bed. I had a different product that really got hard and dried in like 2 minutes. But i ran out. But back to Essie, it&#x27;s great. I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite top coat I have ever tried. It truly dries completely very quickly and my nails stay chip free for 5 days or so. I will be purchasing again when I run out, probably a couple bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job. My nails dry a lot faster and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any smudges!</li>
    <li> Essie&#x27;s Good To Go quick dry top coat is great!  It smoothes out your nail color and makes it look flawless AND it really is a quick dry product!  My nails seem so much healthier since I have been using this.  My nail color also lasts alot longer with this top coat.  I am on a computer keyboard all day and counting money as a bank teller and this really holds up.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love the speed of drying and high gloss, but my nail polish peels off in one big chunk a couple of days after applying this topcoat. The polish also seems to gum up pretty quickly in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a great top coat. Personally, I don&#x27;t see it as drying any faster than any other top coats, but if you dip your nails in ice water, they&#x27;ll dry and harden right away.</li>
    <li> Love this topcoat. Better than OPI but fraction of the price. It makes my freshly painted manicure dried so fast it makes my manicurist scream. Also it makes my color stays longer. Shipping was fast too. Couldn&#x27;t be more happier. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is definitely NOT what it claims to be. Doesnt dry quickly, and was chipping within the first few hours and I&#x27;m not the type that does any type of \\&quot;hard labor.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll stick with my Orly top coats from here on out.</li>
    <li> I have been painting my nails about twice a week for the past few years, but I&#x27;ve never used a topcoat.  I recently found out what I&#x27;ve been missing!  I bought this topcoat with some Essie nail polish, and the topcoat makes the manicure last about a week.  Also, it smooths out any bumps and lumps that show up when you paint the color.  And, the color doesn&#x27;t end up back in the clear bottle.  Just perfect.  I haven&#x27;t tried it over regular drugstore nail polish yet, though.</li>
    <li> Does dry relatively quickly and leaves a very nice shine, lasts longer than other top coats I have used but still chips, which with the activities Im doing everyday (crossfit, rock climbing) I don&#x27;t think there is a non-gel polish out there that will last more than 2 days anyway with zero chips.</li>
    <li> Fast dry awesomeness!! This is a great product! It literally drys within minutes! Great as a top coat and as a bottom coat. Would definitely recommend to others.  Seller was very prompt in shipping!</li>
    <li> For the last few years, all I&#x27;d used was Seche Vite... But I&#x27;d grown tired of the bottle getting goopy, lack of ready availability, and the &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34;. No &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34;, it dries fast, is durable, and has great shine! This is my new staple!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT TOP COATS AND THIS ONE IS THE BEST! IT DRIES SUPER FAST JUST LIKE IT SAYS AND LEAVES A REALLY PRETTY HIGH SHINE. NO CHIPPING OR CREASING! THANK YOU ESSIE!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product because I wait forever for my nails to dry, but this doesn&#x27;t dry my nails any faster than the air does. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Essie is my favorite polish and this did not disapoint. To prevent chipping don&#x27;t forget to paint the tips of your nails. It helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Shiny and fast drying. I love it. Essie products are the best I&#x27;ve found. This top coat keeps my manicure looking brand new all week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this polish for several years and this is the only polish I will use after spending big bucks to get my acrylic nails done. No use in spending serious money to get your nails done and use cheap polish. It also dries FAST.</li>
    <li> I really have problems with top coats. They seem to make my nail polish bubble disgustingly even if I don&#x27;t shake any bottles and wait a really long time in between layers.  I really like this top coat because my nail polish hardly bubbles now.  Also, you can put it on top of the color coat while it is still tacky.  It&#x27;s quick drying to the touch and has a nice glossy shine.</li>
    <li> Shine: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Dry speed: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Skrinkage: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shrinkage - it does shrink from the sides/tip. However this is easy to remedy no matter what top coat you use - just file down the nail tip! I have been using the glass file called \\&quot;Cheeky Crystal Nail Files,\\&quot;, and I have not had any issues. The shrinkage I have experienced with Essie Good To Go has been adequately addressed by these nail files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency - I have used about 25% of the bottle, and it is starting to get tacky and sticky and hard to use. I am wondering what kind of thinner can be used with this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I can&#x27;t thin it out, I will probably get another bottle because it dries SO quickly and the shine is amazing!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not kidding when they say fast dry. Perfect top coat to any nail lacquer . That perfect salon shine on every stroke. Came in time and I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m being a bit premature leaving this review - because I only used this for the first time last night - but I&#x27;m really happy right now. I almost always have problems with my nails being dented and marked by my sheets, even when I do my nails 6+ hours before bed (I have some cheapie polishes, admittedly... but 6 hours seems like enough, doesn&#x27;t it?). I put this top coat on at 9:00, was in bed at 11:00, and this morning my nails are still glass-smooth and so, so shiny. So shiny. It was definitely dry to the touch a minute after application, too. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for a top coat, but I do not think my nails dry any faster than if I were using another top coat.  As a regular top coat, this is great.  It provides great shine and I think my polish lasts longer when I use this.  However, the fast dry is not accurate.</li>
    <li> Note: Usage 2 times review observation based on seven days with polished and mended chipped nail edges.    The Shine on my nails is as glossy on Day Seven as it was on Day One. The edges began to chip on Day Two on a couple of fingers. Continual chipping on the edges of my nails during the week. By Day Seven only one finger looks presentable in public.       I re-polished my edges only by first using a coat of the top coat, the actual color, and lastly a coat of the top coat. The nails look fabulous again.      Contains Tosylamide Formaldehyde Resin    Made in USA</li>
    <li> This is the best top cover I have ever used in my life. I know it says that it is a drier but it works amazingly as a top cover. You put it on and it dries super fast and my nail polish will last more than a week without cracking or chipping ever! I have to take it off not because of the chipping but because I get bored of the color. It also leaves the nail polish looking like glass! Super shinny and beautiful! I have tried SO many top covers and this is the best one I have ever tried. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great top coat, dries super fast and makes doing my nails much quicker.</li>
    <li> great product! won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have been using Seche Vite for several months now, and this stuff is even better.  It dries in literally two minutes...it could even be shorter than that, I&#x27;m just too afraid to touch them right after I paint.  It doesn&#x27;t shrink like Seche Vite does, and it&#x27;s super glossy and pretty.  Well worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is my go to top coat for any manicure.  I use it on ones I do myself and I also add it on top of professional manicures a few days after I get them done to keep the polish looking fresh.  After too many coats over several days, the edges of the polish start to peel up on the sides of my nails but I can do a coat two and four days after a manicure and it still lays flat.  This tends to happen to me with any top coat and polish though.  What I love most of all about this polish is how fast it dries.  My first hand is dry to the touch and functional after doing my second hand, less than a minute later. So convenient and lasts very well!</li>
    <li> The top coat is very shiny and dries very fast. I would recommend all of the Essie products and will buy more myself.</li>
    <li> The BEST topcoat. Dries super fast and is super shiny.</li>
    <li> My friend showed me this a few years ago. Since then I can&#x27;t paint my nails without it. Smooths out any bumps or bubbles, drys quickly, leaves a nice shiny finish. Love it</li>
    <li> Great, does what it says but doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping. Would be so amazing if it was a two in one- quick drying and chip resistant. I have Essie&#x27;s no chips ahead but it&#x27;s just too many coats- base, top, quick dry and no chip coat makes my nails smudge due to too many layers, it&#x27;s like it never fully dries and somehow I always get a smudge after.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says. Good product.</li>
    <li> Makes my nails dry fast and stay chip free longer than if I do not apply the nailpolish. It also adds an extra shine giving me that &#x27;just manicured&#x27; look</li>
    <li> Nice top coat and quick dry is a PLUS!! Love this product, I&#x27;m on my 2nd one and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Dries in 1 min or less! No smudges at all, EVER! I have recommended this product to many friends and they all love it! Have tried many other speed dry top coats  and none even come close in comparison! Must buy!</li>
    <li> Best top coat ever. Dries in minutes with great shine. Essie are great quality products, the only polish brand I will use.</li>
    <li> Great fast drying top coat! Makes nails very shiny. Would recommend for those two purposes! You can never go wrong with Essie!</li>
    <li> With this Essie good to go - fast dry high gloss top coat, i don&#x27;t need lot of time to do my nails and this top coat is very very glossy !</li>
    <li> Dries super fast as advertised. Super high gloss shine. Goes on a little thin but dries with a thick, gel like feeling. I really love this top  coat and plan on ordering many more.</li>
    <li> This is the fastest top coat you&#x27;ll ever use! I&#x27;m serious like a minute and you&#x27;re done even with two coats of color. And it keeps your polish on longer. I keep my toe nail polish on for weeks and no chips! I only buy from amazon, you can&#x27;t beat the price and I stock up! I also reccomend this to everyone! Amazing isn&#x27;t a good enough word for this product :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who paints their nails (base coat, 2 color coats and top coat) and then all of a sudden I urgently have to go to the bathroom. Or I&#x27;m starving. Basically, I can&#x27;t stay still long enough to let me nails fully dry. Ever since buying this stuff, I haven&#x27;t smudged once. Before this stuff? Literally every time I painted my nails, at least one would smudge. LOVE. I&#x27;ve used it at least 10x now and have hardly made a dent. I usually put on a coat a couple of minutes after the last color coat and then within 5 minutes I can carefully carry on with my life and within 15 minutes I just forget that my nails were just painted and have no issues with messing up my manicure.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple products( top coats and fast drying spray all the way to using a blow dryer and dipping my nails in cold water.&lt;br /&gt;  ESSIES good to go has made painting your nails fun again! They dry within a minute and have the most beautiful shine!&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a nail product I couldn&#x27;t live without, it&#x27;s this one folks ;)</li>
    <li> I have tried many top coats (Poshe, Seche Vite, Insta-Dri, etc) and Essie&#x27;s Good to Go is undoubtedly the best of the best. Here is why I love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries FAST&lt;br /&gt;Has tons of shine&lt;br /&gt;Polish does not shrink on the sides/shrinks very little as it dries&lt;br /&gt;Works well with Zoya brand nail polishes (Good luck trying to get your Zoya&#x27;s to not peel off in sheets with Seche Vite!)&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming odor&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my polish on with minimal chipping for 7+ days&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT THICKEN CONSIDERABLY AS YOU USE THE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last note is why I am willing to spend $8 on this t/c. Other quick dry top coats thicken so much by the time you are half through with the bottle that you have to start thinning it which greatly reduces the efficacy of the product. Good to Go thickens a bit but the product is still very usable til the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried this top coat yet, I highly recommend you buy it immediately.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best nail polish buys I have made recently - it&#x27;s a MUST HAVE. It literally cuts drying time down to seconds. AND, it smooths out the polish so if you make any small mistakes this topcoat practically erases them. You must buy this if you do you own nails at home. It makes the task a breeze!</li>
    <li> I use mostly OPI polishes, but this Essie top coat is great!  Dries really fast--don&#x27;t even need to use drying drops-- and no bubbling whatsoever!</li>
    <li> this top coat works great. It dries your nails quickly and give it a nice shine. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new topcoat and found this amazing one. Dries super fast and has a good shine. Recommended to purchase.</li>
    <li> As a user of sveche was not impressed with this. Chips very fast. But on a good note the gloss makes your nails look better than just a dull regular top coat.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic top coat and goes great over Zoya (and other) polishes, but once the bottle gets down to a bit more than half way full, it gets so thick it becomes unusable.  I have read that thickening top coats is a common issue and Essie is not alone in this.  This product is super smooth and glassy and dries incredibly quickly (the latter being my favorite characteristic), and as far as shrinkage it is okay and not too bad.  But any product that is sold with you having to throw it out when it&#x27;s not even half used up, is not a good product, in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Essie Fluid-E thinner, and have used up more than half the bottle now, adding dropper-full after dropper-full into the Good To Go, and the top coat is still thick and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brush doesn&#x27;t go all the way down to the bottom and once the fluid gets to about half way down, you have to keep precariously tipping the bottle to get the brush dipped.  Wish they would tweak this.  I don&#x27;t want to think they&#x27;re trying to force customers to re-buy their product unnecessarily soon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m moving on to other top coats now, and will compare.  Those reviews to follow.</li>
    <li> Ths top coat is the fastest drying top coat I&#x27;ve ever used and it has a great shine too!  I&#x27;ve  tried a lot of top coats and this one is by far the best and the fastest drying.</li>
    <li> This top coat is the absolute best, and I&#x27;ve tried both OPI and Seche Vite or whatever it is. This one is quick-drying, shiny, and always seems to smooth over any imperfections from the nail polish. I switched to OPI briefly and quickly switched back to this.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Live love love it</li>
    <li> Anytime I can&#x27;t wait for my nails to dry i use this and it works great! Dries my nails in about 5 minutes or so instead of 20! I love everything Essie so I may be bias but it does work well : )</li>
    <li> All Essie Polishes are so amazing but this top coat makes them even better because it literally dries in like 30 seconds  (probably more like 2 minutes for hard-core dryness) which is FANTASTIC considering I have a 2 year old and I still like to reconnect with my former adorable self through home manicures. The hubby appreciates it too even though he has never actually said it but I can tell.  Now I can paint my nails more often because this top coat&#x27;s name speaks for itself- you really are &amp;#34;Good to GO!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> No shrinkage on the edges, such a quick dry. I was hesitant to try another Essie top coat since No Chips Ahead is so terrible, but I was amazingly surprised. I will keep this on hand at all times! I even smudged a nail a bit WITH top coat (before the 3 minutes it takes to dry) and with another coat it was smoothed to perfection.</li>
    <li> I love it works great and dries fast! Drying fast is very important to me because I&#x27;m always on the run.</li>
    <li> Came on time and saved me a couple of bucks from buying it in stores. It has become a staple in my nail polish collection. It dries in minutes and you can go to bed without waking up with pillow and sheet marks on your nails. You still had to be careful but not as much as you did before</li>
    <li> this is a must have for me, for the last 3 years. The nail lacquer looks so well done with this coat, I do my nails myself and people always ask me where I do them and this is one of my tips.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews...never has the amazon review section let me down so badly.  The top coat is fast-drying, I&#x27;ll give you that, but I have used it multiple times and every time I have woken up within two days of using it to find that the nail polish on one of my nails is COMPLETELY GONE! That peeling would be great if the top coat would last for more than two days, but as it is, it&#x27;s terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product if you want your manicure to last more than two days.</li>
    <li> Def cuts out the wait time when doing your nails! First time ever that my nails are dry BEFORE I knick the polish!</li>
    <li> This top coat is among the best that I have tried so far. I&#x27;m going to continue to buy it through amazon, so long as the it stays&lt;br /&gt;in the desired price range. I had very little chipping, but I take off my nail polish pretty frequently. The best thing about it&lt;br /&gt;though is the shine from it. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best top coat available right now. I have tried many top coats, such as OPI, Sally Hansen, Barry M(a UK brand), and many more. I was never satisfied with any topcoat I used. I always felt like they never really did much for me. I generally paint my nails before bed and with other top coats I was waking up in the morning with my nail polish smudged and lines through it. Even if I painted my nails during the day, I would think they were dry and then go do something and completely mess up my nails. I was sick of spending an hour waiting for my nails to dry, only for them to be messed up within minutes. I figured I need to do some research and invest in a nicer topcoat, which is when I found and bought Essie&#x27;s Good to Go. The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it dried and how shiny and thick it made my nails look. Honestly, it dried within 5 minutes. My nails are so shiny and gel-like. People have been commenting on my nails and asking me if I got a manicure or if I have \\&quot;gel\\&quot;(shellac) nails! I have used this top coat various times now. I can now do my nails right before bed and wake up and they look FLAWLESS. I can paint my nails during the day and continue doing household activities and they don&#x27;t smudge one bit. Now, I can&#x27;t really say that it keeps your nail polish from chipping for long periods of time. I do a lot of dish washing and cleaning around the house and my hands also go through a lot at my job too. I think for me this top coat lasted about a week before I saw a lot of chipping. Though with what I do to my hands I cannot expect any top coat to last through it. This topcoat is worth it for me with the drying time and gel like appearance alone. I am VERY satisfied with Essie Good to Go and I will be repurchasing this when I run out!</li>
    <li> It does what it says! Drys fairly fast, and has a very nice gloss to the polish. Love Essie products!!</li>
    <li> This product doesnt last at all and doesnt dry fast! I have purchased this previously but directly from Essie and the one i received is different from the original. Dont waste your money, i dont recommend buying this product from amazon. Just go buy it at essie site.</li>
    <li> I always used Sally Hansen top and base coats on my nails, but after reading reviews on this one I had to try it.  It&#x27;s a great product.  My nails dry faster than ever before, and they are super shiny and look great for days.  I painted my nails around 5:30 PM and they didn&#x27;t even get bed sheet marks on them when I went to bed!  I&#x27;ve gotten marks through other top coats even after painting my nails in the early morning!  Amazing product and does what it says!</li>
    <li> This top coat is what I am looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this top coat after I painted my nail with essie base coat+3 layers of essie polish.  Then I waited for no more than 20 minutes before I began to prepare dinner (peeling n slicing potatoes, wash cabbage, etc.).  To my surprise, my nail polish did not smudge or chip at all!  Later I kind of accidentally smudged two of my nails when I scratched my itchy leg.  However, here came the best part, I used my finger to stroke the two smudged nails, and press and push to make the wrinkles disappear---the result is, they just disappeared and back to gloss flattering look, as if they never smudged at all!!!  This is amazing...  I have been wearing polish with this top coat on for five days, and they did not smudge or chip a bit these days, just look like the first day I painted them.  I would recommend this top coat to anyone I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Just as another reviewer said, the packaging is different from the picture.  Mine also comes with pale orange lettering, rather than the blue ones shown in the picture...not sure if this is a newer version of the product advertised or even is another product in their \\&quot;good to go\\&quot; product line... but it works really great!</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast. It arrived earlier than expected. The nail polish was well packaged, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think I ordered the wrong essie product lol. I thought the good to go was a very thick top coat, this one has the consistency of other normal top coats. But still its a great quality product and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used once, but I like it so far.  I like to try new top coats and this seems to be up to par with some of the good ones.</li>
    <li> The top coat is much thicker than regular ones and it does not dry faster.  So nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> I love Essie products and couldn&#x27;t find this top coat in my local store, so i&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon for a slightly cheaper price. Just got it in the mail yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to do my nails! This is really a fast drying top coat. I swear I can never do my nails without ruining them right after. I either have an itch, need to go to the bathroom, bang them on something, ect. This drys super quick and my nails look perfect today! :) Definitely worth buying!!</li>
    <li> not only does this make my nails dry much faster, it also makes them look very  smooth. If I&#x27;ve messed up my nails by touching something too early, this top coat evens everything out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this gloss a few times now and it works great and dries super fast.  I haven&#x27;t experienced the &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; issue people seem to write about but mine is still pretty full so for now its great</li>
    <li> It really works, takes no time for the nails to dry.  I will continue to use this product and have suggested it to friends..</li>
    <li> This is like magic it dries so fast. Even over 3 coats of wet polish all of it set quickly. [Thanks to this I threw out the all-in-one 3 way that takes forever to dry].&lt;br /&gt;I like it as opposed to love it because while it dries quickly, it does seem to chip after 4 days [3 way would get me at least 6 days]&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone who uses Essie colors and wants to paint their nails and then get on with their life.</li>
    <li> I did a comparison between this an the Insta dry brand and Insta dry chipped after one day this lasted almost 3 days.</li>
    <li> This top coat is great!  Keeps polish looking glossy and dries super fast!  Helps prevent chipping.  Very pleased with it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried to find a long lasting, fast drying, super shine for my manicured nails.  Finally, that long search is over!  This is IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered it because I heard a lot of good things about it. It&#x27;s a good top coat but I prefer the Seche-vite one (it keeps the nail polish longer on my nails) but this one is also good for about 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terrible at keeping my nail polish looking nice without a top coat. This goes on smooth and dries fast. I rarely get bubbles unless I am going over the same nail repeatedly before the coat sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it dries very fast, it does not set very hard until after about 30 minutes for me. Otherwise, the nail polish &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; from the edge that I accidentally touch to an object. Over time, the solution does become thicker, so I avoid leaving the top open longer than it needs to be while using it. My only other complaint would be that I am unable to use all of the top coat from the bottle. The brush is a tad too short to reach more of the product at the bottom. Even tipping and dipping the brush doesn&#x27;t work well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this is a very good product overall. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This polish leaves a nice shine and if u hate waiting on your nails to dry this helps. I love it!</li>
    <li> I had been using Seche Vite (sp??) however I would feel guilty each time I used it due to the cancerous ingredient warnings. I almost exclusively use Essie nail polish so I am not quite sure what took so long for me to find this. It dries very quickly (not QUITE as quickly as the Seche top coat, but negligible difference) and dries in a way that makes your nail look nice and shiny (much like the Seche top coat). I paint my nails each Sunday and when using other top coats I have found that by a week I usually have some chips/peeling after a week, however with this I have not had that issue at all. Love this and have already recommended it to a few friends.</li>
    <li> I am a freak about having a fresh manicure with no cracks or chips or anything and with my hands being in water, a lot, due to my job I don&#x27;t really get that option. But manicures can take up to 2 hours mostly to dry, until I found this! Now all I do is paint, decorate I I want, wait two minutes with reds or blues, put on this top coat and in about 3 minutes it&#x27;s dry. And when I say dry I mean take a shower, wash your hair, fold laundry, do dishes, go to sleep and have no dents dry! I&#x27;ve tried everything including buying my own drying lamp, which still takes over 20 minutes and is a waste.. I loveeee this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat ever! It drys quickly and last for days. Better than the salon&#x27;s top coat!!</li>
    <li> This top coat works well. It may not be as fast-drying as others and could leave marks, but it sure gives a shiny look and doesn&#x27;t chip for a long time! Love it!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t go back to any other top coats, this one is by far my favorite. it&#x27;s cheaper on here than in the store and one bottle lasts me quite a long time. it makes my nail polish dry super fast and it gives a beautiful shine! they changed the packaging, but the product is still the same. the shipping was very fast and packaging was safe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the most inpatient person ever when it comes to waiting for polish to dry. Literally three minutes after using this product, I am up and running! No smudges!</li>
    <li> I love Essie products. It works perfect and it enhanced the Essie colors on my nails. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> It actually works very fast and leaves nice shiny coat! Would definitely buy again when I run out. Thanks Essie!!</li>
    <li> It actually does what it claims.  The top coat goes on very nicely, don&#x27;t leave the cap off, the shine is beautiful and lasts, and it does dry quickly...which is why you want to keep the cap on and not paint slowly.  This product is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t good at painting nails, if it takes a long time...this product may get thick on you.</li>
    <li> I am not super talented at painting my nails and if it weren&#x27;t for Good to Go!, I probably wouldn&#x27;t bother. I try to do thin coats, but often the polish goes on thicker than I intend, so I would most likely smudge things during the wait time for it to dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this product is awesome. It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries very quickly -- much, much faster than if I were to let my nails dry on their own. I use it with Essie polishes, as I find they are some of the longer-lasting ones out there. Cheaper polishes will still chip early, though this top coat might give you an extra day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to speed up the nail-painting process, which is most likely anyone who does their own nails -- you&#x27;ll be able to touch things and get stuff done within minutes of applying the Good to Go! top coat.</li>
    <li> This works great! It adds a nice shine to the polish. Dries very quick and makes the color last a long time. It&#x27;s better than most other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> it adds great shine, but my nails still chip.  depends on the polish below. it&#x27;s chipped in a day or lasted 3, so i think this isn&#x27;t the best top coat out there. i&#x27;m considering buying the Seche top coat.  i heard it&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
    <li> Good and really fast drying polish. On the thin side of polishes, applies easily and does&#x27;t get that thick over time.</li>
    <li> Dries nails fast &amp; the shine is amazing! Protects nails from chipping. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. Love this product.</li>
    <li> After reading all the good reviews i decided to purchase Essie. I don&#x27;t know if it only works with essie nail color polish or what but when applied to other manufacture nail polish it only lasted for 2 days. I think i will stick with Rock top coat nail polish, no matter what nail polish I use it last a little over a week.</li>
    <li> So it doesn&#x27;t appear to be this exact version. Mine showed up in with pale pink/orange lettering. It appears that the Essie sticker on the front is a duplicate/copy as the E is off centered and the name of polish &amp;#34;Good to go&amp;#34; is in smaller print than the original and the original does not say &amp;#34;top coat/finition&amp;#34; under the name of the polish. It still does the job, though I think there may be a slight difference between the two in quality. However, Essie&#x27;s fast dry high gloss is the best!!! So if this is a diluted version and it cost me 40% less than the original...I&#x27;m &amp;#34;Good to go!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I tend to stay with Essie products for their quality.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to polish your nails apply the Good to Go and within minutes your nails are dry.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product will recommend this to each and very women who wears nail polish. High gloss and quick dry</li>
    <li> Best top coat I ever tried. My nals have been done for a WHOLE week and that is a lot foer me. The service was excellent!</li>
    <li> This top coat dries super fast, but its not very chip resistant..oh well, guess you cant have the best of both worlds. still love not having to wait 20 minutes for my nails to dry</li>
    <li> Great for on the go lifestyle, drys quickly with a nice hard topcoat. Love it! I ran out and I have it on my list to repurchase asap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three bottles and found like another reviewer mentioned that half way through the bottle it is useless because it becomes so thick.  At that point I have to toss it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> I honestly hate getting my nails done or even doing them myself because its so hard for me to just sit still to let them dry. With this, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the drying time. I have owned lots of top coats but this is the only keeper!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s more to Essie than amusing colour names. Used this for the first time and am impressed with its durability. Have done a lot of heavy-duty housework and it hasn&#x27;t chipped at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical; you paint it on right away after your last coat of color, and somehow it dries rock hard in no time at all.  Finally....I&#x27;m no longer a prisoner waiting for my nails to dry.  The other nice quality is that it dries thick and glassy, which is something I like.  As in, it gives your nail the appearance of being thicker or plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Good To Go is a top of the line top coat it has everything one could want.  Not only is it fast, it doesn&#x27;t bubble, doesn&#x27;t yellow (especially with over exposure to UV light), and it doesn&#x27;t start to get thick like other fast drying top coats tend to do.  Compare it to lippman&#x27;s fast drying top coat they dry about the same time side by side but Essie&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t yellow and it stays smoother longer (so it sustains a longer shelf life) Lippman&#x27;s tends to get thick after awhile and it&#x27;s harder to apply.  Not to mention Lippman is more expensive.  Essie&#x27;s Good To Go never disappoints!</li>
    <li> great price and received quickly</li>
    <li> I will not buy this again. I use darker nail polish, wear gloves when cleaning and washing dishes, and was surprised to find the nail polish had chipped on 5/10 finger nails after only one day of wear unlike other top coats which last 5 days.</li>
    <li> This top coat does dry quickly. It has a nice shine to the finish as well. Happy with purchase. Would buy again. I can&#x27;t seem to find a top coat that will decrease the wear at the tips but I guess I am asking too much given I don&#x27;t have any chips for a week just wear at the nail edge. No complaints (but I am no nail polish connoisseur). It is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it does a great job at speeding up the process! Big bonus is that it adds a nice glossy shiny finish!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite and go to top coat. It goes on easy, dries quickly, and hardens fast too. There is some shrinkage if you miss the edge of the polish but the speed of dry/harden out weighs this for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to give Essie&#x27;s Good to Go top coat a try after my friend said it worked really well. I was pretty skeptical since I&#x27;m a Sephora top coat fan and have been for awhile. I&#x27;m really glad I tried this product out on a whim! This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever come across and I think it&#x27;s even cheaper than Sephora&#x27;s standard top coat and their super drying spray (which tends to leave bubbles). It&#x27;s been three days since I applied the top coat--so far no chips and the glossy finish is still intact!</li>
    <li> It dries fast and adds a decent shine, but didn&#x27;t help a lot with the peeling off, especially when you have work to do.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with my polish chipping after a few days with this top coat. The trip is to apply it after you paint your nails, to keep the polish from getting ruined while it dries. THEN, the next day, add another layer of this top coat to your nails (add a little extra to the tips of your nails, too). Two coats of this will keep you polish from chipping for a week+!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use when sealing off my nail art designs and it works great. It dries fast enough to prevent my nail art colors from bleeding and gives a nice clean glossy finish.</li>
    <li> This got thick quickly so the entire manicure peeled off in under a day.</li>
    <li> i was afraid of knockoffs but its perfect awesome color it is true to its pictre and totraly worth the money vs in store here paying 8-10 a bottle!</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat out there, hands down. I like it much better than the opi top coat. I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it makes your home manicure look salon level.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite Essie topcoat,gets tinted by base nail polish really easily, I prefer the green one</li>
    <li> This is a great and very fast drying top coat.  It&#x27;s perfect for a daily shine touch up to keep your color looking new.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a top coat could be this good after reading the reviews, but decided to give it a shot. Wow! My nails look flawless, dried super fast, and have a hard enamel glossy feel and look on top just like the salon! Really worth the money and will be a repeat customer!!</li>
    <li> super fast shipping! this really works so fast! i use this and my nails are really &amp;#34;good to go&amp;#34;! the only thing is that you still need to wait about one minute and use a good amount on the brush. when its too thin then it doesnt work so well. perfect too when i chip my nails because then i can touch it up and put this on top and it looks perfect again!</li>
    <li> Great top coat, very shiny finish and dries quickly. I tried so many top coats because I like to change my polish at home every 2-3 days. And this is by far the best one I have ever used. Helps prevent chipping as well.</li>
    <li> has changed my manicures forever. It smoothes out any smudges or mistakes, drys super fast and makes mu nails salon shiny</li>
    <li> Not great... but not bad. Great shine. It chips off easily in the first day. Wearable for about three or so days if the chipping doesn&#x27;t bother you. I think it has something to do with fast drying tops coats. I bought an NYC top coat at the store. After four hours the top coat was cracked, and my nails looked so horrible. This doesn&#x27;t do that. But the tips will chip in about a day. I&#x27;m using quality polishes also. In beauty school I became hooked on OPI product. I wanted to like this top coat so much. but this hasn&#x27;t been the greatest first impression. I&amp;#34;m going back to the OPI top coat. Dries a touch slower. But lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have a UV nail dryer and when I use this stuff it makes my nails extremely glossy and shinny. It dries fast. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This product does just as it says. Dries very quickly. Doesn&#x27;t change the color of the polish as some do. I just wish it was a bit shinier but honestly thats me being picky. Its great.</li>
    <li> Best fast drying durable top coat I have ever bought! Love it!</li>
    <li> This polish does not dry as quick as everyone says but when it does; it gives off a nice luster. I&#x27;ve received many compliments. People thought I had a gel manicure. Even if you smudge your nail, one coat of this corrects it right away. Great polish. I just wish that it dried quicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not a very picky person but I&#x27;m quite disappointed with this product. Yes, it goes on the nail nicely and dries quickly but I had this top coat peel right off the same day I put it on! Unless your a doll who sits all day, this is not for you. I would much rather recommend the Sally Hansen Insta-dri polish. Its cheaper and works better!</li>
    <li> I love Essie, so quite naturally I was excited at getting it in the mail. Only for it to be a total disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my nails plain with no nail polish underneath and the color turned yellow after it dried!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really weird so I took off all of it and applied one coat of a very light sheer Essie polish (forgot the name) and applied the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same thing happened! Nails turned yellow after it dried. Not to mention it took 30-40 minutes to dry and that was with nail dry spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with this product. Will see if I could get my money refunded.</li>
    <li> Essie good to go sucks.DONT GET IT . By the next day of using this gloss my nail polish pealed. Horrible.</li>
    <li> Love this - but I would make the bottles bigger!</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> I have bought many top coats over the years and none have ever impressed me. I have been trying to limit my professional manicures and doing a few of my own in between. Bought this because I like Essie Polish, first time I used it , it was amazing. Drys amazingly fast, but what I like the most is it dries so glossy and no smudges because of the quick drying. Will by this again and again as long as they keep making it.&lt;br /&gt;04/20/2013 continues to be the best top coat ever.&lt;br /&gt;1. dries fast&lt;br /&gt;2. great shine&lt;br /&gt;3. long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Even if you get a manicure done at the salon or spa, put a coat of this on 2 days later and you will be amazed at how much longer your manicure lasts.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple a season&#x27;s ago and it is \\&quot;Good To Go\\&quot;. I love that my polish doesn&#x27; tsmudge like some other top coats do and it&#x27;s worth the price where ever you may buy. I&#x27;m running out and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so i guess im a have to settle for Amazon. They have the best prices than straight from store bought items. I paid $7.00 + tax in store and on Amazon $5.00. Can&#x27;t beat that price</li>
    <li> Great high gloss. Essie is a great brand. Received at a good time. Definitely recommend this product to anyone who paint their nails.</li>
    <li> How did I live without this for so many years?! This top coat dries my nails in under 4 minutes, so I can do my nails and go. Word of caution for use: be careful when applying not to smudge your previously applied polish (this is a hazard I have encountered with all top coats I&#x27;ve used). I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle of this top cote. I cant say enough good about it. It last, it doesn&#x27;t chip for well over a week and it is as shiny as could be.</li>
    <li> This is the best item if you in hurry to get  out and put some on your nails in hurry and dry very fast i love it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will but not completely smudge free on artwork. the only bad thing is its odor not so good but goes away fast so not a big deal</li>
    <li> Dries rather quickly, seals ok, doesn&#x27;t clump – which are the three main reason that I bought this top coat. The only downside is that it chips rather easily, but maybe it&#x27;s because I use my nails a lot. In overall I&#x27;m okay with this product. Not the best top coat out there, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I dont even know how I painted my nails before this stuff. I LOVE IT. makes my color super shiny and dries so quickly. No more chips!!!! I will always buy again. Hard to find in the store sometimes so I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it. and its about $3 cheaper on here.</li>
    <li> I love ALL the Essie products.  Products are top quality, adequate coverage and color seems to stay true.  Great top coat.</li>
    <li> This is a great top coat to use if you are crunched for time and want your nails to dry fast. It makes your nails look shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it helps your nails not chip maybe 1 more day than a regular top coat. It&#x27;s mostly just a fast drying top coat. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for then this is it! :)</li>
    <li> It dries FAST&lt;br /&gt;Has tons of shine&lt;br /&gt;Polish does not shrink on the sides/shrinks very little as it dries&lt;br /&gt;Works well with Kleancolor brand nail polishes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many top coats (Poshe, Seche Vite, Insta-Dri, etc) and Essie&#x27;s Good to Go is undoubtedly the best of the best.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times now as a topcoat and what I like about it is that it does dry very quickly.  The very big reason i don&#x27;t like it is that it made my polish come off as soon as later that day.  Not like little chipping, but rather, it was like peel off nailpolish and I would just have a bare nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it when I need my nails dry quickly, but otherwise, I was disappointed, as I love all of my Essie products.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff, I put it on every manicure and my nails are dry and ready in minutes!  Plus, it makes them super shiny and helps the polish stay on forever!  I took my last manicure off after 10 days because I was tired of it, but there wasn&#x27;t a chip to be found.</li>
    <li> I found that this top coat is not good to wear alone,as it chips really easily,however,when used over a thick coat of any other polish it works great! I did my toes almost 3 weeks ago and the shine still hasn&#x27;t gone away. Good top coat,but the formula could be a little less chip resistant on finger nails.</li>
    <li> Essie makes the fastest drying nail polishes and they last the longest without chipping. This top coat is my favorite, it dries quick and protects the polish underneath.</li>
    <li> I love this! Even when you put 2 coats of color polish and the top coat, it still dries in seconds! I love it!</li>
    <li> I will never buy another top coat polish again! This is by far the best and fastest drying top coat out there...and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT! Buy this!</li>
    <li> It was horrible. My nail polish peeled off as of it was a stick on.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best topcoat I have ever used.  The finish is amazing and my nails never chip.  I will use no other.</li>
    <li> This is a great top coat but just make sure the other coats are try. Goes on easy and dries fast.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  Your nail polish dries very fast with a shiny appearance.  It makes home mani-pedi&#x27;s worthwhile.  Polish does not smudge.  I highly recommend this product.  Your nails will look professionally done.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I am getting so many compliments on my nails.  My polish is very shiny and HARD.  The polish feels protected.</li>
    <li> I thought it was one of those items u buy and its all bull,but dis product for busy working moms its amazing!! It dryies in an instant!!!</li>
    <li> This topcoat feels so amazing on my nails. It&#x27;s so smooth and it makes your design last a long time! It also drys super quickly, which is definitely a plus because sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to wait for my nails to dry a long time, but this polish really seals it off quickly!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Tried this when ran out of my other brand and received promptly and like the product.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> i use the protein base coat first followed by a layer of this and my nails look great! the nail polish dries fast so no sitting around waiting.</li>
    <li> This was the best buy iv ever done. It dries supper fast literally inly took 2-3 minutes</li>
    <li> I have used other top coats from good brands. This is the best so far. It drys out quickly and shiny. I think i&#x27;ll let my friends know about it and get one more before price change.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> Truly fast dry! Every Essie product is fabulous.</li>
    <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
    <li> This clear coat dries fast and goes on smoothe! I am a huge fan of Essie Nail Polish over any other and this topcoat is amazinnggg! usually I have to change nail polish every few days, I have had this same nailpolish on for a week and it hasn&#x27;t chipped! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This was so reasonably priced I added a bottle to my last order and will be getting another to have in my travel case, it dries fast,clear with a glossy smooth sheen and stunning shine . I promise you will be glad you got it to go with your Essie polish. You get what you pay for when you buy Essie, top shelf quality that you will be glad you spoiled yourself with ! 10 stars all day long!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with my nails and the high shine top coat is AMAZING. It gives u that gorgeous fresh out the salon shine and even better sets super quick. This will be repurchased.</li>
    <li> I can never wait for my nails to dry, and when I do, I always end up getting those awful bubbles for some reason. Well this thing makes my polish dry super fast, and actually gets rid of the bubbles somehow! Need more nowwww</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t bubble once applied, dries in matter of minutes and produces a perfectly glossy look. There no better top coat. Period.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase this topcoat after reading the positive reviews, but my experience has not been so positive. I have used this product several times and every time I get polish chipping and peeling a day or two later.  I do not do a lot of hard labor with my hands, just basic things. I love the &amp;#34;salon-finish&amp;#34; high gloss shine, but other than that it has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing gloss and shining! This is one of the best nail polish buys I have made recently - it&#x27;s a MUST HAVE.</li>
    <li> It really is super shiny and dry pretty fast, but it doesn&#x27;t make my polish last that long. I&#x27;m just trying this out, and obviously I&#x27;m gonna continue using my Sache Vite top coat which is better.</li>
    <li> I *LOVE* Essie nail polish and that&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ll buy - so I thought I&#x27;d stay true to the brand and get this as well... but it doesn&#x27;t really work. I mean, if you&#x27;ve never tried Seche Vite, then well maybe you think it works... but after being a steady user of the Seche Vite, nothing compares, and this just seems like it&#x27;s a top coat - it&#x27;s definitely not fast drying in comparison. So if you want a top coat, buy this. If you want your polish to dry faster than lightning and have a clear top coat that shines and lasts over a week - get Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish! This is by far the best polish I&#x27;ve purchased, and I can guarentee this will be the only top coat I ever buy again. It goes on nicely, dries incredibly fast and offers a beautiful shine! This stuff is perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Big fan of essie so I decided to try to this to see if it would leave me with less chips, not only does it prolong my manicure a few extra days, it dries in no time so that I dont have to sit around waiting for my nails to dry. Favorite product want to buy 5 more!</li>
    <li> this works great for all my nail needs, dries quickly, nice shine, happy with this product, I would purchase again,</li>
    <li> For years I have been painting my own nails and waking up with sheet marks and nails that looked a mess even though I would paint them at 2 pm and go to bed at 11 pm.  But I read all the reviews about Essie and thought I would give it a try, It was wonderful, since I did my nails at 7pm and they were dry minutes after I painted them.  But I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances so I didn&#x27;t wash dishes or do anything for 30 minutes..........This is a great product, but I use it everyother day on my painted nails since the manicure only lasts a few days if your hands are constantly in water.  But now I am using gloves to wash dishes with and it seems to be lasting almost a week.  This product is worth the money and a great time saver........</li>
    <li> Great polish!  Dries fast and goes on smooth.  I like the clear a lot better than the colors from essie.</li>
    <li> Vastly preferable to the Seche Vite, as the latter gets really gummy and difficult to apply halfway through the bottle. Essie&#x27;s is glossier and seems to wear better regardless of the polish underneath, so for me it&#x27;s well worth the extra dollar.</li>
    <li> great easy too busy too find in a store always sold out</li>
    <li> This top coat dries lightening fast, for sure. It&#x27;s great if you need a last-minute mani that only needs to last for one event. However, beware: it dries by \\&quot;shrinking\\&quot; the polish application. Not sure about you, but when I paint my nails, I pull the polish all the way to the tip of the nail and wrap around. Once you put on this top coat though, if you look closely, you&#x27;ll see the edge of your nail has no polish on it anymore. And I mean the TOP edge. It looks like you didn&#x27;t completely paint your nails. I think this is largely what causes the peeling - it breaks the seal between your nail and the polish when it shrinks, so it then allows air under the polish and, soon after, peeling. If I&#x27;m in a rush for a quick mani, I&#x27;ll use this. But that&#x27;s about it. Expect to have peeling within 24-48 hours. (And I&#x27;ve ensured, time and time again, that my nails are oil free and completely prepped for polish, AND I use a base coat -- STILL peels.)</li>
    <li> Just okay... it does go on kinda rough. It leaves lines because its to thin!!! I would try a different product!</li>
    <li> Amazing top coat! I&#x27;ve been looking forever for one that doesn&#x27;t leave my nails feeling sticky or ruined when I wake up in the morning! Dries so fast and my nails look so glossy for days!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s on par with my go-to, Seche Vite. Quick drying and high shine, but it tends to make the polish come off like a sticker. Still, I like it.</li>
    <li> Received the item fairly quick. Use it everytime I paint my nails and then I put my hands on the fan for a few seconds. It works really well because afterwards my nails are completely dry. I still try to be careful with what I touch especially since I do 2-3 coats of nail polish. Do wait 1 min or so after applying this to your nail polish because I feel like it makes the color uneven.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, and works well. Great price too. Very happy with it! Keeps my nail polish on much longer than normal.</li>
    <li> Dries my polish in a flash and leaves a great shine that makes my nails look like I came straight from the salon!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  My manis last longer and dry faster!  At first I was like,\\&quot;It&#x27;s just another top coat.\\&quot;  Little did I know, I would fall in love.  Drys faster than you can imagine and creates a bullet proof top coat shine that is to die for!  It drys straight through sopping wet polish!</li>
    <li> I have purchased a lot of products and spent countless hours in nail salons, had tips, wraps, gel manicures. I now have natural nails. I bought this product and was pleasantly surprised at how well it works! My nails look salon finished and perfect! It dries super fast, no smudges or dings in the finish. Leaves a glossy finish. LASTS for days! I did my nails four days ago and they still look perfect! Hands down best quick dry top coat I have ever used! Years ago I used Seche Vie--that only worked well on wraps on tips-not on natural nails. With this you can use regular polish and once you put the top coat on your nails dry quick and look great and it lasts. No ruined nails underneath!! In the few weeks since I have purchased it, my nails look great every day and not just a day or two after being done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/30/2013--I just ordered another bottle--this stuff is awesome. Everyone comments on my nails--thinking they were done in the salon. Just now as I was typing this a co-worker commented on how nice my nails look. Like I said before- BEST TOP COAT EVER. Super quick drying to a perfect glossy finish that looks great for nearly a full week! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fast drying top coats, out the door, cnd air dry, seche vite but I must say this has been my favorite. Cnd air dry close first as well. It gives a high shine finish and is the fastest drying that i&#x27;ve tried. Most dry the top but leave the polish underneath still wet causing smudging of the whole top polish layer to come off. My nail polish chips fast no matter what top coat I use so I can&#x27;t give a true review on its lasting power, however it lasted no less than the others so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> This has changed my nail painting experience forever. I can literally paint my nails, roll over go to sleep and they are perfect in the morning. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It is THE best top coat on the market. Not only it&#x27;s affordable, you need just a little every time so it lasts a really long time. I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year and I&#x27;ve used approximately 1/5 of it ( i change my nail color every week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s best about it is that it adds a gloss finish to your nails and they shine for at least 5 days without getting dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it&#x27;s 3-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love love love it. One thing to notice though, even though it can dry your nails in only 2 min, it&#x27;s better to allow 5 min to let the color set.</li>
    <li> It definitely is quicker to dry with this compared to a regular top coat, however, it depends on what type of nail polish your using. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use an older Essie nail polish and it&#x27;s fine all day until I sleep and I&#x27;ll wake up with it messed up!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift.  She loves it!  I would definitely buy this top coat again!  Best top coat ever and a real fast dying top coat!</li>
    <li> Love it!!.. It gives a perfect finish look to your manicure. It doesn&#x27;t get  gluppy or thick.  A must to have product.</li>
    <li> great quality top coat, keeps your nail nice and glossy for a long time, they will look beautiful for weeks without chipping</li>
    <li> I asked if this was glossy and works good on gel nails...it is neither, You have to put on at least 3 coats for gloss and with gels, it starts wearing off...don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Really dries nails quick.  Perfect for my little girl becasue she doesnt like to sit still to wait for them to dry.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It really gives off a high shine and dries within a minute or so. It wasn&#x27;t gloopy or anything like people have described before, no shrinkage or yellowing. I find that it works best with Essie polish. It has the same effect with other polishes but it chips a lot faster with other brands.</li>
    <li> Top coat fast gloss is perfect!!!!! Keeps nails glossy for days..fast delivery</li>
    <li> thank you works wonderful</li>
    <li> This is really good if you use it all fairly quickly. The brush is excellent, the consistency is great at first, and it really does dry in just a couple minutes (still, don&#x27;t press your luck). But after a few months it started to get super thick in the bottle and I had to throw away about 1/3 of it because it was coming out in long strands, the way honey does if you drizzle it from high up.</li>
    <li> Essie Nail Polish is one if the best, and now I have tried the top coat.  Essie is a brand that has built an expertise of followers. The polish us tried and true and rubs the gamut from sophisticated colors to bright flaming colors. The polish stays on without chips nor muss for at least a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last top coat polish was just not working for me. My nails would smudge and I found I was redoing my manicures. I use the Essie base cost, followed by two coats of Essie color. I am using the lilac now. I then followed with the fast drying top cost. This is just what I wanted, a top coat that was quick and easy, and one that protected my nail color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 06-24-14</li>
    <li> I have tried this top coat with Essie brand nail polishes and other brands as well, but this was disappointing since it didn&#x27;t dry fast even with 1 layer of polish. I think the polish by itself would dry faster if I don&#x27;t use this top coat. It does add a high gloss though which is why I am giving it 3 stars. I need to use my Sally Hansen insta dry drops with this top coat in order to make this dry faster. I would use up the bottle that I purchased, but wouldn&#x27;t re-purchased. China Glaze makes much better top coats than this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see that it drys as a fast as other quick drying top coats but it work OK. Much better than if you dint have anything over the top.</li>
    <li> Leaves a GREAT shine. I use it with China Glaze&#x27;s Strong Adhesion base coat. Idk if it&#x27;s this product or China Glaze, but when my nail does chip, it comes off in a huge chunk. It&#x27;s made my polish last a few days longer though.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat out there. Not only does it help your polish dry real quick but it also evens out those small imperfections we all have when painting our nails. GREATLY recommended.</li>
    <li> Great fast drying and shiny just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> All-around good product, just a little too pricey when you can buy other polish that does basically the same thing.</li>
    <li> This is great if you have problems with sheet marks or fingerprints, but it isn&#x27;t armor! If I wear shoes after using good-to-go on my toenails, they&#x27;re still gonna get smudged because the layer of solid topcoat just slides along the wet layer underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had problems with tip shrinking and zoya polishes. A quick fix is to do your tips before the surface of your nail.</li>
    <li> Dry fast but still, my nails dropped like two days later.</li>
    <li> Makes nails look like gel finish and dries fast!! :)</li>
    <li> Works like you wouldn&#x27;t even believe! This will be the only brand i purchase!</li>
    <li> I was using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat before I found this. The Seche Vite gave me a migraine because of the strong smell, I decided to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found the Essie Good To Go! and I&#x27;m in love. My nail had one tiny chip after a week of paint and the odor wasn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works!!! I have such a hard time keeping my nails safe while drying yet within 15 minutes of applying this to my nails they are dry. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many quick dry too coats and this is the best! ... give yourself 10 minutes and you are good to go...I keep it in the refrigerator and it lasts forever! Beware tho....if you apply a second coat of this it may want to peel off a little. If it does get a little thick as you use it just add a drop or two of acetone and it&#x27;s like new again. The best rapid dry top coat on the market...highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Several months ago I decided to try to find something that would help my nails dry faster. I looked at Good To Go, but ultimately decided to try the Quick-E drops. Those were okay, but not really what I was hoping for. Recently I ran across a deal in a store where I could try Good To Go for free with other purchase - can&#x27;t turn that down. I use a lot of polish coats - base, two color coats, gel coat, and then top coat. This product enabled me to go about life in about 5 minutes. I am astounded! And the shine is perfect. Sooo glad I ran across this. And even if it does end up thickening halfway through the bottle as others have said, it will still be worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I paint my nails 2-3 times a week, and need them to dry as fast as possible.  This clear coat dried quickly and evens out any imperfections of the nail color underneath.  It wears well and the bottle lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I used this to top my friends nail art that I did, and she was able to wear it for about 5 days with some chipping.  It did smear the nail art a little but nothing as bad as the others I&#x27;ve tried.  It does dry quickly, and smooths out imperfections in regular colored polish.</li>
    <li> This top coat dries extremely quickly, pair is with an essie base and color and your ready to rock your nail wear!</li>
    <li> This top coat really does make my polish dry super fast! I don&#x27;t know how they do it...but it doesn&#x27;t just dry the top layer but all the layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, when you put several coats of polish on, it dries very slowly. And even when it&#x27;s \\&quot;dry\\&quot;, it&#x27;s still vulnerable to being messed up. But this dries my polish like it&#x27;s been drying for several hours - but in just a couple minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of skeptical at first but man, this is the stuff. How will I ever go back to a different top coat? I won&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> this dries very quickly and imparts a nice shine.  The finish is not as hard as I would like, but otherwise very good.</li>
    <li> I have come to really appreciate the quality of Essie&lt;br /&gt;nail products. This fast drying top coat really works!&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and leaves a nice glossy shine.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like Essie&#x27;s polish a lot, but like the other seller said it literally chipped off the next morning! This happened every time I&#x27;ve used it, which is maybe 3-4 times. I did my nails the night before and woke up to them chipping off in chunks. Maybe we got an old bottle from this seller? Guess I will have to try another brand, won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, this top coat dries quickly and keeps your nails chip-free for at least a week. I&#x27;ve used it on my fingers and toes and it really locks in the color. So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten goopy like other top coats (eg: OPI) have in the past. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like Essie Good to Go! I have used it on Zoya and Essie polishes with great success -- my manicure is dry very quickly. I can use my hands freely much faster than the other top coat I was using (Zoya Armor, which to be fair, is not a quick-drying top coat).</li>
    <li> Liked it a lot.  Would buy it again</li>
    <li> YEAH SOMETHING FOR ME</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Essie Good To Go top coat!! It does exactly what it says!! I was impressed, it dries nails instantly, and leaves your nails with a thick high glossy shine! I definitely recommend this product to everyone&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this product and its true to its name. After a half hour of drying i am good to go! High recommend! And leaves your nails glossy and shiny!</li>
    <li> I really like this fast dry top coat and it holds up longer than other brands. This was the best price I found after checking it out in local stores.</li>
    <li> Very good, dry very fast and the nail polish fix for a long time</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have always had problems getting my nail polish dry in a reasonable amount of time. I&#x27;ve tried other fast dry products, especially the oily ones, and have found them lacking. I don&#x27;t like the oily mess and they really don&#x27;t dry the polish. I finally got into the habit of doing my manicures last thing in the evening, then letting them dry for awhile before going to bed. Then they could harden overnight. That worked until I woke up one morning with my thumb nail stuck to my forehead! About a year ago I fell in love with Essie nail polish. Then I happened to see this product. It does what it says it does. Not many things do. I apply two coats of polish and let the second coat dry for a few minutes. Then I apply Good to Go, wait a few minutes, and I am literally good to go. My polish is dry and solid. I also have a nice shine. I love it!</li>
    <li> My nails literally dried in second and they are super shiny! Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong  as the seche vite but still gets the job done. Holy grail</li>
    <li> I always have a problem with my polish drying, just when I would think its good to go I would bump my nail and ruin it.  After reading the review on Essie Good To Go! I decided to give it a chance and WOW I&#x27;m glad I did!  I can now paint my nails and be back to life in 10 minutes.  This is by far the BEST top coat I have ever had!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep the manicure chip free for as long as other Essie topcoats, but like the product advertises, nails are dry to the touch almost instantly.</li>
    <li> Must have for fast drying nails</li>
    <li> A beautiful, high gloss clear coat that dries super fast. Feels and looks almost like gel. Doesn&#x27;t last exceptionally longer than anything else I&#x27;ve used but that&#x27;s not a huge problem for me.</li>
    <li> My favorite quick dry nail polish ever. It leaves a great shine and dries it extremely fast. I&#x27;ve taken it with me to the nail salon a few blocks away from where I live after they apply it, I don&#x27;t even stay to let them dry at all. I walk out and by the time I reach my house (approx. 3-4 minute walk) my nails are completely dry.  I always use this for my top coat.  I have three kids and anyone who has kids knows you don&#x27;t even get 5mintues to sit still. So I need something that dries super fast. So I can do what I need without worrying about my nails messing up. Its worth every penny! Every person needs to have this</li>
    <li> it drys faster that other top coats....really nice! i use it now (when i&#x27;m at work and need it to dry fast) hahaha.</li>
    <li> A minute is all you need for your nail color to dry. No other top coat sticks to its promise as this on. Try it to believe it.</li>
