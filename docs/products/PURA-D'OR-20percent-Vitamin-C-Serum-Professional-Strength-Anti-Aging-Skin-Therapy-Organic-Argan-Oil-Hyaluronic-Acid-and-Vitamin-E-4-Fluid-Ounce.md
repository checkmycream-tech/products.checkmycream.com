<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this after using other Pura d&#x27;or products, and like their other products, it lives up to is claims.  This feels good on the skin, is non-oily, dries quickly, and has a noticeable tightening and smoothing effect.  I have also noticed blemishes and flaws clearing and smoothing the more I use it.  I like the fact that its Doctor tested and used organic ingredients and little goes a long way.  It has a pleasant, light citrus fragrance, which attests to its high vitamin C content.  If you are looking for a high quality, reasonably priced anti-aging serum, this is a excellent alternative.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! I used this oil only for my hair,  but I started to use it for my face . So far, I am very pleased with product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always spent a lot of money on skin care, and I thought I was doing everything I should do for my face until trying this Pura d&#x27;or C Serum. After reading an article about how Leonardo DiCaprio, who can have whatever he wants and looks gorgeous, has all the running water in his house infused with vitamin C, I decided there must be something to it. The difference it makes in my skin is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for only a week now, applying it to my face, neck, and chest in the morning and at night, and my skin is clearer and brighter, more luminous. I had some redness on my chest, and it&#x27;s faded. It also seems to tighten and lift. I love this stuff, and I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this for both my face and legs. I have some deep dark discoloration from bad insect bites that I itched internally. I&#x27;ll talk about my face- I use this roughly everyday and I also derma roll twice a week. Beware after derma rolling and putting this on my face- my face was red and it BURNS. Luckily it last less than a minute but it is highly uncomfortable right when you put it on. Good news is it works my acne scars on my face are almost gone with only a couple weeks of using. I use to also to even out my skin as I am anemic so some parts of my face are slightly lighter than others. As for my legs I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference but the scars are also wayyy older. So i gave it four stars because I am still awaiting the results and when I do I&#x27;ll put a before and after. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product is so silky and leaves skin feeling hydrated.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> A lot of the skincare products I use can be really messy. The pump head that this product has is not only very easy to use, but it also eliminates the mess that a lot of the products that I use before left behind. The serum itself is also very clean, and doesn&#x27;t gunk up the handle.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a week but I can see a difference already. My fine lines look smoother. Also my skin is so soft. There is alittle tingling when first applied but it goes away quickly. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple skin creams to help me take care of my dry skin. Skin creams are thicker than this product, and can sometimes be difficult to get on your skin to where they are “just right.” This serum is easier to use than those creams, and I don&#x27;t have any problem getting it spread on my skin the way I want it to be. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin--it moisturizes while healing skin and smoothing out fine lines over time. One aspect I would change about this product is its applicator. Because the serum is thin and watery, it drips down the bottle after every use, and forms an orange crust around the applicator (due to its acidity). Aside from that, 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Still on my first bottle, but noticed a difference right away. Skin looks and feels tighter, and my wife noticed that the dark circles under my eyes are much less dark than they used to be. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I noticed a difference almost immediately with the feel of my skin.  I wanted to give it 5 stars but I was disappointed with the extremely tiny type on the bottle.  It would help if you added a tag around the neck of the bottle with decent size type so a person can read the instructions. When we purchase a product we have never heard of or used before we would like to be able to read the directions.  I had to use a magnifier and my glasses and still was unable to make out the ingredients or directions.  Some companies that I order products from enclosed a little card with all that information on it in readable type.  I am 65 years old and it is a real strain trying to read the label.  Other than that I like the product.  I still don&#x27;t know how  often to use it because I am unable to read the label.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or Vitamin C serum for a month now and I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. The serum is sticky and dries the face out while leaving a white film. This serum is not moisturizing and leaves a tight feeling on the face and for that reason cannot be worn alone. However other products cannot be layered on top as the serum just crumbles and that&#x27;s a problem as I&#x27;m unable to wear this serum under a sunscreen as I intended to.  I contacted the seller for the money back guarantee and I was told that I had to contact the manufacturer instead. So don&#x27;t believe this: &amp;#34;100-Day complete satisfaction guarantee or your full refund. No questions asked.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s simply not true. This product has done nothing at all for my face and it&#x27;s a waste of money. On the bottle there&#x27;s a sticker which reads that you get a free bottle if you submit a review. This is for US residents only. So that could maybe explain so many excellent reviews?</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle by Pura d&#x27;or. I love the way my skin feels and it is packed with great ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It has reduced fine lines and balanced the color of my skin.  I have received many compliments.  I have to say it does burn for about five minutes after putting it on, but is more than work it.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use 2 times every day. When possible I will always reorder.</li>
    <li> I work out in the sun a lot, so sunspots are a big problem for me. I was talking to my daughter the other day, and she recommended this product for me to help me take care of my sunspots. A few weeks after I started using this product, my sunspots were almost gone. I use this product almost all the time now, and since that time, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with sunspots! This is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Watery consistency makes it easy to apply. It is non sticky and gets absorbed by the skin in no time. Doesn’t break me out, which is great.  The serum smells funny, but the smell  goes away in seconds so it is not an issue. It leaves  fresh feeling on the skin.  The bottle is very practical and the pump makes it easy to use without wasting the product. Overall great product and what is very important to me it is organic and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many remedies for aging skin that did nothing.  I cannot begin to count up all the money I have blown on products that were supposed to be natural solutions.  I almost did not order this because I thought I would just get ripped off again.  But my skin is so dry and rough from the summer sun, I had to try again.  It felt great going on my skin and within a short time, I made a big difference.  I will never use anything else again.</li>
    <li> Igot this vitamin 3 days ago I sow my face very bright from the first use i love the lime smell I hop evry one  get it  love it</li>
    <li> I am new to Pura D&#x27;or products. I have been using Vitamin C serums for a few years. I was interested in trying this new brand. First let me say I was surprised at the size of the bottle, twice the usual size. I did feel a slight tingle when I first applied it, I feel this is a good sign it is potent enough. I also purchased the Argan oil from the same company, adding some essential oils to it. Using these two products my face is so soft and smooth. I had few wrinkles to smooth out. I can say I will continue to use these products. The only thing they could change is the quality of the pumper/ sprayer. It is hard to control the amount you want to spray out. I think I will transfer this to another bottle (dark). I would also suggest people using Matrixyl 3000 serum and retinA. Always use a sunscreen too.</li>
    <li> It may be a little bit too soon to say, but I think I&#x27;m falling in love with this product. After I started using it, the redness in my skin has all but gone away. I had little hairline wrinkles on my face, but I don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;ve gone, because this product has made them disappear. I have very smooth skin, and the color that I had to my skin in my youth has come back! I am just appalled at how well this product works! I have suggested this product to my coworkers, and they are falling in love with it too!</li>
    <li> I had so many skin problems that it was hard to believe! I had dry skin, hairline wrinkles, red skin, you name it, I had the problem. This product cleared up all of those problems, and left my skin feeling smooth and strong. I am a long-time user of this product and I don&#x27;t see myself giving it up anytime soon.</li>
    <li> One of the biggest problems that I used to have is rosacea. My skin would get really read, and no amount of makeup I put on would help me cover it up. My doctor suggested vitamin C serum to me. So I bought this product and gave it a shot. Boy am I glad I did! After using this product for a while, you can even tell that I ever had rosacea. This stuff is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Pura d’ Or makes a vitamin C serum with a very strong formula! My skin is smoother than it is ever been, and it has actually increased elasticity of my skin! I feel like a beauty queen when I used this product, and trust me when I say, my beauty queen days are long gone. I recommend this product to anyone who wants very strong and supple skin!</li>
    <li> honestly one of the best products i have ever tried, multi-use. leaves skin soft and smooth. i use it as a daily moisturizer and i love it. its perfect for my dry skin, looking forward to buy more.</li>
    <li> I used this product to hydrate my skin, and it works better than anything else that I used pickup at the store. I am just over the moon at how well this product works. I wish that I had known about it sooner. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Jury is still out with this. The first bottle I received leaked during shipping so I returned it for another. My second bottle did not leak during shipping, but when I pick it up if it tips at all it leaks out the side. Also, it has a not so pleasant odor. I am going to try a third bottle. Third time is a charm, afterall. I have used it the past couple of days, and despite the scent I like the way it applies and feels. It is a little more watery than I expected.  I was expecting more of a thicker liquid.It is also slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.  That being said I apply the Pura d&#x27;or Argon oil over this and the two together seem to be a great fit. My skin feels soft and well moisturized. I look forward to getting a bottle that does not leak and hopefully has a better odor. Even if the scent is not as pleasant as I would like, I will continue to use it because I do love the way my face feels after applying.</li>
    <li> I just started using it but so far I am happy.  It has a nice pleasant scent, slight tingling when first applied but not unpleasant.  I follow up with straight Argan Oil as my moisturizer which immediately counters any stickiness,dryness or burning others have mentioned.  So far I am happy.  I will check back later with further results. FYI:  I have been using the pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for nearly a year now and I have been happy with that so I was anxious to try this as well.</li>
    <li> This serum goes on pretty smooth and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I received this serum about 10 days ago and have been using it faithfully once a day ever since.  I honestly see a difference in the overall appearance of my skin on the tops of my hands and face. My skin looks better overall with an evening of skin tone and the firmness of my skin. I have tried several moisturizers/serums in the past but not with these results. This is one of the few products I definitely plan to recommend and continue using.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried! I have really sensitive skin and does not irritate my skin, but leaves it softs and dewey! My pores are getting smaller and my skin overall is clearer and brighter. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few vitamin C serums and I think this one is one of the best. It leaves my face very soft.  It&#x27;s very light and not oily. My husband and I have seen great results so far with this serum.  We use it daily under our moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Almost immediately saw a difference.  Only suggestion would be to change bottle dispensing design - comes out of pump too fast, too much.  Have used excess dispensed on hands, which is quickly getting rid of my &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; hands.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I had heard about the benefits of Vitamin C serum so I thought I would give it a try. I could tell a difference in the first couple of days. My skin looks younger, softer, and has a youthful appearance. Compared to the prices I have seen on other products that claim to have similar benefits, this is a true bargain. I will be buying again....</li>
    <li> Using this product makes me feel like I have the smooth the skin in the county! Nothing that I have ever used for my dry skin has worked so well! It is so wonderful to have smooth and supple skin. I love this product. Nothing comes close to it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a second bottle and it&#x27;s time to write a review.  The first bottle I had was good. it was hard to squirt onto my palm and the liquid was kind of hard to spread over my face for some reason.  Nothing big improvement yet.  I thought it was good and wasn&#x27;t sure if i wanted to order again.  I&#x27;m glad I did!!  They improved the spray pump and added something to this product.  I don&#x27;t know what it was but it&#x27;s a lot easier to put on my face.  Yes it&#x27;s a little sticky but it&#x27;ll go away once it gets dry.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3-4 months now and I DO see a big improvement  :) I look healthier and younger!  :D  It&#x27;s well spent for 4oz!</li>
    <li> I love Pura d&#x27;or products! My favorite is the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil. The Pura d&#x27;or 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Vitamin E, Super Anti-Oxidants, is not my favorite, though. It has a watery consistency and has an unusual smell to it. I tend to use it on my hands and not my face because of the consistency, unusual odor, and it leaves a slightly sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I had a facial peel two years ago for my acne scars.  It went bad.  It made them worse and very red.  I have tried every remedy there is, natural and otherwise.  Finally I have found a product that works.  My scars are not near as bad and are not red either.</li>
    <li> Anti-oxidants are scientifically proven to repair damaged aging skin and to protect from further damage.  I have used anti-oxidant formulas on my face for about a decade now.  I tried this one not too long ago and can see what an exceptional product it is already.  There are several anti-oxidant rich ingredients in this combination so that accounts for how powerful it is but it is gentle and moisturizing as well.</li>
    <li> The formula that this product is made from must be made for miracles! Because, that is what this vitamin C serum has done with my skin. I look younger, I feel fresher, and I have not had any problems with sunburns, since I&#x27;ve started using this serum. This product has gotten me to believe in miracles!</li>
    <li> Easily the best on the market! My skin is radiant and beautiful because of this product! I love it so much! Thank you Pura d&#x27; Or, you made my skin lovely! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how well this product worked! The redness and wrinkles on my face have diminished significantly since I started using it! I really love this product and I know I will get more once this bottle I have runs out!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27; Or has made a vitamin C serum has given me beautiful, vibrant, silky smooth skin. I have been using this product for about three months, and I don&#x27;t think that I have ever been had smoother skin in my life. This product is so amazing!  I love it! Five stars! Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use beauty products.but when i noticed that my face is always oily i asked my sister who is expert of trying new and different beauty products and she said try using this Pura d&#x27;or Vitamin C Serum and just apply a small amount. so i started using this product and after 2 weeks i see a difference, my face is not that oily anymore. so for me it is a very helpful and good product</li>
    <li> I used this product for two years.. make sure to cleanse and apply toner to your face before applying it for better result. this product make my skin rejuvenated even though mostly I didn&#x27;t have enough sleep and leaves my skin soft, This is a Pretty Cool Product for me!</li>
    <li> On my second bottle.  My skin has changed and become more youthful.  I am 50 this year and I don&#x27;t look it.</li>
    <li> Body: This is a nice facial care vitamin c product. I like it a lot and is reasonably priced</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin C Serum!  I am woman in my early sixities and I have tried many products to help with age spots and wrinkles.  Nothing has worked except this stuff and it is all natural!</li>
    <li> I have not seen my spots disappear but I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician,  so I&#x27;ve tryed just about every type of this product on the market. It&#x27;s not like argon oil, in fact it&#x27;s not oily at all. It&#x27;s like water. But I think (going used it for a week) I can see improvement in my dark spot. You will still need argon oil or moisturize. I would recommend this product to my friends. I only gave 4 stars because was expecting more of an argon oil base.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month and a half ago.  I was finding hat I had become very sensitive to many products on the market and had started using coconut oil to moisturize instead.  Good stuff but a bit on the greasy side.  I decided to give this a product a try based on the great reviews and hearing how great many of the ingredients are for the skin.  Excellent moisturizer without being greasy, no break outs, improved skin firmness and radiance.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Contains phenoxyethanol a somewhat harsh chemical preservative! My face is red and stinging after applying one time. Disappointed that it&#x27;s another chemically laden product :(</li>
    <li> I do LOVE Pura D&#x27;Or 20% Vitamin C Serum! I have probably purchased about 10 bottles thru the past year. I use it in the morning and evening, I have noticed a tremendous change in my complexion! It is a great product! However, it always seems to be a different consistency every time I start a new bottle. The smell and texture is always different! They changed the style of the dropper. Now they have new packaging. It use to arrive in a blue bottle with a different label (gold) now it is a brown bottle with a bronze label. It is now a clear color with no scent it use to have a cooling feel when applied and was more of a yellow color with a citrus smell. I have asked for a replacement on my last bottle received, I am curious to see how it will turn out. Still think it is a great product I am just a bit curious if they have changed the formula and the amount of each ingredient. I would recommend it in the past let&#x27;s see if their complete change up in the product changes my mind. I will so disappointed if it has changed for the worst.......</li>
    <li> Very soothing on my face. I used a depilatory on my upper lip area it burned and made my skin peel. I used this Pura d&#x27;or product on my upper lip area and face, it immediately stopped the burning and peeling. August 2015: I use Pura d&#x27;or  20% vitamin C everyday: Product goes on a little sticky, but is instantly smooth and soft. I like the 4 oz. bottle and will order more when it&#x27;s gone.ORDER # 103-0245033-5209879 Feb. 9, 2015</li>
    <li> Great product! The skin feels  so smooth !</li>
    <li> Is this for real? Water does a better job!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum.Each 4oz. bottle lasts a long time, even with 2x daily use. I am almost 60 years old and have noticed a vast improvement in the clarity of my skin with extended use of this product. This is my 3rd bottle, and have been using for the past year. Improvement noticed early on in fine lines, firmness, and age spots. After applying to my face and neck,prior to applying moisturizer, I apply whats left on my hands to the TOP of my hands and all my age spots have faded there as well. Especially love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and cruelty-free. Will continue to purchase this product</li>
    <li> Just after a few days using the product, noticed a difference in clarity.</li>
    <li> Actually feel a tingle from serum that tells me it working. Dries Quickly and can feel it tightening after application..and most of all A nice large amount of serum for the price</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> This product has a very powerful formulas to stop anti-aging. I have been using this vitamin C serum for about three months, and I am noticing an improvement in my age lines. If you are having problems with your age lines as well, this is a wonderful product for you.</li>
    <li> While I just received this Serum today....I can already tell that it is a product I am going to be happy with.  The bottle and its label....along with the nice pouch to hold it in...are all very nice!  I have previously ordered two other brands of this sort of product and I can tell this is a better product just by one single use.  I have read about customers who complain that this product (no matter the brand) can feel sticky when used.....I did not see that this product was any different during application other than it did have a nice scent to it....the application was what I expected.  The idea of it being sticky is a little bit of a stretch for me.  While it does have a different feel to it...different than a lotion or moisturizer might after application....it definitely is not sticky or offensive in any way.  I feel that this product feels just like any other sort of &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; product....whether its this one....or a retail store&#x27;s brand of serum....the dried or absorbed product feels just like any other similar product would.  I am happy with this product, the size it much bigger than the others offered and yet has the same price!  I plan to order more products from this company because I felt confident it was made with care and the packaging was done so nicely.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve compared this product to many other skin care products in the past, including other vitamin C serums. Of everything that I&#x27;ve tried, this is got to be the ABSOLUTE BEST EVER product that I&#x27;ve ever tried. It hydrates my skin and takes care of the spotty patches of skin that I have. Ever since I have started using this product, I have not had any problem with red skin, and sunburns are a thing of the past for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I decided to give this product a try. This is my second bottle, and I foresee myself getting a third in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent! When I use it my face feels really soft after, it is a good combination to use together with Argan oil from Pura Dor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was checking on this company to write my happy review I was surprise to see that they have the same products that I have bought before and they are on top of my list, I honestly was a bit shock as I didn&#x27;t realize before that I was using several excellent products from the same company. I didn&#x27;t know that Pura D&#x27;or was the same company as Pura Cora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the wonderful products, my hair and skin love your products and I will keep buying them. Keep quality first as you do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the following products:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pura D’or Pure and Organic Argan Oil, Brown and Gold, 4 Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;2. Vida Cora Phytoceramides Professional Strength with Antioxidants and Multi-Vitamins 120 Capsules&lt;br /&gt;3. Pura d’or: Premium Organic Conditioner (16 fl. oz.)&lt;br /&gt;4. Pura d’or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue&lt;br /&gt;5. Pura d’or 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Vitamin E, Super Anti-Oxidants, Argan Oil &amp; Aloe Vera –</li>
    <li> excellent serum,&lt;br /&gt;My favorite face serum. It&#x27;s made with simple, natural ingredients.vitamin E, and plenty of antioxidants. It&#x27;s also completely organic and that is what i Like the best. It has been very effective at making my skin smoother I always recommend it to my family and everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I order the anti-aging cream, can&#x27;t wait to start using.</li>
    <li> Because of my letter skin, I had a really, really, really bad time with sunspots. They would show up on my face, arms, and neck like a big, ugly, brown beacon, and they were very troublesome. I used to undertake very expensive treatments to take care of them.&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I am not only able to treat my sunspots, but prevent them as well. I have saved a lot of money on skincare treatments, so much so, that I am able to spend that money on more interesting things, like trips to the spa.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27; Or vitamin C serum is made with ingredients that are proven to improve your skin, and have anti-aging effects. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months, and I can vouch for these claims. My skin has become softer, firmer, and my wrinkles are not as prominent as they were before. I can only imagine how much more progress I will have in the months to come. This is a great product and you would be crazy to pass it up if you are in need of the skincare supplement.</li>
    <li> nice serum.  hard to judge long term effect after using it for two days.  its a bit sticky when applied</li>
    <li> I work for a dermatologist and I learned from my boss that Vitamin C when mixed with aloe vera is an excellent skin remedy, so I bought the product. The package arrived on time. It was neatly wrapped and I was amazed at the consistency of the serum. I had expected it to be oily but it was rather smooth and not greasy at all. When I applied on my face, I felt a tiny bit of tingling sensation which I know for a fact is a natural reaction of aloe vera and vitamin C so I wasn&#x27;t worried. It was night time, right before I went to bed when I applied it on my face. I always make sure that I put on a toner and cleanser before I applied the serum.  To my amazement, I woke getting the softest skin I had ever had. Now, I know that I have the right skin product in my hands.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different facial products. Love that this one has given my dulling 60-something skin a brighter look, diminishing age spots, minimizing lines above my lip. Also great on the neck and décolletage. Hubby uses it as well and no longer has problem with oily flaky skin on forehead and nose. A bit less expensive than other products with all of the same ingredients. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best serums out there and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful for toning. I use it morning and night usually immediately before I apply my organic moisturizer. When I don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s noticable difference. The creases across my forehead have almost disappeared and the lines and creases around my eyes are improving too.</li>
    <li> great product for skin,makes it smooth and bright</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Get Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum if you have a problem with wrinkles. I started having problems with wrinkles a young age, and tried to use many things to get it under control. After I started using this stuff, I noticed an improvement in my wrinkle problem. This product has worked well for me and it will work well for anyone who has any kind of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I just got it 5 days ago. Seems like working. I feel tightening effect after using it. More liquid that I expected.</li>
    <li> First I would like to talk about the customer service. I give it five stars. I emailed them some questions I had about the Vitamin C Serum and whiten hours received a answer. So that was a major plus for me to go ahead and place my order. I had been using another brand at the same price and it only was one ounce.The shipping was so quick. Another five star for that. It was packed well for shipping. Now for the product itself I am a happy customer.It goes on better then the Vitamin C I was using. I like the pump on the bottle. It will keep the product fresh longer in my opinion. My skin looks brighter after using the Vitamin C Serum.I will continue to buy again. It meets all my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is see zero works very well with my moisturizer. Together they do excellent things for my skin. I have added this product to my morning beauty routine, and it has had great results. I really love it. Super!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  She has used other Pura d&#x27;or products and this, like them is excellent.  She is very picky about what she uses on her hair and skin and all the Pura d&#x27;or products meet her high standards and do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum has made my wrinkles evaporate into nothingness. Over the year that I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have seen my skin go from having many hairline wrinkles, to being as smooth as it was when I was a teenager. I love this stuff and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different skin treatments in the past. Some of them were inexpensive, some more so, but none of them have worked as well as this one has. This product has made my skin moist, and fixed the spotty skin problems that I used to have. My skin coloration is a monster that was slain by this powerful product, and whenever I get a sunspot, this clears it up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where I would be without this great serum. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> So far the product seems to feel good on my face...it will take some usage time to determine if it has any longer term positive impact.</li>
    <li> This serum has really improved the tone of my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and can tell a difference in the discoloration from acne and sun damage.  I don&#x27;t really have much in the way of wrinkles so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but I imagine if it&#x27;s strong enough to change the tone of my skin then it would have to also have an impact on wrinkles. I will definitely be buying this again because it works and is a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I am a bartender and I have acne. My dad also has acne, so I guess it runs in our family However in my case, I am more prone to acne because of my job. I work late at night and the shift puts a lot of stress on my skin. I used to have severe acne so when my girlfriend gave me this serum, I was skeptic and I did not even open it. However, my girlfriend showed me the reviews and I read that it was good for acne, so I decided to try it. Now, after 2 weeks, the redness on my face due to the large zits has disappeared and my acne scars are less visible. I have smaller pores and my face is no longer oily, which is a great improvement. I plan to use this for the next months or so because I am quite satisfied with the results!</li>
    <li> Just so you know, this product DOES Not contain argan oil. I made the mistake of thinking it did and rubbed it all over my arms and legs when I first received it and I was a sticky mess afterwards. That being said, it was my fault, I really should have looked over the ingredients better. I have bought this brand of argan oil before and LOVED it, so I decided to start using this serum on my face and neck. So far it seems pretty good- I have been using it about a week and my complexion does seem a little bit brighter and fresher looking. It makes an excellent primer- it&#x27;s helping my makeup stay on all day. I also ordered the regular argan oil as soon as I realized my mistake, so now I have both!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Pura D&#x27;Ora Vitamin C Serum after it was recommended on a beauty vlog.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the serum and it arrived in record time!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use the product for a little while before posting a review so that I could provide an honest and accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY dry skin and, to make matters worse, I live in a very dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the serum immediately after washing my face and no longer need creams that clog my pores and cause breakouts. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and, unfortunately, STILL break out. Fortunately this serum hasn&#x27;t caused any new breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;My skin actually looks and feels so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I apply the serum to my face and neck and my pores appear smaller and my skin seems smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this serum again and again.&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight scent but it&#x27;s not bad or overwhelming and disappears right away. It&#x27;s not greasy in the slightest and creates a slight tingle to my skin which also disappears pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this serum and for the price, you can&#x27;t afford not to give it a shot!</li>
    <li> This is truly a phenomenal product. After using it for only a couple of days, I noticed that my skin was smoother, softer, with a more even tone. By the end of the first week, fine lines and wrinkles began to smooth away. The price is reasonable given the fact that it works so well. It is not nearly as expensive as it could be, if the price were based on product results. It is light and my skin absorbs it well. without an after effect of heaviness, or clogging of pores. I am adding this product to my list of &amp;#34;skincare products that REALLY work&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student and i&#x27;m always exposed to the sun resulting for a damaged and dry skin. i instantly see result after after applying this,. my face is silky smooth. been using this for over two weeks now and my skin is well hydrated now. i&#x27;m really impressed with this product and i think that the price is just right for what it does to your skin..</li>
    <li> I honestly did not believe this would help with my dark spots and dry skin, but after a week of use, I am a TRUE BELIEVER!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I tried the &amp;#34;Perricone MD&amp;#34; line for a couple months, and it had a damaging effect on my skin. I used the &amp;#34;Jack Black&amp;#34; line for a few months to no real effect.  I ride a motorcycle, so my face and skin feel all of the elements. I have now been using the &amp;#34;pura d&#x27;or Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34; along with &amp;#34;pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Oil,&amp;#34; for a few weeks and have experienced incredible new firm, supple skin growth. My skin feels new, and looks like it too...I have been receiving very kind compliments from friends and family. I will be using this product indefinitely, and have been recommending it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I liked how  the serum softens my skin. It is not greasy and it does not leave any residue on the skin. It soaks it nicely and quickly. After 4 hours, I can still feel the softness and see a nice glow to my skin. The only issue is that I need to order a larger bottle because it soaks in so much and I find I use quite a bit for each application.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get a good serum. I have very dry skin. I have only been using this product for a few days and I notice a difference in the lines on my forehead and on the edges of my eyes have decreased. My face has a glow to it now. I use this serum before my moisturizer morning and night. I am so excited with the results.</li>
    <li> I love thiis product! You can feel it working everyday.</li>
    <li> When I put this on before bed my face looks smooth and wrinkle-free in the morning.  Nights I don&#x27;t use it, I notice the difference.  I can&#x27;t say what the long-term effect would be, since I alternate it with other products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have found my hyperpigmentation is lightening and my skin feels smoother. I will continue use this product. It is good quality and the price is great, especially considering you get 4 oz. Thanks</li>
    <li> So I have been using this product for about a month now and I must say I do like it. Had been looking for a high % vitamin C serum and decided go with Puro d&#x27;or as I use their shampoos and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice part about this product is that it also contains hyaluronic acid which moisturizes the skin. Sometimes I dont need to wear moisturizer as this serum is enough!</li>
    <li> The bottle size is over 3oz which makes this an incredible value compared to most other C serums.  It goes on smooth and for me I only need one pump to cover my entire face.  Results seem typical for a C serum</li>
    <li> I just bought this product for my face and I love the way it smells!!! Yes it&#x27;s kind of a weird smell but I like it somehow. It&#x27;s a water like product with some foam and it goes dry on your face, not oily at all and very fresh. It&#x27;s very good. It&#x27;s too soon to see results but it does leave my face feeling very refreshed. I recommended highly because it&#x27;s an automatic difference to your face.</li>
    <li> I do really like this but my skin is alil sensitive right now and I&#x27;ve had to back off. The absorbic acid tends to burn the skin alil bit. If you have sensitive skin this is not for you. Otherwise good stuff</li>
    <li> Is light, not oily, and absorbs almost instantly. Could be used in conjunction. Does seem to result in a healthier looking skin.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second bottle.  This is the most amazing product.  My skin glows.  My husband looked at me recently, after many years of marriage, and stated you have the most amazing skin.  Thank you for such a wonderful product at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Made a noticeable difference in my skin, .....smoother, healthier color...go for it.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this product a little over a month, and over the time period that I have used I noticed that is has really lighten up on my acne scars. I love that its an all natural product and I use it every morning and every night. This product is great on my skin and I love it, wearing under make - up is not an issue so thats a plus for me. I will defiantly be repurchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week or two and I have noticed smoother skin and my hyperpigmentation marks are slowly starting to fade.  There is also a slight tingle  when I put the serum on my skin but the tingle goes away in a few minutes.  So far I am enjoying the product and will most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two bright red blemishes on each of my cheeks for nearly five years and have tried everything short of laser treatments to get rid of them but nothing has worked. They are probably due to sun damage.  After the second time using this serum the spots are nearly invisible!  I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful this worked. It absorbs quickly and is light weight.  It has a citrus smell which I like. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product seems true to its description. It leaves my skin looking smooth and fresh and kind of glowing.  I would recommend it. Also reasonably priced. I need to use very little so it  should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month now. I use this as part of my morning routine, applied to freshly cleansed skin and prior to tinted spf cc cream or mineral makeup application. Leaves my skin moisturized and even toned. I do not feel greasy at all. So far has not caused any breakouts for my sensitive skin nor irritation. I have medium olive skin that is oily in the T zone and dry on cheeks. Happy that this does not interefere with makeup application or end result. So far very pleased with product. To early to tell if any benefits on lines or wrinkles yet. Seems versatile for all seasons.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Makes my old wrinkled skin look 10 years younger!</li>
    <li> The only problem I had was that the pump failed to work.  The product itself seems to be working - only been using for 5 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this serum. It has smoothed out the texture of my skin, closed enlarged pores, diminished brown spots and fine lines, and even diminished deeper wrinkles. My skin looks noticeably younger. I&#x27;m a fan and will definitely keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get a serum that works. I have very dry and sensitive skin. I have using this serum for a few weeks and I notised a great result. My face more moisturizer and softness. Will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> my serum forever. smell like organic naturally. best price for serum</li>
    <li> The greatest thing about Pura d&#x27;Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel all icky and nasty. The serum goes on easily and is absorbed quickly. After it&#x27;s done working, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily. I love using it after I take a shower to replace skin moisture.</li>
    <li> Love it!! My skin has more flexibile and smooth!! Would recommend to use morning and night!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase.  The shipping and packaging was handled very professionally.  Pretty bottle and label.  It came with a cloth pouch to hold it (so would be nice for gifting).  Pretty, light fragrance.  I applied it sparingly and it felt a little tacky when initially applied.  It drys/absorbs very quickly.  I used it under my regular moisturizer.  After four days of using it as directed (morning and night) my skin feels softer and a little firmer and my skin tone appears a little more even/brighter.  Hopefully, after longer use, my lines and wrinkles will be reduced.  I am happy with this product and the amount/size of the bottle.  I would order more products from this company because I feel confident their products are made and packaged with care. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I work a very stressful job, and as you can imagine, I have very heavy bags under my eyes because I don&#x27;t sleep very much. I looked for different products to take care of the heavy bags under my eyes, but nothing really seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about three weeks, I noticed that I had an improvement in the bags under my eyes. This product has many other uses and I use it as a general skin moisturizer and softener as well. Great product and great value!</li>
    <li> I have used purador argon oil for several years and loved it. I recently found the purador c serum and decided to try it because their argon oil had been a regular part of my skin care routine. I once again am totally impressed with the purador product. I have been using the c serum for a week now and have visibly seen the deep forehead wrinkles that I have had for years decrease. I believe with continued use my fine lines and wrinkles will significantly diminish. The product has a mild tingling feeling when first applied but after is soaks in the tingling goes away. My entire face looks looks bright healthy and glowing. I continue to use my purador argon oil as a moisturizer after the c serum has soaked in. The two products work wonderfully together. I am 41 years old and would recommend both purador products I have mentioned for mature skin to achieve a younger vibrant completion.</li>
    <li> This works! Much better than creams to lotions. Not terribly thrilled with the pump spray but love the product.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my face, neck and hands, and the results are incredible.  The best is that I know that I am using a natural, high quality product, without unnecessary added chemicals and the like...</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Vitamin C Serum and am loving it.  My face feels smoother and looks healthier. It is easy to apply and  one doesn&#x27;t need a lot.  I use it under my morning and evening moisturizer and find that it adds a firmness that I didn&#x27;t get just with my moisturizer.  I am really looking forward to the long term effects on my skin. Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I am glad I decided to try this! At first I was a little nervous because my skin is pretty sensitive, but I have to say, from the first night I used this I noticed a difference in my skin. I have been using Vitamin C Serum about 4 months now, and I think my skin looks great. I it made my skin glow and  more vibrance. I use 4 drops every night and I wake up to smooth, even skin, that feels soft and hydrated but never greasy.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Not a moisturizer but the serum definitely penetrates quickly and fine lines just seem to disappear.  I use it with a moisturizer and the combination is great. The skin on my forehead was dry and crepey before but after using this product my skin was definitely smoother and younger looking.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked the price of this product compared to others I was considering.  It&#x27;s a sizeable amount of serum and appears to be a good quality.  The only draw backs for me are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The pump dispenses a large amount of serum every time.  Almost too much for my needs, so I feel like I&#x27;m wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  If you apply too much product, it tends to feel sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but I&#x27;m willing to overlook that as long as it keeps my skin glowing.  If you apply the right amount and it gets soaked into your skin, the smell is barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Have seen results in just a few days.  Purchase this product and watch your fine lines disappear.  My forward had deep lines and already are disappearing.  My skin looks refreshed.</li>
    <li> I heard about this vitiman c product from a YouTube . I have been using  timeless c and that was good for a while but it just stopped workin . Then I switched to Paula&#x27;s Choice C. The first bottle had slight broken glass in the bottle. They gladly  sent a new one. It worked quite well however it was quite pricy and very small bottle and it oxides very quick. Hence the quest again for a great C product. Well thus us it. One night there was a change. My skin was glowing in the morning. I have very dry skin and I also use retna  a each night.  This product dies what it says. I add a few dops to my face serum day and night. Its wonderfu . Asxwell as it&#x27;s quite a large bottle..&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest going to your local store and get a small blue bottle and keep a small amount in your bathroom and the rest in the frige. I would give 6 stars if I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November Update: I have now been using Pura&#x27;Dor Vitamin C Serum for over 6 months now,&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;90 % of all my sun spots are gone for the exception of one small stubborn one.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is definitely firmer&lt;br /&gt;My skin is brighter&lt;br /&gt;My pores are better, not 100% but better&lt;br /&gt;Price point, &amp;#34; you cant beat it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons ! &amp;#34; Only two...&lt;br /&gt;1) It has a strong C odor, however you do get use to it .&lt;br /&gt;2) It can stain, so you need to really let it dry, I mix it with my serum..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this product and will never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It is very smooth. Smelled very well.</li>
    <li> This is the second brand of vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried and I really wanted it to be the one, you get 4 ounces at a great price, alas, it was not meant to be.  The pump works well enough and seems to dispense an appropriate amount, but I found the odor off-putting, it smells like hand sanitizer.  I could have easily forgiven this, but the serum also took forever to absorb and when it did it was sticky and left a shiny film on my already oily skin that I couldn&#x27;t even hide with makeup.  I even tried using a much smaller amount to see if I was just putting too much on but it still dried sticky and shiny. Then to top it all off I started getting really painful pimples on my cheeks and jaw, so I&#x27;m going to send this back.  I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for about a week and a half so I can&#x27;t really say if it reduces wrinkles and improves elasticity, but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my poor face.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me this serum as a going away present. I was leaving for a holiday in Hawaii for a week, so the timing could not have been better. I&#x27;m in late 40&#x27;s and my face is normal to dry but mostly dry. I use this product three times a day. Every morning before I go out, I apply it on my face after cleansing and toning. After lunch, I freshen up by using tomatoes as a toner for my skin and then I wash it off and afterwards I apply this serum. Wow, the results are amazing! My face has never been smoother and the small lines along the corners of my eyes are slightly softened. So I know that this product really works. At night before I go to bed, I put this on after I cleanse and tone my skin and the next day, the results on my skin are incredible! I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> I had a really bad sunburn that was very painful. It was giving me some trouble at work one day. I was rubbing the burn, when my boss came by and asked me what was wrong. I told her the problem, and she said that she had a quick solution. She went to her office, and brought this product to me. She told me that I could have the rest of the bottle, since there wasn&#x27;t much left. She said just rub it on the sunburn and eventually, it will get better.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days, my sunburn started to feel better. After a week, it was gone. Now, I am going to get a bottle for myself, and one for my boss for introducing me to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now in my early 40&#x27;s and living near the beach has made my skin dry and my pores larger. I also have learned that sun exposure is damaging to the skin. Seeing that I&#x27;m a beach bum, only means I&#x27;ve got sun-damaged and premature aging. Seeing this serum on Amazon as I was searching for natural skin care products, I was amazed at the incredible price and its amazing ingredients, so I ordered one immediately! The package arrived on time and the serum was neatly wrapped. The first thing I had observed was that the serum wasn&#x27;t oily but it was rather creamy. It had a smooth texture and when I applied it on my face, I could sense a tingling sensation which they say is good. The reviews all say that your skin becomes soft after the application and yes they were correct. My skin is satin smooth with only less than 3 weeks of using the serum and I&#x27;m quite impressed with that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Vitamin C serums. However when it&#x27;s mixed with Vitamin E and Aloe Vera, the benefits are endless! This is an awesome product with an awesome price. You can&#x27;t buy too many skin care products out there that are less than twenty bucks that has all the natural ingredients. So this is a fab product worthy of a good review!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this serum with the help of my boyfriend who used his credit card to buy this product on Amazon. It was an anniversary present for me. He said that I never really needed this since he thinks my skin is already gorgeous but I wanted it anyway, so he gave me one.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived two days after he paid for it and the timing could not have been right. We were supposed to have dinner with his parents the next day, so I needed to look like a million bucks, you know.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the serum before we slept along with my cleanser and toner which my boyfriend also bought for me. I&#x27;m so lucky...lol!  The next day I woke up to a refreshing glowing skin that was soft and as smooth as velvet itself. Life could not have been better!</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST Vit C serum I have found (my holy grail skin care product).  I love that the formulation blends right into the skin, is not &#x27;greasy&#x27; at all, and is made from only plant based and naturally derived ingredients with no parabens or petroleums.  It meets every one of my needs for a C serum and the size if 4X that of the mad hippie serum I was previously using for LESS cost.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!! A+++++</li>
    <li> Like so many others, so far I am blown away by this serum. I have eczema and I am always cautious when trying new skincare products, particularly anything with vitamin C. I bough this because it was highly reviewed and was relatively inexpensive. I do not like paying an arm and a leg for an ounce or two (often less) for a product, particularly when it may be too harsh for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for my skin; not too sticky (I hate that tacky feeling on my skin), not too runny (I hate that too), and a nice sized dark bottle to help preserve the vitamin C. I use it at night, either alone or on some cold nights under a night cream, and it&#x27;s fading some scars that would normally take a longer period to fade. I&#x27;ve been using it on a much older scar on my arm too, with slight results--which is better than nothing, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say much about the hyaluronic acid or other ingredients, as I really only bought it for the vitamin C and E, but the ingredients list is incredible and as long as the price stays reasonable and the size is large, I will be using this forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One potential issue is my husband did say this stung his face when he tried this. I can&#x27;t account for this because my skin is very sensitive and I use it nightly, but perhaps if you have been very sensitive to vitamin C in the past use it sparingly--I can&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy it, however, because I can be sensitive to vitamin C too but it is fine with my skin (and the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; is in there; I can smell it). So, try it and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, give it away. Someone can use it!</li>
    <li> I bought a brand new bottle several weeks ago to have on hand.  I went to get it on the shelf (bedroom shelf with no sunlight and no heat) and pressure built up and it leaked out through the top and all over -- it was still in the canvas pouch.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again because that&#x27;s a sign of either some chemical or biological activity.  Wonder if anyone else had this happen?  Does it really have to be used immediately upon purchase?</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using the serum I put it on one night and didn&#x27;t add moisturizer or any other cream. Next day I had a rash in the neck.&lt;br /&gt;I also developed a bad rash on the blossom area. I treated both with an Aloe Vera soothing lotion. On the face it tingles most when I use toner before the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to control better the amount from the bottle by keeping it very close to my hand when I pump. I&#x27;m not sure yet after a month or more if it works but it does give the skin a different texture. With other serums you don&#x27;t feel their effect all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I waited for a few weeks to see the result.  At first, I had burning sensation.  But after a week, I have noticed great result!  Great price for such a large container.  Pigmentations are going away.  And my skin feels much more even. I hope that you will keep the price the same!</li>
    <li> feels great on face, skin is firmer, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot and have been using about 6 weeks.  Has lightened some age spots and cleared up some mild eczema. Is thin, like water going on and should last about 3 months.  Use it morning and night. Does sometimes make my skin feel a little dry, but does not appear dry which is more important.  Will continue to use and feel it&#x27;s reasonably priced. Is not the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34; that I have seen ads for other similar products.  Came quickly after I ordered it and had slipped out of protective packing so was surprised it was not  broke since it is a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like it all over my face, even over my eyes.  It made my eyes and face firmer.  I have used it for 1 week and my face is brighter and it feels good to put it over my face.  I put jojoba oil after I let it sink in for few minutes.  I have been derma rolling, this serum accelerates the results.  It stings little but it&#x27;s worth the result.  I will be using it for long time.  It is a very good value, before I used this I used Philosophy when hope is not enough serum.  I like this better.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 major luxury brands serum ( SK2 and Estee Lauder). While SK2 was good Estee Lauder didn&#x27;t do any good for me. While reviewing some of the best products for skin I cam across Pura d&#x27;or serum. The reason it caught my eyes was because it has all organic plant based ingredients. I received the order in 5-6 business days which was great. I also ordered their organic face cream. I have been using serum and face cream for last one week now. Although first 3-4 days there wasn&#x27;t any difference in my skin but for last 3 days I am observing a clear and glowing skin. At least 2 close friends also observed that and they asked what I was using. Thanks to Pura d&#x27;or. I am loving it and do not see switching from it anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This product works really well.  I had to purchase an extra for my sister.</li>
    <li> I could not be more please with this product. Does exactly what it says it will do. I am in love and will be purchasing more! For reference I am 32 years old with combination acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or professional strength 20% vitamin C serum for six weeks and I absolutely love it!  I have also noticed that the fine lines and wrinkles around my mouth are less noticeable.It is important to me to be able to use a pure organic product and I am very happy to find a quality one such as this… I will definitely be re-ordering this product and using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Pura d’ Or’s vitamin C serum is less expensive than other vitamin C serum products that I have found online. Also, for all of the things that it does, it is a better value than many other products that are less expensive than it is. With this serum, you get a great value for your money. I am very happy with my purchase, and look forward to getting another bottle!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, however, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My skin is very sensitive and each time that I used it, it burned.  I thought that was the initial reaction and that it would get better, but it didn&#x27;t and my skin felt slightly burned.  Interesting enough my face did have a glow, but after an hour it was dry and within a week very irritated.  I stopped using and will not use again.</li>
    <li> I am new to using this serum but not Pura dor products. I have used the Argan oil for years twice daily and recently was given this vitamin c serum to use with the organic face cream. It has a very thin consistency and it felt slightly warming when I applied it. You do not need to use much for it to cover your entire face. I believe using this serum along with the face cream has given me very supple soft skin. I will continue using this product to maintain my youthful glow.</li>
    <li> Great Product.... helps reduce breakouts.. ships quickly!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! I want to get as much vitamin C in my daily skincare routine as possible. I love that this not only has high Vitamin C content but is also packed with other high-quality nutrient-rich ingredients, too! It&#x27;s light and smooth and absorbs quickly. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and it works!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got it. I used twice and i can tell it works very pretty well, I already can see how soft my skin looks! I am using in my belly too to help with sagging and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I heard about Vit C serum first through my mother in law. Since she has always found out about the latest skin products from her church group club. She gave me a sample that she purchased from this website and I was in shock at how much it helped my skin. I was a bit thrown off by the wateriness of this product since I am used to creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This quickly went away when I applied the serum after 1 week of use. My skin was almost transformed into a younger, brighter, and tighter texture. I cant stop touching my face and it looks amazing in photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased another bottle for my self as well as for my mother in law. Thank you Grace!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! I used to suffer from horrible acne, and because of that I was left with scars all over my face. I heard that vitamin C was really helpful in reducing the scars so I started researching, and found this one. I can say that after using it once, I woke up the next morning, and my blemishes had greatly reduced which really impressed me because most products don&#x27;t show such great results right away! My scarring has greatly reduced as well already, and i&#x27;ve only used it a few times. I will definitely keep using this product. Also, this serum is very light weight so it is suitable for all skin types-and this product has the right percentage of vitamin C!  I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants their skin to feel rejuvenated and youthful :) Will be recommending this to all of my friends for sure!</li>
    <li> Far from any other product, this vitamin C is the most complete product i&#x27;ve seen. It works as a moisturizer, toner and balancer. It also helps with anti aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very gentle but becareful of the 20% vitamin c concentration, it can sting a bit if you skin is overly sensitive or your first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try a small area and a small amount first and work your way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT this stuff is gold just like the brand name</li>
    <li> I received promptly.  Only have used the product for one week, but I really like it so far.</li>
    <li> I love how well this worked for me. The serum starts working immediately and helped rid dark sun spots over time. The best part is how soft my face is through out the day.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and this new serum they have. I have been using their argan oil for 2 years now and Now i use thier Vitamin C serum after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum just makes my feel baby soft and it gives a nice smooth texture, lovely.</li>
    <li> Ive tried so many things and who knew that all I needed was some Vitamin C?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO far i am just swept away out how lovely this serum makes my face feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth, I had to get used to it but once I did, I cant do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum leaves a nice mask that you can feel working right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for night time use or also effective under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face wash_serum_moisturizer - Perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  I needed something to help with my 56 year old face and this serum makes my face to smooth&lt;br /&gt;and has helped with the fine lines also.  I have tried other products but definitely like this one the best!</li>
    <li> Great product! Silky smooth! Feels great on hair, face and all over the body! Excellent service! Delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> I used it everyday for 3 weeks and my face felt smoother but it felt like it was going onto my skin and into my brain and taking my memory away.  It took about 5 days after stopping use for me to feel back to normal.  I&#x27;m not a paranoid personality and I am usually in touch with reality -  but I feel we have to be aware of what chemicals can do to our bodies.</li>
    <li> I am so happy at how well my skin responded to this serum. I have used it religiously for the past 3 weeks and it has done wonders for my face. I used to have dark circles, GONE. I had uneven skin tone, Poof! disappeared. the serum applies really nicely and it bonds to the skin like a layer of goodness.</li>
    <li> i received this product way sooner than said. As soon as i received it I put it on my hands an around eyes. Not greasy at all, Soaks right in&amp;#60; i have purchased many other brands but nothing as good as this&amp;#60; just feels wonderful, In confident i will see changes.</li>
    <li> Normally I used this serum in night time before going to bed. But in morning when I woke up I have seen my  skin gets very dry, and some wrinkles also.</li>
    <li> This oil is so amazing! and helps with my aging spots and fine lines but I can&#x27;t believe it is frosted glass and not dark amber?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark is better to keep lights out. I have to hide this bottle in my closet to keep it fresh.</li>
    <li> Once I used the shampoo I decided to try this product and I could not be more pleased.  It has replaced all the lotions and toners I was using and my skin has never looked better.  This is now my favorite and only facial product.  The product is not greasy and rapidly absorbs into the skin - incredible.</li>
    <li> Nice Light Serum, absorbs fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a little over 3 months now and I have definitely noticed my skin smoothing out. My sun spots seem to appear a little lighter and he pores on my nose have also shrank and I don&#x27;t get blackheads anymore.  I&#x27;ve used other cosmetic serums before but never yielded results like I do with the Vitamin C Serum. My daughter tried it and after one use she loved it and is planning to purchase a bottle for herself. Definitely plan to keep this in my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I was having issues with my face being dull and people would ask me if I was okay like I was sick. After that embarrassing episode, I went ahead and tried the Vitamin C Serum and i was amazed at how it made my skin glow and gave my face more vibrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark circles disappeared and also my wrinkles were smoothing away. I apply every night and also every morning before work.</li>
    <li> I have decided to write my review after I have used the product for a month. I am impressed with the natural ingredients used in conjunction with the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, which are all  beneficial to healthy skin. The serum is gel-like, which I prefer. I have gotten other products that were to runny to apply to the face. I also feel the tightening effects of the serum after I apply it without the burning some other products cause. I know hyaluronic acid and vitamin C treat sun damaged skin, and since  I work outside in the sun, this is helpful.</li>
    <li> it make face skin softer, will buy another one!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, will use it again definitely!</li>
    <li> This serum worked so well on my face I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it. I had to get used to the slight tingle to it, but after I realized that it was actually the serum doing its magic, I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has a slight rosacea around the upper parts of my cheek bones. Since using the serum, it has removed the redness and my skin has started to feel smoother with much less wrinkles. I always reapply after jogging out doors after washing and rinsing my sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this serum for those that want quick results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is life changing. I wont ever buy a serum different for my hair. Pura d&#x27;or is my new favorite product line.</li>
    <li> Of all the products that I&#x27;ve used in the past for skincare, this is probably the easiest product to use. All I have to do is pump a little bit into my hand, and spread it over my skin. The product is very thin, unlike the other heavy skincare products that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and it dries very quickly. I love how quick I am able to use this product, and I love how effective it is. 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had such amazing results using Pura d’ Or’s vitamin C serum! The sunspots that I had on my body are completely gone! It worked better than advertised! Amazing product! Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> I am very careful about what products I use on my body and what ingredients are in the products I use.  I heard about Pura d&#x27;or from a friend, and have tried several of their products including the vitamin c serum and the anti-hair loss shampoo.  This serum has been amazing for my face, and top notch compared to other natural products I have tried.  My skin has a brighter healthy glow and feels soft.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> You can see the difference in days</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum along with their Face Cream &amp; it&#x27;s a great one-two punch. The serum consistency is light, not oily, unscented, absorbs quickly into the skin with no tackiness. I can appreciate this product, its ingredients, fair pricing &amp; the quick &amp; very favorable results I&#x27;ve seen in just a couple of applications. Wish I would have known of this company &amp; their product line years ago. I wasted lots of money &amp; time using high end products that never delivered over months of us like this one has in such a short period. Pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> The rest of my order was intact, but this had burst all inside the box :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 8 months.  I&#x27;ve never used a serum before, as I have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out from allergic reactions.  I have very fair combination skin, and this has worked beautifully on my face, no allergic reactions at all.  The first couple of weeks I used it did sting slightly, but that stopped over time.  The smell is a bit strong and &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34;, probably from the ferulic acid, but fades quickly.  I can see great improvement from this product on my skin discolorations due to the sun and aging.  Spots have lightened up considerably, and my skin has a lovely clear glow. I always use a sunscreen of at least SPF 30 after applying this serum.  Would highly recommend this product for aging (over 40) or sun-damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I actually used another vitamin C serum other than Pura ‘d Or’s. It did not work as well and it was more expensive. I am very happy with my purchase of this product, and I plan to get another bottle once the one that I am currently using runs out. This is working better than I ever thought possible.</li>
    <li> One of the biggest problems that a lot of people suffer is dull skin. Many of my friends used to tell me that I had very pale skin. They were being mean when they said it, they were just telling the truth. When I looked in the mirror after I was told this, I realized that I looked like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this product for about a week, I noticed that color was coming back into my face. My skin started to look more vibrant, and natural. Ever since I started noticing it working the way it has, I have continued to use this product. It’s awesome not to be a ghost anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just beside myself. I can&#x27;t believe this product works as well as it does! I used to have a major case of dry skin, and my skin used to be very pale. Pura d’Or’s vitamin C serum cleared up both problems without any trouble! I recommend this product to all of my friends, and I recommend it to you as well. You will not be disappointed in how amazingly well this product works!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I just can&#x60;t get enough of it.I think it&#x60;s a must-have for someone who likes organic skin care.It helped smooth out some fine lines from prolonged stay in the sun.I noticed the results within a week.Definitely will be ordering it again</li>
    <li> The serum came in yellow brown color. It burned my sensitive skin. I even tried mixing it with rosehip oil and it still wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> great product. fast shipping. good seller. please do to do bussiness. item as described. great job.</li>
    <li> I had never gotten into skin treatments etc outside of finding a cleanser and moisturizer that agreed with my skin.  I found this one on the Pura d&#x27;or website while researching their hair loss shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman at the cosmetic counter in Nordstrom rudely commented on the blackheads on my nose as I perused their selections.  Needless to say, I could not received anything she said especially at what I viewed as excessive cost of the products offered by her coworker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin C Serum has exceeded my expectations.  I have no blackheads.  My skin is so beautiful and bright now that I grab a hand mirror to get a closer look in amazement of the difference adding this product to my skincare regime has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i receive so many compliments on my skin, which is very welcomed at age 44.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use too much or did not use my facial brush with a soft hand this stuff burns.  But it is easily remedied by applying my moisturizer with spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.  Please don&#x27;t change the formulation.  As it stands, I am loving my skin.</li>
    <li> I worked very hard to keep my skin hydrated. I purchased many lotions and creams to make sure that my skin stays moisturized and smooth. I have been having a lot of trouble recently trying to keep my skin moisturized. I did a little research, and found that I might not be getting enough vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product in an attempt to get more moisturized skin. After using it for a few days, I noticed a great improvement in my skin hydration. This product works well in conjunction with other skin creams and lotions, or you can just use it by itself. Either way, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> I have had such amazing results using Pura d’ Or’s vitamin C serum! The sunspots that I had on my body are completely gone! It worked better than advertised! Amazing product! Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Great product will definitely recommend, faded scars and brightens skin!! Hoping they will come out with an all organic serum in the future.</li>
    <li> Easily the best organic vitamin c serum for night time use on Amazon. It&#x27;s very difficult to choose from the wide variety of products offered on Amazon.com but this was an easy buy. Will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Most lotions with &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in them tend to block my pores and cause serious blackheads and break outs. Believe me, I&#x27;m 56 and have tried so many products, it would astound you!!! Pura d&#x27;or products seems to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; to my skin, leaving it soft rather than it sitting on top of my skin and becoming oily. I enjoy a few Pura d&#x27;or products! Very different, very nice!! Finally!!!</li>
    <li> I have a major issue with redness on my skin. I don&#x27;t really know what causes it, all I know is that my cheeks and four head are very red, and it makes me look like a tomato. It is a little bit embarrassing, and some mornings, when I look in the mirror, I really don&#x27;t want to go outside.&lt;br /&gt;I did a little research on the Internet, and found vitamin C can help with this problem. After doing some more research, I found that Pura D’ Or’s vitamin C serum product was cheaper than other vitamin C products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take very long for my little bottle to get shipped to me. I started using it immediately after I got it. 10 weeks later, the redness in my face is gone. I have started using this product on other parts of my body, and it is work just as well. This is a wondrous product and if you try it, you will find out how great it is too.</li>
    <li> I love Pura ‘d Or. There vitamin C serum lasts all day, and only takes a few minutes to apply to problem areas. I like to put it on my face, arms, neck, and legs. It doesn&#x27;t take that much to cover my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel unnatural like other products that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve given other products, other than this one, shot, and none of them even come close to the effectiveness of this one. This product is just so effective. I honestly don&#x27;t see myself not using this wonderful skincare supplement.</li>
    <li> am so pleased with this serum and I have shared it with so many friends. I bring this serum with my everywhere and I love doing product demos with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate effects are whats best about this product since it really coats the skin and starts working right away. I love how it is so lightweight and it forms a nice protective barrier that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is the best that I have tried and it has the best results since it doesn&#x27;t hide behind any other moisturizing agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serum is a must have for any one that wants to have nice soft wrinkle free skin.</li>
    <li> After I use this product, I think that my skin is glowing! This vitamin C serum has brought out the true color to my skin, and almost feels like it makes my skin glow! This is an amazing product and you would be crazy to try anything else!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true or not, but I think that this stuff is magical. All of the skin problems that I had don’t bother me anymore. Pura d’ Or’s vitamin C serum is just flat-out wonderful! It is a top quality product, and worth the price, and more!</li>
    <li> I like this serum very much because it&#x27;s not like any other I&#x27;ve had before. It&#x27;s not heavy or greesy. My skin drinks it up and skin is soft and smooth. It seems to help keep break outs from progressing. Thank you thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is all I use now......no other moisturizer or night cream. I am soon to be 69 and I get comments all the time on how good my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;All the products I have tried from this brand have been excellent.</li>
    <li> Amazing product that is changing my skin! This company has outstanding customer service. And this Vit C serum is changing my skin for the better after a few uses. My skin has a brightened glow to it. Combine this with the Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil and you won&#x27;t need anything else to maintain healthy, moisturized, plumper skin! I&#x27;m a customer for life... love it.</li>
    <li> I used this Serum for one month and now I can write this review on the quality and how I use it. I had a high hopes for this product and wanted to use it for the whole month before my wedding to improve my skin. My main concern is a dullness and melasma so after the whole 30 days I can say that my skin looks brighter and firmer. I use the serum at night time before my night cream and I will continue to use it since t I can see some dramatic improvement in my skin quality.</li>
    <li> My skin isn&#x27;t really old looking.  Not yet, at least.  I am thirty something and have not had wrinkles set in yet but…I have age spots.  I think they are from sun bathing and being very active in the California sun.  I hated them so when I heard that this product would help, I ordered immediately.  And immediately upon getting it in, I tried it.  It has been four weeks and they are lightening.  I really can&#x27;t believe it but...they are.  I am one happy girl!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, who has been using a cream that cost close to one hundred dollars. She tried it out thinking I must have spent a lot of money on it.  She says her skin feels a lot different, with better results than the cream she was using.  Not sure what all that really meant, but if she is happy, i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this face (vitamin C based) serum, it goes on smoothly with a refreshing feel and pleasant smell. My face feels firmer without drying out. My dark spots are fading away too so hope after a few months they&#x27;ll disappear, even if they blend in better as they are now I&#x27;ll be happy. I use this in the morning and again before bed. I was also pleased to see the size of the bottle, most Vitamin C Serums cost the same but for 2 oz, this is 4 oz. Look at the reviews, I&#x27;m clearly not the only one giving this 5 stars. Give  it a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a week and so far, so good. My skin feels much smoother and is beginning to even out.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Only some spilled out during shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this formula. It makes my skin feel so much softer and even thick where it is thin. Comes in a convenient spray bottle. I just use one spray per day. You will notice a difference that you like. Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> this serum is good I didn&#x27;t use it on my face I used it in between my thigh butt and legs 3 pumps on each section and add my lotion it&#x27;s been 4days and I see a big difference already I told my friends about it I  will definitely buy it again.and it ships fast thanks</li>
    <li> Vit C serum is a &#x27;Holy Grail&#x27; skincare product in my anti-aging regime ... this is BY FAR the best C serum I&#x27;ve come across!! I love the fact that the ingredients are all plant derived (even the hyaluronic acid) and there are NO harmful ingredients, parabens, phalates or petroleum agents.  From the first time I used this serum, I could feel it working (slight tingling, which means the C concentration is Legit!!).  It soaks right into the skin, does not feel oily at all, leaves your skin glowing and plump ... ordering more right now!!</li>
    <li> None of the old skin care products that I used in the past were terrible. My biggest problem with them was that a few hours after I put them on, they stopped working. Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum works all day. Five stars! Brilliant product!</li>
    <li> I have done some research on the chemicals found in this product, and many of them have been proven to stop free radicals. This is something that is very important to me, as a lot of beauty products that I used to use don&#x27;t do that. I like to consider myself a smart consumer, so I do a lot of research on products before I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;I did research on this product and it left me nothing but impressed. I purchased it based on what it was made from, and I am buying it again because of how well it does it&#x27;s job. It works better than advertised!</li>
    <li> Works well and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product gives me such smooth, soft skin. I never thought that this would give me such smooth skin. I love it and I plan to get another bottle of it in the near future! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum because I&#x27;m almost 30 and my skin was feeling dry and dull. I started using the serum mostly at night and I can honestly say that by morning my skin felt revitalized and bright and i noticed that over time it has faded some dark spots i have while using my derma roller along with it (about once a week). P.s. I have acne prone skin and it did not make me break out, it actually helps heal faster it seems. will keep using!!</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is made with scientifically proven ingredients that can work wonders with your skin. I have been using this product for about six months, and it is done amazing things for me. If you are looking for something that will actually give you results, get this product and see how well it works.</li>
    <li> A lot of my friends used to tell me that I had very pale skin. I tried many different things, including getting a tan, but all that did was give me a sunburn. After using this vitamin C serum, my skin has taken on a radiant glow. My friends have told me that I don&#x27;t have pale skin anymore. Oh, and my sunburn, this product helped with that as well.</li>
    <li> I know for a fact that Vitamin C helps to lighten the skin because it acts as an anti-oxidant. I also know that aloe vera is a great plant ingredient that&#x27;s excellent for the skin. So when I learned about this product through my office colleague, I had no doubts about it. The package arrived on a weekday and I was on leave on that day, so my mom was there at home and we both tested the product immediately. Before we applied the Vitamin C serum, we used an aloe cleanser and toner. The only problem was it didn&#x27;t have any Vitamin C. So buying this product completes my skin care line because it has loads of Vitamin C. We were astounded with how smooth and fine our faces were after we applied the serum. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and my face looks amazing. I don&#x27;t have any pimples anymore and the dark spots have incredibly softened. I totally loooove this product!</li>
    <li> lately I&#x27;ve been noticing fine lines and wrinkles on my face. saw this on amazon and immediately purchased it. around 2 weeks of using it I see that my face is soft and smooth. now I been using this for 3 months and i notice that my wrinkles are reducing. will definetely order again!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks and have seen progress in lightening of age spots. I get a slight tingling feeling when I apply right after cleansing, then a tightening sensation. Overall I have smoother skin and wil continue to use it. The only thing I would change is the pump to dispense. You have to be careful to not push it too hard ar fast or the serum sprits out everywhere.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product gives me really smooth skin. My husband tells me that I have very smooth skin, a lot smoother than I had a few weeks ago. He really loves to cuddle up to me in bed now. He tells me that I am his favorite cuddle buddy. Well, he set I was always his favorite cuddle buddy, but now I was a lot more fun to cuddle with since my skin was smoother.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I have suggested it to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell but  I know that my hair is not falling out using this product.</li>
    <li> ARRIVED ON TIME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  PRODUCT ITSELF IS PACKAGED IN A PUMP BLUE BOTTLE WITH A CLOTH POUCH TO KEEP LIGHT FROM EFFECTING THE SERUM. SERUM IS A EXCELLENT VALUE AND DOES DO NOT IRRIATE MY SENSITIVE SKIN. I&#x27;M EXTREMLY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old and acne has recently been a problem for me. I guess the late night studying has taken a toll on my skin. When I saw this on Amazon, I bought right away. I was a bit skeptic because I have tried numerous acne products but I was allergic to half of those and the ones that I liked, were far too expensive. When I tried to apply the serum the first time, I felt a bit of tingling sensation. It was not itchy at all and did not sting. The serum did not have awful smell but my only complain was the pump or spray.I was hoping if you guys could use a dropper so it would be a lot easier to control the flow of the serum. That&#x27;s the only small thing that I think is a downside to this product, mainly because I don&#x27;t want to run out of it right away...lol! Other than that, this Vitamin C serum is the best I have ever tried on my skin and I&#x27;m loving the results!</li>
    <li> My uncle gave me the first bottle to try and i like it so much and i order my first one and recommend this to who ever start loosing hair.&lt;br /&gt;The sooner you order the more hair you gone have.</li>
    <li> This product made my face very oily so I returned it.  A lot of vitamin c products sold on Amazon have oils added in guess you just have to pay attention if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Using it just for a week brought a huge change in my skin texture and brought a glow!!! Absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks, and I already have angel dove soft skin. This is the best product that I have ever used that acted as a skin softener, and I would suggest anyone who wants soft skin to pass up other creams, and just get a bottle of this. You won&#x27;t regret that you did!</li>
    <li> Have not seen any significant improvement in skin tone or texture.  Oil tends to crust around the opening of the bottle.  Now use it only for my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I really love the results I have had over the last couple weeks. My skin is clearer and smoother. I find myself excited to come home and wash my face so I can use it again. The only downside I have is that the oil leaves a little bit of stain on my hands. I have already recommended this to a few of my friends. I&#x27;ll be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> anyone concerned with anti aging should be using Vitamin C daily. I am thrilled so far and will continue use.</li>
    <li> The serum provided a reassuring sting when applied to my face. Made me think, &amp;#34;This is it! I never have to find another product that&#x27;ll clear my face like this does!&amp;#34; When paired with Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil, you have an unbeatable team. The smell is a little weird which isn&#x27;t a deal breaker at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! This is the ultimate serum product. After the first application my face felt fresh and moisturized. It also has wonderful properties that tightens the skin leaving a wonderful feeling that I never got from other products. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I would have to say this product is more around 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Initially when I started using it, it stung my skin a little bit. The smell is not very pleasant, and the texture is very watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: It&#x27;s winter right now when skin is more dull and dry. With more consistent use, I was able to see my skin a little more bright. Another plus is that it&#x27;s a huge bottle of serum.</li>
    <li> I liked this serum, it is a bit runny which I was not expecting but it is a great product! I added it to my skin care regime and it has given my skin a nice natural glow. I love it!</li>
    <li> The other day, I noticed a dark spot on my skin. I freaked out, and immediately went to the Internet to figure out what might be wrong. It turned out that I had something called a sunspot. I realized that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, and it was something that could easily be taken care of with the application of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;I chose Pura d’Or’s vitamin C serum, because I am a big fan of natural ingredients, and this company uses all-natural ingredients to make its products. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four weeks, and the sunspot that I had is almost gone.</li>
    <li> Pura d’ Or’s vitamin C serum feel so much nicer than all of the other creams I used to use to hydrate my skin and help prevent skin problems. The creams that I used to use were very thick, and felt very nasty on my skin. This serum is very thin, and absorbs into my skin very quickly. In a few minutes I am able to just rub it into my skin, and go about my day. This product has replaced a lot of the beauty products that I had in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Initially within 3 days of application I had severe break out of adult acne. So stopped using the product and was contemplating return. But I am glad I didn&#x27;t as last 10 days I have been using this product 2x a day and it&#x27;s clearing my skin and fading those acne marks. So my journey was a roller coaster ride with utter disappointment to happiness seeing my skin glow after every application. I am glad I started to use it again instead of returning or shelving it. I will surely buy more though I must say its a big bottle of serum. I am giving 4 star because of the initial break out.</li>
    <li> I really like this result. But when I put some in my face, I always feel irritated sensation. Usually it will be gone in 30 minutes. Especially, I put some Aragan oil after this serum, my face got redness like allergic react. So I just use this only, without any toner or oil. It&#x27;s reasonable though, I feel a little bit dryness.</li>
    <li> I have tried 100% Pure&#x27;s vitamin C, but wasn&#x27;t impressed. So I went on Amazon and looked up alternative Vitamin C serums. I have to say I am impressed with Pura D&#x27;Or. I use this serum after washing my face and it leaves a nice tingling sensation. You only need 2-3 pumps. After it&#x27;s dried I then put on moisturizer. Great product and great price! I recommend buying it on the company&#x27;s website as first time purchasers receive 20% their first order and free shipping.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product while looking for a natural shampoo and conditioner, and I decided to give it a try because it claims to neutralize free radicals. I&#x27;m only 23, and I already have noticeable sun damage on my forehead. I love that this product is natural and has a pleasant neutral scent. I&#x27;ve been using this product at night after I wash my face, and when I wake up in morning my skin feels smooth and refreshed. It hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout and my makeup still goes on normally. Money wise, similar products cost just as much and are a quarter of the size. So, I definitely feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the only thing I don&#x27;t quite care for is the consistency.  It&#x27;s pretty watery compared to other serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The strong smell after you apply is irritating , am being using different brand with not problem and I decided to change since I love pura dor shampo but this serum was a mistake am going back to my previous one.</li>
    <li> good addition to Pura d&#x27;or cream</li>
    <li> I love this!  At first I was skeptical since I felt that all the ingredients in the bottle were ones that I thought warranted the bottle more expensive.  I thought it was too good to be true.  However, after only three nights I saw a difference in my face.  I love this!!!!!!!!  I hope you do not discontinue this product.  It is genius in a bottle.  Trust me when I say I do research on EVERYTHING.  This is an awesome product, and for the price I should not have my eyes set on anything else for some time.  Thank you!! :)</li>
    <li> I very much like this serum. It goes on nicely and I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> great product , makes my skin glow and improves the appearance of my acne scars, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very very happy with this product . Feels wonderful on my face and neck. Saw results on my face within weeks WOW !!!!!! So I ordered 4 more bottles . Got my husband to use it also . we have live din the Caribbean for 40 yrs so we have sun damage on our faces especially my husband being out on the water every day . With this product I noticed his dark sun spots on his faces are fading . So I am now giving 1 bottle as a present to my mother and 1 bottle to my Aunt. I recommend this product!! Naomi Webber</li>
    <li> Used along with rose water and bentonite clay (separately, not mixed together), my wife loves these items and has completely reinvigorated her skin again. We moved to an area a few years ago that has extremely hard water and no way to install a softener. This has wreaked havoc on our skin. With facial skin being the most sensitive on your body, she has used these items to gently moisturize, tone, and exfoliate safely and effectively.</li>
    <li> l love the vitamin c serum its amazing! Very good price for the 4 oz bottle. Would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your amazing products.. Also love the conditioner and gold shampoo :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s high in Vit C.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is something that many people don&#x27;t really talk about that often. I mean, everybody knows that orange juice is a good source of vitamin C, but other than that, no one really talks about what it does. I never knew that vitamin C was important to skincare. I am really embarrassed to say that, because I consider myself a skincare buff.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product when I started noticing that my skin was drier than normal and nothing I did was helping it get moisturized. It wasn&#x27;t very long after I started using this product, that I noticed a stark improvement in how moisturized my skin was.&lt;br /&gt;I am now using this product to help take care of my skin. I am also drinking more orange juice!</li>
    <li> I bought the serum along with the oil. The serum causes a sting once you apply it but dont worry most serums do. It hasnt done anything great to my face but it did cause a few breakouts and stopped using it i now use it very sporadically , once in 3 days. It is very watery texture and has a pleasant smell . Im giving it a few more days to see if this product can bring some radical effects</li>
    <li> This item was sent to me by accident I believe, since I ordered the Shampoo + Conditioner. I received the conditioner, but the product I got was a very pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product because: Creamy consistency which is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip, but not oily. Absorbs into the skin quickly and once it&#x27;s absorbed, you can put makeup over it. It makes your skin feel baby soft, but doesn&#x27;t feel that moisturizing (it&#x27;s not advertised as a sole moisturizer, so this isn&#x27;t a problem,) so I would recommend still keeping your moisturizer and using this before.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It goes on like water, my skin soaks it up and feels so smooth and silky. Will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> Swept away, that is the best way to describe how I felt when I first started using this product. It is taking care of so many of my skin problems, and is very easy-to-use. I used to have a problem with fine wrinkles, and sunspots. Ever since I started using Pura d Or’s natural vitamin C serum, those problems are both gone.&lt;br /&gt;If you are out in the sun a lot, or you have a problem with fine wrinkles, this is the product for you. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feels tender. I have super sensitive skin. I think I should start out on a lower concentration first to get used to it.    -Revised: After using it for a few weeks, my skin adapted and is not longer irritation.</li>
    <li> Organic and all that is good but I just like that this Rose Hips stuff worked.  I used this for my acne scars and it made them almost go away.  Nice that it&#x27;s organic and all but the fact that it works is the best thing.</li>
    <li> The Pura d&#x27;or Vitamin C serum is amazing!!  I use it after microneedling because it is organic, pure and very good for my skin.  My skin feels dewy and supple.  I absolutely love this oil and will always use it!  I highly recommend using it on your face if you are looking for a high-quality vitamin serum for your face.</li>
    <li> It makes skin feel nice and some of my lines don&#x27;t seem as deep.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Does really make your skin tighter. Definitely shows signs of reducing scars and blemishes. Leaves skin brighter. I would highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter. According to her, she noticed good results after a week of use. She said her skin was softer, her scars were starting to fade and she can&#x27;t wait to see long-term results. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, and the only negative is that she wished the product came in dropper rather than a pump so there is no waste.</li>
    <li> re-ordered this and started using it right away.  My skin has always been problematic.  As a teen, I battled acne (and have the scars to prove it!) Now that I&#x27;m middle-aged it seems I am still battling something -- if not acne(?) then dryness around the edges.  Started using this and already, I am getting compliments. People look at me and say:  Wow you look great ......what are you doing?  And of course, I tell them.  The product makes my skin feel moisturized without feeling greasy...</li>
    <li> If you do not buy this product you will miss out on amazing benefits! This is the best product for your face with multiple benefits and it is only $20</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but have tried the hair loss shampoo, the argon oil, and the acne treatment. All have been wonderful products that have done exactly what they claim to do. I will try this out and update. Every high quality company.</li>
    <li> This light, thin serum is very nice and will not dry out your skin. I have tried other vitamin C serums, and for the price point, this one is definitely worth using. Do not expect this to perform as well as a $100+ vitamin C serum, that&#x27;s all. I am quite pleased with the results and will continue to use this serum everyday.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum is a powerful formula that fights dry skin, and skin imperfections. I&#x27;ve used it, and the claims hold up. All of the skin imperfections that troubled me are gone. I love this stuff, and I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for the world! Best product!</li>
    <li> I use this product during the day and during the night. It is very effective during both times, and it always makes my skin feel amazing. My face is very soft, and so is my neck. I don&#x27;t think that I have ever had a product works so well!</li>
    <li> Just a tiny drop of this potent stuff goes a long way. Yes it does work! Once you put it on it dries to this slightly sticky film on your skin which feels stiff... guess that&#x27;s the serum doing it&#x27;s action. Your face doesn&#x27;t feel hard or anything but just a note how it feels when you touched faced after use. This stiffness tends to make your skin a bit itchy after a while. Not an uncomfortable itch or anything worth noting but you feel it once in a while that just last for a second. The key is too use very little. Just spray on palm of hand and apply with finger tips in circular motion. That&#x27;s all too it. Don&#x27;t have to be a rocket scientist. It&#x27;s right on the directions. Yes, I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve used two other C serums on the market but neither compares to this in terms of effectiveness. Also, this is a fantastic deal for the size of the bottle! This is a no-brainer buy.</li>
    <li> I have tried several vitamin C serums including Philosophy Turbo Booster C, Obagi Professional C Serum, and Oz Naturals C Serum. I was actually ok with them until I tried the Pura d&#x27;or Vitamin C Serum. This stuff is amazing!!!! I love how it burns slightly when it&#x27;s applied. It makes me KNOW it is highly concentrated. My skin looks brighter, healthier, and it even plumps my skin to make me look younger. I will never use another vitamin c serum again! It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and works great under my make-up! I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon this highly effective product!!!! Will DEFINITELY continue to purchase this serum!!!!</li>
    <li> Very light weight like water. Easily goes straight into skin. Hope to see results soon.</li>
    <li> First time buying, and just used it few days. Hope can see the result soon.</li>
    <li> This product did what it said it would. It made my fine lines disappear and caused my skins dark spots to become lighter. I like how it has a pump applicator for a no mess type of applications. I mix it in with some sunblock to really make it last for sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and a a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with how well the serum made my skin feel. The touch is so soft and smooth. This serum is top shelf!</li>
    <li> This is my fourth purchase of this product &amp; it meets all of my expectations &amp; more.  I am a senior citizen &amp; I can honestly say this product has minimized the few age wrinkles on my face.  Part of my wrinkle free face is due to good genes but this product has definitely improved overall appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> First time buying, very pleased with the results. Dark mark (hyper pigmentation?) Gone! Tried everything this worked.</li>
    <li> Worked almost immediately to smooth skin and leave it fresh looking!</li>
    <li> I have been using this item since March 16, 2015.  I can honestly say that there&#x27;s no noticeable difference. But after doing some research, I believe this product has to be used for six months for the results to show.  The good thing about this product is that is not irritating on my sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions to it.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Pura D&#x27;or Argan oil and been using it for years now and my skin is beautiful so I wanted to try vitamin C from this same brand so I ordered it.  As soon it I recieved it in the mail I tried it on my face.  Like my pura d&#x27;or argan oil, I love this product.  It is very light and smell free and absorbed into the skin rapidly which I need for daily use.  I just love this product.</li>
    <li> I used to have really spotty skin. My face and shoulders were the worst places. I used Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum to see what it could do for me, and the results were amazing! I don&#x27;t have spotty skin anymore. This product is an excellent skin care option to take care of spotty skin. It deserves nothing less than five stars!</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded my expectations.  I noticed a difference in my skin after three days.  My skin is in fairly good condition, but the aging process happens regardless.  I highly recommend this product.  It does what it promises.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This serum is a very good value considering you get four times more for the same price as many others. While it seems equally effective so far, a downside is that it leaves more of a film that you can feel and it makes your skin a little more shiny than others I&#x27;ve tried. Nonetheless, this type of serum seems to be the best treatment I have found for controlling adult acne, and this specific type is the best value out there at the moment by far.</li>
    <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin regenerating itself. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very nice serum, bottle and dispenser. Good high quality item.</li>
    <li> This product goes on and dries in minutes. It is not as messy to use as other skin care products, and from my experience, it is a lot more effective than other products. A lot of the other things that I used in the past made my skin feel very oily. It was a very sad feeling after getting out of the shower, and I used one of those old products, that it seemed like I hadn&#x27;t even showered at all. I love this product, and I don&#x27;t see myself replacing it any time soon!</li>
    <li> This is a top-tier skin care product that is very versatile! Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum has helped me with skin discolorations, and has helped me with my cracked, dry skin. If you are having just about any kind of skin problems, use this product. It works very well and a lot more quickly than the others that you will find in your local store.</li>
    <li> I have used the argon oil from Pura d&#x27;or for a while now and really like it.  So I wanted to try this serum as well. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.  It makes my skin very soft and supple, and I really love it. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairline wrinkles I have around my eyes are not as bad. I noticed that this product was good for skin discoloration as well, so I started using it on those areas. This product is worked very well for my skin discoloration, and is also made my skin smoother, and suppler and those areas.&lt;br /&gt;This is a Grade A skin care product that has so many uses. A+!</li>
    <li> One of the biggest problems that I had with my skin is redness. I don&#x27;t know if I have rosacea, I really doubt it, but I do know that I had a problem with red skin. Pura d&#x27;Or vitamin C serum has all but put an end to my problems with red skin. This is such a fantastic product. I really love it!</li>
    <li> I had a really nasty problem with dry skin before. A lot of the lotions and skin creams that I used to purchase didn&#x27;t work very well. The ones that did work, wore off way too soon. Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C supplement is different. It lasts all day, and works better than any other product that I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;Another big plus is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling nasty. Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this night when I go to sleep, and when I wake up, it makes my face feel fresh and clean. My husband has told me that the skin on my face is smoother, and it gives me a radiant glow. He tells me that I look like an angel when I use this product. 5 stars and keep up the amazing work!</li>
    <li> This product was offered on Amazon&#x27;s Deal of the Day and I HAD to order it because of all the fabulous reviews.  Every review I read gave it 5 out of 5 stars.  And I can honestly say this is a fantastic product.  My skin feels softer and looks brighter.  Goes on easily and is absorbed into the skin almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I really liked it when I first used it. It seemed to hydrate incredibly well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems kind of shiny. I am 63 though and my skin has lot of sun damage. I will use it more and see if it helps. Its super thin, watery almost and doesn&#x27;t sting and dry out my skin like Paulas choice  Vitamin C. Not sure if that means it isn&#x27;t working as well?</li>
    <li> I use this once a day at night and have seen a nice shine and glow to my face in only a weeks time. I use it in conjunction with argan oil in the morning.  This is a high quality product and I like that it comes in a glass container with a pump.I did experience some stinging the first several uses but that has dissipated. Enjoy the benefits from Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I have been using this 2x a day for two weeks. It goes on smoothly, not greasy, and absorbs quickly. Not super moisturizing but it wears well under foundation. In a short time I do see a slight improvement in tone and texture. Reasonably priced as well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Rosacea is a problem in the past for me. I used to get really Redskin, and it was very embarrassing. I thought that there was nothing that I could do to take care of it, that is until I heard of this product. For months later and my rosacea is almost completely taken care of. I see red spots occasionally, but not nearly as often as I did before I started using this product. This vitamin C serum is an amazing buy!</li>
    <li> After using this for a month, skin seems more firm and &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34;.  Most noticeable difference is improvement in appearance of neck. Lovely texture</li>
    <li> This product worked instantly! It tingled slightly upon applying to clean dry skin. Then it left my skin glistening and hydrated! It has a bit of an odor probably from the vitamin C and the squirt bottle leaks (maybe mine is defective?). But the product itself works well and is all natural!</li>
    <li> I got this few weeks ago. At first i was hesitant to try new product on my face. But i felt like i need to use a product that would help my dry skin. I read all the reviews about this product and was convinced to try it. I had fast transaction with this product. When i received this product i immediately use it. Like after 3days of using this i already noticed a change in my face. Friends kept asking me what i used. Been using this for almost 2 weeks already and im loving it. Would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have done some research on the chemicals found in this product, and many of them have been proven to stop free radicals. This is something that is very important to me, as a lot of beauty products that I used to use don&#x27;t do that. I like to consider myself a smart consumer, so I do a lot of research on products before I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;I did research on this product and it left me nothing but impressed. I purchased it based on what it was made from, and I am buying it again because of how well it does it&#x27;s job. It works better than advertised!</li>
    <li> My older sister looks younger than me.  I finally asked her why that was and she told me about Rose Hip Seed Oil and that is also had Aloe Vera, Rose Water, Mint Water and a ton of other great ingredeints.  I tried it and my face is looking younger after just 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Many people might be scared off by how small this bottle is, however a little bit goes a long way. All you need to do is use a little bit of this stuff, and you can cover most of your body.  I have had my bottle for a month, and it is only half gone. This product is a great deal and you would be crazy to pass it up!</li>
    <li> In just a few days of using this product, I had smoother skin. Because I am such a fair skinned individual, I used to have a major problem with sunburns as well. Ever since I started using this product, along with my sunblock, I have not had any problem with sunburns. This vitamin C serum is truly remarkableness in a bottle!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does everything that it said and more. Top-tier and amazing quality! 5 great big huge hollywood sized stars!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I used it for a couple of weeks, and was seeing results during that time frame. I felt tightness on my skin, especially around the eye area. In terms of pricing, Pura d&#x27;or offers the best price on the market. $19.99 for 4 fl. oz. is a sweet deal! Most sellers offer the same price for 1 fl. oz. Unfortunately, my skin is super sensitive. After 2 weeks of using this Vitamin C serum, I started experiencing this stinging effect. I was hoping the stinging would go away, but it didn&#x27;t. Despite my negative experience, I still recommend this product. However, for those who have sensitive skin, beware.</li>
    <li> I am 55 and I used to be a beach bum, so the sun took a toll on my skin and gave me small wrinkles even when I was young. When I heard that this product had natural ingredients, I checked it out and bought one. Now, it&#x27;s been more than two weeks since I&#x27;ve used it everyday and my skin looks amazing. The blotches on my skin had minimized and the pores look smaller. My skin literally glows every morning. At this point, I&#x27;ve been drinking more water because I heard that it helps to boost the skin&#x27;s natural mositure along with using this lovely product. I&#x27;ve never been happier!</li>
    <li> Large size! Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C formula is a super strong formula that fights hard to make your skin soft. Nothing that I have ever tried has worked this hard, and made my skin the smooth. I have been noticing a lot of improvement in the problem that I have had with spotty skin as well. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> How does it work? Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there anything else out there that can match it? No&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has it done with my skin? Wonderful things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: 50 Stars out of 5!</li>
    <li> This product is pure magic.  Tightens and brightens skin within mere days of starting to use.  The price cannot be beat.  I have purchased it for my sister and plan on doing so for other family members.</li>
    <li> A lifesaver! This is one word that I can truly describe this serum. Let me tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;My hubby and I had plans of going out on the weekend with his in-laws. However 3 days before that was supposed to happen, my face was all red with allergies I got from a serum I bought at a local store.&lt;br /&gt;I searched for Vitamin C serums and found this one! I knew that Vitamin C is a natural skin care allergy remedy. I was hoping that my skin would look better, improve my skin tone and make the redness disappear right away. And it did!&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised and amazed! After only one application, the redness on my face had diminished and my skin was velvety smooth. My prayers were answered the next day because all the redness was totally gone and my face glowed with freshness I&#x27;ve never had before. I&#x27;ve been married for 3 years now and for the first time my best friend had asked me what I was using because my skin was as fresh as a rose. I&#x27;m 31, so go figure, huh? lol&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this serum, I also use Aloe Vera mask gel which I put on at least twice a week and I guess Purador&#x27;s Vitamin C serum had literally completed my skin care regimen. I can honestly say that this serum truly makes my skin velvety smooth!</li>
    <li> this serum is light and absorbs easily and has a wonderful fresh scent. my skin feel tight and toned after using it for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;it helps my moisturizer and night creme absorb much better.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it !</li>
    <li> Not sure I can even rate this. I wonder if I got the right product as mine is the consistency of water. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all in the condition of my skin.</li>
    <li> I know that vitamin c helps the skin to lighten. and my problem is my face and neck complexion is darker than my body.after using this product for 2 weeks my face and neck are starting to lighten up and for 3 months my face and neck is the same complexion with my body.. now i&#x27;m not only using this to my face but i&#x27;m also using this product to my body and my skin...</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of Vitamin C Serum, this one exceeds the others. I have used it now for five months with great results. I like the natural ingredients(no chemicals, great for sensitive skin), light scent, large 4oz.size bottle (other brands are generally 1oz.), blue bottle with cloth bag (ingredients do not degrade), and the price was fair (cheaper per oz. than other brands). This serum was light and absorbs and dries quickly. My skin is smoother with diminished pores and fine lines. This can be used under makeup, although, I do not wear foundation or creams, so I cannot comment on that. The only con I have is it squirts out hard so you must cup your hand around the pump to reduce the amount wasted. I will definitely stick with the pura d&#x27;or brand and purchase again.</li>
    <li> I work outside as a volunteer for a senior citizen activities coordinator. The sun has not been kind to my face. I had a scare a week ago about a dark spot on my shoulder. It turned out that it wasn&#x27;t anything too serious and I quickly researched on the internet about what I could do to prevent dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from more sun block and working only indoors, I saw that Vitamin C serum is able to target and block sun damage from penetrating deep into skin cells. I bought the serum and used it on my face along with my sun block and the results were so dramatically different from before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had fine wrinkles and I wanted to find something to really help my facial skin. This serum lasts very long and my skin looks so good and feels nice to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will for sure buy again!</li>
    <li> love this product, use it every night all over face and body</li>
    <li> Well, when I finish this bottle, I&#x27;ll certainly write a review.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate serum product. After the first application my face felt fresh and moisturized. Will definitely order it again</li>
    <li> This is a great serum, and at a good price as well.</li>
    <li> I love all of Pura d&#x27;or products.  I am used to using their hair products, but this is the first product that I have used for my face.  The ingredients are natural (glycerin is the last ingredient, so I will assume that there is only a small amount of it in the product).  I wouldn&#x27;t advise putting it on before makeup because the serum doesn&#x27;t leave the skin smooth once you put it on, but my skin looked very fresh the next day.  Thank you for another wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Great Value and Great Product! I have been using this for weeks and can visibly see and feel a difference with my skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. It has a tad bit heavier feel than some serums but with the high concentration of Vitamin C the benefits are well worth it. It goes on well under moisturizer and does not feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Very good Vitamin C serum....</li>
    <li> Great product and I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I used to have a major problem with spotty skin. I felt a little embarrassed every time I would go outside, because I felt that everyone was looking at the little spots that I had all over my face. I went to the doctor to see if there was anything I could do about it, and she suggested that I use vitamin C to take care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, and it has cleared my spotty skin right up. I don&#x27;t feel as embarrassed to go outside anymore, and I have even received compliments on how pretty my skin is. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> There used to be a lot of skin spots all over my body. I purchased this product to try to combat all of the skin spots that I had. It worked as well, and in some places even better than advertised. I have milky, silky smooth skin. I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin, some people even tell me that my skin looks like a supermodel’s! This is nothing less than a five star product!</li>
    <li> I used to have a big problem with alligator arms! The skin on my arms would crack and feel like sandpaper. The week after I started using this product, I noticed that my skin started to feel a little smoother. At the end of the second week, it was much better. Finally, at the end of the third week, it felt like I had never had a problem with dry skin it all. The skin on my arms is smooth, and it seems to glow as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am now using this product on my face and legs. Wondering if it works well for those too? Let&#x27;s just put it this way, yesterday my friend told me how vibrant I looked. I am not used to getting complimented on my looks, I blushed.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s Vitamin C serum moisturizes skin better than any product on the market. I am living proof of this. If you want a product that will actually keep your skin moisturized, get this one. If you don&#x27;t mind dry skin, then get something else.</li>
    <li> Since I have started using this product, my boyfriend calls me his angel. The reason he does so is because he said my skin has been growing a lot. I am shocked at how bright this serum has made my skin. 5 stars! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product is work more effectively for me than many other skin care products. It does more than the vast majority of things that you can purchase in the store, and taken collectively, is a lot cheaper. I am very happy that I discovered this product, because it is made taking care of my skin a lot easier.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend knows that I&#x27;m into skin care products that are natural. So when he saw this on Amazon, he bought it for me as a birthday present. The first thing I noticed about it was the consistency of the serum. It was not greasy and it did not smell bad. I usually go for skin care products that have high doses of Vitamin C but most of what I have seen in the market are sooo expensive. So when I asked  my boyfriend about the price of the Vitamin C serum he gave me, I was shocked to know that it was incredibly affordable!! Now, I know that there are skin care products out there that are not pricey but are really effective for the skin. It&#x27;s been a month since I&#x27;ve used it and I no  longer have tiny pimples near my nose. My skin is glowing and it&#x27;s pinkish, especially after I wake up. I&#x27;m sooo impressed with this serum and I looove it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month since I&#x27;ve started using this Vitamin C serum. I did not have any doubts about it, seeing the many good reviews. I live in CA and most of the skin care products around here are a bit expensive. So seeing this affordable skin care is like heaven! I love its creaminess and it does not feel oily at all! Aside from Vitamin C, I know that Aloe Vera is also an excellent skin remedy because it&#x27;s used for cuts and burns. So, whenever I go to the beach I use this serum instead of my make-up base or instead of the BB cream! It feels light on the skin and so far my skin looks amazing! So I will give this product a 5 star rating it deserves!</li>
    <li> Taking into consideration everything that this product does, it is a lot cheaper than other separate products that only do one or two things that the other products do. I discovered this product one day, when I was looking for a multipurpose beauty care product, to take the place of all of the other expensive products that I purchased for my beauty care needs.&lt;br /&gt;This product has effectively taken their place, and I look forward to getting my third bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I am 39 and I have oily skin. This results to having large pores and a few large zits every now and then. I have never experienced a moth where I&#x27;ve never had any pimples. So when my bestfriend told me about this serum, I was skeptic because it was low-priced. I&#x27;ve always thought that low priced products would mean low quality but in this case, it wasn&#x27;t! I think this product rocks! The Vitamin C serum was thick yet it wasn&#x27;t oily either. Plus it had pretty good reviews so I bought 2 bottles. Looking at the ingredients, I&#x27;m pretty sure that my face is in good hands now!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum because I have acne and I have spent a lot on derma products that I am up to neck on credit card bills because of my acne. I ran across this product through an old pal. By the way, I am a 34 year old male and I&#x27;ve been having acne problems since I was 19. When I tested the serum, I did not feel any sting but I did feel a slight tingling sensation which is common in skin care products with plant ingredients as I was told. The only thing that sets this serum among other brands is that it works on acne at a price anyone can afford! Literally that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m ordering again before my Vitamin C serum bottle gets empty!</li>
    <li> To start off, this might sting a little. But it doesn&#x27;t last. And I don&#x27;t mind it because my skin looks great. It is brighter and clearer -- I have not seen it this way in a long time. Just a little every day or every other day  and it works wonders. Enjoy it people, because I sure do!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this product works on my face, neck and hands and I have only used it for a week, I am 67 years old and have spent a lot of money on other products nothing helped, this does. Can&#x27;t wait to see how well it does on my face in a month. Thank you</li>
    <li> I saw some people said it was sticky or watery but they must be used to lotion. It is just like the same consistency as most serum, and I have had some that were like water. I&#x27;m pleased with the results and think it&#x27;s a decent product with good value for the price. I did see a little redness after application, but this is normal and it goes away after a few minutes. I also got complimented from a friend about my skin after using this and that was a nice feeling. I&#x27;ll have to use it a bit longer before leaving more details.</li>
    <li> I love all Pura d or products that I have purchased! This seems to being lightening my sunspots but I think more time will review what it is really capable of! Smells yummy!</li>
