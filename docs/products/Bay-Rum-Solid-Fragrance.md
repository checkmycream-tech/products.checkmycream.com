      <li>I like it because it smells good and its convenient.</li>
      <li>it would be a great warm weather scent,</li>

      <li>so I am always smelling nice for the ladies.</li>
      <li>Really nice scent.</li>
      <li>Oh, and it smells nice, too.</li>
      <li>Nice smell...not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice having a scent that no one else has.</li>
      <li>Nice smell and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>Fragrance changes over time which is nice.</li>
      <li>Nice idea.</li>
      <li>Keep up the good work and more products that include Bay Rum</li>
      <li>The bay rum blends nicely with the clove.</li>
      <li>Nice for beards, too.  </li>
      <li>One nice lady approached me in the grocery store to ask about it, and she commented that I smelled \\&quot;like a gentleman should!\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This item has a very strong Bay Rum odor which is nice.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and great quality.</li>
      <li>Not the most sophisticated scent, but it&#x27;s inexpensive and a good starter for my son.</li>
      <li>It is very strong</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok because this stuff is potent!</li>
      <li>Very good with decent staying power.</li>
      <li>Great clean scent and easy to transport.</li>

      <li>I get so many complements on it.</li>
      <li>love this stuff,</li>
      <li>for the most part I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>does not get any more convenient than this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;only say if you like Sandlewood you will like this better Bay Rum.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very spicy manly scent and does smell great</li>
      <li>On the upside, the tin will last me forever making it incredibly cost effective.</li>
      <li>would be better size.</li>
      <li>I have bought three already and am planning to buy more for gifts.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>The staying power is respectable.</li>
      <li>It smells more of a&lt;br /&gt;Sandlewood which I love.</li>
      <li>More specifically, this Stingray Bay brand of Bay Rum is everything that a Bay Rum scent should be.</li>
      <li>I have been a Bay Rum user for many years now.</li>
      <li>favorite mens fragrance out there, and its so inexpensive.</li>
      <li>It was so dissappointing as, like I said, I love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the scent,  and so does my wife.  </li>
      <li>I love having people give me compliments on the scent and ask me what it is.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great just wish they had a bigger size</li>
    <li> It really smells terrific</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance a man can wear!!! I get so many complements on it. It has the smell&lt;br /&gt;of bay rum with a smoky oak flavor and it lasts all day. The amount you get doesn&#x27;t seem to be&lt;br /&gt;that much, but it really is, because it only takes a small amount on the back of your neck. Believe me,&lt;br /&gt;the women love this stuff. I have bought three already and am planning to buy more for gifts. This is&lt;br /&gt;my favorite mens fragrance out there, and its so inexpensive. Great packaging and super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you..............p.s. If you apply it correctly, the amount you receive last for over a month...You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my middle-school aged son who is beginning to experiment with deodorants and fragrances.  This product has an infinitely more tolerable scent than the Axe products his classmates are all using!  The fragrance is really strong; I had to show him that a very little certainly goes a long way.  He was heavy-handed at first, which isn&#x27;t hard to do given the concentrated nature of this product.  He&#x27;s learned to barely touch the wax now, and to rub it lightly where he wants the scent.  The actual fragrance is reminiscent of bay rum, but much heavier on the spice than I&#x27;m used to.  Not the most sophisticated scent, but it&#x27;s inexpensive and a good starter for my son.</li>
    <li> To me, this is one of those rare smells that stimulate your senses-like catnip for humans! It is a wonderful aroma. As other reviewers have stated, it does not last a long time, but an hour is a bit of an exaggeration.  It does not linger like fine cologne, but it does not cost like fine cologne either and a small amount is plenty to give you a terrific smell.  In addition, I had a very good experience with the customer service department of this company.  I liked my first can so well, I had ordered a second.  It was shipped in very hot weather and melted which effected the quality of the product.  After emailing the company to let them know what had happened, they not only mailed me another can at no charge, they watched the weather in my area to find a good shipping window!  When I find a quality product being sold by a company that stands behind it and strives to make me happy, I am impressed.  I plan on making this little can a regular!</li>
    <li> smells good, very small can</li>
    <li> I have to use only a small amount because this stuff is very potent! I use a Q tip to apply a small amount to the back of my neck. Has a old timey, grandpa&#x27;s cologne smell, but in a good way.</li>
    <li> The scent is very spicy at first but mellows quickly. Lasts all day and smells great! Highly recommend this classic scent!</li>
    <li> Loved the scent!!  Description said it was all natural, which I cannot dispute.  All I know is that I used it daily for a couple of weeks and then when I put it on, I would break out in an itchy rash!  It was so dissappointing as, like I said, I love the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not typically &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; to anything, but this did me in.</li>
    <li> Great clean scent and easy to transport. DO NOT leave in a hot car because it will melt.</li>
    <li> Really awesome scent and super fast shipping.  I bought this along with some bay rum beard balm and beard oil thinking it would be a great warm weather scent, I mean it&#x27;s bay rum , is pored by the islands. I have sandalwood for the cooler months, but unfortunately for me I wasn&#x27;t familiar with bay rum and it turns out, in my opinion to be a cold weather scent as well. It&#x27;s a very spicy manly scent and does smell great but perhaps a bit too heavy going spaces for the warmer seasons of the year.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this little gem before I purchased the dozen other bay rum products that I had to go through before finding this bit of bay rum bliss in a convenient solid fragrance form. Not to mention the great price. I love it so much I got another 5 tins to keep handy and put in my coat pockets and brief cases. This has me sold on the convenience of solid colognes. I have just started wearing it and consistently get compliments from everyone. Smells like just the suave gentlemen every man wants to be.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to wear during my &amp;#34;Workouts&amp;#34; at the gym; I sweat, let me say tha again, I SWEAT, and don&#x27;t want to chase everybody out of the gym.  I read another review of this product and decided to give it a shot.  WORKS GREAT, the more you sweat the more the fragrance activates.  I use Bay Rum products and I find this one perfect for what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not rate it higher is that the tin is smaller than it appears in the picture, however it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the light fragrance.  I should have invested in the other , more expensive, cologne.  I KNOW that is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Piercing scent. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I like natural scents, not chemical concoctions, which is what drew me to Bay Rum.  I first tried a Bay Rum aftershave which I liked very much, as it was delicate and pleasant, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to check out this solid fragrance since it&#x27;s all natural, compact &amp; portable, and alcohol free.  One thing I noticed when it arrived is that it&#x27;s notably stronger and muskier.  It&#x27;s almost a different scent than the aftershave I first used but I still like it.  It lasts a long time and I&#x27;ll probably buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! It only takes a very small amount and it lasts all day. I have to be careful with colognes because they can trigger my asthma but because the smell is so fresh and natural I have no troubles.</li>
    <li> With another company not making bay rum products any more it was wonderful to find this great sent of Bay Rum again.  It is a clean natural scent not flowery or over bearing.  Keep up the good work and more products that include Bay Rum</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent stuff. I&#x27;m not a bay rum expert but this does not smell like other bay rum scents I&#x27;ve smelled. To qualify that statement: I&#x27;ve only used Col. Conks shave soap in bay rum scent which smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first this smells like an old person (no offense intended). It reminded me of my grandmother. It has an almost powdery scent. So I was not going to use it. Then one day I tried a very tiny dab on my forearm and it smells very different on. It takes on a much more masculine scent. Honestly, the powdery scent that turned me off faded very quickly. With that said, I do like the scent on me and have worn it everyday since. All you need is a very tiny dab. I just rub my finger tip on it and rub it into my forearms, neck and chest. The good thing is that at 5:00 pm after a long day of work I can still smell it on my forearm. Try that with a spray cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was more solid. I expected a solid candle like wax substance. This is far more liquid. I did refrigerate it upon arrival as directed. It firmed up but quickly softened as it sat in my air conditioned room. Therefore, I would not carry it with me.</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer. This smells like that musky granny perfume that you can smell from 10 feet away. It has a floral and musk combination that just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have a hard time picking out any bay rum in it at all. Very very disappointed. Usually gross smelling scents get used to line my stinky garbage cans when they get smelling foul. I don&#x27;t think I want my garbage cans smelling like this stuff. I think I will seal it up very tight and throw it away, making sure it isn&#x27;t disturbed so no scent can ever escape and find its way into my nostrils. Oh and one more thing, this stuff is not a solid as advertised. It is like a runny version of Vaseline. IF it didn&#x27;t stink I still wouldn&#x27;t trust it not to leak in a car, a pocket, or a bag. I would have to drive the car into the sea, burn the bag, and possibly amputate the leg where this stinky cologne would surely have penetrated through my pocket and into my skin permanently. Keep your legs and avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Nice idea. Great to freshen up or to use after a shower. It does not take much and it lasts a long time. Nice smell...not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I really want to love this (because of size and convenience) however it is SO strong that is a little cloying.  It must be overwhelming for anyone near you.  The one use I have for it is to put a TINY dab on each foot before putting on socks and boots.  At the end of the day your feet still smell okay.  Maybe worth it just for that?</li>
    <li> A long lasting strong odor. Unfortunately the cologne does not smell like bay rum, it smells like a grandmother.</li>
    <li> This is strong stuff. A wee bit goes a long way. I work hard in a sweaty environment and have to deal with people as well. It is nice to smell good all day long.</li>
    <li> I like Bay Rum and it is getting harder to find. I came across this and ordered it.  I like the fact that I can carry it around and smear a little on if need be at some point in the day and it isn&#x27;t overwhelming. It isn&#x27;t the best bay rum smell but isn&#x27;t bad, hence the loss of a star.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine said it smells like sandalwood... I&#x27;ve never smelled the other bayrum products yet so I have no idea which one really smells like the real deal. But this one smells sweet to me like fruits made into candy... like those soft fruit bars I buy at Costco on the holidays.. instead of smelling masculine, I think this makes me smell fruity. and it kinda makes me crave for candies.. yeah its weird. But not bad at all... I enjoy the smell..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had compliments on this bay rum smell. I like it because it smells good and its convenient. Just rub some on your neck, chest, or wrists. Don&#x27;t need a lot. It goes a long way. Might get another for traveling</li>
    <li> Not much bay fragrance, way too much pumpkin pie spice smell.  It is a well made product, but it sure isn&#x27;t bay rum.</li>
    <li> My 18 year old son loves this product!  It really smells like Bat Rum.  The scent is not too strong.</li>
    <li> Classic cologne fragrance for those occasions when you want to truly smell like a well groomed man. Shipped quick too.</li>
    <li> This little thing is fantastic.  It was a little smaller than I expected, about an inch and a half accross.  However, this smells absolutely amazing, and a little goes a long way and lasts a long time, definitely a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous fragrance - long lasting and you only need a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;If you have it in your cart or on your wish list, don&#x27;t hesitate - buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for a year now. I only opened my second tin 2 months ago. A little bit goes a long way. The fragrance lasts all day and is an outstanding Bay Rum fragrance. MOST IMPORTANT: I have terrible dry skin and have used every lotion known to man or woman. This has cured my facial &amp;#34;flaking.&amp;#34; I wear a very short beard and have used multiple lotions and tar-based soaps and shampoos. Daily use of this has totally cured me of this affliction that I have suffered with for the past 30 years. In addition, my face is not greasy and I do not look like I dipped my face in olive oil. This is the greatest product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This fragrance does not smell of Bay Rum in the slightest. It has that chemical spill aroma one catches when passing by a perfume section in a department store. It doesn&#x27;t smell natural, earthy, manly or anything else one might use to describe bay rum. I put a dab in my beard and my eyes were watering within 5 minutes. I&#x27;d rather smell like garbage than toxic waste. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product if you&#x27;re looking for a Bay Rum scent.</li>
    <li> I am a general contractor/ real estate investor in Texas.  I am outdoors 80 percent of the time.  In the Texas heat that can be a problem.  Going from the summer heat to a meeting can be a problem.  This solves that problem for me.  Small and easy to carry, I can put a little on and feel confident that I am not going to offend anyone in the afternoon meeting.  My only advice would be to be prudent when applying, a little goes a long way.  I am constantly complimented that I smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small size makes it perfect for travel, and easy to carry in my briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, oh and the price, what a bargain.</li>
    <li> First and foremost while it is a pleasant scent in my opinion it is not very masculine.  Obviously this is subjective but I ran it by a couple female friends and they agreed, they said at best it might be unisex.  The scent does seem to be long lasting, it appears to be a natural product and I love the portability, but I won&#x27;t be wearing it again.</li>
    <li> Great concept.  That&#x27;s where it ends.</li>
    <li> i really like the consistency of this stuff.  it lasts about four to five hours before i need to reapply.  Problem with Bay rum is that its either a love or hate scent.  Great product if you like the scent. Horrible if you don&#x27;t.  Would like to see this company offer different scents, and i would really like to see them do combination scents with bay rum.  Example: Bay rum/lime/vanilla or something similar.</li>
    <li> Natural and earthy masculine fragrance that wears well for any situation, whether casual or professional. Very economical since a little goes a long way. Very convenient to carry along for travel since there is nothing to spill. Great gift idea for Father&#x27;s Day or any occasion.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for - a TSA friendly product that smells great without overpowering. A little goes a very long way.. just barely brush a finger tip in the tin and put it on pulse points for many hours of fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this.  it actually smells too sweet; almost like perfume.  I thought the bay rum scent would be more traditional.</li>
    <li> Nicely blended scents make this a joy to wear. I actually keep this in my desk at work since it&#x27;s hand to apply and is great to have on stressful days. The smell will lift your spirits and perhaps those that have to deal with you. &#x3D;8-O</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a sold fragrance. I will never go back to spray colognes or body sprays. This method of cologne lasts all day without fading. More specifically, this Stingray Bay brand of Bay Rum is everything that a Bay Rum scent should be. It is a classic, manly fragrance. Prompt shipping, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Very good with decent staying power.</li>
    <li> smells like a herbal muscle rub but the good news it didn&#x27;t last too long...was not for me at all</li>
    <li> is not solid is a cream liquely</li>
    <li> Great product will easily purchase this again. I absolutely love the scent,  and so does my wife.  So it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;win win&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! I love having people give me compliments on the scent and ask me what it is. No one has heard of it. It&#x27;s nice having a scent that no one else has. Dare to be different!</li>
    <li> Great scent especially for the price!! Prompt delivery,and even a thank you card...would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> I am new to the solid cologne thing, but I really see the value here. You are getting a natural product that seems to last as long as any other cologne. It also smells manly, like bay rum should. I don&#x27;t recommend shoving your face in the tin and sucking air though. It is a very different scent when concentrated, similar to London Gentlemen or Blackbeards Delight. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love the scent of this Bay Rum solid;it is earthy and long lasting with a twist- not just the traditional Bay Rum. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells great, closer to Clubman than Captains choice, which to me is GREAT. captains choice does not appeal to me, while Clubman is my fave, this Solid Bay Rum is going to be kept in my car or at work so I am always smelling nice for the ladies. haha</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I was looking for something to wear midday at work since colognes usually run out by then. Masculine overtones, with cedar and musk dominating. I want to try more scents from nz, wish they had samples so I could pick my favorite.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff just got it today and already ordered more for my gym bag and work locker. Has a nice scent not overpowering and seems to last a while.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product. Subtle, yet classy scent. Highly recommended for those that enjoy bay rum aftershaves. I&#x27;ll certainly be ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> This scent is super strong and a little goes a long way! I rated this 3 stars because the strong spicy/clove scent was too much for me and it gave me a headache. HOWEVER, it must be noted that I have sensitivities to many colognes/perfumes/scents. I&#x27;m sure that most people who loves spicy scents will probably love this perfume and it wont bother them. I purchased this for my husband thinking it would have a manly type of scent and I had no idea what to expect. A plus for me is that the formula is very smooth and it glides onto and blends into the skin very nicely. I&#x27;ll just have to tell my husband to use it sparingly!!</li>
    <li> I live in Phoenix, Arizona USA and I ordered a tin of this bay rum solid fragrance in July where the temperatures often exceed 100F (38C) and it arrived liquified. If you order this product during the hot season, put it in a cool place (like a refrigerator) for about thirty minutes to give it a chance to re-solidify BEFORE opening the tin. The first time around I did not do this and I had liquid bay rum all over my hands and the kitchen counter ... not a pleasant experience since this stuff is very potent and little bit goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I order this product again? Yes.</li>
    <li> A GREAT SMELL and reasonable priced.  Not over powering but lasts and lasts. When I think of the money wasted on more expensive products that faded away long before This Bay Rum. Try it, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> great bay rum scent. I put a little in my beard and am good to go. It scent lingers quite a while. I wish I didn&#x27;t use it up so fast</li>
    <li> The good stuff first: the consistency of this product is excellent -- solid, but easy to get just a dab to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is beyond me why any man would want to apply this scent. (I&#x27;m not sure most women would want to, either.) In stark contrast to other reviewers who thought the scent smelled \\&quot;manly,\\&quot; I found it overly cloying and far too floral to ever be mistaken for a scent a guy would wear. Rather, it smells a bit like an old lady trying to cover the scent of her aging body with too much perfume and not quite succeeding. I&#x27;m thankful that I tested this out after I was already in for the evening because 30 minutes after I put it on, I could no longer stand it and jumped in the shower to make sure I washed every trace of it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve literally tried dozens of bay rum formulations. This doesn&#x27;t smell remotely like any bay rum ever, and it undoubtedly smells the worst of the lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, my wife confirmed my opinion that in no way does this scent smell \\&quot;like a man\\&quot; or \\&quot;like a gentleman\\&quot; should. Instead, she said it smelled \\&quot;weird\\&quot; but definitely \\&quot;girly.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Really nice scent. Subtly classier and more &#x27;real&#x27; smelling than &#x27;old spice&#x27; Got it for hubby for Christmas... He likes it too.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Very potent and spicy! Just a tiny amount will leave you wafting in the breeze all day. My only complaint is that the base compound is much less solid than expected. I used probably a couple of weeks worth just by scraping my fingernail across the top and rubbing it on my neck!  Wife loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased drug store bay rums and they just faded quickly. I even looked into possibly making my own, but that&#x27;s a bit extreme. This stuff is amazing. It lasts but is not overpowering. I have sensitive skin, but there was no allergic reaction. Just the scent I was looking for at a remarkable value.</li>
    <li> I happened to run into this product, so I tried it on a whim. I really like it. It dosn&#x27;t smell like Bay Rum . It smells more of a&lt;br /&gt;Sandlewood which I love. The staying power is respectable. The price was good. I would like a bigger size can. This container is .9 of an ounce. I think 2oz. would be better size. This is a good product  for the office. You can freshen up if you are doing something on the run. I am wondering why they don&#x27;t make this in Sandlewood. They would&lt;br /&gt;not have to change much in their formula. I will keep buying this prouct as long as I can order it with out shipping. I can&lt;br /&gt;only say if you like Sandlewood you will like this better Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> Chicks dig it...at least mine does.  My wife approved and that is all that matters.  Don&#x27;t apply this to any part that you have just shaved though....really stings.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Great smell... that is light, citrusy, and sexy for men.... I hate over kill im fragrances. So this works for me.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice bay rhum aroma however it isn&#x27;t a long lasting aroma. If you need a quick hit before a meeting or whatever this will do it. It&#x27;s easy to carry and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I had to come back and edit my original review. Since the original review I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to purchase this item a couple more times. Today my last order of two cans arrived. I opened one then the other....then I went and pulled out a previously ordered can that I haven&#x27;t used yet....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOOOooOOAAAaaahhhh!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Three cans the same size, marked exactly the same and each can had a different amount. There was such a noticeable difference that you could categorize them like the three bears....small, medium and large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to contact the seller and maybe send them a picture. I wish I had a scale to measure them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good thing for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 4/4/14 - Sent out an e-mail detail my findings. I received a reply and another tin is going to be sent out. Apparently there was a problem with production and how these things get filled and how the product cools. Interesting but I feel it&#x27;s a great gesture to insure you&#x27;re keeping the customer happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the most part I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was something I remembered from when I lived in California. I chose the five star rating not only because it has a very manly smell, but because the 0.9 ounce container holds a large amount of the really great Bay Rum fragrance. I am really happy with this purchace.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, and lasts long.  However, a little goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> Not a lot of aroma-very little bay rum essence.  Does not last long. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Bay Rum Solid Fragrance for Men does last longer than liquid colognes, but the smell is different from typical West Indian Bay Rum.  I guess one could get used to the different fragrance as it is not bad or overpowering (you control the amount to apply!).  The small tin and solid form of the fragrance make it very convenient to carry, especially for air travel (carry-one luggage), and for use at the gym.</li>
    <li> Scent is rather strong. Too strong of a fragrance for my body. I instead use it in my car, as car freshener</li>
    <li> Not bad.  I think it needs to be tweaked with just a little more bay rum and a little less perfumey?  That said, it&#x27;s convenient.  Nice for beards, too.  Chicks like it.</li>
    <li> Every maker seems to have its own take on Bay Rum - this one&#x27;s certainly a classic Bay Rum but with an appealing and natural sweetness. \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; is the key word for me, as this pleasant, mellow scent doesn&#x27;t make a huge impact - it&#x27;s a great smell, but remains a subtle one. The tin contains a beeswax-based cream that rubs on clear and isn&#x27;t greasy. A little dab under the jaw or at the base of the throat is plenty. A fine alternative for those who want a classy, traditional, male scent.</li>
    <li> Nice smell but a little goes a long ways.  Too much can be overpowering to me while wearing it.  On the upside, the tin will last me forever making it incredibly cost effective.</li>
    <li> This Bay Rum solid fragrance makes even the lowliest, saddest excuses of men seem like heroic, furry-chested studs to every single hot and classy lady on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;Do I need to continue...?&lt;br /&gt;But seriously - it is an old-world smell that, because of its solid nature, lasts all day and gets stronger as your body heat rises. It works well, since that&#x27;s when you really begin to stink. The only con to this item is it can melt if exposed to high heat... And when that oil spills into the floor, your car smells like a barber shop for the rest of its  life... Makes for a good conversation starter but be careful.</li>
    <li> Excellent Bay Rum scent.  Heavy on the Bay part, so if you want the more spicy scent, splash on some cloves, lime, and coconut with this solid fragrance and you won&#x27;t be able to get enough of it.  Will order again and again!</li>
    <li> I gotta say with just a little  it goes a long way. I hear all the time from people damn you smell great what are you wearing , so I tell them and where i brought it from.</li>
    <li> If you like the scent of bay this is great.  a bit weakon the rum scent but a nice clean herbal smell.  it also make s a great moustache/beard conditioner in small amounts</li>
    <li> I really like the scent, it&#x27;s the third time I purchased this item there is no better Bay Rum than this one. The item ships really fast</li>
    <li> I use and enjoy the Koru Naturals products I purchase.  Quick delivery and great quality.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT natural fragrance for men.  I highly recommend it and gave it to my friend, my son, and my grandson.</li>
    <li> I have never had so many compliments about my cologne as I have in the short amount of time that I have been using this Bay Rum. One nice lady approached me in the grocery store to ask about it, and she commented that I smelled \\&quot;like a gentleman should!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just came back from a vacation in the virgin islands where I fell in love with the scent of Bay Rum, however when I tried some of the colognes there, they all seemed astringent. Not this one! It has a wonderfully natural scent, and thanks to the solid nature of the product, it stays with you all day. The tin is small enough that I can take it with me to the gym and not worry about a leak or a broken bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this product and I highly recommend it, just let me buy more before you place your orders!</li>
    <li> Wow, the scent on this is unexpected. I mean thatin a good way. You only need a very small dab for it to last all day. People will notice it. Definitely buying another tin of the stuff when I run out!</li>
    <li> Unlike some solid fragrances, this is a real powerhouse. Not much required to have an all day scent. Fragrance changes over time which is nice.</li>
    <li> This solid fragrance brings back lot of memories.  Smells the same as the last time my senses met with the bay rum. Last all day long and delivers well.</li>
    <li> It seemed like the scents of modern day products don&#x27;t last long with me so one day I was in the barber shop telling the barber this and he slapped some Bay Rum on me. It lasted all day. A little dab of this product will go a long way and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a solid fragrance. I like the concept and it works great. The first time I used it, it seemed like I couldn&#x27;t get enough on my finger to apply, just a thin film. But that is more than enough to produce a noticeable fragrance. The first time I accidentally used more than that and it was way too strong. Just a little bit smells great and lasts a while, but it eventually fades away. However the tin is tiny and I find myself re-applying sometimes as the day progresses. The scent is similar to Pinaud&#x27;s Bay Rum scent, but a little heavier on the spice and a little lighter on the rum...if that makes sense. Its strong at first application and has a bit of an oily feel to it, but in less than a minute it absorbs well into the skin and the scent mellows out and is quite nice. I like that the container is small enough to take with me anywhere and I can freshen up when ever I feel the impulse. Wish they had other scents to choose from like Sandalwood or other popular after shave scents and I hope they expand their offerings in the future. This was definitely worth my 8 bucks.</li>
    <li> The package was a lot smaller than I expected but it&#x27;s ok because this stuff is potent! I think you could use it to smuggle dope across the border because it is so smelly.</li>
    <li> A natural cologne that actually works -- and lasts all day.  Essential oils never cut it for me and I&#x27;m always hesitant to use artificial colognes with the preservatives, etc.  But this cologne is just great.  As an added bonus, it actually smells fantastic too.  A classic, manly scent.</li>
    <li> First off it doesn&#x27;t smell like any bay rum I have ever used.  It has a peculiar smell.  I&#x27;ll grant this - it&#x27;s hard to get rid of the smell once you dab some on.  Possibly later it smells a little better.  Maybe I just got used to it.  I really can&#x27;t recommend this.  I&#x27;m also perplexed by the &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; or wax like form.  It&#x27;s like a mustache wax but DON&#x27;T use it for that.  You&#x27;ll be smelling the stuff for days.</li>
    <li> This is my scent. I use it everyday &amp; only have to buy more every 3 months. A little goes a long way &amp; a lot is just too strong. Last all day. Plus its all natural.</li>
    <li> This item has a very strong Bay Rum odor which is nice. Overall it&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again as I prefer a spray or splash than a balm.</li>
    <li> This is a Bay Rum in a solid form and works great if you use it in very small amounts.  A little dab will do it!  Nice smell and lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I have been a Bay Rum user for many years now. This is the first solid fragrance I have ever used. It is without question the longest lasing and one of the nicest smelling bay rums I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they did some other scents like sandalwood, in this solid format. 95% of the many expensive colognes I have used over the last 40+ years do not last more than 1 hr. on me. So I am a very tough customer regarding scents and how long they last.</li>
    <li> great product. very subtle fragrance. does not get any more convenient than this.</li>
    <li> Packaging and customer service is great, almost overdone. But the item is not as described. Does not have anywhere near the amount of long lasting scent it claims. Couple of hours tops and very faint. While a great scent, easy to apply like others say it just doesn&#x27;t last. Yes as the wearer you can notice it. But no one else will unless they jam their face in your neck. After years of online shopping, especially here, I have learned and important lesson when reading reviews before buying. There is nothing wrong with 1 star or 5 star reviews. But just as a bunch of 1 star reviews that say, \\&quot;This sucks\\&quot; really tells you nothing and makes the overall rating suspicious a bunch of multi-paragraph professionally written 5-star ratings should raise the same flag. High marks for scent and ease of use, low marks for duration, size ( its smaller than a 50 cent piece not much larger than a quarter) and shipping time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give as a gift overseas.  Due to airline regulations I couldn&#x27;t send regular cologne due to it&#x27;s alcohol content (potentially flammable).  This worked out just fine as an alternative.  It&#x27;s true that a little goes a long way..... Oh, and it smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> volume is a lot smaller than I expected, but seems to be lasting. aroma is nice, starts off heavy on the other fragrances but mellows to the Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> Bay rum to me is the essence of out door life it has the fresh smell to stand up outdoors. I was very surprised when I opened&lt;br /&gt;this small can of solid fragrance. My first application that I applied was way overboard you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;And it takes time to get used to its fragrance I put it on in the morning and it will last until about three p.m. And I have been&lt;br /&gt;ask a few times what I was wearing by both men and woman. I would recommended this to any man that wants a fresh&lt;br /&gt;clean sent that stands out from the crap sold at the department stores targeted to teenagers. One word of caution&lt;br /&gt;I am surrounded by national forest where I live while on a walk I was confronted by a large bear it was standing up&lt;br /&gt;sniffing my direction. This spice smell could confuse a hungry bear that you are a meal!!! Wear it well my friends.....</li>
    <li> Some background here may be helpful. I am 50 years old and rarely use  cologne. When I do it&#x27;s good ol&#x27; Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;OK, I thought this smelled awful, way too spicy, even just using a small dab I found it to be an overbearing spicy stink.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the other reviews it might just be me, hence the background info.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I guess you can always see for yourself.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance. The bay rum blends nicely with the clove. I&#x27;ve had a lot of good comments about this scent!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. Not overpowering and not subtle either. Perfect man scent. The wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, dont be thrown off by the size of thIs container. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It smells like spicy rum as the named suggests. I personally like the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  A great scent, easy to apply and not overbearing.  Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This solid fragrance smells fantastic.  Bought for my husband and he was very pleased with it.  Scent lasts all day</li>
    <li> Great smell. Definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Longer lasting than I originally thought.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great Scent!  Get some and smell it!</li>
    <li> The best solid perfume on the market! Amazing smell strong but not overwhelming. It lasts several hours. The only issue was that it melted due to heat but the seller offered to send me another one immediately. Great service!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend. I was a little weary of buying offline, since I am so sensitive to most scented things. Decided to give it a shot and we love it! No allergy-like symptoms like I get with almost all perfumes and conventional products! We dont use much. It is very strong so you only need a teeny tiny little bit. The scent weakens after a few hours so if you wear this in the morning, an evening reapplication is needed... keep in mind we only use a TINY amount so your mileage may vary. Its a traditional bay rum scent without being too musky. It has a crispness to it that I like. Will come back for a reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> Strong, pleasing, long-lasting scent.  Wax base melts nicely on touch.  Little tin is easy to  carry along.  Wear it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for something that would extend the smell of my Clubman Pinaud bay rum after shave which is decent, but the smell dissipates very rapidly... I am on a search for the classic Bay Rum smell in what I buy. Thinking the Bay Rum Solid Fragrance for Men might be the answer, I bought a tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am greatly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so why am I disappointed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I don&#x27;t like smelling like my Grandmother! And she is dead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a classic Bay Rum smell, more girly spice, than a manly Rum smell.  It has a nauseating, covey, flowery, spiced pumpkin bread smell to it. No masculinity to it at all, quite old lady feminine to me. Actually musty old lady!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on with a heavy smell, it fades quite fast, but the wearer can still smell it.  Again even when it fades there is no &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; essence. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those who are looking to have that &amp;#34;pirate&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker was, when I let my ladyfriend  catch a wiff, she pulled back, and asked; &amp;#34;What in the world is that?!?! Did I mug an old lady???&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it one (1) star for quick delivery, easy open tin, ease of application. Otherwise, faggedaboudit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note to those who will still purchase this product. Be warned, if you live in warmer climates such as I do in the Mid Atlantic, watch keeping this where temps rise.  This is a wax product and melts at low temps.  Avoid keeping in your pocket, really avoid storing in your car for sure!</li>
    <li> Very good and authentic bay rum scent.  Lasts  a long time</li>
    <li> It is much easier to apply than regular cologne; the fragrance is refreshing and a subtle application on the wrists, neck, and chest lasts all day.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want people standing around you, then this product is for you. Otherwise don&#x27;t waste your time or money. I wind up throwing it away after the first use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves bay rum, but it spills when traveling so this is a great alternative to the liquid bay rum!</li>
