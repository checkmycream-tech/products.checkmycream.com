    <li> Good color and nice blend with complexion. Had searched for this very color in stores and I was very glad and surprised to find 2 for a pretty decent price on line.</li>
    <li> when i put it on it clumps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Black Cherry for almost two years and as I&#x27;m runing out of my current tube, I bumped into this and I was so happy because 2 for that price! I can&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail.It&#x27;s great on my dark skin.</li>
    <li> i found this cheaper at dollar general also the people who take pictures need to upgrade their digital cams and have a model try on the lipstick for these pictures!</li>
    <li> I love the color and looks great but I noticed if I&#x27;m drinking something the lipstick smears. I end looking like joker with my smile looking extra wide (LOL)</li>
    <li> Loved the color of this lipstick, perfect condition, brand new in packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> Amazing color for Fall. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this lipstick. It came in a pack of 2 for a great price. I gave my sister the 2nd one and she loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much for red lipsticks nor am I one for bright purples but this shade is the best of both that I have come across. I am a dark skinned gal, UD shade 9.0, and this is such a rich, velvetty cabernet color which I can&#x27;t get enough of. I didn&#x27;t know when I purchased it that it was a two pack so what a surprise for me when I opened the pack (a good one). Yay!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shade, I love using it to outline my lips with, and to get an ombre effect that fades into my other shades.  This is a staple shade for me, it is very creamy, not drying to my lips which I love.</li>
    <li> I was watching a review on youtube and the artist used this shade of lipstick. It photographs beautifully and works well for any skin tone and especially shows up the teeth. I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and was happy to find it online. I am glad  I did. It really is a pretty color. A heads up it is a dark cherry color for those use to wearing lighter shades of lipstick.</li>
    <li> In LOVE with this color! perfect for Fall and Winter!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my order as I had looked all over and had been told that it was no longer&lt;br /&gt;in stock...but , just last evening happened to check while shopping for another item and there it was ! It arrived ahead of time , was superbly wrapped and was exactly what I had been looking for. Thank you ! Will definitely return to this vendor.</li>
    <li> It melts,  and is not top quality.  You get what you pay for.  I like MAC so sucked up and bought the haute couture.</li>
    <li> This is really amazing lipstick. Feels like a dream. I use it to do my Lynn Yaeger lip look - I don&#x27;t think I would consider using anything else.</li>
    <li> Great lipstick! I&#x27;ll admit I was expecting it to be a bit redder, but I like the color anyway. It&#x27;s a very nice dark purple with pretty good staying power and it doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick color. They arrive fresh and not dried out. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Cute color. Great if you&#x27;re looking for a grunge or gothic look.</li>
