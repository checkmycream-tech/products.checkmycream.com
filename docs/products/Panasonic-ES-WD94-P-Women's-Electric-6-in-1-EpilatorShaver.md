<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for my wife a year ago. She says she likes it. good enough for me...</li>
    <li> It works great!!!  I had an older model Emjoi (32 tweezers), but this one is a super replacement; especially with all the cool attachments!!!  :))  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator about 3 months now. Before this i had a cheap $25-30 model that i got just to see if i could handle epilating. I&#x27;ve only ever shaved my legs and waxed them once, so the thought of a bunch of tweezers plucking hair from my legs didn&#x27;t sound like the greatest idea. Looking back I wish I would have started with this one. Its like all electronics you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a first time user, having the dual rotating heads makes it hurt a lot less and after you do the first time it hurts even less. normally what i do is i use it dry for my lower legs and the part of the upper legs that are less sensitive. The more sensitive areas i wait until i can take a bath and do it then, the hot water helps. On average i epilate once a week and it doesn&#x27;t always get all of the hairs but i would say it gets about 98% and if i want completely smooth legs i just shave afterwards and then i have 100% smooth legs for at least 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am part Italian and have awful hairy legs if not controlled, even though i&#x27;ve only been doing this a couple months i can go a week and i only have that 5o&#x27;clock shadow - you know when you shave in the morning but by 5pm you have stuble on your legs. Every girl should know what i&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. But here are some key points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - can be used in shower/bath/partially submerged *i think the manual says don&#x27;t keep it completely submerged for a long time. has a light to see the fine hairs. cordless so you can take wherever (my other model wasn&#x27;t cordless and i didn&#x27;t think much of it because i didn&#x27;t think i would want to use it other than my bedroom/bathroom...since having the cordless i take it in the yard on sunny days to use, i sit and watch a show in the living room, i&#x27;ve taken it on vacation). different head attachements (i got this mainly for my legs, i haven&#x27;t gotten the courage to try my armpits yet. but i have used on my feet and chin with the smaller attachement and having one with less tweezers is really nice for the sensitive areas). On the main head there are two rotating rows of tweezers instead of one big one, i think having the 2 rows helps grab more hairs so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - like some of the other reviewers have said, the option of turning the light off would be nice, you don&#x27;t always need it and i&#x27;ve almost blinded myself a time or 2. remembering to charge it - i knows it sounds like \\&quot;well duh\\&quot; but after every use i would say to charge it even if you just used it to touch up a spot so that next time you go to use it, its all ready to go (there were a couple times the battery died on me in the middle of epilating). Some of the accessories are just unneccesary but i guess still nice to have (i haven&#x27;t used the razor or the pumice). Truly and honestly i can&#x27;t think of anything else i don&#x27;t like about it, hope this helps and happy shopping.eet and chin with the smaller attachement and having one with less tweezers is really nice for the sensitive areas).

    <li> I had two options when looking for an epilator.. The two best were this model and the Philips HP6576. After much time invested on trying to make a decision I picked this one because of the waterproof feature. I can&#x27;t say how much that helps, especially if your doing your WHOLE body like I am. This product made my husband it&#x27;s best supporter too. It also made our honeymoon much more enjoyable &amp; never needed to shave once. After using it several moths now I&#x27;ve had hair that grows back in different time waves as others. So it seems I&#x27;m epilating once a week if I want to get every hair. But that&#x27;s more of a touch up and can go 2 weeks before realizing I have some longer stray hairs. The time it remains charged also has not been a problem. It definitely last long enough for a full shower &amp; you can get pretty much everywhere within 45 minutes. I love this product and will never go back to \\&quot;the normal way\\&quot;. Oh also it did hurt a LOT, but knew the pain would only decrease over time, (and it has!!)</li>
    <li> not for me, maybe the machine works perfectly but it is painful, I use now only the stone for the calcaneus, that is a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> First, I’m a guy and I use this epilator on my chest.  I was tired of shaving and figured this would be a better solution to the problem and a better use of my time.  Shaving every day in the shower was a waste of time and water.  Women have been using similar technology for years so why not me?  The quick answer is, buy this epilator and deal with the pain.  It’s simply worth it.  The long answer is a bit more detailed…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you deal with the pain of the first epilation and the ensuing welts, you’ve gotten through the worst part.  I had a couple drinks plus 400mg ibuprophen, epilated in the shower and it was torturous.  That being said, I did my entire chest and stomach in one session.  The welts lasted for 5-6 days.  The good news is that the welts lasted a shorter amount of time after each subsequent session.  After epilating for about 5-6 times the skin might get a little red but no lasting welts appear.  I’d feel confident using this product the night before going to the beach with no hesitation.  The one exception is if you haven’t epilated in a couple weeks there may be some redness that lingers due to the larger amount of hairs that are being yanked out.  In addition, the pain is WAY less and is honestly manageable even for a man who is not used to getting waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not a masochist, you may want to do 10-15% of the area where the hair is to be removed at one time.  Keep even pressure on the epilator with short strokes going over the same spot a couple times.  While this means it will take longer (multiple sessions/days) than if you epilate the area all at once, the duration of pain will be significantly shorter and easier to handle.  I also prefer to epilate dry so I can see what I’m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After epilation the body feels really but not as good as if you had just shaved.  I’d give it an 8.5 on a scale of 1-10 with a razor being a 9.5.  Some areas feel better than others but overall the simple fact thatyou can epilate and not touch a razor for a week or so is fantastic.  There may be some stray hairs here and there but nothing I feel is overly problematic.  There will be hairs that break off.  This is a pain.  You will have to wait until they grow out enough in order to epilate them.  Some reviews have said to wait 1-2 days after shaving in order to epilate.  I followed the directions and waited until the hair was the appropriate length.  That took me 4-6 days.  The longer you wait (up to a point) the better chance of the tweezers catching the hairs and completely removing them at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still shave once every 2-3 weeks (as opposed to every day) and I feel that the razor exfoliates my skin and provides a nice blunt edge for the tweezers to grasp.  You should exfoliate in some way every day to avoid ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, buy this unit and epilate away.  With any luck it will save you some money on your water bill and encourage your wife/girlfriend (or whoever) to get a little closer… I’m not sending mine back any time soon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it, but she recommends using a search engine to find some operating procedures (in terms of after skin care) from the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife reports that the pain of tearing one&#x27;s hair out is diminished with each use and is greatly reduced with proper hair length at time of epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point that I had not seen reported widely, and affected me as a person of Mediterranean descent, people with dark and curly hair shouldn&#x27;t be using this thing. I still have a rash of ingrown hairs on my left forearm where I tried to &amp;#34;demonstrate how little it hurts.&amp;#34;  I was right, it didn&#x27;t hurt, but the ongoing in grown hair problem has not been fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Works, but make sure you give your skin some TLC after. Also, don&#x27;t be prone to in-growns like me.</li>
    <li> I got tired of shaving and decided to try the epilator before going the expensive route of laser hair removal!!! The first time it hurt like HELL - I actually just did half an armpit lol... Next day I did the other half and honestly thought about returning it....as the days went buy - I had to shave te other arm... And after two weeks after shaving my right armpit every other day and the left one was smooth and no hair... I decided to suck it up and get it done.::. Now it&#x27;s a walk in the park.... Since there are very few hair to be removed at a time!!!! I love it .....worth very penny!!!! I am a razor free woman lol!!!!</li>
    <li> What can I say, I actually enjoy using this epilator. It may have more features than I need (the shaving attachment), but who cares!</li>
    <li> Great product! With the  pain that others have noted in the review I had no problems after the first few passes</li>
    <li> I almost bought a laser system but it was too expensive for me. My wife wanted this badly so i bought it for her. She loves this item. She can&#x27;t stop telling me about how good it is. For what it&#x27;s worth i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Battery discharge very quickly&lt;br /&gt; Not even working for 30 minutes. Not running while power cable is plugged inn. Not happy</li>
    <li> This Epilator is everything a woman needs.  Finally I found something that does the work that I needed done.  I am not going to write much about this product because there are great reviews about it already, what I am going to say is buy it and you will not be sorry because it is definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> hands down the best epilator I have used and I have tried many. Doesn&#x27;t hurt almost EVER!! I realize this is a device pulling hair from your body, but for me, the lack of pain is bordering on the magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are many attachments, some unnecessary and most very useful..especially the foot care attachment. I was skeptical about the wet/dry feature, but this panasonic is a natural amphibian in and out of water! Battery life is also very good. No complaints and its been 6 months already!</li>
    <li> Have been using epilation as my primary hair removal process for 20+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st - Epilady - rotation coils. Very painful. After this, no other product hurts too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd - Gently Gold - Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd - Something my sister bought, but she couldn&#x27;t stand the pain, and then gave to me. Good++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd - Braun, Silk-Epil, Xelle (green) - Excellent. Removed short hairs. Nice light. Corded. Lasted 5 years, then motor slowed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th - Tried the Panasonic ES-WD94-P Compete Ladies Wet or Dry Epilator Set, White/Pink . Cordless. 40 min use after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - wet/dry &#x3D; easier cleaning. Cordless &#x3D; better portability and more comfort during process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - couldn&#x27;t just plug in and do it whenever I wanted, HAD to wait for charge. It only removed 30-40% of hair with 1st pass. Could NOT get it to remove all hair no matter how many passes. Tried every direction. Returned it as defective as none of the other reviewers stated this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5th - Braun - Silk Epil, Xelle. New version (pink).&lt;br /&gt; Bought this on Amazon after returning Panasonic. Wanted to buy the same one I had, but its old so goes for $100, while this is around $50. Works the same so far (only used once). The only difference is that it comes with a shaver/trimmer head in addition to epilation head. The old/green one only had epilation head. I do not use the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. I use the file for heels 2-3 times a week and it works great. I have been using epilator on my legs and I love it. I have hardly needed to shave since starting it.</li>
    <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t cut as good still leaves hair there. Just not what I expected very disappointed won&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> But it works great.  And after the first few minutes you go numb anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;Takes the hair away and keeps it away.  Each use there is less and less hair so it takes less time to finish.</li>
    <li> Lately it seems to be difficult to find a product that does what it claims. I decided to purchase this item in hopes of finding a quicker, more efficient way of making my grooming rituals more streamlined. Waxing and depilitories destroy my delicate skin while shaving proves to be a daily task with regrowth appearing several hours later. Laser treatments were expensive  plus having to make and keep appointments with an already hectic schedule was inconvienient. I was initially skeptical--okay, terrified-- about trying an epilator after the trauma of using the original epil-lady from 20+ years ago.  The Panasonic&#x27;s wet/dry feature is what finally changed my mind and I took the plunge.  Indeed, I am glad I did.  I must confess, I purchased this item in March and did not begin using it until June.Yes, I was a big chicken. I re-read the reviews and took to heart the &amp;#34;glass of wine&amp;#34; recommendation.  With a fine pinot noir in hand I took a warm bath and started with my legs. Once I got used to the pulling sensation it was not bad at all. A few days later I tried my underarms, my usual trouble spot that  looks like I have a five0&#x27;clock shadow after a few hours after shaving. In a word, &amp;#34;OUCH&amp;#34;. I stopped after a few seconds and regrouped. The next day, I resumed after a long soak in the tub; much better and I completed both underarms. I am now a pro and there is only a VERY minor discomfort. My hair re-growth is significantly less already and I can go without shaving my legs or underarms for a week. I am totally amazed and just love my panasonic. I have yet to try my bikini area or even venture to think about &amp;#34;travelling to Brazil&amp;#34;(if you catch my drift) so I cannot comment on those areas as of yet.  I do need to comment that I also used the GIGI post epilation lotion that was suggested when I purchased the Panasonic. My skin is extremely sensative and this did the trick in leaving me free from irritation or bumps.</li>
    <li> This is the best epilator/electric razor that I have ever owned. The little foot attachment file is the icing on top. My daughter uses the razor attachment, while I use the epilator attachment. We both love it, and I feel that I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth by not having to purchase two different tools (we do NOT share the attachment heads!).</li>
    <li> It works as described. However, it does take a lot of time to clean the bits of hair that&#x27;s in the epilator/shaver, and its tweezer.</li>
    <li> Wooooow the pain!!! However, it does do the job! I&#x27;m a little wimp when it comes to ripping hair out but I do like the results. The only down fall is that you have to keep on epilating to get the results you want and since I don&#x27;t take it well I kind of gave up on my legs. I didn&#x27;t even make it to my thighs (lol). I do use it for my arm pits on a regular basis. My pits were way sensitive to razors and I never got that smooth look when I shaved. Using the epilator, however, I get that look. It hurt a lot for that first time epilating, but now it&#x27;s not too bad and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in all thick-like. The attachments are nice too. Love the callus one. The charge holds for a while I would say. I was expecting to have to charge it a lot, but maybe because I use it on a small area, I don&#x27;t have to charge it as much. I would recommend this product to people that can handle pain!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected!  Now I want to gift to others as well but there is one problem.  I can&#x27;t find the serial number and only have 10 days to register it.  The paperwork says the SN is on the back of the unit, there is nothing there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver/epilator for a few months now and it&#x27;s still working well. The foot callus remover works really, really well. The regular shaver works well, although, still not as well as shaving with a normal razer. The epilator works very well and the different covers are useful when you&#x27;re getting used to the pain of epilating. I haven&#x27;t found this to be extremely realistic for leg hair removal because it takes a long time to remove that much hair and it is pretty painful (wet epilation doesn&#x27;t hurt as much but I usually don&#x27;t take the time while I&#x27;m in the shower so I mainly do dry epilation). But I love the epilator for smaller areas where hair is less dense, like my underarms. I epilating a few days in a row to remove all of the hair and not kill myself from pain. Once I got the hair removed, I&#x27;ve just been doing quick touch ups 1-2 times a week and it&#x27;s working really well.</li>
    <li> After  other brands, the  Pansonic epilator became my favorite : relatively fast , durable, can be used  dry or wet.  I love the little light . Makes hair more visible .</li>
    <li> Having no other products to compare this with, I love it!! Works great!! Works both on my arms &amp; legs.</li>
    <li> So many different pieces, I am having a hard time understand how to use this. I have started with the first piece and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do what it is suppose to do? I will keep working with it because Panasonic is a great brand.  Lot of uses for the Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I am hope I will get used to it and be able to us all the different parts.&lt;br /&gt;I would say I would recommend this to my friends instead of a razor.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL! I LOVE IT! I HIGLY RECOMEND IT. You won´t regreat . Get one! I loveeeeeeeee it so much :))</li>
    <li> I decided to buy a new epilator to replace my old emjoi epilator.  I have sensitive skin that is prone to getting bumps just from shaving.  After researching several of them, I decided to invest in this one because I liked that it can be used wet or dry and that it came with several attachments.  I know that some people loved this Panasonic based on the reviews, but I was not impressed with it because it picked up fewer hairs than my 10 year old epilator and left my skin irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the shower with a little bit of body wash.  The built-in light was incredibly helpful for seeing missed hairs, but it only highlighted the many hairs that remained even after going over them with the epilator 4 or 5 times.  Then within a few hours of using this epilator, I my legs started to itch and I noticed that I&#x27;d developed incredibly red bumps all over my legs.  I thought that maybe this was a fluke skin allergy or irritation to something else and that it might not be the epilator causing it, so I waited three weeks or so until the bumps were completely gone and tried using the epilator again.  Same thing happened! Turns out, the epilator was breaking the hairs rather than pulling them out, leaving me with pretty itchy and irritated-looking ingrowns all over my thighs and calves that wouldn&#x27;t go away for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed it didn&#x27;t work because I was looking forward to a convenient hair removal method that I could use in the shower, but I definitely would not recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator. My first one was half the price and worked better but a friend dropped it and it broke so I decided to get a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; more expensive one and ended up disappointed.</li>
    <li> I overall really love the product.  I did not find the wet feature really helpful thus not particularly like it not working when plugged in.  I would also like this product to have more tweezers.  I love that it all falls apart and can be rinsed clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tough critic when it comes to hair removers. So far, I&#x27;ve tried a lot (waxes, springs, etc.) and none of them have lived up to my expectations. Hence, I always find myself returning to the tried and true razor. Well, I can finally say that I&#x27;ve found an alternative that I actually like, with a few caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted the Panasonic epilator on my forearms as my test drive with the Gentle cap, and I used it dry with no gel. It removed the hair to my satisfaction but left a red rash for a few hours afterwards. I suspect if I&#x27;d used the product wet or with the gel as recommended I&#x27;d have had less of a problem there, so no points deducted for skin irritation. (I&#x27;ll report back if that becomes a longstanding issue.) I opted for the Gentle cap over the Beginner almost immediately to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large areas are time-consuming, make no mistake about that. It is therefore doubtful I will ever be using this as a regular alternative for my legs. Smaller areas don&#x27;t suck up too much time, though, and the lasting results are worth it. Two weeks later I was just starting to feel some stubble and my hair tends to grow fast. Plus, epilation didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would, so I may just use the Panasonic epilator without any cap in the future to speed things up even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my experience.</li>
    <li> i am sooooooooooooooooo happy with this little machine, all in one :) i don&#x27;t need to worry if i have a sudden and unexpected date :)</li>
    <li> Dont like it at all, it hurts soo much, cant handle it. and i have to pass it more than once in order to get all the hair, dont like it.</li>
    <li> This is pricey for a torture machine but I decided to take the risk.  Now I am glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic is alottttt quieter than my emoji chic epilator which always scared the shizzzznit out of my dog whenever I would turn it on.  I would have to hole myself up in the bathroom and hope it didn&#x27;t sound like i was sawing a dead body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wayyyyy quieter.  Quiet enough my dog will sleep right through it if i was using it right next to her.  Still makes noise but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a meat grinder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all the different heads available and the LED light on it is awesome.  I just got it today and it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was hesitant at first to spend 90 buckaroos for something that rips hair from my skin and skins my feet I for sure - when this reaches it&#x27;s undetermined demise - will buy another one.</li>
    <li> This product tried pulling instead of shaving my hair. I tested the quality of its advertise claim of being able to shave all parts of my body on my legs first. Let&#x27;s just say after a short while I had to stop! And I won&#x27;t DARE use this product anywhere else! It felt like someone was tweezing each follicle with a loosely gripped tweezer.  I reread the instructions and tried several months later thinking that I was at fault and received the exact same results!! Yowch!!!!! I would pass on this product</li>
    <li> This is the second epilator I have used. The first was manufactured by Braun (model Se7681 Silk-Epil 7681.) Comparing the two, I prefer the Panasonic model. There is not much of a difference between the two. They both weigh the same, have an led light to illuminate your skin, have a decent amount of attachments, (though the Panasonic has more,) and have about the same battery life before needing to be charged. The only thing I liked better about the Braun epilator is that it had two speed settings for use, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the two speed settings aside I would recommend the Panasonic epilator. The retail price is about 30 dollars more, but on amazon the two products are practically the same. What I like more about the Panasonic model is that it has more attachments than the Braun, as previously stated. The extras include a foot buffer for pedicures and a smaller epilator head for more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the extra two attachments are not something you need, than I would go with the Braun epilator. Either way both are great products. I just liked the Panasonic model a bit more.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would say this much less write that this Panasonic epilator is even better than my Braun silk epil! I have been epilating for the last few months so I knew what to expect. But if you&#x27;re new to the whole epilation thing, know that initially it is uncomfortable and that there is no magic epilator that will take that away. But the good news is that it gets better each time and you have to epilate less often as well. If you have always shaved and never waxed or epilated, you will never have felt legs or arms as soft. This epilator is lighted, cordless,  and has six attachments included. I use the main one mostly since I have never tried it on my face or underarms (not brave for that one yet).  It feels more comfortable than the Braun and I have experienced less ingrown hairs than it. I do use a loofah to exfoliate but it has been less of a problem with the Panasonic. There is also a pumice attachment for your feet exfoliation and I just love it. I also love the light like my Braun since it helps to target the tiny hairs. The battery charge is quite good and also it feels good to hold in the hand. You can use this wet or dry and if you&#x27;re new, you might find it more comfortable to use in the shower. Great device at a great price!</li>
    <li> stylish and works great.  my second one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been so compelled to write a review but this epilator has honestly changed my life.  I bought it at Target.com for about $65 because Amazon Prime was out of stock.  I chose the Panasonic because I read a blog that said of all the epilators on the market today, this one was rated least painful.  I also based my purchase on the low amount of one and two star reviews compared to the competition.  This product may not have as many total reviews, but as far as bad reviews, there aren&#x27;t that many compared to Braun, Emjoi, etc.  Here is why I rated this product 4 stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAIN&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to pain and this was my main concern.  I have very fair, sensitive skin.  I am happy to say that this product lives up to the hype.  It is not that painful.  I first tried it on my legs (did it dry while watching tv) and had no problem whatsoever.  I next tried it in the shower on my underarms.  While the pain is much greater than the legs, I am happy to say that I was able to get through it in about 15 minutes and what pain I felt was well worth it.  My underarms have been smooth and hair free all week.  I pluck the random hairs with a tweezer and I&#x27;m perfect.  I used the underarm attachment on my upper lip and again, more painful than the legs but I got through it.  I now do weekly maintenance on all areas and there is not much pain at all.  I have never caught my skin in the blades though on two occasions I almost did because the guard fell off - that was my fault though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTACHMENTS&lt;br /&gt;Although there are too many attachments I think, there is one for smaller areas like arm pits and face which is very nice.  There is also a attachment to turn your epilator into an electric razor which can come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR REMOVAL&lt;br /&gt;It does a pretty good job of hair removal.  I have fine blonde hair on my legs.  It works better on thicker hair but it still gets the job done.  I just have to go over my legs a few times more than my underarms where the hair is thicker and there is less of it.  The built in light is very handy to see exactly where the hairs are.  For thicker hair, this thing rocks.  Like I mentioned earlier, it&#x27;s been a week since I did my underarms and I am still as smooth as day one.  Like any hair removal method where the hair is being pulled from the root, you will see bumps but those go away in a few hours.  All epilators will give you temporary bumps!  I have very sensitive skin and the bumps went away within hours.  I use PFB after shaving which helps alleviate irritation and makes my skin silky smooth.  You definitely can&#x27;t epilate before going out but that&#x27;s the advantage of epilation.  You are smooth for weeks so there is no need to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WET/DRY FEATURE&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome.  I can watch tv and do my legs or do it in the shower if I want.  I like to do both.  Some prefer one way or the other but it is good to know that both methods are just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life has truly changed.  I no longer take 30 minute showers because I have to shave my legs, underarms, and bikini area every day.  I no longer have to spend hundreds of dollars on razors and waxing/sugaring.  When I&#x27;m with my boyfriend, I don&#x27;t have to worry about second or third day stubble because this epilator has done its job pulling the hair from the root.  I wake up and feel confident that my skin is as smooth as it was the day before.  I haven&#x27;t tried my bikini area yet.  I am waiting to get sugared this week but I plan to use the epilator for maintenance so that I never need to get sugared again.  I will report my results when I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  For a mid priced epilator, this is certainly one of the best, least painful products out there.  This is my first time using this method of hair removal and I will never go back to shaving again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I got sugared 2 weeks ago and started using this epilator on my bikini area. I find thatthis machine works well on very short hair causing less pain. I have been doing a tiny bit of maintenance every day and I feel that I won&#x27;t need to go back for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I just did my arm pits today and it didn&#x27;t  at all! I was amazed at the difference.  I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars - it&#x27;s great to not have to worry about embarrassing stubble.this machine works well on very short hair causing less pain.

    <li> The epilator works very well and easy to use. Multiple attachments are very helpful. It can be used in the shower as well reducing the pain of the process</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this epilator works. It is much much quieter than my Braun Silk epi. It works quickly, the attachments are nice , but the single best feature is that it is really comfortable to use! This is without question the most pain free epilator I have ever used. I highly recommend it over anything here in Amazon, and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> I got this over a year ago and it&#x27;s still working just about as well as when I first got it. I have probably used it about once/month and the battery power has remained consistent. I usually use the large epilator head to epilate my legs. I have coarse hair and it works well at grabbing it. It can pull pretty short hairs, especially if you exfoliate the day before and do not moisturize beforehand. It does hurt but that&#x27;s the case with any epilator. It lasts about as long as waxing my legs (3-4 weeks), but different hairs have different growth cycles so at first you may need to use it once a week or so. It&#x27;s also fairly easy to clean with the little brush that comes with it. I have used it in the shower but generally use it dry. I have small hands but it&#x27;s still a pretty comfortable size and grip for me. The only thing I wish was different is that it would work while plugged in so if the battery runs out while I have it in use I can finish without waiting for it to recharge.</li>
    <li> The most painful experience of my life. Add to that you get more ingrown hairs than you do with shaving or waxing. Even with exfoliating. Lovely! I&#x27;m back to waxing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife for Christmas gift. Excellent value for the money!! Purchased in conjunction with Emjoi After Epilation Cream with Growth Inhibitor....</li>
    <li> As somebody who&#x27;s shaved her legs for almost 20 years, I was so glad to discover the world of home epilation. Basically, it means you don&#x27;t have to shave your legs (or whatever) for a couple of days. When your hairs start to come back, they&#x27;re far less spiky than before. It&#x27;s great. However, let&#x27;s be honest - using an epilator isn&#x27;t a walk in the park. It&#x27;s using a tool to RIP the hairs from your body. While that in itself is a fairly unpleasant idea, this 6-in-1 by Panasonic has made it as pleasant as one can, I think. The wet/dry is a great feature, as using this in the shower with some shower gel really makes the process less painful. There&#x27;s also a tiny light that shines down where the skin contact will be so you can see the tiny hairs that are doomed to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery on this isn&#x27;t great, so if you forget to plug it in after a good use, you&#x27;ll be lucky to get in a second full epilation session on the same charge. Don&#x27;t forget to plug it back in and you&#x27;ll be golden.</li>
    <li> My wife liked thus so much I decided to get my daughter one. She used to sit in he shower at least once a week and shave. Now she can sit in her room and do her legs once a month.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it might be an es cape from the blade. It didn&#x27;t do as well as I expected. To me it wasn&#x27;t painful. I actually kind of liked the way it felt, I even took the covering off to get as much contact as possible. I tried the product for almost a month. It seemed to not pull out nearly as much hair as I expected and had a hard time with the tougher rooted hair like around my ankles.unfortuntely after trying it I also noticed that my skin seem more bumpy, not sure what that was all about, that could also just be how my own skin reacted too. I wouldn&#x27;t knock it completely, but I have/had higher expectations . The battery held charge well. The light was very handy and all the attachments were awesome.</li>
    <li> I was unsure where to begin when purchasing an epilator and saw one youtube video on this epilator. I am VERY glad I risked it and bought this epilator! It is wonderful. I use it when in the shower mainly, I think it is less painful, but really not so painful after the first pass, like plucking your eyebrows, after the first time, you are used to what it feels like when you pluck. I am now sort of addicted to it to be honest. I REALLY like how long it takes to have hair grow back, my hair growth before was enough to have to shave every day and my hair follicles were thick and very noticeable. With the epilator, I can go many days before I need to use it again and the hair seems to be smoother when there is regrowth. And when it does grow in it seems more sparse. I lost the main leg head part and was really sad to think I needed to repurchase the entire epilator all over again, but I found the head I needed on Panasonic.com and now do not have to buy the entire epilator again. I am VERY, VERY HAPPY with this product. I think this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever left on any product. That is how satisfied I am with the product.</li>
    <li> I got this for wife, and she absolutely adores it. Great product at a superior price. It was a bonus that it was pink, her favourite colour.</li>
    <li> My fiance wanted me to get this as a solution to my shaving woes. I was hesitant at first..I mean, who wants their hairs ripped out?  The first time was horrible. It hurt a lot but I soldiered through with the help of some \\&quot;liquid courage\\&quot;. (I also figured if I could get a tattoo on my side, I could epilate my legs!) I was able to complete both of my legs from the knee down in one go. I also did my armpits and bikini zone then I called it quits. I waited for my skin to stop being sensitive (it took about one to two days) and then cleaned up any hairs that were left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, It&#x27;s been a week later and my skin in those areas are super soft and hair-free still! I am very pleasantly surprised with how much I love this thing. LIke I said, the first time hurt. But keep going and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light on this epilator helps a lot when it comes to seeing the hairs and it&#x27;s very nice that there are different \\&quot;levels\\&quot; of epilating the different heads offer. I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head first and worked my way up to the more \\&quot;hardcore\\&quot; ones as I got used to it. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this epilator set.  It has a nice sized main head for epilating large areas like your legs and smaller, more specifically designed heads for the more sensitive areas and those that require greater precision.  Though it works on either wet or dry skin, I prefer to use it on dry skin as I feel that it has a tendency to drag and catch on wet skin. It cleans up easily, has charged quickly, and held the charge very well during my sessions and the led light illuminates the area you are working on quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one feature with this unit that impressed me over others is the \\&quot;foot care\\&quot; attachment.  It is a rotating buffer cylinder for smoothing calluses and rough areas on your feet.  I love it!  I constantly put lotion on my feet to try to keep them soft and hydrated but small callouses form from wearing sandals in the summer and just from general living.  This tool is wonderful for helping to remove those hard areas and to maintain smooth skin, along with my regular regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other epilator, Braun Se7681 Silk-Epil 7681 Wet and Dry Epilator, seemed a little less painful when I used the \\&quot;massaging head\\&quot;, but it did not have the foot care head and is a bit pricier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, Panasonic ES-WD94-P model is, in my opinion, an excellent epilator set with a number of neat attachments and helpful features to meet your needs.  It&#x27;s also reasonably priced, comparatively.</li>
    <li> I  like all the attachments that it comes with and you can use it in the shower.  It  works well taking the hair out from the root.  I  recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has options that I do not need by works well for what I do need. Thanks for a nice product.</li>
    <li> Mathis is the second epilator I bought. The first one was not cordless. I have had this one for about 1 year now. It still works great. The cordless battery last a long time. I only recharge it every 4 moths.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat new to the epilating world.  I was impressed with the attachments that were included and the first two times of using the product, I used the beginner attachment which reduced the area that was being epilated and minimized the pain.  The first time I used it on my legs, it left my legs with red dots wherever a hair was removed.  Those red dots stuck around for about a day.  The more I have used it over the last month though, the less irritated my skin is after use (I may get a little redness but it goes away within hours) and it is less painful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that you can use it dry and that is my preference because it means I do not have to fit it into my normal shower time (I have young kids so sometimes I don&#x27;t have the luxury of long showers!)  I also am a big fan of the light on it... even in a well lit room, it helps show you where hairs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot attachment is incredible at removing calluses. It&#x27;s pain free and seemed to be more effective at reducing calluses than most pedicures I&#x27;ve had. My feet are now smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives would be how painful it is on other body parts.  I tried this epilator on my armpits and could not handle the pain (or the burning that lasted for days afterwards).  I will stick to a razor for that!  Also, I read reviews that said you only need to use it every couple of weeks but I find myself using it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am impressed with the product and enjoy using it for hair removal on my legs.</li>
    <li> 1.5 yrs in and I still love it! Wet/dry, attachments, charging time, everything is awesome! I don&#x27;t epillate anymore but I still keep this in the shower!</li>
    <li> This item is handy to have. Though using it for the first time is slightly painful, it does do what it says it does. I returned this item because I found another one just like it at a much better price. But this one came with several different attachments, including one for your feet. It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift for her birthday and she tried out for a little before we returned it. She said it was painful using it and left allot of hair behind. She tried the regular shaver attachment and it did not work any better. In fact her old cheap electric razor does much better that this. She could not see spending this much money on something that doesn&#x27;t perform as better than her older razor. It was cheaper going with another razor and waxing when needed</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve tried epilating before, but quickly returned to Nairing my legs due to the pain.  This Panasonic is amazing; yes, you will feel a little tug, but it was quick, without (much) pain, and I had no red bumps on my legs afterward. (I have a very low pain tolerance, BTW).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bright LED light makes it easy for you to get every single hair. The charge lasts a long time, so you won&#x27;t need to recharge every time you decide to epilate, probably every other usage. You can use this wet or dry, and it cleans up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature of this Panasonic (besides being almost painless) is this model comes with a foot buffer head, very similar to an Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  I have a problem with cracked heels, and although I will probably still need to use a callous remover with the razor blade occasionally, the foot buffer included with this Panasonic will help smooth my heels between times.</li>
    <li> I JUST got this from my UPS driver 2 hours ago, and I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before. Here is my first impression for other first timers, I&#x27;ll try to be brief in case you&#x27;re already going blind reading reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have: thick strong smooth hair with dark roots (white girl, fair skin, hair on legs and underarms moderately finer than my black friends&#x27; hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms first, because i hate the stubble, shadow, burn. I used a trimmer on the hair there yesterday to have 1-2mm hair today (don&#x27;t bother if you buy this model--trimmer included).  Tried dry first because the veterans seem to prefer it. humidity is high right now, and my body runs hot-- nothing will never get my pits dry enough to glide, and the SLOW progress was torture.  based on reviewer tips and wet operation instructions, I did the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. drank 2 beers (actually lime-a-ritas)&lt;br /&gt;2. took 2 aleve&lt;br /&gt;3. wet my pits and applied body wash to the epilator rollers (have it running while dripping the soap dead center on head, sucks all soap in rather than flinging some off.)&lt;br /&gt;4. holding skin as taut as possible slid epilator (with full head and cap) up and down, and left to right, smooth and slow until the pinches stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pain washed over me in goose-pimply waves, but determination and intoxicated detachment pressed on, and after just a few minutes I have the smoothest arm pits I&#x27;ve ever had. I have red bumps of course, but they&#x27;re soft smooth bumps, and they&#x27;ll go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will do my legs and bikini area as well over the next couple days, and will update review as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regarding the product itself, it has all the accessories shown, a real shaver with a guide cap for pre-epilating trim, a 2nd head for smaller areas, a sanding roller for feet. storage bag is nothing to speak of.  use something else to store it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: End of week 1, first time epilating is time consuming. I&#x27;m very busy, so I&#x27;ve been doing a bit at a time when I shower. Definitely prefer wet/foamy. Keeping close contact with skin is very important for quick first-pass plucking. Direction of effective passes is just like shaving. Revisits to under arm area to compensate for varying follicle growth has been much less painful and less irritating. The light really helps in the shower-don&#x27;t have to try to aim the body at ceiling light source.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator based on others&#x27; reviews and was not disappointed.  Can&#x27;t quite believe that it can be used in the tub, but it can.  I like the variety of heads that come with it.  The light is a very helpful accessory, too.  Any epilator will hurt at first, but time and repeated use generally diminish the sting.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because a reviewer said it was gentle. What I didn&#x27;t count on was that the more I used/use it, the more hair I grow on my face. Yes, it&#x27;s a good shaver, but now I have to shave! I wish I&#x27;d stuck to simply tweezing, which I am also still doing.</li>
    <li> I used to hand tweeze my underarm hairs and it took forever.  This is a time saver!  It does a really good job and shucks off most hairs within a minute, leaving just a few left to hand tweeze off</li>
    <li> My first epilator. It didn&#x27;t hurt my skin. I&#x27;m not using any foam. After bath, get towel to clean my skin, then i used it. Long battery. I can give this product 5 stars. But, maybe i have more hair at my skin and i&#x27;m never use product like this, i repeat same area more longer than anyone. Other than that, almost perfect.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the epilator as I found it to be painful but the callus removed is great. My husband uses it also. and the razor  is good</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife so the verdict is still out.  It look like a nice set but she will have to be the judge.  I think she will be pleased but because she has not used it I can not reccomend it yet.</li>
    <li> I have a shaving allergy so I&#x27;m forced to use an electric shaver. I get terrible ingrown hairs as well so I can&#x27;t speak for the epilator part of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get a good enough shave, you have to go over the same area more than 10 times. I lost count after that. This shaver is also really hard to clean. I&#x27;ve done everything I can to clean the inside crevices, but I&#x27;m still left with black crap inside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this is that it holds a charge really well. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, just buy a men&#x27;s electric shaver instead! I like this one!- [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]]</li>
    <li> My wife began using this new Panasonic item and is enjoying it from the beginning.  This newest addition to the Panasonic&#x27;s line is quite a product.  It is loaded with features that can help the user get great results that last !  It seems to be easy enough to use, and offers a wealth of options, from offering \\&quot;silky-smooth results,\\&quot; to \\&quot;removing hair, smoothing calluses, and a whole host of possibilities.\\&quot;  My wife tells me that it takes a while to get used to the item, but she enjoys now what it has to offer.  The price of the item seems to vary, so check around for the best pricing.  The new ES-WD94-P will probably serve you for a long time, and provide you with great results.  You might want to read the product&#x27;s box before you buy it.  It gives you a pretty good description of what it can do for you.  Even the box is heavy.  Try it- you might like it !</li>
    <li> This is my second Panisonic epilator, so I was already accustomed to its use and was used to the feel of the tweezing process (ouch!). I&#x27;ve used this epi both wet and dry with similar results. I&#x27;m beginning to prefer using it in the shower with a bit of shave cream. The only criticism is that it&#x27;s slippery when wet. I haven&#x27;t used the shaving head but have used the buffing head on callouses and it did a great job.  My old epi didn&#x27;t have the buffer.  The light is a very nice addition making it much easier to see missed hairs. One improvement I was hoping for was the location of the on/off switch but it&#x27;s still in the same bad location. I constantly hit the button while I&#x27;m using it which is annoying. Panasonic makes a nice product that gives me smooth legs for a week.</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE this epilator!  I&#x27;ve had one other one, a Braun, and it wasn&#x27;t bad.  But this one is SO MUCH BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you&#x27;re new to epilation, yes, it does hurt.  There&#x27;s no sense in beating around the bush on that one.  You&#x27;re ripping hairs out by their roots, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt.  Although it&#x27;s worth noting that after the first time, it&#x27;s much more comfortable.  After the first time, it doesn&#x27;t really hurt, it&#x27;s just a slight skin irritation.  Just grit your teeth and bear it through the first time, then each subsequent time, it&#x27;s much easier!  After the first time, you&#x27;ll have nice, smooth, hairless skin.  It&#x27;s totally worth it, I promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after you epilate, always put something on your skin to soothe it.  Some people like something like aloe vera or a gentle moisturizer.  Personally, I like coconut oil.  It helps calm and heal my skin, and since I&#x27;ve been using it regularly, I&#x27;ve noticed a beneficial difference in my skin!  (I use it on my face too, and it has not caused any breakouts, and I&#x27;m definitely prone to breaking out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this epilator is that you can use it wet or dry, and you can use a shaving cream if you so desire.  Honestly, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefit to using a shaving cream, (it&#x27;s allegedly supposed to make epilation more comfortable), but I have noticed it&#x27;s easiest to epilate after you&#x27;ve had a warm shower, so the hair is slightly softer and more willing to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a number of attachments, so I&#x27;ll go through each:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primary epilator head with multiple covers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my arms and legs and it works fantastically.  It catches just about every hair, which my old one did not.  It also has a few different covers, so you can control how wide/large the area is at a time you&#x27;re epilating is.  I&#x27;ve found the smaller ones to be more comfortable in an area you haven&#x27;t epilated before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial epilator head:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this attachment.  I unfortunately have some facial hair (don&#x27;t we all!) that needs removal.  This one is perfect for small, delicate areas like chin, upper lip, and that area between your eyebrows that often sprouts extra, unwanted hairs.  The face is probably the most painful place I&#x27;ve epilated, but after the first time, it&#x27;s barely even an irritant to my skin.  It&#x27;s amazing how well your skin will adjust after just one epilation!  After epilating in this area, I will also use coconut oil, and have great results with it.  (No breakouts!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving head:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great, basic attachment!  It has a guard on it that will shave your hair to about the right length for immediate epilation.  (You do not want to epilate with long, fully grown hairs - they will break and will be more painful, and they won&#x27;t be removed properly.)  It&#x27;s also a great basic razor for any place you don&#x27;t want to epilate.  I use it on my underarms and my bikini region.  I am not yet brave enough to epilate either of those areas!  Though perhaps once I&#x27;m completely comfortable and used to regular epilation, I will try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumice stone head:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, seriously, I think this epilator is worth buying over any other JUST for this head.  This thing is AWESOME!  I&#x27;ve always had issues with rough skin on my feet, and this thing is a godsend.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time, and you&#x27;ll have soft, silky smooth feet perfect for sandal weather!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I didn&#x27;t have this little guy 10 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  There is really almost no negatives for me in comparison to other epilators.  I just love this one, and if I ever need a new one, it will most definitely be a panasonic!  The only thing that could potentially be a drawback to some is you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  So if you forgot to charge it, and were hoping to use it while it was charging, it won&#x27;t turn on while plugged in.  But it charges in an hour or two (it&#x27;s really fast) so that would be an incredibly minor drawback in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering an epilator, and want the best of the best, BUY THIS ONE!  I promise, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  :-)</li>
    <li> I was having skin issues with regular shaving in the shower.. So, I decided to try an epilator. I am so glad I did. It&#x27;s so easy and I can use it any time.. Like when I am sitting on the interwebs watching the Youtubes.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to thick hair and this bad boy gets the job done. For first timers. Yes. It will hurt. Follow everyone suggestions..&lt;br /&gt;Shave the day before. Hold the skin down to make it firmer on your first go. I suggest only doing a little bit at a time if the pain is too much for you.. and epilating every day for the firsts week to get the strays.&lt;br /&gt; After my first go, my legs did turn into red little dots, but they vanished by the next day. So, remember to epilate at night so your legs have time to fix themselves. I can now epilate casually at my leisure any time.. my legs do not get as red because I use it every day or every other day to pick up the strays.. So it&#x27;s not like plucking every hair out of your leg at once.&lt;br /&gt; The fact that this little guy has like 4 different head attachments is great. I love the shaver and the foot buffer. They&#x27;re really a great addition to this little guy.. and the light on it really helps to see all the little stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt; Overall I love this little guy and I am never going to shave my legs in the shower again.</li>
    <li> I have only started using this over the past 3 months and I love it. The hair on my upper lip was getting so dark that I was bleaching every other day. Any other  method to get rid of the hair resulted in looking as if I shaved as my hair grows incredibly fast! I use this product maybe twice a week. The area is smooth and there is no stuble! I haven&#x27;t even tried it anyplace else......I plan to expand use!  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This epilator/shaver was advertised as being comfortable to use and it was  not. It hurts when it pulls the hair out and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; at all. The only worthwhile feature was the buffing attachment. That actually works painlessly. Sorry that I bought this and I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect solution for my upper lip hair. I have waxed in the past but hate that the hair has to be a certain length to be able to wax it, so you are forced to grow it out. This epilator can latch on to hairs I can&#x27;t even see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used an epilator before... it stings a little bit but you get used to it after a couple seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this on my legs as well but found it just took too long and I didn&#x27;t have the patience. Since the upper lip is my top priority and it&#x27;s perfect for that, I don&#x27;t even mind only using it for that area.</li>
    <li> Came used. Hair clogged in blades.</li>
    <li> I love this as an epilator.  I have owned several different ones over the years and i needed a new one. After reading several reviews i decided on the panasonic.  I have not been disappointed. I have not used the shaver so I really can&#x27;t comment on that function. I would recommend this product and may buy another myself as a gift.</li>
    <li> I used an older model Panasonic epilator until it just died. This updated model is fantastic! It has not pinched my skin even once in the 6 weeks I have used it. My old one had gotten to the point that it took forever, but this little devil is very quick.</li>
    <li> This was an upgrade for me from a 15 year old Epilady that finally wore out.  WOW!!  This is quite a leap forward.  Much quieter, easy in the hand, light source very helpful.  Haven&#x27;t tried it in the wet mode, or the stone for foot callouses yet.  Overall and so far, very pleased with the choice of this model.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use, easy to clean, does not hurt at all. Hair seems to grow back slower. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> disappointed. Too much money wasted on a product that barely does anything yet is painful as all get out...&lt;br /&gt;pain with no gain. Ugh</li>
    <li> I am not sure why people have given 4+ star to this product.  I used to use emjoi optima, and I decided to switch because I got bored of that epilator.  I tried to remove hair from my under arms with this epilator, it will start bleeding, but hair will not be removed.  Switching back to my old one.</li>
    <li> Everyone will tell you an epilator hurts, and they&#x27;re not kidding.  For new users I recommend you enjoy a few glasses of your favorite alcoholic beverage prior to use.  I used this on my boyfriends neck/shoulders and lower back and it worked like a dream.  It&#x27;s very fast too.  I just wish he weren&#x27;t such a wimp and would use it on his chest too!</li>
    <li> I am not sure yet how I feel about it.  It is painful.  I will say that.  However i still have stubs.. That is a little annoying.  I live in oil on my body, so my skin is naturally soft. I am tellin you this because when I ran my hands down my leg, I could feel the difference, but I could still feel soft stubs.  I am still thinking about this.  I have a little time left if I decide to return it</li>
    <li> For years now I&#x27;ve been using (mostly) a spring epilator (the original Epilady) so now the hair on my legs is very fine and not much of it as after years of yanking the hair out, much of it has quit growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have used an epilator (the tweezer kind) for my bikini line and had good results. The tweezer epilator I had before was useless on my legs because the hair is so fine and it was hit or miss as to whether or not it would tweeze it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly thought this Panasonic would still come in second to my old spring epilady but I was WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this thing. I&#x27;ve never been able to use an epilator on my underarms but decided to give it a try with this Panasonic. It&#x27;s still fairly uncomfortable to me but not unbearable and if I decide it&#x27;s too painful, I can just switch to another head attachment and shave them instead so without a break to go get a different item, I can do my legs, my bikini area and my underarms. Hooray! I can also use the foot attachment for any rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably cut at least 20 minutes from my beauty routine because before, part of it I&#x27;d do in the shower and part of it had to be done with clean, dry skin and if I forgot and applied lotion to my legs then I&#x27;d have to either wash it back off or try to remember to skip it after my shower the next day until I&#x27;d done my legs. Now I just grab this gadget and do each area and in no time, I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sometimes get a few stray hairs on the underside of my chin and I was able to take care of those in just a couple of passes so no irritation or redness on my face that might require more makeup to cover up (I have sensitive skin and other epilators have sometimes left my skin red for a couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one tweezer epilator that actually gave me blood blisters a couple of times because it drew my skin into the tweezer part and pinched it. NOT GOOD. After using the Panasonic at least 4 times now, I&#x27;ve not had any pinching at all, even when I don&#x27;t quite hold my skin taut enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this gadget! I&#x27;m tempted to buy another and put it away for when this one wears out although it feels pretty sturdy and I think it&#x27;ll last a long time. I&#x27;ve really come to rely on the Panasonic and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.t had any pinching at all, even when I don&#x27;t quite hold my skin taut enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this gadget! I&#x27;m tempted to buy another and put it away for when this one wears out although it feels pretty sturdy and I think it&#x27;ll last a long time. I&#x27;ve really come to rely on the Panasonic and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> This is my third epilator. My two previous epilators were both Brauns. This epilator is quite a bit different, in that the main head has two rotating tweeezer discs, whereas the Braun only has one. Both models have the same number of tweezers in the discs, though. I do prefer the action of the two discs. The main head on this one also pivots, which I like a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I like about this is that it has a separate head for small and/or sensitive areas. On my old epilator you used the large head with a shield over it that blocked off most of the tweezers. On this one there is a completely separate head that only has a few tweezers. I think this is great, as it allows for more precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic epilator also comes with a pedicure head. It has a pumice disk in it to help smooth out calluses and rough areas. I think this would be a great attachment, except for the fact that the pumice doesn&#x27;t seem to be replaceable. The included product literature says the accessories can be purchased through the Panasonic website, but as of this writing, a replacement pumice disk is not one of the available accessories. It doesn&#x27;t take long for the pumice to wear down, and then it is useless. It&#x27;s a nice added feature while it lasts, but the lack of a replacement means it doesn&#x27;t really add value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I don&#x27;t like about this unit are that (a) there is no way to turn the light off and (b) it only has one speed. Sometimes it is nice to slow down the tweezer heads in tight places where it can be difficult to control the unit, like under the arms. The LED light is really bright and in some cases it actually makes it harder, not easier to see the fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this a lot. It has features that I prefer over other epilators I have used, but also lacks some features that I like. In a side-by-side comparison, however, I would chose this Panasonic epilator because of the separate sensitive head and the pivoting main head.head.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Wet or Dry Epilator gets used for several things around here. First, I use it for my feet. It works well on making the bottom of my feet smooth and soft, even though it still tickles my feet, I just laugh all the way through it. Second, my mother, whom I take care of, has Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and she can&#x27;t use an epilator, so I have to help her. She gets hairs on her chin and this does an excellent job of removing them quick and easy. Third, her legs she can&#x27;t shave either, but me using the Panasonic on her legs, they are easy to shave. Rarely are there any small cuts. I do recommend that you be careful when using the foot care head on the back of your feet toward the ankle. I have cut my self in several places there and now barely press down to use it in that area. Otherwise it performs flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a Braun Epilator that I used on my mother and it works well but I like this one better because it is easy to turn on and the Braun Silk Epil 7 has a hard to turn on and off dial. I also like the more hand held feel of the Panasonic and now we are just using the Panasonic and will keep the Braun as a backup.  Also the wet or dry function is fantastic and that alone makes it the one to get.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the great reviews and thought \\&quot;WoW it has to be good!\\&quot; Until 2 days later I went to my local Big W and saw it for $29.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware have a look at your own Big W BEFORE you make the same mistake I sadly did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I used it, it was noisy and it hurt more than wax!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This made my legs rash out for a month. I do like the foot pumus stone. It really gets your feet smooth. It is very exspensive for just that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item expecting not too much, other than pain really!  Had used an epilator years ago and remember a lot of pain and not great results.  This Panasonic is wonderful.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Even though some reviewers said it hurt to use, especially at first, I found that it was not painful at all and did a great job, especially on underarms and legs.  Is it comfortable? No. but I would not say it is painful to use at all.  I am very fair haired and have been told that laser, etc does not work on fine blond hair; waxing gets very expensive and I hate shaving.  This unit removed the hair quickly and easily and kept it gone so much longer than shaving.  It is well worth the money and slight discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that using it in the bikini area does work well, but is uncomfortable...not enough to keep me from using it, but more so than other areas.  I found that all around it works great.  I use mine in the bath and have found that a cheap bottle of shampoo works better than anything else as a lubricant while using the epilator. (and doesn&#x27;t leave a ring like soap can).</li>
    <li> This epilator is hands down the best one I&#x27;ve had yet. I&#x27;ve had two previously and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs or armpits in nearly 10 years. The extra row of tweezers makes it go much more efficiently and it&#x27;s remarkably less painful than the other two. If you&#x27;ve never epilated before or are not used to it, it will hurt, but after using it (without shaving) for a few months, you&#x27;ll get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I&#x27;ve found is that it can be hard to use in narrow spaces because the head is so much wider (i.e. bikini area).</li>
    <li> I have owned three diff shavers. My best one was my first one and could not find replacement heads so I brought a new one and that one did not do well for a Brazilian cut- lol... However, the third one is always a charm. It works great after you have shaved close and you must continue to keep it low. Snags on long hair- lol. If u r like me a Brazilian girl, u would LUV it. For other area it&#x27;s great. Takes awhile to get use to all the components. There is a great shaving gel called \\&quot;coochy\\&quot;, available at pure romance.com. Work great and u would never get shaving bumps . Use it for 4 years and never changed since ... Try it!!!! Good for men 2...</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this. I am not real big on leaving reviews, unless the product is flawed, because I buy everything on Amazon. I just received this and played with it all day. It was ready to use, right out of the package, it was already charged.&lt;br /&gt;When I was a teenager (20+ Years ago) My Aunt had an epilady (I think she still has it). I tried it, and I was scared to death, thinking, why would anyone ever take more than one pass at trying this? I always thought my Aunt was mad as a hatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I can hardly feel the hair being pulled out. The secret is to have shaved recently. The longer the hair the more painful it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. All the Attachments. Wow! I am in love. I have used the regular attachment for legs and arms, the small one for facial hair removal, and the foot care head. I have not been pinched or cut. I did not get red bumps all over, like I have heard of with other epilator reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The foot care head is amazing! I have a problem with dry cracked feet. I have since I was a child. I sat down on the couch, with a towel underneath me, and went to town with the foot care attachment. I have tried so many callus removers, buffers, creams, and lotions. This little miracle removed ALL the dry cracked skin from my feet. It did take a while since they were in bad shape, but way faster than any other method I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is wet dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The heads are easy to rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. It doesn&#x27;t take long to fully charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. It holds a charge for a long time- about 2 hours give or take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only 1- It cannot be used while it is plugged in. I guess it makes sense, since it is a wet dry, and I am sure there are idiots out there that would plug it in and stick it in the bathtub, and be electrocuted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I recommend this, even if you have tried another kind. This one is amazing! My teenage daughter gave it a few sweeps on her leg,and wants one for her birthday. I did purchase the Emjoi cream with the epilator, and it seems to work well, but I cannot say if it inhibits hair growth or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12-13-2012- Still FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! I love it! My mother in law, bought one and she loves it too! She has pins and screws that stick out slightly in her leg, so shaving was difficult. She has not had a nick or cut since she started using this.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product, I love it.</li>
    <li> Just took it with me to a trip to Rio... I had to wear a bikini or shorts every day so it was VERY useful to have it with me!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, i love the fact that the shorter the hairs are, the better it works!  You don&#x27;t have to wait until you have horrible hairy looking legs or underarms to be able to remove them &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;The machine remains charged for quite a long time too and once you use it, you can rinse it with water without any prbm as it is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I am saving so much money on waxing and I don&#x27;t get burnt by the boiling wax anymore &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This thing is scary. It definitely takes getting used to. And once you use it and get all your hair off, you do have really smooth skin. I really love it for my armpits because I have dark hair that&#x27;s hard to keep clean-looking. But boy oh boy did it bring tears to my eyes the first time I used this baby. And it takes forever the first few times. I seriously think it took me like 2 hours to epilate my legs. So needless to say, I don&#x27;t hate shaving my legs enough to warrant using this for that, but A+ for my armpits.</li>
    <li> I  will tell the truth about this product. it works well but does sting. I have not tryed all the attchments as yet.Guess I will just have to grin and bear it. Not really to bad. I can not ss well so can not use twizers.</li>
    <li> so, I never used this one  by myself naturally, but my wife was extremely satisfied, so I got few credit points from her for that purchase (spent them in a day however). So she tried all the addons and everything was wow, she liked packaging, and what in the box, and how it worked. I liked her skin after she used that. for sure I recommend it to guys looking for something for you lovely wifes/girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a side note, I&#x27;m not sure if she has tried a lot of such devices to compare, as she was using very old epilator, which kind of worked but was not that easy to use and didn&#x27;t do the job clean from the first try. I assume there other good sets from different manufacturers, some of the Philips for instance. but top Philips was 150 bucks and that one just 80 or so, it is unbeatable if you look into cost effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipping and handling and other things were all good. so no cons so far, there would be for sure once she get to used to it and when she start looking more pragmatically but anyhow that is 5 star.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with epilator because I am afraid of it hurting me and have had some bad experiences. What I like about this epilator is that you can use it while dry or wet (you&#x27;re suppose to put soap on the area while showering to epilate). I find that the wet experience is slightly better. Out of the box, there are a lot of attachments, just the regular razors and epilator heads for the legs/arms and a smaller one for the underarms. What was also interesting is that it comes with an attachment that allows you to \\&quot;grind\\&quot; away at the dead skin on the heel of your foot. I have never seen that with other epilators so this was a plus. Charging and set up was very easy and it didn&#x27;t take long to charge so I could start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, in order to have a successful epilation, the hair has to be trimmed down with just a regular razor part. This had a part that you can pop up to cut down the longer hairs and one for the smaller hairs. I found the razor part to be a bit slower than other razors so you want to have plenty of time to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilation wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be. This is actually one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried. There was some slight tugging here and there but overall, pretty painless. Once you&#x27;re done, the legs are extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment for the heel was also better than I expected. I can literally see the dead skin being \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; off. It&#x27;s basically like a sand-paper like feel to the attachment. I am also extremely ticklish so was a bit worried about it. However, I didn&#x27;t have any problems in using this and was able to smooth it out just slightly. It&#x27;s like a gentle massage. Don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle tool though. It&#x27;s just a nice added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s actually pretty painless to use and one of the better ones. I think they&#x27;re definitely starting to get the epilators made correctly.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is easy to clean and use plus it works great. My money was well spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned a few epilators in my short life but this one has been the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different attachments are very useful and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is bright enough to help see anything that was missed!</li>
    <li> Does not epilate correctly. It does not tweeze from the root. Its like shaving but it rips the hair instead so it hurts.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of epilators because I&#x27;m one of those people who somehow always manage to cut themselves when I&#x27;m shaving my legs with a non-power razor, and the power razor I use just doesn&#x27;t seem to really leave my legs smooth enough. But the ones I&#x27;ve tried have been dry epilators and truthfully, I&#x27;m not really a masochist and the whole process was just too painful to continuously use.  I have to say, though, that the Panasonic ES-WD94-P has managed to change my mind about epilators, mainly because I can use it in the shower with shower gel without pain.  As others have pointed out, you need to make sure that you use this with small hair growth - don&#x27;t go on \\&quot;Survivor\\&quot; for a month and expect to be able to exfoliate that kind of leg hair without pain.  So definitely shave your legs first, before you start to use this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the foot care attachment to be handy, and know that I&#x27;ll get even more use from it in the summertime when I tend to walk around barefoot more.  I haven&#x27;t used the attachment for facial hair; for that my product of choice is [[ASIN:B001FXUTUM R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover]] which does the same thing, only I don&#x27;t have to charge it and can do quick touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear that Panasonic did some serious design-testing on this product using actual women because this product is designed to deal with the bumps and curves of our bodies.  If you&#x27;re in the market for an epilator, definitely give this one a try.  But do remember that epilation is basically pulling the hair out by the root, so the first time it may be uncomfortable or actually hurt.  But the more you do it, the more accustomed you become to it, and the discomfort becomes minimal or virtually non-existent.</li>
    <li> great product but not sure its working for all kinds of woman and hair styles. it has a lot of optional heads to switch and very easy to use. but not sure how long the shaving last-for me it wasnt that long...</li>
    <li> This may be the most comfortable epilator ever. I have a couple of Braun epilators which work well (and grab shorter hairs than this one does), but if you follow their suggestion and use this in the shower with a drop of shower gel on the spinner, it creates a great foam and makes epilating nearly painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some quick thoughts on this model specifically:&lt;br /&gt;* You can use it dry or completely-wet, but not damp (e.g., right after the shower won&#x27;t work--the pink cap will pop off and go flying). Dry is fine if you&#x27;re used to epilating, but using it under running water dramatically reduces any discomfort, and using a drop of shower gel on the spinner reduces it further. This is the most comfortable epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;* You can&#x27;t use it while plugged in (that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower!) but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge, you&#x27;ll have to toss the unit)&lt;br /&gt;* This includes a separate head for more-targeted facial hair, which epilates a smaller area at a time. Unlike the Braun cap (which sits atop the normal epilator and blocks all but a few of the tweezers), this one is a separate unit, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out if the unit isn&#x27;t entirely clean after doing another area... BUT this attachment is really uncomfortable, and since the epilator doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;slow\\&quot; speed I really can&#x27;t recommend using this. It may be worth cleaning the main unit well and using that wherever needed :-/&lt;br /&gt;* A trimmer attachment is very helpful if you need to use it before epilating--the epilator picks up medium-length hairs far more easily than long ones. (You could also use it if you&#x27;re just wanting a quick trim, though I&#x27;ve never done that)&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m in love with the spinning pumice attachment, which you can use to exfoliate your feet. It says that works better dry than wet, and I used it when my feet were damp from an extended soak in the tub, which was perfect. It seems odd to have a \\&quot;foot\\&quot; beauty product that works off my \\&quot;hair removal\\&quot; motor, but I have to say I really like it&lt;br /&gt;* The various heads attach to the base with a latch/button. Most of the time this makes no difference, but on my older Braun epilators (where the top just snaps on/off), I find the caps start to fall off or pop off after a year or so. So the mechanism on this unit should make it last better over time&lt;br /&gt;* The small spotlight on the unit makes it easier to see hairs you may have missed. If you&#x27;re using shower gel, the white foam also makes it easier to spot dark hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And some thoughts on epilation in general:&lt;br /&gt;* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again (assuming you do it at least once every 3 months!), the subsequent touch-ups really aren&#x27;t bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so. Face is also quite sensitive, though that probably varies by person, depending on how much tweezing you normally do.) Remember that epilating \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with shower gel reduces discomfort, so definitely do that your first time.&lt;br /&gt;* After the first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you&#x27;ll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back, but are still too small to get, even though the hairs aren&#x27;t really visible. So if you think someone&#x27;s going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don&#x27;t bother doing anything for a month or so, you&#x27;ll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirelya thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;* You do have to use a loofah or some other type of exfoliation on your legs occasionally to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don&#x27;t turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you&#x27;ll have to do that anyway&lt;br /&gt;* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they&#x27;ll banish them but don&#x27;t? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)  This also helps with bikini-area bumps, but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade, so it&#x27;s fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited awhile to review this product because I&#x27;d flipped flopped about whether I like it. As an epilator, it does hurt. It really, really hurts. Like &amp;#34;clench your teeth and check to make sure it didn&#x27;t burn you&amp;#34; hurts. But if you can handle the pain, it is nice that your leg hair growth slows so much. If that were all that there was to it, I would really like this product. However, the number of ingrown hairs you get when you use this is just nuts. I&#x27;ve never had ingrown hairs on my legs before and when I use this I get like ten-twenty. As an epilator, you only have to shave every other week or so but it really hurts and you get a ton of ingrown hairs. The other problem with this epilator is that the attachments are sort of worthless. I&#x27;ve never found a use for them. It is nice that you can use it under water, which reduces the pain of epilating your legs a bit, but it&#x27;s just too much money considering all of the cons. It doesn&#x27;t replace shaving, it just reduces it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it so far. Had it for a couple months now. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was fed-up with my dry-only cheapo epilator because it hurt and took forever (60+ minutes) to use.  The problem with dry-only is you are supposed to use it on dry clean skin.  That means no deoderant/lotion/anything.  So I shower, exfoliate, get all dried-off -then- start epilating.  Catch my drift?  Takes forever!  What I did love about epilating in general was going a week with-out shaving and not having the prickly stubble I could use against my husband.  I decided to try a more expensive one I could use the in the shower and settled on this one.  I got it through Amazon at $80-ish.  I tried it the day it came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month now and I love it.  The attachments alone make it great, less painful and versatile.  The old one hurt like a mother in the armpits and bikini area but with the small attachment on this one I feel very little.  It&#x27;s also much faster!  I can use it right in the shower and that speeds up my routine considerably (exfoliate, epilate, done).  Without the big routine I am also able to do legs one day, armpits another and so on.  The light is also very helpful in catching renegade hairs.  The shaver attachment has a bikini comb for the most intimate of female grooming that comes out looking professionally done (I don&#x27;t look 12 yay!).  The large attachment for the legs works quickly with minimal pain.  Mind you, if it is your first time it -will- hurt no matter what kind you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I got this epilator to use after having a different one for almost 10 years. Overall I think it&#x27;s a good product and works well. I like that it&#x27;s cordless because the cord on my old one tended to get in the way, but I do wish it had a longer battery life. It&#x27;s best to charge it after every use or else the battery might run out if you&#x27;re using it on your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the attachments are nice although I haven&#x27;t used too many of them yet. I also like that it comes with a little bag to hold all of the items so they don&#x27;t get lost. The light is useful at times, but I&#x27;d be fine without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had two speeds like my old one because I feel like it&#x27;s a little slow to use at times. For an epilator, I think it&#x27;s very gentle. Like I said, I&#x27;d been using my old one for almost 10 years so I&#x27;m used to the feel, but even I could tell a difference that this one was gentler.</li>
