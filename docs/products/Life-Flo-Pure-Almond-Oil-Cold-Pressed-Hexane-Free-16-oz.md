<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it to take off my makeup and it nourish my skin and my lashes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant with my first baby. Started using this oil in my whole body at night, ( most of them) since I learned I was pregnant at 6 weeks. I have not developed one stretch mark. Not even a hint of it. a couple months ago I started adding Vitamin E oil to this bottle. What I love about almond oil is that it is not greasy at all and it absorbs super fast. The remaining oil in my hands after applying, I put in my face. My skin looks radiant and healthy. Will keep buying  and using forever.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and not to say ALMOND oil. Multiple use product, I use it for my hair, face &amp; body. Simply the best</li>
    <li> I bought this originally for reed diffuser oil but now keep it in the bathroom to clean my face.  I mix it with Witch Hazel to take eye makeup off and put some on a baby wipe to clean the rest of my face.  It&#x27;s a very nice oil and using the baby wipe makes sure that it doesn&#x27;t get too oily.  So it meets two needs - face cleaning and reed diffusing.</li>
    <li> I love this oil so light delivery was great..will ordrer again</li>
    <li> This is the 1st oil I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m using it for my hair to undo some coloring damage. So far I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair and it only feels soft when I&#x27;m washing the oil out. I can&#x27;t use it everyday because it makes my hair too greasy. I want to try a SWEET almond oil next and see if that will bring different results. A small amount feels great on my face but doesn&#x27;t moisturize the skin on my hands. I&#x27;m not impressed after regular usage.</li>
    <li> Can I use this for my hair</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks and is using it as a moisturizer along with castor oil at night time.  The product appears oily at first but it slowly dissipates after a few minutes.  I have to wait for awhile to see the results of the product since many other have mentioned that the appearance of your skin changes.</li>
    <li> My favorite oil. Use it after showers and on my face under makeup.</li>
    <li> At first I applied the oil on top of my regular moisturizer, it didn&#x27;t work for me because my skin feels oily throughout the day. Then I reversed the procedure, almond oil on my bare cleansed face then my moisturizer. It woks wonderfully. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily but supple. I applied it twice a day around my eyes and for the first time in my life, the dark circles are gone!! I have tried many things to reduce dark circles but only this works! I also added a few drops of almond oil to my home made facial masks with various ingredients (you can get these recepies from web). One of the easiest is to mix with freshly squeezed lemon juice and honey and applied it as facial mask. It gives the same result of expensive masks I can get from salons! I also rub almond oil onto my hand in the morning followed with my hand lotion. It makes my hands looking younger throughout the entire day without having to reapply lotion.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected for a nice almond oil. Nice for moisturizing my face and body and as an occasional hair oil. Use sparingly. No scent.</li>
    <li> I use sweet almond oil for my body (not face) as a moisturizer during the winter. My skin gets very dry and regular lotions only do so much. It&#x27;s a very viscous oil but absorbs into the skin very nicely. You will have to massage it in, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some body lotions and creams do. I also have very sensitive skin, and this has worked very well for me! This is also great as a massage oil :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and has a wide range of applications such as in a sugar/salt scrub, massage oil, and cooking. It also has anti-inflammatory properties. This is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off saying that the \\&quot;Now Foods\\&quot; Almond sweet oil is better. Reason, on the texture seems a bit thicker and more richer onto the skin. It&#x27;s a 100%...I Also don&#x27;t care for the packaging on the \\&quot;Life-Flo\\&quot;, Almond oil...the label hugs the oil outside of the bottle and that will start to peel. I just got the product last week. I still have my \\&quot;Now foods\\&quot; bottle ummm...to years old almost. Believe me I compared the two products and I&#x27;d rather buy the \\&quot;Now foods\\&quot; the next time around. Hey, just to add this is not a terrible product as you see I did give it 4 stars. My bottom-line I prefer the other brand.</li>
    <li> It indeed made my hair shiny but it did not stop my hair from falling out.Depending on what you want, it&#x27;s your choice if you want to buy it. Personally, I would advise no.</li>
    <li> Quality carrier oil.  Very smooth.  No smell.  Works very well when added to body butters and mixes well with essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;______________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon.com LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon.com LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 7 days after order date</li>
    <li> I really like this Almond oil.  It has a nice mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, it made my skin feel so smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Does not leave an oily or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular coconut oil girl, however I wanted to add another oil to my regimen.  The almond oil is a litter heavier than coconut oil, but a lot lighter than Jamaican black castor oil, so it&#x27;s a really nice addition to my hair and skin regimen.  I think I like it more on my skin, than my hair.  A little oil goes a long way.  Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t seen any significant growth or changes to report.</li>
    <li> this product along with one of the artisans coconut butter was open when the package arrived</li>
    <li> Use it on my skin a lot and like that it hydrates it. goes on well. Doesn&#x27;t absorb fully into the skin so it does leave a little greasy after effect, but doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
    <li> I see that this bottle has lasted me a little over a year, which is tremendous, since I use it after almost every shower/bath.  I have a sensitive nose, and it didn&#x27;t have a stale/oily smell when I opened it, as some other products have.  Even after a year, I can only smell the slight fragrance of a few drops of essential oil that I added to it.  It has stayed very fresh, and I&#x27;m back for my next bottle.  It seals in my skin&#x27;s natural moisture; I don&#x27;t suffer from that dry, itchy feeling when I use this oil.</li>
    <li> Product is perfect for anything! I used it for my body butter and body scrubs!</li>
    <li> This almond oil made my hair so soft, I love it ! It is a little too oily though, and stays oily also, so I wanted to use it on my body but I&#x27;ll stick to grapeseed oil for body for a while.</li>
    <li> Love it. Keeps my hair soft.</li>
    <li> not bad you should try it</li>
    <li> Bought it after seeing reviews and rating, it came pretty fast. Basically my wife is using it and i could see she is quite happy with the quality, i must say it is real good product and should give a try. I recommended to other too and ordering next one now :)</li>
    <li> It works well for a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Best almond oil..I am using this as bathing oil for my son, as almond oil is very good for skin.</li>
    <li> A friend told me to use this on my face/body at night. I can see a difference already. Wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  It&#x27;s very thick and luxurious.  It has no scent, so you can also mix it with something else.  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair while shampooing, and it was awesome.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a lot of ways. I&#x27;ve added it at bath time and used it in my hair. I&#x27;ve dabbed a cotton swap with it and used it for itchy ears. It&#x27;s been good for moisturizing and a little goes a long way. Have had this bottle for at least a year</li>
    <li> I use it everyday to wash my face. Love that is has no scent. I have it for about 2 months and barely made a dent in it. Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. Cant wait to used it.</li>
    <li> It is rich and make my skin feel soft and at the same time does not make my skin too grease</li>
    <li> Thanks! Thanks! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I am a careful buyer, do my research and try different brands before settling on what works the best for me. This is the one if you are looking for the best.</li>
    <li> nice product, exactly as described</li>
    <li> fast delivery. I loved the product</li>
    <li> Well made, and a great price on Amazon.  SW</li>
    <li> So easy to click and have it arrive--not every grocery carries this.  I use it after every shower because I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I had a slight eczema through the years and this has help control it. I use for my entire body especially winter time. I don&#x27;t even have to use body lotion. Works best after showering before drying...apply when your skin is still wet the skin absorbs it in.</li>
    <li> The feel of this oil is really nice. I honestly thought it was going to have the sweet almond smell though and was sad when I opened it.</li>
    <li> You got to love this product.  I rub it into my scalp at night before I go to bed.  It helps my hair look shiny and healthy.  Very nice product.  I recommend using this on skin, hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I use this every day to take off my makeup and do the oil cleansing method for washing my face.  Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s also great to put on the lids and lashes at night for a eyelash treatment/mask.  I also use this as a hair moisturizer/mask a day or a couple hours before I wash my hair.  Many different uses, love this oil!</li>
    <li> This pure almond oil is exactly what I needed to make my own &amp;#34;do-it-yourself&amp;#34; facial cleanser and after shower moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  I just got the bottle and yes this is one of the most pure oils in the market. The label says 99.5% almond oil and it is cold pressed  that means  is pure and  there is a little bit of vitamin E.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of a pinterest find about using this oil and witch hazel in place of face wash... well, I wasnt a fan of that. It may have been coincidence with something else I am unaware of, but I started breaking out. So I dont recommend it as a &amp;#34;face cleanser&amp;#34;. It still is good to use as a makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Lovely oil. Good amount of product for the price. Will last me forever. Makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I add 1-2 drops to my cream makeup, making it go on easier. Generally does not leave me feeling oily. On rare occasion when it may make my face feel a little oily, it resolves after about a minute.</li>
    <li> I purchased the  coconut oil from this company so I felt comfortable with purchasing the almond oil so I can mix with my shea butter. The shea butter was purchased from but from a different company on Amazon. It looks exactly how it is pictured on the site. The bottle had a seal and as for smell, the almond was not existent, just pure oil scent.(that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sensitive to almond smell but want the same nutritional value for your skin then this product will be perfect for you</li>
    <li> I love this, and this company!  I use this as a face massage oil and it works wonders.  The scent is very light, and I love how there are only two ingredients.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Initially bought this to do the oil cleanse but have expanded to use as an all over moisturizer. It so good I&#x27;ve retired my Neutrogena sesame oil. Also it&#x27;s been great for my oil cleansing. Face has cleared up</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil to prevent the appearance of stretch marks in pregnancy, I use it in my belly, bust, and in my thighs and it has provided the elasticity I was looking for.  It is definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Great product for massages, as a base for salves, etc.  Just read the label before dousing a salad.  External use only!!</li>
    <li> is a great produtc ,is  real 99.5 almond oil with 0.5 vitamin e ,smell like almond and work very well on the sking and hair, i recommended</li>
    <li> It is a big bottle and good for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like almond.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like vegetable oil to me, and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin ;(</li>
    <li> Great oil! Keeps your skin smooth and hudrated all day! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I love how well this oil absorbs.  It leaves me less sticky than lotion.  There is no odor to compete with my perfume!  Living in the high desert makes my skin so dry that I itch all the time.  This oil really helps to moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use to mix with my Panoway essential oil and I apply it twice a day.  Goes a long way, and am even using it to moisturize my lower legs.  No odor, non-greasy (it is an oil after all), very light, rubs in easily.</li>
    <li> I got this to rub on my belly to hopefully avoid stretch marks from my growing baby belly. So far so good. But, I also discovered that I LOVE using it everywhere. I doubt i will ever buy moisturizer again! And, if my ends on my hair look a bit dry...just a small amount rubbed in your hands and put through your hair will do. I love using this at night under my eyes and on my face. EXCEPTIONAL product.</li>
    <li> It is a great oil and keeps my skin soft. I love it.</li>
    <li> when i seen the package the box was full of oil. when i opened it more than half of the bottle had leaked in the box. had no safety cap on it. when i opened the bottle the safety seal was stuck on top of the cap. i emaild amazon for refund or replacement but i had tossed the box and bottle so i couldnt return it. emiald them but no response yet. but from the bit i had it was wonderful lol.</li>
    <li> I use it for hair therapy. Leaves my hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a thick, practically odorless oil.  It works extremely well to moisturize the skin and I find it works best on damp skin.  On dry skin, it&#x27;s just too thick and doesn&#x27;t spread well.  This bottle is pretty large and I don&#x27;t feel I have to ration it because the cost is reasonable.</li>
    <li> nice quality, however no scent</li>
    <li> I ordered this to make my own massage oils with essential oils.  This is an excellent carrier oil.  I even had a friend who loves almond oil open the bottle to smell it and he was surprised to say that there was no scent.  This is perfect when you want to add a scent of your own choosing to the oil!</li>
    <li> Great for the skin and hair! I use this mostly for my face and back - the two driest parts for me. I also use coconut oil on my body, but almond oil is a must for the face! Pure COLD-PRESSED Almond Oil. Doesn&#x27;t get much better!</li>
    <li> Very nice almond oil. I got it to use in a acne sugar scrub that I make for my sister. As far as I can tell, the oil is the real thing. It does not smell like almonds, which my brother tells me is okay. I thought it had to smell like almonds for it to be real almond oil, but apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;I have a really bad time with razor burn and sever dry skin on my legs, so when I ran out of the lotion I normally us one night, I decided to try this and see if it helped. Sadly it didn&#x27;t help at all, and I had to apply some of my mother&#x27;s lotion on top of the oil because my legs were burning so badly from dryness. But for less sever cases of dry skin I&#x27;d say this would work fine.</li>
    <li> I love this almond oil! I use it for oil cleansing my face &amp; it&#x27;s perfect! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The oil got here fast. Was what I wanted but when I went to use it to make the lotions, we were 1 oz short. You took the weight of the bottle in to account.( Instead of weighting the bottle first then putting the oil in) So I was only able to make 3 batches. I make it to give away and like to use the same oil in each batch. So now I have to buy more so I can finish my Christmas baskets.</li>
    <li> i use this to make a sugar scrub and a salt scrub.  i think it is a lighter weight oil than olive oil and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue on skin after rinsing</li>
    <li> I keep this by my shower and use it immediately after I get out, or I put a bit into a hot bath as I&#x27;m running it. I think it was a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This item was a godsend. After a long battle with antibiotics and topical creams that never worked for long and gave me bad side effects, I decided to go the natural route to treat my dry, acne prone skin. I used coconut oil and that has been amazing at clearing most of my acne. However, scars and red pigmentation (I have light skin and it was very noticeable) remained in its place. Not wanting to use chemicals, I did some research and decided to try almond oil, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I applied at night as I would a moisturizer and within days my skin tone evened out and scars visibly reduced. I&#x27;m hoping over the next few months my progress continues, and I can achieve a flawless face without the need of countless dermatologist visits. I highly recommend the use of almond oil for the skin, especially combined with coconut oil. Great product!</li>
    <li> Can use this any way that I want. Can put it on my face and can mix it with other oils too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this stuff! I was just a tiny bit disappointed that it has no smell of almonds like other almond oils I have used in the past, but honestly, the feel of my skin after I use it makes it all worth it. No greasy feelings at all! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Use as body oil for winter-dry skin. Leaves my skin nourished, not oily, all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the product. I&#x27;m pregnant and skin started to get crazy, but when I got it it stop all the problems in my skin and I&#x27;m using it for my hair as well. The delivery was quicker than I spect. I&#x27;ll recommend it, it&#x27;s 1</li>
    <li> This oil slowly soaks into my skin. With the winter as bad as we have had, this is a skin saver beyond words. Great product and it really lasts. One use after my shower and I am good for the whole day...no matter what the weather is.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my face and body daily. It absorbs into your skin, without making it look or feel too greasy or oily. I have tried coconut oil on my face, and it made me break out. This almond oil keeps my skin looking clear and feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Used with almond oil to treat my daughter&#x27;s severe eczema. I wish I took before and after pictures! Eczema and hyperpigmentation gone! Note: Prior to the above application, I applied fresh cut aloe vera gel to the inflamed sites to air dry.</li>
    <li> This oil of sweet almonds was delivered promptly and in good condition and I would cheerly recommend it to anyone as a vehicle for other essential oils and as an emollient.</li>
    <li> Natural oil , alittle goes along ways, skin and hair feels very soft , and yes even at my age.</li>
    <li> love the oil. really great moisturizer. good for skin and hair.a little goes for a long run. i will buy again.</li>
    <li> when I saw the package it looked like there was some pillage and I realized that the bottle was open and some pillage had occurred. not that much was lost but you would tell that it was loose. so I would suggest a better tighter cap and seal. There was no seal.</li>
    <li> Eating almonds and using it on your skin is so good to keep it from looking dry! I use this in the morning with my moisturizer and it keeps my skin smooth and radiant looking! I put some around my eyes at night as well to keep them moisturized. It is a great product!</li>
    <li> I like this oil. I bought it to make a lotion with, which turned out to be too oily for my taste. It took a long time to soak into my skin. There didn&#x27;t seem to be much of a fragrance to it, which is good, since I will now probably make it into a salt scrub and add essential oils and don&#x27;t want too many fragrances fighting with each other.</li>
    <li> Nice oil. Sweet almond oil. Great for adding essential oils to. Fresh oil, smells clean. This big bottle will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> Have been using this pure almond oil &amp; Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel as a facial toner after oil cleansing method Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Very nice item.  I use it with a bit of peppermint on my hair.  Leaves hair soft with shine.  Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I used it on my wife...she loved it!  It really opens up the world to new possibilities!  I love pickles</li>
    <li> I bought this as my carrier oil since it&#x27;s considered the one to use if you have oily skin.  So far, I have been very pleased.  I also used it just out of the shower as a moisturizer and am please with using it that way, as well.</li>
    <li> Oh, nice.  Worked well for my project and is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> Best Almond Oil around....I love it...hair and body I use it for...it&#x27;s better than other brands, it&#x27;s thicker and I love it!</li>
    <li> Recently I became interested in learning how to give a Swedish back massage and that meant first finding the right oil, not lotion, and research all pointed to a &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil known as &#x27;sweet almond oil.&#x27;  With little background in one oil over another I chose sweet almond as it has no scent, which is why it is a &#x27;carrier,&#x27; it is often blended with exquisite and fragrant essential oils for massage and aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stayed with just the oil itself, and what a stunner it is, never tacky, beautiful on the skin, perfect for those long sweeping strokes (effleurage) as well as the more intense movements such as kneading, wringing, knuckling, etc. And it retains it&#x27;s slight sheen as you work the muscles, a little goes a long way! I tend to use quite a bit as I&#x27;ve been adding massage for arm, leg, neck and shoulders. Even with my tendency to use more not less oil it is mostly because once the massage is over the skin remains absolutely glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I&#x27;ve added use of this oil to my after shower moisturizing, a light covering and then another coat of whatever lotion I am partial to at the moment, the lotion goes on and blends with the oil in a way that can only be called a luxurious experience. I am so amazed at how well this oil moisturizers and feels that any description you may read about sweet almond oil DOES NOT do it justice. It is tasteless and has no fragrance, when warmed up between the hands it goes on as if the skin was begging for it, lovely oil; any purpose you may have for a body oil try this one, it&#x27;s a revelation, and I haven&#x27;t even tried it with essential scented oils yet!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
    <li> I use this product for my hair and skin. it makes both very soft and my skin smoother than ever. I also love the size of the bottle</li>
    <li> This is a great carrier oil for essential oils.  It is also nice for dry hands and face by its self</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil for the second time because I absolutely loved it.  But my second bottle came without the little seal attached to the top.  So being worried about not getting the product I think I am paying for makes me worry that it may be something other than the pure almond oil in my bottle.  It seems like the good stuff but there is some doubt in my mind that I wish I didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> I use this for my oil cleansing method and moisturizer, and I love it</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade lotion recipe, it works great, has a very light smell.</li>
    <li> I find this oil to be nothing special, leaves the skin oily, and does not soak in very well.&lt;br /&gt;After 24 hours it&#x27;s still oily feeling on my skin, so just another oil, and not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;The good is not much of a smell.</li>
    <li> This product actually subdues acne and fades scars. My sister told me that you can wash your face with oil(which sounds weird right) so usually I put some acne medicine on and then some oil over it and it certainly hasn&#x27;t made me break out or anything. Definitely recommend giving it a shot</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works well for oil cleanse!</li>
    <li> Nice oil, but it comes out of the bottle so fast that I have already wasted a bunch of it!</li>
    <li> This bottle did not have a safety seal, and leaked all over my other items. Additionally, I am not sure if I should use the oil because there is no way to tell what is in it. 1/3 of the liquid was missing upon arrival. I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I use too much on my skin.  I use after the shower and feel slick for several hours afterwards.  not a huge deal.  I do like the oil and sometimes use on my face as well.  I like it but do wish it had a sweet almond smell to it. I&#x27;d probably buy again in the future</li>
    <li> Happy with product, have bought this product before.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, but I was not happy that it arrived unsealed and had leaked out all over the rest of my order. It scares me a little that it was not sealed. I chose a different brand this time.</li>
    <li> i have begun using this oil as a makeup remover and it works so much better than anything else ive ever used! it gets ALL my makeup off and leaves my face moisturized and glowing. i have oily skin but my skin is LESS oily using this and also my pores are looking smaller. i am completely satisfied and will be returning to buy more.</li>
    <li> I seems to help cover the smell of some of the other products I use on my hair but I does not have a very sweet smell or nutty smell it is kind of plain but it is a very helpful product for skin and hair love it.</li>
    <li> I really like how this plus other oils makes my hair feels soo soft and shines and keeps it hydrated. I can use this alone but i like the benefits the other oils give too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working off this bottle as my healthy alternative for make-up remover for quite some time now and I&#x27;m still not halfway through! A great recommendation for both it&#x27;s quantity and price. (:</li>
    <li> this is now my fav oil for my skin. it has my skin glowing. i use this daily (morning and evening) for my entire body. its been great for my under eye dark circles. have seen great improvement. try this oil</li>
    <li> I am looking for a strong scented almond oil to make scrubs, does this have a nice strong scent?</li>
    <li> I am SUPER prone to breakouts so at first I thought people who put oil on their faces were out of their minds, BUT after doing a tremendous amount of research, I&#x27;ve learned that SOME kinds of oils, are actually amazing for your skin and for your acne. Pure sweet almond oil happens to be one of them! I use this as my ONLY moisturizer after I get out of the shower or before I go to bed and man oh man when I wake up my skin is soft and beautiful! It even soothes redness! My only recommendation is putting it on a while before you have to leave the house, it does take the skin a bit to soak up. But so worth it, and WHAT A GREAT PRICE...You DON&#x27;T HAVE TO PAY TOP DOLLAR TO HAVE YOUNG GORGEOUS SKIN!</li>
    <li> replaced body lotion with almond oil. Works great!</li>
    <li> If you like almond oil without the nutty smell,&lt;br /&gt;This is it! hands down, first try and like and it&lt;br /&gt;is A LOT for a 16.0z</li>
    <li> Half the bottle was gone at receipt. It spilled all in the delivery box. I recommend better packaging in the future. However, the little that&#x27;s left seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> Great product.. good delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Must be sealed better!!</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle of almond oil and I am in love! I use it with the oil-cleansing method to wash my face at night, and I also use it as a face and body moisturizer. I usually don&#x27;t like using straight oils because I dislike the long-lasting greasy feeling, but this almond oil absorbs so well! I love using it on my arms and legs. Combined with dry-skin brushing and oil-pulling, my skin has never felt so soft! I am always running my hands along my thighs marveling at the silky-softness. I&#x27;ll be keeping this stocked from now on out. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not organic.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I break out from everything.  I can use this oil on my whole body including my face and not break out.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love it. I use on my face, and hair.</li>
    <li> Great oil not odor. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I used this for an oil cleansing method on my face and broke out everywhere. I&#x27;m still trying to clear my face up, 1 month later.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, but wish it had more sweet smell</li>
    <li> Not sure if the shipped bottle contained sweet almond oil as shown on Amazon website. Bottle was received with the seal broken. Oil was thicker and more yellow than the Now brand of Sweet Almond Oil that we had used before. We purchased it primarily for applying it to the skin esp. for our kids who have very dry skin. However, the quality of the oil was not up to par and we couldn&#x27;t use it as intended. Will switch back to the Now brand.</li>
    <li> This totally fixed my dry, frizzy hair. Careful not to use too much near your scalp cause this will make your hair very greasy but just a dime sized all through your ends will make a drastic change. So glad I found this instead of using expensive name brand serums.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice item. You can use this oil for dozens for uses. Terrific product and great company to deal with.</li>
    <li> I read reviews for everthing, but seldom post anything about stuff I purchase. Which is a bit hypocritical, and is why I am making an effort today to write a review about this particular item. This stuff is by far the best beauty item i have ever bought!!! And i have tried it all, Expensive face creams, eye creams,face washes. I was originally looking for an oil for my hair, but read a review about a lady who used it for her face. Her story was very detailed and everything she described sounded like the exact thing i was going through with my face. I won&#x27;t say everything but in short; the older she got, the drier her skin got, with an oily T zone and roseaca. And it worked great for her. I also get small whitheads on my nose and cheeks. Not huge, but i get them even on dry areas of my face. My skin condition confused me. How can my face be so dry and oily at the same time. Creams worked for a few hours but eventually left my face dry and flaky and oily around my nose and forehead. I was hesitant at first to put an oil on my face scared my face would completely break out. To me oil on ur face &#x3D; pimples. Even when i first got it i only used it on my body and hair. On my body, i love it. It makes ur skin glow. I would rather use it than the stinky self tanners i have. It doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb but u do have to wait a little while. On my hair, i don&#x27;t like it. Maybe some people can put oil in their hair but i can&#x27;t stand it. I hate the greasy feeling. Maybe im not using it right. Finally when i got brave enough to try it on my face i was amazed!!! No more greasy flaky skin. My face was actually smooth and soft and it felt like that all day. I later started adding an aloe vera gel to some of my drier areas ( at first the oil was enough but i guess after my face got used to it i needed a little more moisture). But i really couldnt believe it worked and no more little whiteheads. This oil didn&#x27;t get rid of my wrinkles or reverse my aging but it made my skin feel softand youthful again. Which is more than any wrinkle cream has done!!! I pretty much use it everyday. I know there are alot of fake reviews out there these days but i still read them, and i may rely on them for most of my purchases probably more than i should. But I still have faith that there is some truth out there. This little wonder product definitly made me believe that. And i hope this review can help someone else who might have the same problems. I don&#x27;t really remember the person who made the post but Thank u! Thank u! U made me open my mind to trying more natural products!!!</li>
    <li> Its a multiple use product. Can use for skin and hair. it is Perfect for nourishing and reviving any skin type.</li>
    <li> Worked well for me, I didn&#x27;t need the monthly supply</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use on my whole body, even my face. I&#x27;m 32 and sadly my face still breaks out. I have been using it for a week and my face has cleared up! It makes my makeup go on smooth and evenly and I use much less foundation since it spreads better with the oil on my skin. I moved to Texas and my skin has been drying out but the oil is helping to restore the moisture and softness again. I&#x27;m about to clear out all lotions I own (it&#x27;s a lot) and use only this. I have already told my sister to get this for her teenager girls for their skin.</li>
    <li> As expected for use doing massage good price</li>
    <li> My ride or die product! What have i done before thee! Guys this product is the truth! I use this product on my face and body, But i initially got it just for my acne polluted face. I started getting tons of acne breakout at 27 yo, to the point that i, who never wore makeup had to visit the beauty store to get different types on concealers, foundation and such, I would burst out in tears when i saw my face in the mirror (Yeah It was that bad). I went to different dermatologists, tried different products, facial therapy, everything. All i got was more acne and breakouts. Which began to lower my self esteem, since i had never experience acne -breakouts even as a teenager. One fateful day, I stumbled on a Youtube Beauty Blogger video (Hey Fran Hey, God bless you Lady) the video was about facial cleansing using this products (Life-flo-Pure Almond, and Witch Hazel). I decided to gave it a try. Guys this oil is the boom, i apply this all over my face before bed and sometimes in the morning and it does even help to stop new breakout (for real it does). This is one of my first review on Amazon and yeah it is nothing but the truth.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own sunscreen &amp; bath products.  Great quality!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to mix with my coconut oil for lotions, hair masks, etc.. and it has worked wonderfully for that. Also, I have combination/oily/sensitive skin so I tend to not use moisturizer except at bedtime. I ran out and decided to use almond oil on my eyelashes and rub the rest around my face (I&#x27;m talking drops here...very little). My face felt amazing the next morning! Not oily at all. Now I don&#x27;t have to buy moisturizer! I love products that have multiple purposes! I feel the same about my coconut oil!</li>
    <li> I love this product for its purity and ease of use I&#x27;m giving it to some of my special female friends they seem to appreciate its great qualities aswell,the results are very good from first use</li>
    <li> Unlike some brands, this is truly pure almond oil with the exception of a tiny amount of Vitamin E (natural preservative). It has almost no scent whatsoever and absorbs well. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Great to use with body lotions</li>
    <li> Recommend this oil. Hydrates my hair and skin real well!</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the skin &amp; hair. I put the oil on my hair 1x week for 4-8 hours. I do throw keratin spray on it after washing it out and it works wonders. First time, only a slight difference. Second time, I def noticed a difference and continue to see more shine/thickeness as I keep on using it week by week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it on my skin. It&#x27;s so soft and nourishing. It dries nicely (not like baby oil) after I shower and before I go to bed. Highly recommend it esp in the dry fall!</li>
    <li> I love this great for my essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin</li>
    <li> Great almond oil! I use it everyday on my body. I&#x27;ve actually had people hug me and ask if I &amp;#34;put coco butter your skin 100 times a day?&amp;#34; Haha nope just almond oil once a day :) I mix it with castor oil for my hair and face. Mixing this with castor oil does pretty  much the same thing $80 skin wrinkle creams and all that fancy stuff tries to do but naturally ;)</li>
    <li> Nothing special about it, didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
    <li> This organic almond oil is perfect for making my own diluted therapeutic oils.  I personally use Young Living Essential Oils and sometimes I prefer to dilute them or sometimes the manufacturer states to dilute them.  This is a perfect carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make sugar and salt scrubs. Feels great, worked fantastically. Have used it as massage oil when in a pinch. Doesn&#x27;t smell offensive. I wish it were less expensive in general but reasonably priced on Amazon. Good quality stuff!</li>
    <li> Great beauty value. This makes an economical and highly effective moisturizer and gentle facial cleanser. Improves skin texture as well.  Because it&#x27;s a pure, natural product it has many applications. I have even used it on my hair and on the dog. Technically it is food grade but I&#x27;m not sure what the particular advantage is of almond over other vegetable and nut oils in the kitchen. I typically go through this with daily use in 10 weeks or so though it has a longer shelf life.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully for sugar scrubs, and massage oil. It is wonderful stuff and hydrates really well.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is amazing, I use it every day...my skin and I love it.  Its crazy what we will buy like mineral oil filled lotions etc.  And this is all natural, apply light thin layer and perfect absorption- FAB skin naturally body or face!!!!  Can use it to make your own lotions/potions check out u-tube or search online DIY ideas w/ Shea butter, Cocoa butter, beeswax, coconut oil etc blends  Remember our skin is our biggest organ.  I am a RN/nurse so if that helps :)</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I use it on my hair and face love it</li>
    <li> I have suffered from Eczema for a while now, and this has helped me tons. Everyone can see the difference in my skin. It&#x27;s also good for wrinkles under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This product itself is great and it is exactly what I expected. It was neatly packaged and it came faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> This product is great. You can use it on your face, body, and hair. I love it and would recommand to anyone</li>
    <li> This is awful, this the worst almond oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Almond oil has some benefits, like skin lightening, hair growth, benefits from oil pulling etc. I used it for months, and I&#x27;m yet to see any positive effect off of it. It&#x27;s like putting the most boring, flat and useless oil on you, it just makes your skin oilier, and that&#x27;s about it. I don&#x27;t know what is the exact problem, because I spotted a lot of them. Maybe it&#x27;s the plastic bottle instead of a glass one, maybe it&#x27;s the transparent bottle instead of dark bottle so it can keep the light out, maybe it&#x27;s a very low quality almond oil. Maybe it&#x27;s all of them. The only thing I know for sure, is that I won&#x27;t be purchasing from them ever again. And that&#x27;s so bad, because they have a very nice collection of oils and I was looking forward in purchasing more. But judging from their almond oil, it&#x27;s just money down the drain.</li>
    <li> I like it! It makes my skin feel soft! I will order it again in the future!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great, I mix it with my after shave before I use it and I smell good all day</li>
    <li> The almond oil is great.  It leaves your hair soft and shiny, and does not feel greasy.  Great for your skin too.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I originally got this for my daughters intensely dry hair but I now use it as a hair product, a lotion, a bath oil. Great stuff! It has no smell, and it&#x27;s not oily like a baby oil. It&#x27;s a soft oil that provides nourishment for the skin and hair to keep it soft with out looking greasy. I would recommend it to anybody with dry skin. Sometimes I mix it with lotion to give that added moisture.</li>
    <li> I am going to be honest about this product and hope that others make an informed decision when purchasing this. The bottles arrived oily and were missing the safety seal that they originally came with. I wouldn&#x27;t let my girlfriend use the oil, not that she would&#x27;ve, because only the seller knows what was actually in the bottle. Just beware of this. But the seller refunded me without a problem.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Really good for skin also used on my hair makes nice and soft! Also nice for removing water proof mascara.</li>
    <li> great oil.  A good carrier oil and I even use it on my face after shaving.</li>
    <li> Works great as a hair conditioner and face oil. I&#x27;ve tried both and highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to synthetic conditioners and moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This is a good oil. I only wish it had the almond odor and taste of the almond odor my friend introduced me to. I&#x27;m discovering that most almond oils don&#x27;t have the taste of almonds. :-(</li>
    <li> This oil is incredible. It&#x27;s unsented, so it won&#x27;t compete with your perfurme. And I use it for my face, and the rest of my body. It takes a few minutes to dry but it dries nicely, so I don&#x27;t look oily. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. On skin absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t have an odour.&lt;br /&gt;Try it on your hair. Leave it in overnight.  Wash next morning. Leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price.  After washing hair, apply to wet hair - produces nice sheen when blow dried.  Good product to have.</li>
    <li> I am not allergic to peanuts and assumed that this product would not be a problem. However, using it around the eyes, which was recommended, led to swelling, bags and tiny lines appearing. I thought I was just not getting enough sleep (dah...) but then figured it out. When I stopped applying it to my eyes, the swelling went away.  So be careful and be observant when using it under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I also found that I still needed to use lotion after applying the oil to the rest of my body ( I swim daily), but it seems to work very well with this regimen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a natural moisturizer, but it doesn&#x27;t soak in very quickly. It rests on top of my ski and comes off on my hair and clothes. Plus it took FOREVER to ship.</li>
    <li> Good quality Almond Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection against breakage. Wonderful carrier oil for Essential Oils. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> I bought this pure almond oil to mix with various essential oils.  My current favorite is lemongrass essential oil.  It moisturizes beautifully!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just as good as NOW brand, but cheaper.</li>
    <li> Use daily in the shower to cleanse and moisturize. No longer buy harsh soap or expensive lotion!</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation from a friend, to use for massages for my baby boy. We started by using extra-virgin olive oil , and have also used mustard oil. However, this oil is much lighter and has no smell, is non-sticky, and is absorbed better into his skin. After I do the massage, I just rub my hands and rub them on my arms and there is no oily remnant on my hands.  I have also started using this to massage my scalp. This oil prevents my hair from looking greasy and from sticking together.  All in all, I highly recommend this oil, and I&#x27;ve about to buy another few bottles.</li>
    <li> Love it perfect for massaging men because there is no smell to it! my cat loves it , I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this oil as an ingredient in my all natural face &amp; body lotions.  Unfortunately, this oil has no odor.  Shouldn&#x27;t almond oil smell like almonds?  Since there is no regulation for these things I&#x27;m highly suspicious.  What kind of oil is this really? I hate to spend this money for something that may be toxic.  I won&#x27;t buy again.  Every almond oil I&#x27;ve bought in the past smelled like almonds.</li>
    <li> I heard so much about using natural oils for your hair and skin from my co-worker. She&#x27;s all about using natural products for any and everything. So I looked on Amazon to find some, and this was it. I use this oil on my face at night after I wash it; I pay close attention to the eye area. I used it in my hair too as a pre-wash regimen. I mostly mix it with my lotions, my skin is super try in the winter and this helps.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping from seller. Saw this product on Dr OZ. My hair was very dry from winter months and color. After few treatments my hair is soft and manageable again.  Great on the face too!!</li>
    <li> This oil is great for facial scrubs when paired with organic brown sugar and raw honey; oil cleansing; moisturizing skin; and sealing in moisture for natural hair.</li>
    <li> wife ordered it says its great</li>
    <li> I have used this (sweet, as opposed to bitter) almond oil every single day since I got it, which I would guess was about 5 months ago (?). I trashed every cream and lotion in my home at the same time. All hand creams/lotions, all face crap (even the expensive stuff), all body lotions/creams/whips, blah, blah, blah. It was all garbage filled with chemicals that I no longer wanted to soak into mine or my family&#x27;s skin. So, I threw everything away, bought a bottle of this almond oil for my face and some various sized tubs (and a near bucket-sized container) of coconut oil for any and all skin needs. I&#x27;ve never looked back. I swear this is true, not just the lies some people write for products they want others to buy; when I apply 3-4 drops of this oil to my face after cleansing, my face looks like it&#x27;s glowing from the inside-out. No greasy, oily sheen, just the look of dewy, soft skin. I have had a hard few years with the skin on my face (light acne as a teen, developed rosacea at age 21, more acne, combination of oily and dry skin) and wanted to see what fully natural products could do for me. I am totally and completely satisfied and will continue my regimen for life. Ladies, don&#x27;t fall for the cosmetics company&#x27;s lies: you don&#x27;t need to slather chemicals and crap on your face daily. NOTHING will keep your skin from changing and (*gasp!*) aging. Treat your skin as gently as possible, with the least amount of chemicals you can, and enjoy your skin while you&#x27;ve got it.</li>
    <li> Love the almond oil! i use it on my hair and now that it&#x27;s getting colder it is great for moisturizing dry skin! I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This is SWEET almond oil which is supposed to be odorless.  If you want an almond scent, look for bitter almond oil.  I use both since the sweet almond oil is moisturizing but the bitter almond oil (NOT moisturizing because of the alcohol in it) smells nice.  I usually will combine sweet almond, a little bitter almond, and shea butter then whip it up into a body butter.  I hear people will cook with this but I never have so I can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
    <li> I keep buying expensive stuff with almond oil in it. And then I found this giant bottle for a fraction of the price. Seems good, moisturizes well (strangely, the cat likes to lick the bottle, had to find out if almond oil is poisonous). You can mix it with a shea butter moisturizer and that does a doubly good job (and smells good).  If you buy a grocery store container of sea salt or sugar (depending on your preferences), and mix this stuff with it, you get an expensive exfoliating scrub. Endless possibilities with great value.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHEN I WILL GET TO USE THE LIFE-FLO PRODUCT. HOPE WITH IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO.</li>
    <li> I put on a little everyday and it leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth. I would recommend this to anyone looking to add moisture into their daily after shower regimen!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this oil! I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for the past week and my face complexion and tone has improved soooo much! My scaring has also began to fade away and I have stop breaking out. This is oil is perfect because it leaves my face feeling baby soft and it doesn&#x27;t look oily. This is the only thing I use on my face. I threw away all the cleansers and creams. I put on a small amount on my face and massage it, then I wash it off with warm water. It cleanses beautifully! Then I apply a little bit more after I pat dry my face. I do this twice a day and it has done wonders! It is definitely something worth spending my money on. It also lasts for a long time too! The shipping was incredibly fast too! I definitely recommend this product! Overall an AMAZING product!!! :)</li>
    <li> I like how easy it is to quickly apply this oil and it felt great going on but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling very moisturized.  After the oil dryed up my skin would feel dry, tight and itchy.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle, I use it all over my body after a shower and it leaves my skin feeling moist all day.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is definitely smoother.</li>
    <li> I use it as a body moisturizer after a shower, in my hair mixed in with my conditioner and on my face every morning and evening after a wash. Soaks in completely after a couple minutes but keeps my skin shiny and moisturized with no smell so I can still wear my perfume. Works wonders and a little goes a long way. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I just made some body oil using this Almond Oil and it was just wonderful. I love the great moisture that it gives to my skin.</li>
    <li> My wife used this stuff to treat her hair and she loved it. We also used it as oil for back massages and I loved it :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> This is a great oil.  Absorbs quickly, high quality and works great as a carrier oil for my aromatherapy oils as well as a general moisturizer</li>
    <li> This oil is easy to use and great for hard-to-manage or damaged hair. I recommend it for permed or straightened hair to increase shine.</li>
    <li> This is not a review for the product but for it&#x27;s description. Not sure why is this appearing in all search results when I search for Organic Almond OIl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product is concerned, I had bought a bottle before and am happy with it. But this time am looking for an organic version. Hence the additional stars.</li>
    <li> I love the purity of the oil and is a great moisturizer.  It also doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell. Use it for all over body moisturizer and hair moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I SUGGEST THIS FOR ANYONE THAT CARES ABOUT THEIR SKIN! I MIX THIS WITH ALL MY LOTIONS ITS GENTAL AND GIVES YOUR SKIN AN ALMOND LIKE GLOW.  I DON&#x27;T LIKE IT FOR MY HAIR (A LITTLE HEAVY) BUT GREAT FOR SKIN!</li>
    <li> Fortunately I lost only about 1/4 cup but the box was an oily mess when it arrived and the bottle was not tightly sealed. I kind of wonder if it had not been a return from a prior customer as these bottles are usually so tightly sealed. So, besides this unfortunate first impression, the oil has been nice as a carrier for my essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and I find that this product helps to ease the dryness that can often accompany it.  I moved and the climate was much drier than I was accustomed to.  Getting into a new dermatologist also took some time.  I was at my wits end and decided to try this to see if it would help because several other reviewers had indicated it would.  Within a few days of using the oil on my face, the skin felt supple, instead of tight and dry. If you have rosacea you know what I am talking about and know that that feeling on your face just makes you stress more, which makes the whole situation worse!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used as an all over moisturizer after bathing but the best result for me was with my face.</li>
    <li> Great massage oil. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I use this to make a body srub with</li>
    <li> Great for my essential oil blends!</li>
    <li> Really good quality, pretty good price, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using  this Life-Flo Almond oil it to make chapstick and hand cream. It is a nice addition to other ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great product works well love using it ony face body and hair but the shipping is expensive thats my only problem with this product</li>
    <li> I used this product for years and I like, because this product moisturizes my skin. I love used this product after take a shower,</li>
    <li> I DONT LIKE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE SMELL TO ALMONDS.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and light oil. Loooove it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this brand of almond oil. Just a drop goes a long way even on the hairy clients.&lt;br /&gt;Even my clients have positive feedback on this brand.</li>
    <li> I use this almond oil for moisturizing my entire body and I use it in a homemade diaper wipe recipe.  The smell is very plain and the texture is amazing.  I have paid much more money for almond oil from mountain rose herbs and this one behaved the same if not better.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Use this item for oil cleansing, my skin is soft and moisturized throughout the day. The size of the bottle is perfect, it will last for months!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this oil to use on my hair but decided to try it to moisturize my body instead. Once I get out of the shower, while still damp, I oil myself down and my skin feels and appears dry in less than an hour. The only way that it seems partially effective is if I coat myself in Vaseline immediately after I apply the oil to my skin. Even then by the time I wake the next morn it is time to reapply more. Maybe it works for some but it just doesn&#x27;t benefit me very much.</li>
    <li> Used it during my pregnancy (every day) and I don’t have any stretch marks. Loving it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for hair and body :)</li>
    <li> I have combo skin and am in my early 20&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne for a couple years now. Before I tried almond oil on my face, I was using argan oil and it worked great! However, it was kinda costly so I thought almond might be a good alternative. A big bottle of almond cost the same as a 2oz bottle of argan and had light fragrance and did not feel as heavy. Well, I learned you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning after using my almond oil, my face had three giant pimples on it. One on my forehead, at my temple, and right on my cheek near my nose. Now even as a teen, the most acne I got was some bumps on the forehead and maybe one or two pimples on my cheeks. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple for about 2-3 years and I changed nothing else in my skincare routine so it had to be the almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt sad but I didn&#x27;t want to toss out a huge bottle I just bought so I used it on my body. My skin gets super dry and flaky during the winter no matter how often lotion is applied but the almond oil moisturized it and kept it soft and flake free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am disappointed i cannot use almond oil on my face but it is a great moisturizer for the rest of me.</li>
    <li> This is very good quality oil.  I use it for my lotions and other bath and body products and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It leaves the skin smooth and nourished.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  Makes my skin super soft.  Hopefully this will work great in the winter months also, with the dry heat at home...</li>
    <li> Absorbs into skin without leaving greasy residue.  Mixes great with essential oils.  Great for skin care and mixing.</li>
    <li> There is no scent. I have purchased smaller bottles of almond oil and it always smelled good. This has no odor at all</li>
    <li> I purchased this almond oil because it was the most pure one I could find, the only other ingredient is vitamin E oil.  I attempted to use it in my hair, but it just made it a greasy mess!  So, I don&#x27;t recommend that, but it does work well as a skin moisturizer.  If you want to get almond oil to make homemade products, this is a good one to get. However, I was very disappointed in the packaging, the oil had soaked through the box when it arrived at my house.  I was afraid the whole bottle had dumped out with how much the box was soaked.  But, it turned out that I only lost about a half ounce.  Aside from the packaging, good purchase.</li>
    <li> This oil is light and smooth. It works perfectly for infant massage without clogging pores. I don&#x27;t have to worry that my baby is ingesting/absorbing something harmful, because this oil is plant-based and food-grade!</li>
    <li> this is totally awesome - my daughter has dry skin and this makes it totally soft.  there is no bad smell and it doesn&#x27;t burn her skin like lotion does and it&#x27;s not greasy like other products we have tried.  it&#x27;s shiny at first but then your skin soaks it in and leaves just nice and soft skin.  it&#x27;s also great for you dry hands and nails</li>
    <li> I use it on my face morning and night and see a positive difference. Skin looks smoother. Of course it does not eliminate wrinkles but it does make skin look better.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It is very moisturizing. I have used it in my hair products. Skin cr&amp;egrave;me products and it is fabulous. I would purchase again. It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily feeling either.</li>
    <li> Best facial oil I have ever used. I like sleeping with it on my face. I wake up with a natural glow and smooth skin. I used to have acne scars and it reduced the appearance tremendously.</li>
    <li> It spilling in the box.</li>
    <li> Great amount for the price!</li>
    <li> Must have skin care purchase!! Leaves skin looking AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I threw out all my expensive cleansers, soaps and what nots, this is all I need to get a clear face. I massage this in and leave it on for 20 minutes and wipe it off with a damp washcloth. My face feels clean but hydrated, and no breakouts at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It does not clog my pores and I have extremely sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I truly love it! I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Love!!! I use it to take off makeup and my face doesnt get too greasy. Much better than olive oil!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!  I wouldn&#x27;t change anything about it.</li>
    <li> Ok I really love this product. Avocado oil is the best for my skin it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it&#x27;s so moisturizing!!!</li>
    <li> This is really good on my natural African-American hair. I use it with the Shea Butter - Molivera Organics 16 Oz. Premium Raw.</li>
    <li> I wish I had been using this years ago. Very mild oil, almost no smell at all. Used for severely flaking beard and scalp treatment. Made a huge difference on the very first use. Great as a base for massage oil too. Very happy. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to get rid of lines and wrinkles and so far it is a great product for massaging - keeps the skin well hydrated.</li>
    <li> I bought this specific brand based on reviews against the NOW brand.&lt;br /&gt;The natural hair community highly recommends using Sweet Almond Oil for hair growth but everyone has the NOW brand so I thought I would try this since many people say Now is not &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The item was packaged nicely &amp; secure so no spills. It is a very fluid product so I guess that is why massage therapist use this. On my 4B hair which is soft &amp; cottony, ala Prince&#x27;s afro; this oil seems to sit on top of my hair. Doesn&#x27;t absorb in. That is why I took a month before my review to give it a try in various ways. It flows as if its a mineral oil and we all know how that can be. So I will not order this brand again, but I may try the NOW brand since this was a fail and so many people swear that almond oil grows your hair long.&lt;br /&gt;I am using the remainder on my skin for old dark spots/sun damage and I have noticed some slight fading. But this oil is too oily for the face. Thumbs down for use on 4B hair, just sat on top of the strands like mineral oil would (rubs off on your hands if you touch your hair). For someone with 3BC I would think this would be too oily. I will look to see if there is an Indian brand, as that culture uses it alot, if you know of a company please drop me a message in the comments section.</li>
    <li> Really good for scalp n hair and doesnt stain clothing like other oils. Great for use on babies as well in diaper area</li>
    <li> This almond oil is fast absorbing and is fragrance free. Very good value for the size and I will order again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Pure almond oil, Hexane free and cold pressed. This was it! The only thing added is vitamin E to preserve the freshness of the product. Perfect for my homemade shea butter creams and lotions.</li>
    <li> After researching diffrent oils that would be good on my skin, I decided on the Life-Flo Pure Almond Oil.  I have very dry skin in the winter and I need something that will deeply moisturize my skin and keep in soft.  I also, discovered that the Almond oil is also great for dry scalp.  The oil is non-greasy and last all day.  I also use the almond oil around my eyes and have discovered that it&#x27;s slowly tightening the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, try this product!</li>
    <li> I use the almond oil on my face. also known as oil cleaning method. This oil is very light and after use my face feels and looks refresh. and it also has a glow afterwards.</li>
    <li> Alot of bang for the buck. I use full strength on my heals to keep them from drying out and cracking. I also add a few drops to my mosturizer. Not oily or greasy and keeps my skin baby soft.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed with this.  Bought because it is pure &amp; natural but does not moisturize anywhere near as well as good old coconut oil.  The only reason I tried it is because in cold weather the coconut oil is solid and hard to rub in.  My cat loves licking this almond oil off my legs after my shower.</li>
    <li> Very Very nice, thick and easy to rub on after bath. No scent.</li>
    <li> helps dandruff or dry scalp</li>
    <li> One of my favorite oils and companies that produces natural products.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil and it can be used for many purposes. This bottle is a great size. great buy</li>
    <li> Great after bath moisturizer; I use it for body and hair.</li>

    <li> Favorite oils I use this for so many things taking off my make up, hair, face, body, cooking.  I will be purchasing this again great product.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this oil, it is very light and absorbs very quickly. It works great for the oil cleansing method, and for making lotions.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if it helps skin look younger.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, so soothing. I use it to take off my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it red. I also add some drops to my body lotion for some extra hydration and its amazing. Also the bottle is very big so its a great value.</li>
    <li> This Almond Oil is great. I use it to oil cleanse my face and also moisturize my pregnant belly. Its very light and great for sensitive skin. I like to mix it with other oils. The package was perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great for when I get my massages! Not greasy!</li>
    <li> very nice organic oil especially for my dry winter skin in north dakota</li>
    <li> This was a reorder. The oil is soothing to dry, irritated skin. It works well as a carrier oil. It is unscented and does not stain clothes.</li>
    <li> I use it for my oil pulling. I like the taste.</li>
    <li> I am using this Almond oil for my Baby massage and it is pure.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for Almond Oil from long time and got this product at reasonable price</li>
    <li> The oil came well packaged and well within the time frame. The price was better than most of the rest.  I used it to make Brown Sugar Scrub for my granddaughter and she loved it. Is planning on making some for her girlfriends for Christmas with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product and priced well.&lt;br /&gt;Wanda</li>
    <li> I bought this based on some of the reviews and also the price point for as much as you get.  Almond Oil isn&#x27;t hard to find and not terribly expensive, so I had options.  As with most oils, the best way to keep it, they should be contained in a thicker darker glass bottle - so sunlight and exposure to changes in temperature won&#x27;t effect it as much. What you aren&#x27;t paying for with this product is that darker thicker glass bottle. It comes in a plastic clear bottle and for the most part, I was ok with that.  I knew I would be using it pretty much everyday as a hair moisturizer (I have very wavy hair), and storing it away from the sun and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it a little over two weeks and I really like it.  With just a couple drops 2-3 in my palm, I rub my hands together and bring them through my hair. I have found my hair to be softer, have more sheen, holds the curls and less frizz, without it feeling greasy or like its weighted down.  Almond oil is also great for the hair because it&#x27;s rich in protein and full of vitamins and minerals. This products has a light sweet scent to it, which is nice, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin E that is used as an antioxidant to keep the product fresh is also an added benefit and great for the skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this 16oz bottle I should have it for a long time, even with application everyday and I think you will find it to be a great product to use as well.</li>
    <li> I use it every day... I do not like having a word minimum.  The oil does not smell and feels clean.</li>
    <li> All i have to say is that i cannot live without this almond oil!! Its so moisturizing and has sooo many benefits and different uses! satisfied customer :)</li>
    <li> Love this product... Works great when mixing with your regular body lotion</li>
    <li> LOVE this oil, I use it every day in the shower.  I have naturally dry skin, and it&#x27;s especially dry and itchy in the winter months.  I now have a routine that I use year round.  In the shower I use exfoliating gloves with my body wash to remove the dead skin all over.  After showering, right after I turn off the water, I use the oil all over on damp skin, rubbing in well.  In the winter months I will usually use more, in the summer months this is a good alternative to lotion as it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel.  Then I just pat dry and the oil absorbs right in!  This has really changed my skin, no more itchy legs!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product through a YouTuber named &amp;#34;hey fran hey&amp;#34; who uses it for a face cleanser and wow what a difference this has made in my skin. I never had any skin issues in my teenage years but in my 20&#x27;s and now 30&#x27;s my face started to break out with pimples all the time. Since using this pure almond oil my face has had few breakouts and when it does, the bumps are gone much quicker. This oil truly does heal your skin from the inside out. This product has done more for my skin than any of those 5 product and hundred of Dollars worth of popular skin care lines ever have. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works as described. Love the nice clean scent and healthful yumminess...It arrived as promised. Would order again. ++++ Thank you!</li>
    <li> Trying the oil pulling thing, not sure why really, but I can say, this oil is tasteless and light, really easy to take</li>
</ol>
