      <li>This is a great skin lightening cream, it didn&#x27;t break me out and cleared some dark spots on my hands and face.</li>

      <li>There should be a bigger size available more ounces in a given bottle..</li>

      <li>So far i have used two containers of the cream.</li>

<li> only disappointment is in the size other than that this product is good to use under your arms</li>
<li> don&#x27;t know how well it works since i have not used it long enough.</li>
<li> I only suggest  that you buy a couple as there is not much in this</li>
<li> This only has one layer of this product and the rest is just empty space, on the photo is looks like the container has a lot of product</li>
<li> the bottle is even smaller then the pictures online its maybe a little bigger then</li>
<li> This is very tiny it is just a sample and not worth buying</li>
<li> so definitely was not able to use it long enough to see a difference and definitely not worth $5..</li>
<li> The only problem is the fact that there is so little.</li>
<li> Smelled great..didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other ppl mentioned...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m Mexican and I saw results within a few months.</li>
<li> so do not be fooled, i spent like 5 bucks on this thing I am so dissapointed.</li>
<li> It came sooner then expected and</li>
<li> They are very small and they do not last long all, I have not seen any change in my skin tone at all.</li>
<li> But such small product though.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m using kojic acid soap with extreme glow.</li>
<li> probably not unlike a lot of other products of this sort.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
<li> but I have some dark spots here and there.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t work and not worth it totally a waste , used it with the other pink box product on some area of my face  and nothing change !</li>
<li> If you have dark spots, mena will get rid of them in no time</li>
<li> I use it for the dark spots on my face</li>
<li> I would&#x27;ve given it another try but one: takes too long to get to you and two: small as hell..</li>
<li> Yes it does makes a diference but cream is super heavy and it will dirty anything you have contact with.</li>
<li> A waste of money not worth purchasing and giving money away.</li>
<li> my face started burning a little bit...wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
<li> but I think this cream is a waste of money.</li>
<li> I can see my skin glowing just after a few uses.</li>
<li> Waste of time and money.</li>
<li> Waste</li>
<li> Wasted my money.  </li>
<li> but I have noticed less breakouts!</li>
<li> By the way its a very small amount so use it carefully.</li>
<li> every time i apply it leaves a pale pink color tint on my skin which is not good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It really works it helps lighten up my skin makes it soft and get rid of dark spots</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. But I had an allergic reaction to it and was unable to continue use.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a tiny container, i can fit two in the palm of my hand- and i have very small hands- they don&#x27;t even fill the container with the product it&#x27;s just what you see on top so definitely was not able to use it long enough to see a difference and definitely not worth $5..</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WORKS GREAT IT KEEPS YOU FACE SOFT AND IT IS GREAT FOR A NITE TIME. PUT ON BEFORE YOU GO TO BED AND WASH OFF IN THE MORNING EASY AND SIMPLE</li>
    <li> I have to mix the mena with my skin moisturizer, but it&#x27;s an overall great product. I can see my skin glowing just after a few uses.</li>
    <li> So far i have used two containers of the cream. They are very small and they do not last long all, I have not seen any change in my skin tone at all. I don&#x27;t know how many of the creams you have to use to see results but I think this cream is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it for the dark spots on my face and I see a difference after a day or two. I just wish there was more of it in the container. If you dont use a lot it should last a while. In my opinion this product is worth buying.</li>
    <li> It came sooner then expected and it realty works. All my scares are getting lighter but I you really need to use it everyday if you want 100% results. if you skip days it takes longer but it works</li>
    <li> It only whitens when you apply it on but after it, it doesn&#x27;t make a change, it smells good and its very smooth on my skin. But such small product though. Wish it could have been a bigger size.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a product I will continue to use.. If it&#x27;s used daily it works.. The only problem is the fact that there is so little. There should be a bigger size available more ounces in a given bottle.. But Mena Xtra white gets a thumbs up from me..!!!</li>
    <li> Made my skin very smooth, to be honest I don&#x27;t remember what effects it had as far as my acne... I don&#x27;t struggle with acne. Didn&#x27;t really lighten skin but still good for skin. Very small amount of product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it does what it says it does.  probably not unlike a lot of other products of this sort.</li>
    <li> Very good. I only suggest  that you buy a couple as there is not much in this but besides that I love it.</li>
    <li> amazing it took a week for me to see results n i am African american with caramel skin tone. it smells amazing love it.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews, this was not even a full jar of this product it only lasted about a week. This only has one layer of this product and the rest is just empty space, on the photo is looks like the container has a lot of product but it does not, so do not be fooled, i spent like 5 bucks on this thing I am so dissapointed. I will never buy from this place again.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for a few weeks straight and no result.</li>
    <li> Smelled great..didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other ppl mentioned...haven&#x27;t really seen any difference in my skin tone but I have noticed less breakouts! I love it!</li>
    <li> the smell is too strong and it irritated my skin, its like a heavy makeup that not even wipes or facial cleaner can remove completely</li>
    <li> i received with the broken plastic lid which is very disappointing and i think the product would have been oxidized in transit but still i used the product ..every time i apply it leaves a pale pink color tint on my skin which is not good.</li>
    <li> I didnt see results in two weeks. I didnt like it. I will try some more but i will stop if i see no results in a month</li>
    <li> This is a piece of s***. Wasted my money.  The  size and quality is a zero. Don&#x27;t recommend this at all</li>
    <li> I received this product a day ago and was very excited to try it did so last night and only to start using it again tonight to find out its not a full jar of product and just one layer of cream and the rest is the jar. Yes what you see in this pic is just what you get there is no product paste that white surface so don&#x27;t be fooled This is a scam coming all the way from Singnapore. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money.</li>
    <li> I like it I just wish it went n the skin better an was permanent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good cream, after making it a habit of applying it everyday for like two weeks I saw results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any drastic difference with my skin when I used it. It&#x27;s a very small amount, however i didn&#x27;t like the chalky-ghostlike image it gives you. I felt my skin wasn&#x27;t as oily, but i just can&#x27;t say per-say, if it lightened discoloration.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DO NOT WORK.</li>
    <li> This product is nice and smells AWESOME! I love to place it on my skin to help fade the dark spots and even my skin tone. Very small product, but it works.</li>
    <li> Very good costumer service , and I love the product and it&#x27;s really works</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money. Too small and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Work. I&#x27;m using kojic acid soap with extreme glow. Much better results in just one week</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes since i had been using it.  I will not buy it again and i will not recommend it.,</li>
    <li> I will never buy this again. There was hardly any product it didn&#x27;t lighten up anything and for me to pay $5.00 for a little sheet of product is ridiculous I&#x27;m extremely angry and upset with this</li>
    <li> product came within promised time. smells good. don&#x27;t know how well it works since i have not used it long enough.</li>
    <li> Used for 2 months. Didn&#x27;t work at all. Just made me look ashy all the time .</li>
    <li> LET ME JUST SAY I have only been using this product for a week and the first time I put it on I knew nothing but good would come from it the smell the texture the ingridiant the bottle is even smaller then the pictures online its maybe a little bigger then an american dollar coin but i love it i bought about 7 of the regular mena&#x27;s for my body and one of these to try and i even got a pearl powder mena cream free to try! I don&#x27;t like waiting for packages but it was worth it took about 25 days but omg I love this product I hope the regular mena&#x27;s give me the same effect :3</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s literally like a tablespoon of product in the container.</li>
    <li> This did nothing but clog my pores..</li>
    <li> only disappointment is in the size other than that this product is good to use under your arms&lt;br /&gt;and if you have skin discoloration between your theighs an on your knees an elbows</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work and not worth it totally a waste , used it with the other pink box product on some area of my face  and nothing change ! non of them do anything</li>
    <li> I was surprised that content of the cream shown on this picture is what you are getting.  There was nothing underneath it.  I thought it was a ripped off.  Not satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome product! It totally works and other people say my face has never looked better.</li>
    <li> A very happy with this product.  Leaves no filmy residue and smells great!!</li>
    <li> This is a great skin lightening cream, it didn&#x27;t break me out and cleared some dark spots on my hands and face.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m Mexican and I saw results within a few months. I use this product as a high lighter or foundation 👍</li>
    <li> This is very tiny it is just a sample and not worth buying cause you wast your money better getting something else</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me..I tried it for two weeks! !..my face started burning a little bit...wasn&#x27;t for me. Waste</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING! GOOD CREAM. GREAT DESCRIPTION. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE, FROM SELF EXPERIENCE. I GIVE THIS ITEM A THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> The Mena did not lightening or brighten my skin at all. A waste of money not worth purchasing and giving money away.</li>
    <li> so I love my skin tone but I have some dark spots here and there. I went on YouTube and watched a lot of ladies review this product and Mena had great reviews. I have been using Mena for a week now. On the third day I saw that the spots were lightening up. Anytime I&#x27;m using a product and I don&#x27;t see some improvement in two weeks I give up and move on to the next thing. Mena is great. ladies PLEASE don&#x27;t use mena in the daytime or put on before your daily foundation routine, because mena goes on white and stays that way. I only use it a night before bed. If you have dark spots, mena will get rid of them in no time</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me.. You gotta get a gallons worth im sure for it to work.. I would&#x27;ve given it another try but one: takes too long to get to you and two: small as hell..like where&#x27;s the rest of the product..</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this cream it works really good, my freckles and my dark spots on my face faded, now my skin is lighter and smoother, it&#x27;s very easy to use and very affordable.</li>
    <li> this is like GHeisha  make up more than a cream to clear up your skin....what a joke....do not waste your money</li>
    <li> This thing was such a trick - it looked like a lot of cream but, actually it is only one thin layer on top just like the way it is shown.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth it.  It ran out before it did any good to my skin.</li>
    <li> it was ok, not much difference</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and the main point, its just like make up. Yes it does makes a diference but cream is super heavy and it will dirty anything you have contact with. I recommend to used it during the night before you go to sleep. By the way its a very small amount so use it carefully.</li>
