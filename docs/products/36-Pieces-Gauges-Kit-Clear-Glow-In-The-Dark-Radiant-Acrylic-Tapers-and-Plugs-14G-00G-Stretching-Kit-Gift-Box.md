<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got them! They were amazing. Can&#x27;t find them now, but when I had them they fit absolutely perfect and I was able to gauge up....BUT they didn&#x27;t glow as brightly as I thought they would. I left them in sun, and under lamps and they didn&#x27;t glow that they do in the picture.</li>
    <li> they shippedfast and were all in the box and individual packages they all fit And are easy-to-use</li>
    <li> I got every size it said, each size was individually packaged with the tapers and plugs c:&lt;br /&gt;The #1 question I had was, does it really glow.. at first its hard to see... its not a glow stick and wont light the dark but yes, it does glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this item as a whole and suggest people to order from these peeps c:</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected. Fits great and doesn&#x27;t bother my ears!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product, and everything was there.</li>
    <li> They were awesome everything was delivered in schedule and the kit was super dope</li>
    <li> I bought these because my sons wanted to stretch their ears and I got tired of buying them one at a time. They really like them.</li>
    <li> I love that each size is in an individual baggie.</li>
    <li> Shipping was a little slow but otherwise great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I like that these glow in the dark. These are nice and light when on and plain enough to wear to work or anywhere. The shipping was right on time. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this and love it.</li>
    <li> These gauges will be great for you if you want them to only glow in the dark for a few minutes. I loved how they came in small little baggies with the sizes on them and how cheap they were compared to buying gauges from other stores like Hot Topic or Spencers, but other than that they weren&#x27;t really good.</li>
    <li> great starter kit. Love them</li>
    <li> I placed my order December 27th, and arrived December 31st. Amazed at how quickly I received them. The packaging is perfect and they look exactly like the picture shown. Wearing them as I write this and I love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them one bit. The glow didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> GREAT KIT&lt;br /&gt;it glows, all the gauges are in separate bags, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> These glow awesomely in the dark! I just put the flash light from my phone directly on these and then I turned the lights off and bam they glowed. Overall these are great to stretch with , people say it isn&#x27;t good to stretch with acrylic but If you take good care of your ears and taking time stretching your ears then you should be fine, I am at 8G right now trying to get to a 6G.</li>
    <li> I have tried all of them &amp; they all glow in the dark. Loved it !!</li>
    <li> GOD I REALLY LOVED THESE&lt;br /&gt;i got all of them just as said&lt;br /&gt;works well for me along with the glow</li>
    <li> my daughter loves theses</li>
    <li> Just an what I wanted. None were missing!! And they actually glow in the dark. They even came early.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy they finally came! but when I looked at them one of the 10g ones were broken😒😩 and the other small ones (14g to 8g) seem like they can break easily and they are really bendable and they hardly glow. they also didn&#x27;t come with plugs 😓</li>
    <li> There nice but the only problem I have is even though I left them out a while to make them glow they don&#x27;t really glow</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them.! I am now successfully a 0 waiting to be 00</li>
    <li> Love love love them! My mother didn&#x27;t approve at first but now she loves them, because of glow in the dark!</li>
    <li> they are ok if you want white tapers. the glowing isn&#x27;t that good. for the price it&#x27;s ok, except shipping. but otherwise the glowing part which is why I bout em, doesn&#x27;t really impress.</li>
    <li> They were really good. I didnt have a problem at all with them. Really good price for really good quality. And the fact that they ae glow in the dark makes them even better.</li>
    <li> Can stretch out again. And this I don&#x27;t use sell</li>
    <li> All of the expected pieces came, and they even came in separate bags with the size written on it. The package came earlier than expected too. Nice product!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works!</li>
    <li> They are very well made its a great price for the money. I might buy others from this company again</li>
    <li> they barely  glow at the dark , u can even say they dont glow at the dark ..</li>
    <li> I just got them today and they are amazing! The do glow in the dark and I live that they are in their separate baggies.&lt;br /&gt;Other then it arriving a day later then expected, it is a must buy if you want gauges c: ❤</li>
    <li> Very basic, but I like them and they&#x27;re comfy. The glow in the dark is quick to fade after using a black light to charge them, I&#x27;m not very far in, so maybe the bigger ones hold it better.</li>
    <li> Sizes are perfect I saw some people saying the sizes were off but they are not they are just fine! They glow great!</li>
    <li> Product as described, good quality and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Had an infection and missing the 0g size</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and arrived with everything advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible for me to switch from 2g to a 0g</li>
    <li> Thier awsome cam early than expedid</li>
    <li> This kit is awesome. They do glow in the dark. Nice quality too.</li>
    <li> They were just what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> They came on time, are very nice and as a bonus they really do glow in the dark.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. And they GLOW IN THE DARK</li>
    <li> I bought these a while ago, and im still using the kit! IT&#x27;S AMAZINGGG! Im so in love with this kit and the more you leave the plugs in the light the more they glow. Im on 6g and im extremely happy with this product tho I&#x27;ve lost a few plastic rings but thats to be expected with a clutz like me xD I was in love with these when I bought them and I still am, me and my freinds are going to share this kit (after cleaning off the gauges after we use them of course) but overall it&#x27;s a great product! I recommend it for every one who wants stretched ears, hell even some of my friends thought they were ear rings so their easy to hide as well.</li>
    <li> Very Impressive, have the 12Gs in as we speak, and I don&#x27;t have a single problem with them. I mean, they really don&#x27;t glow crazy bright, but there small so its understandable.</li>
    <li> Im using this to stretched my ear lobes. I love the color to me is a neutral color. So I don&#x27;t have to if it match with my clothes.</li>
    <li> Very Good Quality For A Low Price I Will Be Ordering More !</li>
    <li> Starting out and I found this set and thought it was a great deal. I love everything about it and came early. Will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected, though the glow is very short lived.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves them. She wanted them to wear to a school dance and everyone loved them. They actually glow in the dark.</li>
    <li> great gift for my friend... didnt know what color he likes so the white and glow in the dark combo was perfect</li>
    <li> They arrived on time, no missing pieces c: Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;They come in pairs with both tapers and plugs.</li>
    <li> Came on time, was nicely packaged, the plugs and tapers were labeled in different baggies.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome. They slide right through my ears when I am sizing up and I love how they look when they glow.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought these gauges for cheap and boy did they exceed my expectations. I was expecting some half-fast job on them made out of cheap plastic but they are thick, durable, and comfortable.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. They came on time and are labaled what one is what size i would definantly recomend these to anyone going to stretch their ears.</li>
    <li> For the price its pretty hard to beat. The plugs are a bit small if you have a larger ear lobe. I dont think there a bad product though. I would more or less recommend them so your not buying tapers and plugs every time you go up a size.</li>
    <li> Loved and used it until my ears got infected. Even though this product is on point I suggest stretching with stainless steel.</li>
    <li> Shipping took longer than it said it should have but other than that in very happy with this product all the pieces are labeled and the posts have notches to help keep bands on.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Works great. Ive been wanting to gauge my ears and these work great.  Great buy and cheap.</li>
    <li> Great kit, I love that they are all labeled.  The black rubber bands smell bad, they have ridges on them so the rubber bands don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> You are saving so much money buying these for this price.  i couldnt be happier</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s self Is a ten but tthese tapers do not glow in the dark for long , I put it in light for 2 mins and it only stayed lit up for 5 seconds and I really wanted something cool that&#x27;s what I payed for so I&#x27;m disappointed with the glow in the dark idea</li>
    <li> I left my gauges out for a few months and these came to the rescue! I generally only wear glass, but these were great to build up to 0 again...</li>
    <li> the product got here right on time and it actually glows. it comes with everything it says it comes with and looks very great. its a very great price for how many pieces it comes with</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re tapers and plugs. Not many ways you can fudge that up. They glow really nicely and they&#x27;re smooth and durable. No faults here.</li>
    <li> Got here when I expected it to and I love that they glow in the dark! awesome, great , amazingly sweet!</li>
    <li> Great working very easy to find when It feel out and I like the look of them the orings had a few alight problems but nothing worth looking over these great overall product</li>
    <li> Came in on time and all pairs were there.</li>
    <li> Accurate description, is working great. Materials are obviously inexpensive but not super cheap-feeling.</li>
    <li> Looooooved them. They actually glow really good!</li>
    <li> Loved it my ears are at a 00g and they&#x27;re healthy to</li>
    <li> This is a great way to stretch up if you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive, although the glow doesn&#x27;t last long but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> It was perfect, everything came clearly marked and on time. They are sturdy and I have only lost one rubber ring so far.</li>
    <li> Suckish delivery but over all pretty good</li>
    <li> It got here super quick! I wasn&#x27;t expecting for at least another week. Glows really bright as well. Only problems are the sizes are a tad bit off and the black o ring on one of the the 4g tapers were broken. Still overall a great buy.</li>
    <li> The gauges are in great shape and work perfect, I have yet to really see anything wrong with them, plus they glow :)</li>
    <li> Love this product! Very organized, all sizes in their own little bag, all sizes are there, and they really glow! This is a must have if you&#x27;re trying to stretch your ears!</li>
    <li> I love it , there actually glow in the dark. right when i got it I put the smallest size, can&#x27;t wait till I reach 00g (:</li>
    <li> I got my set within a week of ordering it and everything is exactly as it said! they don&#x27;t glow very brightly but they do glow and I love it! i&#x27;m at a 0 and I love showing off my lobes! I had to downsize but it was only because I was to impatient! I highly recommend taking your time! But if you are looking for a cheap and wonderful plug and taper kit I would highly recommend these babies!</li>
    <li> Great set all bags are labeled with the size and really great price compared to hot topic</li>
    <li> I just dislike the fact thathat they don&#x27;t glow.</li>
    <li> Cool tunnels already been gauging my ear up love them</li>
    <li> Works great, and is a great first kit to stretch with! Came exactly as listed, and they really do glow! It&#x27;s pretty sweet!</li>
    <li> Love the glow in the dark</li>
    <li> im super happy with this product like the other reviews said they came in on time and they were wrapped in little baggies</li>
    <li> These are supposed to be glow-in-the-dark, but I can&#x27;t get them to glow.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great kit!!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect and easy. I stretched to a 00g but my mother made me take them out and threw them away :(</li>
    <li> Great deal love them good quality product</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. They glow pretty bright when they are charged</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my niece (after getting parents&#x27; permission, of course!). She was so excited about them. Each set of sizes comes in its own individual little plastic baggie, which is great to keep everything where it needs to be.... However, since it was a gift, it could have used a better presentation from the company, especially since I paid $20 with my prime membership. Other than presentation, this is a solid recommendation.</li>
    <li> Came right on time and I like that they put each pair in its own bag according to size. I love them and they look so cool at night. :))</li>
    <li> I just recieved this and only got tapers. Does it not actually come with plugs?</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone trying to stretch their ears to 00g. Love it. They glow amazingly bright. Use Black Light to make them glow brighter.</li>
    <li> Great temporary stretching package. Try not to keep acrylic in your ears for too long. Steel, glass, stone, wood, etc. are better for your ears.</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come with 2 inch.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to regauge my ears because they used to be a 6 when I was 14. Four years latter I decided, hey why not? But its hard when one pair is like ten to 15 a piece when I just don&#x27;t have money for that. These are really cheap but very good quality and very pretty. I kept putting in different sizes to see what I&#x27;m at and I was able to get the 8 in with no problem. I don&#x27;t care much for the tapers but they make it really easy to slide in, wear for a day then switch to plugs. I REALLY love the plugs. I&#x27;ve had a lot of issues with plugs in the past, the black bands always fell off and I would lose my gauges. When I bought plugs that the ends were slightly bigger then the middle causing them to get stuck in my ears for months and I would have to research the secret of getting them off (still didn&#x27;t work). I ended up having to wrap tape around them to stretch my ear enough to get them out. But these glow in the dark gauges have small little notches in them for the black bands keeping them in place. Brilliant! It also helps me not have an OCD Freak out attack because I know each one is even on both sides. Love them :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t glow as bright as expected but it was definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> Were great for sizing up, mine didn&#x27;t glow though but didn&#x27;t really care for that part.</li>
    <li> I was so hype to get these in mail I opened it to find only tappers when it clearly says tappers and plugs but the tappers are pretty cool I would like my plugs tho that&#x27;s what I really want in my ear not these long ass gauges</li>
    <li> Got these for my little sister and she loves them. They come individually packaged!! Thats real awesome.</li>
    <li> They are good for the most part but when I was sizing up to a 6g I don&#x27;t think the sizes were correct and blew out my ear.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, great</li>
    <li> Just what i expected! :)</li>
    <li> I loved them.  They were comfortable,  and like everybody else said they had their own little baggies.</li>
    <li> these are awesome they came  one day late but its cool because it came from Miami fl. and im in Washington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there great to start gauging i like how there all in separate bags according to size and it has the size printed on each baggie :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;glow in the dark doesn&#x27;t last long but there white so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> Arrived a day earlier than expected, really like having both the plugs and spikes, I have given the smaller sizes to my friend so she can start gauging her ears, really like that they glow in the dark as well.</li>
    <li> Love these! They all came super early and all in individual bags . Have stretched all the way to 10 g , love them!</li>
    <li> There were alright. They came seperated in bags by size saving me the trouble of identifing everything. But on the double zero gagues the rubber bands were broken....</li>
    <li> Do not buy it looks nice but the big sizes are way too big like an 8g is the size of like between a 6g and a 4g</li>
    <li> Got here fast. Easy to use. Actually glow. Great!</li>
    <li> Thank god they individually packed all the different sizes! Im so glad I wont have to wait SO long to size up. They glow great as well. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with it all. If you&#x27;re just starting and don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have money whenever you wanna size up, this is meant for you!</li>
    <li> Great price. Great quality. Came in a different bag for each size.</li>
    <li> I love them. Mine were really glowing! If you want them to glow a little brighter. Take a picture and put the flash on with it, and they&#x27;ll glow for a good while :$</li>
    <li> These just came today, 4 days before they were supposed too, I love them!  The larger sizes do glow but the smaller sizes arent as vibrant.  These are great man.</li>
    <li> i love them so much im currently at a 6g cant wait to up size soon</li>
    <li> so cheap and so cool! comes with 2 plugs and 2 tapers for each size, doesn&#x27;t really glow in the dark but they just look white (haven&#x27;t tried too much) got these for my girlfriend and she loves them. I wish I had these when I was sizing up.. I probably paid this price per size! (maybe even more)</li>
    <li> These came in really quick, and are great quality for a starting stretcher.</li>
    <li> Good quality, shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Such a good purchase! I would recommend it to anyone! Only thing I hate was waiting to get them!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this. Good price, all sizes were there and labeled clearly, and they really do glow in the dark. Impressed.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes them</li>
    <li> First of all, they came on time. Second, I LOVE how each set of sizes is in it&#x27;s own bag. I didn&#x27;t have to take time to size &#x27;em up.  Third, glow in the dark is always a win.</li>
    <li> Amazing, absolutely perfect fit and glows bright</li>
    <li> gives you exactly what you want. also comes with little bags that have the size printed on them so you dont get confused and mix tapers in with different sizes</li>
    <li> Oh yes didn&#x27;t need to go out and spend all kinda money</li>
    <li> They glow really well</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t glow as much as in the picture</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them! They are everything i wanted and they are in individual bags marked with the the sizes, very helpful indeed :)</li>
    <li> they dont glow like suppost to</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Worked just fine for my daughter&#x27;s first set :)</li>
    <li> Didnt glow right even after holding up to light barely could see</li>
    <li> they work awesomely well there easy to slide in and they look good</li>
    <li> Awesome! Really like them!</li>
    <li> 4/5 they glow really nice but they do have to be in the light for a little while. (However so does any thing else that glows) also I only received one 8g plug, both tapers though. If I had both it would have been 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great it glows it gauges!!! Kind of</li>
    <li> The girl loved them. I bought them for a friend&#x27;s daughter. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Really do glow. Gauges and tapers come in indivaul bags with the size stamp on each bag. Love them. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Really good, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It was cool until I was ready to go up to a 10g. I found out I only had one taper and that sucked. I called them and they never called me back. It&#x27;s OK now because I&#x27;m at a 6g but when I buy a 36 piece set , I except 36 pieces not 35.</li>
    <li> Very good product thank you</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price! Although I didn&#x27;t need sizes 16-12 (my ears were already at a 10, because I was regauging my ears) but I love em!</li>
    <li> Love them. All there. And as described. Just like gauges except they really do glow in the dark. Only proble is the black things fall off easily.</li>
    <li> Love how they fit my ears</li>
    <li> I ordered this of course because I wanted to gauge. It comes in the sizes 14-00 and has tapers and plugs and of course it comes in pairs in case you were curious. Most places sell kits like this for about $15-$20 (or at least in my area) and this was a huge money saver. I highly recommend buying stretching balm by gauge gear. It helps the healing process and also slide in the gauge with ease so its less painful. Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> Firstly they are AMAZING and came earlier than expected. They each came organized in separate baggies and I got ALL of them c: I am so excited to use them. Their glow is so awesome. Even my mom thinks they are super amazing. I was hesitant because I thought &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; but these have NO FLAWS. IM SO HAPPY c:</li>
    <li> They are amazing and glow oh my god the dark very well. :)</li>
    <li> Great quality just wish it came with some instructions so I knew how long to wait before stretching up</li>
    <li> Love the gauges and they came on time! Except they dont glow as bright as the picture looks. But still awesome!!!</li>
    <li> These gauges were awesome and were&lt;br /&gt; delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Super awesome! I got the package two days early everything was there and easy to tell what was what. It glows but not as bright as I hoped it&#x27;s still a really great product</li>
    <li> amazing. Loved them. Complete. Actually glow in the dark. Great quality low price.</li>
    <li> I ordered these and they were really nice. Except for when I got to the 6g. I don&#x27;t think they are all the exact right sizes, but they work if you can deal with the slight difference. And they do glow!</li>
    <li> Came with everything that I expected does glow in dark but not to bright also labels sizes in it&#x27;s individual bags</li>
    <li> Awesome to be honest I have a month with this order and I&#x27;m at size 4g I&#x27;m happy sizing up is easy until you have to go from 8 to 6 since it seems to be a little more bigger (: but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> These are great! I love them and when I bought them I only needed 4g to 00g but having the others are great too. Completely love them!!</li>
    <li> Came fast and actually glow in the dark not like other plugs !</li>
    <li> Woooo!! So I just put the 14G in with applying Lobe lube something i bought separately and it hurt once it got to the top woo ! I suggest you buy a lube or um put some type of moisturizer on it so it slides in better..They all came in a separate bag which is good and has the labels printed on the bag as well. But I feel like a bad ass for no apparent reason. But overall im great with the product also it DOES glow just like the picture .No funky smell or anything looks like the picture once again. THANKS !!!!</li>
    <li> I got my tapers sooner than expected! I am super happy with them except I didn&#x27;t get my plugs. But they are sending me the plugs ASAP! Great customer service and great product! :)</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected, and is exactly as described. Would order again.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing they glow which is freaking cool</li>
    <li> I got these for my boyfriend and they really do glow in the dark... like crazy bright. only problem i have is it came with two 8g instead of a 10g... i don&#x27;t think hell care anyway :) I&#x27;m sure he will LOVE them ^.^</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! They stretched my ears perfectly! The glow in the dark is awesome and the plugs are really comfortable to wear! The price is amazing! Defenitly a good buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great stretching kit and the pieces are easy to find since they glow. I love This because it has both the tapers and the posts and I have 2 gauges in each ear so pairing 2 tapers would look weird but with this I can look good.</li>
    <li> They good if they don&#x27;t glow at first put them next to ur flash light for a few  then they will glow in the dark afterwards</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t glow as bright as the picture, but the glow.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s are a pretty good set, didn&#x27;t take to long to arrive and actually glow. My boyfriend loves them :) I highly recomend them</li>
    <li> Exactly what it said it would be. 😁</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and expected</li>
    <li> cute. perfect. AND THEY GLOW</li>
    <li> I LOVE these tapers and plugs! they are all split into separate sizes and are the EXACT size they claim to be, to the millimeter! I can&#x27;t wait to stretch my ears more!</li>
    <li> They are very good quality. Only thing was that I was expecting them to glow just as much as they do in the picture. The only ones that do glow a little are the bigger sizes but just a little. Other than that I am happy with my purchase .</li>
    <li> They are amazing i love them &amp; they got here really fast</li>
    <li> Great set of guages but they do not glow in the dark. They are just white.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my friend. 😂 but they are really cool to look at. They really glow and all of them came in assorted baggies. Really cool.</li>
    <li> This kit is great it shipped fast and is made of very good materials the price is nothing compared to the actual feel and wear of these</li>
    <li> I just love this kit! They came early and each size is bagged seprate :) The only issue I have is they don&#x27;t glow as bright as the pic but I didnt really exspect them to :3 There still really nice though.</li>
    <li> Recieved these in no time and they were nicely packaged and labeled. No pieces were missing and now I am happily stretching my ears! I even purchased bigger sizes!</li>
    <li> I love the way they were individually wrapped by gauge size.</li>
    <li> Love them a lot. They glow in the dark which is great. Only works well if you know how to take care of them. If you don&#x27;t then don&#x27;t even try to stretch your ears. Make sure you don&#x27;t mess up you might screw yourself over. But anyways came in great condition and they work very well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t glow very well but are cheap and work great!</li>
    <li> Perfect come with exactly what&#x27;s listed and is divided into each sides own bags</li>
    <li> Yeah, they came on time.all in individual little baggies. but i wanted them to glow brighter like the pic showed. all in all not bad.</li>
    <li> its good, i like what i bought</li>
    <li> I loved it hahaha!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these gauges and when they got to my house I looked at them and all the sizes were off the 14 was like a 16 the 12 was even smaller. Other than that they were good</li>
    <li> it came exactly how it describes , it doesnt glow as bright as the pictures though but it&#x27;s alright , i love them (:</li>
    <li> This was a awesome buy. I can say the acrylic isn&#x27;t good for stretching it causes infection which has happened with this product and is still happening in my left lobe. I just say long as you can prevent infection these are amazing !! :) I&#x27;m on Instagram tinylovexo if you wanna see how they look on Simone</li>
    <li> I just got them today, just wanna say there amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered these not expecting them to be this great. They came two days before it said they would, they do glow in the dark and they are smooth when they slide in and the plug is the same size as the taper. They are all bagged separately which is great. I would order these again</li>
    <li> These are great! They&#x27;ve lasted so long! My boyfriend loved them and passed them to his sister who loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glow doesn&#x27;t fade at all!</li>
    <li> These are my first gauges and may I say amazing. They arrived two days after I ordered them it was great shipping, they all were there and individually packaged, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what was described. I am very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast! Cheap and easy to keep track of because of the individual baggies for each size. Loved this gauging kit ♥</li>
    <li> I loved these gauges and I would definitely refers these to friends</li>
    <li> The bumbers stay put and when charged up, they glow super bright</li>
    <li> Super awesome kit, shipped same day for $27! Doesn&#x27;t get better than that. I&#x27;ve stretched my ears and let em close a couple of times now, excited to get a kit for such a great deal.</li>
    <li> I feel like the sizes were wrong but other than that they were fantastic.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for a good product.</li>
