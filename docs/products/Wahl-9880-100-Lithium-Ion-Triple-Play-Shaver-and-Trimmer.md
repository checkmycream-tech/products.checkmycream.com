### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The detail trimmer and adjustable 1-6 guide works great on my sideburns (which grow out of control!)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best rechargeable shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in that regard----and</li>
      <li>Very happy I decided on this shaver.</li>
      <li>When I got there I saw this Wahl razor and having a Wahl clipper that I am happy with, I decided to give this a shot.</li>
      <li>A great shaver at a great price.  </li>
      <li>Bought it any way, expecting great things.</li>
      <li>Was concerned, because there weren&#x27;t many good reviews on it, however he likes it and thinks it works great!</li>
      <li>the rotary system, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t do a good job with some of the longer hairs.  </li>
      <li>it was that good.  </li>
      <li>You could stand in front of the mirror for an hour using this shaver and still would not get a good shave.</li>
      <li>It gives a good shave.  </li>
      <li>Now you have my 43 bucks, and I&#x27;m the proud owner of yet another cheap piece of plastic.</li>
      <li>I must admit, the shaving portion does a nice job with that.</li>
      <li>Nice close shave</li>
      <li>in fact, it outlasts many &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; things I own, shavers and otherwise.  </li>
      <li>This looked good in the store but taking it out of the box, I discovered it was really cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>So 1 more minute tidy up</li>
      <li>Very cheap, plastic feel without a lot of power.  </li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re spending a couple hundred more, I guess you should expect something better in terms of materials.  </li>
      <li>I bought this shaver because it came out top on the gadget show.</li>
      <li>In actuality, they&#x27;re running the clock on the return period offered by most sellers.</li>
      <li>Now I know better.</li>
      <li>I love this shaver/trimmer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with that----it&#x27;s a shaver, not my car&#x27;s dashboard.  </li>
      <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t discarded the packaging or it would surely be returned.  </li>
      <li>As with every Wahl I&#x27;ve had, the motor is strong.  </li>
      <li>It does a fine job if you shave every day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m perplexed why some people say it &amp;#34;falls apart&amp;#34; while they shave.  </li>
      <li>and I was as smooth as...  </li>
      <li>Cheap plastic?  </li>
      <li>I have been excited about this shaver ever since I saw an ad for it in a trade magazine over a year ago, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to get one.  </li>
      <li>It is incredible that with modern engineering such a piece of garbage finds it onto the market.  </li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s true that \\&quot;Not all that glitters is gold.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>This is an absolute manufacturing flaw and I am sure they know it.</li>
      <li>I gave it two stars vice one because it does function fairly well on the flat portions of your face.  </li>
      <li>On arrival i thought it looked  cheap, felt cheap and actually was cheap at £38.00 from argos.</li>
      <li>I used an old Norelco for years that did a much better job.</li>
      <li>Other than the plastic design I love this razor!</li>
      <li>For now though, after a couple years of daily use, I&#x27;m pleased with this model.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very easy to empty the stubble out of the head----you</li>
      <li>My unit has fell apart so many times that I can&#x27;t get it back together any more, and it&#x27;s only 3 months old!  </li>
      <li>After only a couple of weeks shaving, blades are already becoming blunt and shaving time is going up week by week, not covered under warranty.  </li>
      <li>I was debating whether to give it a 4 or a 5, but decided on the 5, primarily to help raise the overall rating because frankly, the lowest reviews need to be compensated for with a higher rating.  </li>
      <li>It comes with its double zipper bag so makes easy 2 take on vacation or business trips.</li>
      <li>As a young boy I can remember standing at the sink watching my father shave with his shave soap and single blade safety razor as he preached to me the benefits of using a manual razor over electric while, wanting to be just like dad, I mirrored every stroke with my own &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; fashioned out of wood.</li>
      <li>It went in the bin today after 2 months and 3 days use, absolute rubbish.    </li>
      <li>I tested it recently and it took 2 minutes to shave 2 days stubble 90% smooth.  </li>
      <li>shaves very good;however</li>
      <li>However, it really struggles around the chin and under the nose.  </li>
      <li>I am very grateful that Amazon had a return option for this item, but my advice is do not buy this razor to begin with and you won&#x27;t have to utilize Amazon&#x27;s customer service.</li>
      <li>error&amp;#34; ismost responsible for the frustration that some folks are experiencing and &amp;#34;unrealistic expectations considering the price point&amp;#34; might explain why others think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; compared to a Panasonic that costs $250.00 instead of $69.95.  </li>
      <li>Watch out if you put too much pressure, the whole shaving head will come off.</li>
      <li>I have gotten a really close shave every morning</li>
      <li>I really like it.   </li>
      <li>it was time for my first shave with my shiny new toy before date night with my better half.</li>
      <li>You can pull your skin down to get closer or put more pressure on the shaver but nothing helps.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, shaving used to take twice as long, since I always had to clean-up my Wahl shave with a conventional razor.</li>
      <li>I came out as the best shaver on the Gadget Show last week beating shavers 3 times as expensive, which was why I bought mine</li>
      <li>/&gt;After seeing an impressive commercial promoting the close shave this Wahl shaver/trimmer provided, I decided to take a leap of faith, trusting the Wahl name to not steer me wrong.</li>
      <li>But make no mistake about it----this gives a decent shave.  </li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews because, in spite of a fairly decent shave, it is a piece of junk.  </li>
      <li>Does not say a lot for The Gadget Show&#x27;s standard of reviewing products, reminds me a bit of BBC&#x27;s Top Gear program, enough said.</li>
      <li>After two months I have had enough, I have just purchased a new head for the Remington and the Wahl is going into the bin and good riddance to it, waste of money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend NOT being this razor; instead, stick with a Norelco, Brahn, or other name brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine over two years now and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out why so many reviewers are having so much trouble with theirs.  </li>
      <li>I had to wait for new stocks but bought one, here is my experience.  </li>
      <li>I went to the store to buy a new Norelco after reading the reviews on some new ones.</li>
      <li>Managed to find a new one on eBay</li>
      <li>I love the old Wahl cutter bar style and for my next new purchase, I&#x27;d consider going back to one of those----especially if they&#x27;re making them with the same lithium ion battery pack as this rotary.  </li>
      <li>Very cheap, I never write reviews good or bad but this shaver is a piece of junk!</li>
      <li>It is loud and thirty minutes after I began</li>
      <li>So I keep an old Wahl cutter bar model in the bathroom----with</li>
      <li>Wahl describe this as a professional product I would describe it as anything</li>
      <li>No indicator on shaver to tell how much power is left.  </li>
      <li>It does its job very well and maintenance is simple.</li>
      <li>I always considered the name \\&quot;Wahl\\&quot; to mean top quality.</li>
      <li>The trimmer attachment in particular sold me on this investment as I was tired of my cheap trimmers that has a cord always getting in the way, and really, I could not be happier with its performance and variety of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>well let&#x27;s see, maybe compared to a Braun or Panasonic that costs three times as much, the plastic and brushed aluminum falls a bit short.  </li>
      <li>I bought this razor based on previous positive experiences with Wahl products, but this razor really comes up short.  </li>
      <li>Not being familiar with electric razors, I thought that the slight rattling when I first flipped the switch was normal until at least I pressed the foils to my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless you want to look like a 14 year old with crappy patchy facial hair even after extended labored effort, DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR.</li>
      <li>but it was sold out and, apparently, discontinued.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless you want to look like a 14 year old with crappy patchy facial hair even after extended labored effort, DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR.</li>
      <li>When first purchased battery lasted about 10 days (35 minutes run time) already this has dropped to almost half that in two months use (Not covered on warranty).  </li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re spending a couple hundred less, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect thinner plastics.  </li>
      <li>This shaver is poorly designed and easily falls apart.  </li>

<li> I enjoy the gadget show but, in this case, they were wrong.</li>
<li> It shows no signs of quitting----still holds a charge for weeks, still has sharp enough blades----and nothing has &amp;#34;fallen apart&amp;#34; yet.  </li>
<li> Twenty-five years later, tired of the occasional knick when hurrying to get to work and annoyed with the mild irritation that comes with shaving off a thin layer of skin with my Gillette Fusion, I hoped and expected the technology of electric razors to have improved significantly since the days of yore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Very Stiff &amp; Loud !</li>
<li> It was rough</li>
<li> I have to wet shave after I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
<li> , it pulled, I tried pressing harder, I tried moving it in small circles clockwise, I tried counter-clockwise, up, down, back, forth and nothing worked.</li>
<li> but you have to be very careful to keep it from literlly falling apart in your hands.  </li>
<li> Now I just go straight to the conventional razor, leaving me valuable extra minutes to write scathing reviews.</li>
<li> you think I&#x27;m an idiot and don&#x27;t know how to use the razor or that I have unreal expectations like that of an elementary school art teacher wanting a second grader to emulate Van Gogh, I have since bought a Norelco that works infinitely</li>
<li> It will fall off after slight usage.</li>
<li> Perhaps they&#x27;re not good at reading instructions or figuring out simple &amp;#34;click in place&amp;#34;</li>
<li> Heads only rotate slowly compared to other shavers and slow dramatically when put against the face.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am so thoroughly disappointed in this product. I may swear off of wahl products entirely. What a ripoff and waste of money</li>
    <li> The razor is poorly built and failed within 30 days of receipt.  I am very grateful that Amazon had a return option for this item, but my advice is do not buy this razor to begin with and you won&#x27;t have to utilize Amazon&#x27;s customer service.</li>
    <li> This is an excellant razor if it would just stay together.  Nice close shave but you have to be very careful to keep it from literlly falling apart in your hands.  I always considered the name \\&quot;Wahl\\&quot; to mean top quality. Now I know better. My unit has fell apart so many times that I can&#x27;t get it back together any more, and it&#x27;s only 3 months old!  Save your money and buy a Norelco or something, ANYTHING except a WAHL.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because it came out top on the gadget show. On arrival i thought it looked  cheap, felt cheap and actually was cheap at £38.00 from argos. Now, i realise why. After using this shaver for a lengthy amount of time, i found my face still felt like sandpaper,(at least a days growth). I think from now on I&#x27;ll review before i buy. Wish I&#x27;d purchased it from amazon so i could return it</li>
    <li> At the time the Gadget show reviewed this product, I was looking to replace my Remington shaver. Just after their review, stocks ran out and the prices went up by about 25%. I had to wait for new stocks but bought one, here is my experience.  1. This shaver is an ergonomic nightmare, head is at wrong angle to body, shaver body is too thin even for me with small hands.  2. One hours charge only gives 30-35 minutes shaving time not 2 hours running time. Remington gives 60 minutes shaving time even after a couple of years.  3. Heads only rotate slowly compared to other shavers and slow dramatically when put against the face.  4. After only a couple of weeks shaving, blades are already becoming blunt and shaving time is going up week by week, not covered under warranty.  5. When charging no indicator on power supply or shaver to tell if charging. No indicator on shaver to tell how much power is left.  6. When first purchased battery lasted about 10 days (35 minutes run time) already this has dropped to almost half that in two months use (Not covered on warranty).  7. After two months I have had enough, I have just purchased a new head for the Remington and the Wahl is going into the bin and good riddance to it, waste of money. Will never buy another Wahl product after this one.    Wahl describe this as a professional product I would describe it as anything but. It went in the bin today after 2 months and 3 days use, absolute rubbish.    Does not say a lot for The Gadget Show&#x27;s standard of reviewing products, reminds me a bit of BBC&#x27;s Top Gear program, enough said.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at Wal-mart.  I shave my head and, I must admit, the shaving portion does a nice job with that. The problem is that this device falls apart.  I don&#x27;t mean figuratively, I mean literally, as you shave, it comes apart.  The shaving head comes off the body, and usually falls to the ground.  It takes a while to reassemble the parts. It is incredible that with modern engineering such a piece of garbage finds it onto the market.  I still shave my head with it.  I taped the shaver to the body with electric tape, but that means that I can&#x27;t use the rest of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON YOU, WAHL!</li>
    <li> Avoid this at all costs.  This shaver is poorly designed and easily falls apart.  I started having problems within 3 days of use with the cover popping open while I was shaving.  I cannot believe this made it through any sort of quality control.  Wahl should be ashamed of themselves for putting a piece of junk like this on the market.</li>
    <li> Awful shaver. Was desperate to get one after the gadget show review but it was sold out and, apparently, discontinued. Managed to find a new one on eBay but it was twice the price. Bought it any way, expecting great things. Big mistake! Absolutely useless - battery life is bad, power is non-existent, it&#x27;s noisy, painful and doesn&#x27;t give anything resembling a close shave. I have to wet shave after I&#x27;ve used this. I enjoy the gadget show but, in this case, they were wrong. Rubbish.</li>
    <li> The ads say this shaver gives an ultra close shave. This is not even close to what you get. You could stand in front of the mirror for an hour using this shaver and still would not get a good shave. It doesn&#x27;t get close at all. You can pull your skin down to get closer or put more pressure on the shaver but nothing helps. Watch out if you put too much pressure, the whole shaving head will come off. I had to go all over my face with a blade razor to finish the job. I used an old Norelco for years that did a much better job. I went to the store to buy a new Norelco after reading the reviews on some new ones. When I got there I saw this Wahl razor and having a Wahl clipper that I am happy with, I decided to give this a shot. Wrong move. DO NOT BUY THIS SHAVER. I should have bought the Norelco.</li>
    <li> This looked good in the store but taking it out of the box, I discovered it was really cheap plastic. The blades fell apart and one of the aluminum trim pieces came off the side of the power unit ..... needless to say, I returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Wahl suggests using the razor for 3 weeks before making a judgement - because &amp;#34;your face will adjust&amp;#34;. In actuality, they&#x27;re running the clock on the return period offered by most sellers. Well played, Wahl. Now you have my 43 bucks, and I&#x27;m the proud owner of yet another cheap piece of plastic. Here&#x27;s the cherry - after a few months of weak, insufficient shaves, this dollar-store-quality contraption simply died altogether. On the bright side, shaving used to take twice as long, since I always had to clean-up my Wahl shave with a conventional razor. Now I just go straight to the conventional razor, leaving me valuable extra minutes to write scathing reviews.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend saw this on tv, asked for it for Christmas.  Was concerned, because there weren&#x27;t many good reviews on it, however he likes it and thinks it works great!</li>
    <li> shaves very good;however the head comes off to easly</li>
    <li> Very cheap, I never write reviews good or bad but this shaver is a piece of junk! Very Stiff &amp; Loud ! Do not buy !!!!!! Couldn&#x27;t give me this shaver! Hard to believe that Wahl would stand behind this product .</li>
    <li> Other than the plastic design I love this razor! I have gotten a really close shave every morning I use it. The detail trimmer and adjustable 1-6 guide works great on my sideburns (which grow out of control!) I really like it.   My name is Jason and I approve this message!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver/trimmer. It does its job very well and maintenance is simple. It comes with its double zipper bag so makes easy 2 take on vacation or business trips. It&#x27;s battery life is very long lasting that&#x27;s another thing I like.</li>
    <li> The trimmers work half decent but The shave feels like it is pulling  the hair out.it compares to a an as seen on tv my husband bought once for $ 19.99.he wouldnt recomend this razor for anything.</li>
    <li> I have been excited about this shaver ever since I saw an ad for it in a trade magazine over a year ago, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to get one.  I should have read the reviews because, in spite of a fairly decent shave, it is a piece of junk.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t discarded the packaging or it would surely be returned.  I guess it&#x27;s true that \\&quot;Not all that glitters is gold.\\&quot;  Needless to say, I do NOT recommend this shaver with all its gadgets.</li>
    <li> This was a Father&#x27;s Day Gift for my husband and he loves it.  It gives a good shave.  Very happy I decided on this shaver.</li>
    <li> As a young boy I can remember standing at the sink watching my father shave with his shave soap and single blade safety razor as he preached to me the benefits of using a manual razor over electric while, wanting to be just like dad, I mirrored every stroke with my own &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; fashioned out of wood. Twenty-five years later, tired of the occasional knick when hurrying to get to work and annoyed with the mild irritation that comes with shaving off a thin layer of skin with my Gillette Fusion, I hoped and expected the technology of electric razors to have improved significantly since the days of yore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing an impressive commercial promoting the close shave this Wahl shaver/trimmer provided, I decided to take a leap of faith, trusting the Wahl name to not steer me wrong. The trimmer attachment in particular sold me on this investment as I was tired of my cheap trimmers that has a cord always getting in the way, and really, I could not be happier with its performance and variety of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it was time for my first shave with my shiny new toy before date night with my better half. Not being familiar with electric razors, I thought that the slight rattling when I first flipped the switch was normal until at least I pressed the foils to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. By god, this razor sucks. It is loud and thirty minutes after I began I was finally fed up with trying to get any semblance of a close shave. It was rough, it pulled, I tried pressing harder, I tried moving it in small circles clockwise, I tried counter-clockwise, up, down, back, forth and nothing worked. The whining of the blades sounded suspiciously like my father screaming in my ear, &amp;#34;I told you so!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just in case you think I&#x27;m an idiot and don&#x27;t know how to use the razor or that I have unreal expectations like that of an elementary school art teacher wanting a second grader to emulate Van Gogh, I have since bought a Norelco that works infinitely better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you want to look like a 14 year old with crappy patchy facial hair even after extended labored effort, DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR. shame on you Wahl for using your name and reputation to skate by on a terrible product.nfinitely better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you want to look like a 14 year old with crappy patchy facial hair even after extended labored effort, DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR. shame on you Wahl for using your name and reputation to skate by on a terrible product.</li>
    <li> This shaver does everything it claims to do.  I tested it recently and it took 2 minutes to shave 2 days stubble 90% smooth.  I could have stopped there it was that good.  There were a few areas that had a very slight prickle.  So 1 more minute tidy up and I was as smooth as...  A great shaver at a great price.  You need to look around as prices range from £120+ too as little as £57.  I came out as the best shaver on the Gadget Show last week beating shavers 3 times as expensive, which was why I bought mine</li>
    <li> The shaving head will not stay on. The little plastic protrusion or clip that holds the head on is far,far,far too small to hold the shaving head on. It will fall off after slight usage. This is an absolute manufacturing flaw and I am sure they know it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, plastic feel without a lot of power.  I bought this razor based on previous positive experiences with Wahl products, but this razor really comes up short.  I gave it two stars vice one because it does function fairly well on the flat portions of your face.  However, it really struggles around the chin and under the nose.  Also, the unit itself sounds and feels challenged in terms of power.  I&#x27;d strongly recommend NOT being this razor; instead, stick with a Norelco, Brahn, or other name brand.</li>
    <li> this product was not good the charge is iratic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine over two years now and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out why so many reviewers are having so much trouble with theirs.  Cheap plastic?  Ummm....well let&#x27;s see, maybe compared to a Braun or Panasonic that costs three times as much, the plastic and brushed aluminum falls a bit short.  I&#x27;m okay with that----it&#x27;s a shaver, not my car&#x27;s dashboard.  As with every Wahl I&#x27;ve had, the motor is strong.  Pros:  This thing holds a charge for weeks.  It&#x27;s the best rechargeable shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in that regard----and in fact, it outlasts many &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; things I own, shavers and otherwise.  It does a fine job if you shave every day.  Problem is, if you miss a day (for example on a weekend) the rotary system, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t do a good job with some of the longer hairs.  It leaves them.  So you could go to Plan B and use the trimmer----except, and here is where the cons come in----it&#x27;s not a pop-up trimmer.  You have to remove the shave head and then put the trimmer on to cut the longer hairs----then remove that and put the rotary heads back on to finish the shave.  I don&#x27;t like that.  So I keep an old Wahl cutter bar model in the bathroom----with a pop-up trimmer----and I use it for that task instead of constantly changing heads on this one.  I&#x27;m perplexed why some people say it &amp;#34;falls apart&amp;#34; while they shave.  Perhaps they&#x27;re not good at reading instructions or figuring out simple &amp;#34;click in place&amp;#34; engineering.  But seriously folks, if you spend a minute or two understanding how to change heads, they should never &amp;#34;fall apart&amp;#34; during your shave.  And it&#x27;s very easy to empty the stubble out of the head----you pry the hinged door open and let the hair drop out, brush it and snap it back on.  Of course, if you&#x27;re not...ummm....&amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; enough to realize that the piece must SNAP back on--- and if you leave it loose----i guess it can fall off when you turn the motor on.  So I would say that &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34; ismost responsible for the frustration that some folks are experiencing and &amp;#34;unrealistic expectations considering the price point&amp;#34; might explain why others think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; compared to a Panasonic that costs $250.00 instead of $69.95.  When you&#x27;re spending a couple hundred more, I guess you should expect something better in terms of materials.  When you&#x27;re spending a couple hundred less, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect thinner plastics.  I guess when you buy a Ford Focus and wish it was a Mercedes, you could get cranky and start complaining about it.  But make no mistake about it----this gives a decent shave.  I love the old Wahl cutter bar style and for my next new purchase, I&#x27;d consider going back to one of those----especially if they&#x27;re making them with the same lithium ion battery pack as this rotary.  For now though, after a couple years of daily use, I&#x27;m pleased with this model.  It shows no signs of quitting----still holds a charge for weeks, still has sharp enough blades----and nothing has &amp;#34;fallen apart&amp;#34; yet.  I was debating whether to give it a 4 or a 5, but decided on the 5, primarily to help raise the overall rating because frankly, the lowest reviews need to be compensated for with a higher rating.  If you can tie your shoes, I think you&#x27;ll figure out how to use this shaver without all the drama.</li>
