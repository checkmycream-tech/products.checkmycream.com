<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like these clips. I have thick, medium length hair and they&#x27;re perfect for pulling half of my hair back. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, these are very small. They won&#x27;t work for what I wanted them for... but hopefully I will be able to find a use for them since it&#x27;s not worth returning.</li>
    <li> So far three have broken.</li>
    <li> Everything the seller did was correct!  The clips were a little smaller than I would have liked them to be.  I can still use them, just have to work a little harder at it!</li>
    <li> I thought these clips were a little bigger so I have to use two clips to hold my hair, a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> They really work well and are very sturdy in holding hair in place. They are the smaller ones for holding only partial hair, as in the front area of your head.</li>
    <li> These look nice enough but they are very fragile and fell apart after only a few uses.  I don&#x27;t plan to buy Scunci again.</li>
    <li> These clips work well with my hair. They might be a little too small for someone who has thick hair. I have short and thin hair so they work well with me.</li>
    <li> There are cheaper options out there, but most break or crack after a while. I promise if you want something you are not going to have to replace every other month this is what you want. These have been good to me. The picture is a little misleading so use the customer photos or reviewer&#x27;s photos to judge actual size.</li>
    <li> These are very small, I thought they were the medium size (1-1.5&amp;#34;) and the size wasn&#x27;t listed so I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> came as expected cute little clips for your hair you can do your hair many different ways that these cute little clips they were packaged enough so that none of the little eyes on the clips broke which is amazing very thankful for the way that they took their time to package it thank you very much Amazon</li>
    <li> easy to use- just wish it offered prime shipping on it individually!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I wanted...  seller is good though!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed by the size of the clips as I have thick hair and need two in order to hold all my hair. They do work well,however, and do not slip which is the point of these clips.</li>
    <li> The bad review is for \\&quot;4cm 2-Count(misc)\\&quot;, this is a 5 pack, and the clips are hardly 2cm if that.  I love these clips, I&#x27;ve been buying them for years.  They hold my fine curly hair very well. I always have clips fall out, but not these ones!  I&#x27;m gonna order some more, they do break if you step on them.  LOL!</li>
    <li> They work fine.  I wish they were bigger but they&#x27;re good for just holding hair out of my face.</li>
    <li> Guess I didn&#x27;t realize when reading the description that they would arrive so small. But they do the job</li>
    <li> as advertised, quick shipping</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair so these small claws work for me.  I use one to do my hair half up.  The rubbery grip inside help keep my hair in place and keep the claw from falling lower on my hair at the end of a long day.  The rubbery grip actually are raised bumps on the interior of the claw that look like leopard spots and feel like rubber cement.  Cool idea and the first time I&#x27;ve seen it on a hair accessory.  At night I use two more claws to clip up the rest of my hair so I can more easily wash my face etc.  The spring in the claw feel sturdy and the plastic parts thick enough to stand up for a good length of time.  I purchased about a month ago and have used almost daily without issues.</li>
    <li> I like using these clips however they do not have the size anywhere so I guessed. When I received them I was a little disappointed they they were smaller than what I wanted. I will use them but will look for the ones I want in the size I want. I wanted the approx 1 1/2 to 2 inch and these are 1 inch measured at the teeth.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the clips to be double the size they were, because the pictures were very deceiving. They were actually five mini clips that i need to used at least two of to hold my hair back. They work well but they were not was i was originally planning to buy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived and these clips are much smaller than they appear in the photo.  There is no way that the clip on the girl&#x27;s hair in the photo is the clip that is in the package.  I have had this brand before and they come in different sizes and I selected based on the photograph.  To me they have used a much larger clip to put up the girl&#x27;s hair than the clip that is being sold in the package.  Very disappointing.  The advertising picture shows the girl&#x27;s entire amount of hair clipped by a single clip.  It would take four of these clips to make for the size of the single clip in the picture shown holding the girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I love these! They hold my hair the best of any clip. I have super slick hair so they do slip a little, but they are better than any other.</li>
    <li> Perfect clips! I use these when I add waves to my hair. I have fine hair and I usually only need 1 clip to hold all my hair up. Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> These are tiny! I thought they were bigger. Overall they are OK ...the grip makes it hold more hair than I thought.</li>
    <li> OVERPAID. Clips are tiny. I could have got them at Walmart for half the price!</li>
    <li> These clips are smaller than they look and do not have the gummy no-slip inside that I was looking for. I still use them to quickly pull my hair back, but I miss the old Scunci clips!</li>
    <li> The written description says these are 1&amp;#34;, so I suppose it&#x27;s my fault that I didn&#x27;t visualize it correctly. There is a photo on the product of the clip in a woman&#x27;s hair and I took it for granted that the clips would be that big. These clips are no bigger than the end of your thumb.</li>
    <li> I have used jaw clips for several years and love them. They are great for work when you run out of time and need to pull some hair back without doing anything fancy. I always have trouble finding the right size/ quality in CVS and other drug stores and was so happy to see them online. The no-slip grip is rubberized interior that allows for the clip to hold onto the hair better. As for the size, they are about an inch / inch and half. Can grab the perfect amount of hair for me for &#x27;half up half down look&#x27;. I have normal thickness hair but they could easily work with all types do the the rubberized gripping.</li>
    <li> These are very small hair clips. Very small. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I ordered.</li>
    <li> Perfect hair tie for my thick hair.  Easily allows me to get it out of my face when needed.  Strong and well made/finished plastic.  Great size, not too small and not too large.</li>
    <li> they were fine...but can get at the dollar store much cheaper.</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;These clips are quite small, less than an inch long and less than an inch high. They are not super-sturdy, but not cheaply made either--kind of medium-quality, and I think they&#x27;re a good value for the price. This is because of their hidden feature: inside the claw, at the top part between the spring and the claw teeth, there are soft rubber bumps to really grip the hair--so that it DOESN&#x27;T easily slip out. Most of the clip is the expected hard plastic, but these are little sticky-type soft rubber bumps. I have many jaw clips of different types and none of them have this; I don&#x27;t know why, because it&#x27;s such a great idea. My hair is very heavy, thick, and pulls right out from most clips, especially mini-clips of this size. However, they do not slip out, and the clip holds my hair really, really well. I really like them. I bought several packs because they worked so well. Whoever thought of this design feature should be commended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you&#x27;re looking for a smaller-sized inexpensive clip that will definitely hold your hair right where you want it, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this clip. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> Though not my strongest clip, the no slip grip make these a great find. They hold about half of my hair back and two will work on my long hair in an twist at the back of my head. Great colors and not as easy to find in stores as they used to be. About an inch big, if you are trying to figure out which size these are.</li>
    <li> I purchased these based on the picture, but they are about 5 times smaller than whats shown in the photo.</li>
    <li> The picture shows a full-sized hair clip, but these things are doll-sized. Useless, so I&#x27;m returning these today. But it&#x27;s a huge hassle since I don&#x27;t have the hair clips I wanted when I needed them, and now I have to mess with shipping these back.</li>
    <li> Hard to find spider clips that grip these work great</li>
    <li> This works exactly as you would expect it too. Great little clips that are easy to lose and step on so be careful!</li>
    <li> Love these clips. I&#x27;ve had about 10-12 packs over the past few years and they have never disappointed. I&#x27;ve lost or broken them and had to re-buy always going back to the same ones. Don&#x27;t be fooled by knock offs - only scunci makes them exactly like this. Great hold on my head of hair which is fine. I put it in a bun and clip it toward the end - about 3&amp;#34; from the tips.</li>
    <li> scunci makes the best hair clips and rubber bands because of that tacky grip.  grabs my hair perfectly to achieve the style I want.</li>
    <li> I use these to pull up small sections of my long hair&lt;br /&gt;they are sturdy &amp; have a coating that keeps them in place&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered others that were to small &amp; did not hold&lt;br /&gt;best product I have found</li>
    <li> Not sure of quality or condition as the hair-clips as it  is sealed and meant for my daughter in November . I will post more if not happy with product or daughter has issues with product.</li>
    <li> Same ones you get at the pharmacy. They work great.</li>
    <li> Unless you can hold your hair up with one pin or one chopstick, these are for you. Great grip, holds hair really well!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something just a tad bigger but kept these to use when styling my hair. They are a nice solid hair clip I just accidentally ordered too small of a clip.</li>
    <li> These clips are smaller than the picture indicates, but otherwise, they are good quality and definitely have a no-slip grip.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine (and somewhat thin) hair and these work great!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love them!! They do not stick or slid out of my hair. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very small.  I thought it would be larger.</li>
    <li> these are very small, for children.  I had no idea I needed to check on the size.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend purchasing these Scunci No-slip Grip Chunky Jaw Clips.  First of all, the hair clips are made of cheap plastic.  Three out of five clips broke within a week of use.  Each clip was only used about one to three times before breaking.  Second, the hair clips were much smaller than anticipated.  The model on the package is wearing one large hair clip to hold all her hair in a chignon.  This is extremely misleading because these clips are not even half the size and are good for only small sections of hair.</li>
    <li> What happened to Scunci? These used to me my favorite clips! One was broken, another broke soon after receipt. The plastic seems a little cheesy. They are OK and if I could not find anything I like better, yes, I would probably buy them again.</li>
    <li> I have very straight European hair that&#x27;s also very long. These clips unfortunately do slip on this hair texture. I imagine it would be even worse on Asian hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and these are the perfect size for small pieces of stray hair.</li>
    <li> These are miniature hair clips. The description does not indicate that these are minis. Good quality, I just can&#x27;t use it as I have a lot of hair, but seriously even people with thin hair would have a hard time with these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m leaving 3 stars because it&#x27;s a personal opinion vs not actually being a good product. I just think Amazon should have left a better description for the size. I bought it thinking it would clip my hair back in a ponytail; these are more like mini clips to hold part of your hair back to the side like a barrett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping them because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to return-- It would have been smarter of me to whip out a ruler or something to really consider the size, but the title or description would greatly help consumers by stating this is very small- I&#x27;d call it mini-clip or something.</li>
    <li> I love these clips with the no-slip grip on the inside, but I was disappointed when these arrived because I had thought they were the bigger ones.  They are medium sized.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair neat-looking and hygienic! I really love how this jaw clips prevent my hair to scatter and look messy. best clips in town!</li>
    <li> I bought these on an whim, but as a hair stylist, i adore them.&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend them to everyone who does hair, or just wants to style thier hair.&lt;br /&gt;cute, cheap, and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;five stars:)</li>
    <li> I have had half of these break simply putting them in my hair.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the design of these.  They are small and they grip perfectly.  Wonderful not to be losing them and my hairdo getting ruined because they&#x27;re sliding off of my hair.</li>
    <li> My workmates were able to witness the holding power of this clip so they also decided to buy this set! They&#x27;re really impressed on the way it puts your hair into place.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and very thin plastic. Not like the ones you get at the</li>
    <li> just the thing for a person with long hair and only the use of one hand like myself keeping the hair out of my face makes it easyer to shave and eat. with only the use of one hand it really helps</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re plastic but not real cheaply made.  i use them to clip hair away while styling and they serve that purpose well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton of thick hair, but the teeth on these lasted for about 3 wears before I found them in my hair.  Sad.  They are the perfect size to hold a half-up/half-down hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I meant to buy the big clips but accidentally got these instead!  But no worries, they work as expected!</li>
    <li> These came a little smaller than I expected.  It will work to secure a bun or pull up the sides of my hair.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> The clips have rubber on the inside to help keep them from slipping, however I have thin hair and so it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Probably would work well for someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> These clips are tiny, they are not the size shown in the picture holding the hair back.  VERY SMALL CLIPS</li>
    <li> These are MINIATURE clips.  Why doesn&#x27;t the description say that?  This is not what I wanted, I am not happy.</li>
    <li> Loved it!!  Can totally hear the voices of the characters. Hope there will be more!</li>
    <li> Ive had this product for about a week and two of the clips have already broke. I will probably buy the larger size from now on.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. I have thin hair and can use these to pull it back in a pony tail at the nape of my neck.</li>
    <li> These are smaller than I had imagined and was concerned their small size would not work for my thick hair. I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair and it is thick and slightly coarse. I use these primarily to hold the majority of my hair up while I straighten or curl individual pieces and it works well. It&#x27;ll hold most of the hair on one side of my head and seems to get the job done. I did not notice the no-slip grip being any better than the clips that do not have the no-slip grips. A fun feature, but again, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. The spring is strong for the size of the clip. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the clip.</li>
    <li> Very tiny, not the size I was expecting.</li>
    <li> These work very well but the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because they are so small. The picture doesn&#x27;t show the correct size.</li>
    <li> These were a bit smaller than I thought, so gave them to my granddaughter who dearly loves them.</li>
    <li> These are the really tiny ones, not the medium ones as pictured!!! Returned</li>
    <li> Love these use all the time. Fast ship.</li>
    <li> For my fine curly hair.  I will order these again, when I inevitably break or lose these.  I use them almost everyday :)</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought. Have to use 2 to hold hair. They are about 1x1&amp;#34; in size.</li>
    <li> Somehow I thought that these clips were going to be 2-3x the size they actually were, and on reviewing this page there&#x27;s no description of the size&lt;br /&gt;That said, they&#x27;re good clips for their size.</li>
    <li> These are mini clips, not even the average size.  Best case I can use them for cable management.&lt;br /&gt;I have super fine hair and these are tiny even for my amount of hair. If you have thick hair this might be ok for just a strand you want to pin up.</li>
    <li> These were too small for me to use on my long (but fine) hair. It was my fault for not reading the product description well enough. I haven&#x27;t been able to use them much.</li>
    <li> I always buy these, especially because they have the no-slip grip! I used to have the ones that didn&#x27;t have the no-slip and it would always slide down my hair. Not with these! No complaints and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like these for pinning up my curls as I am using a hot iron or something, but I have really fine hair so these should not break when I am using them. I have two left, and each of the others broke the first time I used them. I now realize why so many come in a pack. I would recommend that Scunci use a slightly harder plastic to keep the teeth from snapping off. My hair is so fine I normally lose clips and hair pins, and I did not try to pin too much hair at once, this was for small sections.</li>
    <li> Work well and good size</li>
    <li> love that they really grip my hair, which is thick/heavy and a challenge for all other clips.  small, but great for partial pull back do&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These are really small..</li>
    <li> I got these today and was immediately disappointed. My hair is too long for these tiny clips to hold it all up. I assumed these were the normal size hair clips, especially since there is nothing in the product description saying otherwise. They are way too small, maybe I&#x27;ll be able to use them to put my hair half up but I was really looking forward to using these in place of a ponytail holder.</li>
    <li> The clips seems to be poorly made. The teeth on these clips break off very easily. All of them broke within a few weeks (and not even from constant use). They also do not state how big the clips are in the product description. They are about an inch wide.</li>
    <li> I have some old clips I use to pull my hair back to wash my face or use to hold all my hair up when I shower. I thought I was purchasing the same large-ish clip that had rubber material inside the clip. These are small clips and only hold just the sides of my hair up. They also did not have the rubberized grip that another reviewer says they did. These clips are too small to use for what I wanted them for and they slid out of my thick curly hair. So annoyed I was tricked into buying these.</li>
    <li> Too small. Child size. Would not recommend for adults.</li>
    <li> I love these clips. I&#x27;ve purchased them several times. They&#x27;re super sturdy and last long! The grip works really well and will keep a Snooki bouffant in place all night long.</li>
    <li> I bought these almost a year ago and use them a couple of times a week and never had one break on me. The dog, however, ate one....so they ARE NOT dog proof :)</li>
    <li> These are really nice little hair clips. I already own the slightly larger size- they are easy to use and easy to remove without fighting a mop of hair to do so.</li>
    <li> Good clips. Have the grip I need to keep my hair back. Only good for pushing back bangs on thicker hair. Sometimes the clip tends to slip or lose gripping.</li>
    <li> These are very small (still works fine for me) but i must not have read because I thought they were bigger.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality - cheap, brittle plastic.  I have moderately long, straight hair (so they shouldn&#x27;t be getting too much stress), yet half of the clips have already broken off in less than 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Purchased about 4 months ago and have worn these very lightly and only occasionally on fine hair. Today, the last clip of the pack broke. The plastic cracks right above the &amp;#34;no slip&amp;#34; silicone grip, a piece or two fall off,  and these clips become useless. Waste of money, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> These little buggers are tiny! I thought they would be much bigger when I ordered them</li>
    <li> Several broke the first time opening them</li>
    <li> I probably should have looked at the size more closely, they were a little smaller than I was expecting.I purchased them to clip my hair up with when I&#x27;m curling it and they do okay with that but I have a lot of hair so it can be a bit of a stretch to get it all in these 5 little clips.</li>
    <li> Based on the picture, I really thought these would be a decent size for my curly hair.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t even clip my hair half-up in these.  I&#x27;m sure they work better on finer hair, but I was disappointed because there were of no use to me.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and these help hold it out of my face.</li>
    <li> What I received were not &#x27;chunky&#x27;.  These were small.  I returned them. However, the brand and the no-slip clips are great. I was just looking to buy the large ones.</li>
    <li> These clips are TINY!  Need several to put my hair back and I have very long, but thin hair.  Keeping these, but disappointed by the size.  Could have paid about the same for regular size clips at Target.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for, but I was extremely disappointed when I tried to take them out, and one of them snapped in half as soon as I tried to remove it from the packaging. If not for the cheap, flimsy quality, I would give them 4/5 stars because the size is perfect for my fine, thin hair, and it holds very well, thanks to the clear gel grooves built into the inside of the clips--they really truly don&#x27;t slip. They are about 2cm wide and 2cm tall. Overall, 3 stars.</li>
    <li> love these little guys. They last forever</li>
    <li> I thought these would be the regular size clips but they ended up being the mini ones. I guess it works but not quite what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Okay, these are standard clips. Good design, good grip, good all-around. The reason I am LOVING these is because of this past weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally slept (and napped lols) in these (I know...NOT comfy for my scalp AT ALL) for the past 2-3 days and OMG they are still in tact! After the first night, I just found it kind of amusing...but now I&#x27;m thinking these are AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have just gotten a \\&quot;good batch\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know, but just wanted to give it a good well-deserved 5-star rating before ordering more. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are a very brittle, lightweight plastic with weak springs.  I just compared the ones from amazon to my other scunci clips, and these are definitely inferior.  I suspect that these are knock-offs.  I&#x27;d steer clear of buying these on amazon--really poor quality and I don&#x27;t expect them to last long.  My daughter and I use scunci a lot.  I normally get them at Target, and the quality is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve added two pictures so you can see the difference in the quality of the spring.  You can actually see that it is a thinner spring and is not likely to hold up long!</li>
    <li> These are smaller than I was expecting, so they are not that helpful.  They are good for small amounts of hair, so I guess if you have very thin or short hair, these would be good.</li>
    <li> They all broke within the first couple of times of me wearing it. I was down to my last one, took my hair out and threw the clip in my purse.... all the teeth broke off in the 15 minutes it took me to get home. Completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find these are tiny mini clips. The description should be more clear. &amp;#34;Chunky&amp;#34; implies they are at least the normal average sized clip.</li>
    <li> These are mini clips.  If you have thick hair, or a lot of it, these won&#x27;t be sufficcient.  I was expecting the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; size clips which are perfect for my long, fine hair.  These little guys don&#x27;t cut it though.  They are maybe a inch long (and that&#x27;s being generous).  In all other ways they are functional, but just too small for me.</li>
    <li> Great for doggies with top knots on their heads! I use these on my Tibetan Terrier, not on myself. Would work for other breeds that have lots of long hair on top of their heads that drops over their eyes. Her vet said it was a good idea since it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull out the hair like rubber bands will do. These stay in place well as long as she&#x27;s not rolling around like a goofball, and they are easy to put in and take out. She likes it too, she waits patiently for her up-do in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands and these seem to work the best on her for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t last long, though, at least not on a dog.</li>
    <li> The clips are definitely smaller than what I had expected, and I was hesitant to keep them. But I gave them a try one day, using them to hold back the top part of my hair. Lo and behold, they didn&#x27;t budge (and I have long, heavy, thick hair), which makes these perfect to toss in a purse or leave in the car to use when I need it.</li>
    <li> WAY TO SMALL, THOUGHT  THEY WERE BIGGER</li>
    <li> The only negative about this product is that I loose them all the time. But perhaps that is not the product&#x27;s fault ;) I love the reliable hold these clips provide even when my hair is being tousled around on windy days. The size is great for thin to medium thick hair. I have wavy/curly hair that is quite voluminous and this holds the top half of my hair perfectly.  The only times I&#x27;ve had to replace these is when I loose them!</li>
    <li> I am giving this one star because it was very sloppily packaged in a sports drink box and we almost threw it away. I was not going to open and then I realized it came from the same place as something else I ordered. I thought the vendor was sending a free sports drink. It was creepy getting a package like this from someone selling on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I  don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t tell you the size of it. It&#x27;s basically for little girls. No, thank you.</li>
    <li> These are very tiny, I love the bigger version of these clips but this package is for the TINY clips, the picture shows the bigger version.</li>
    <li> This product listing is misleading because I thought the clips would be about twice as large as they actually are. They work well if you have thin hair or are only using small sections of hair. These will probably end up being for my daughter than myself since they are small.</li>
    <li> Much to my chagrin, these are not at all what I wanted.  I thought these butterfly clips were going to be larger based on the image--nowhere in the product title or description does it say the size of these clips--so I was expecting the ones that can clip up a mess of long, medium-thick hair.  These are only big enough to put barely half of your hair up.  Plus, these clips are really cheap and break easily, especially the small teeth.  Big disappontment for me, but I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for small clips to put your bangs up, then these might work for you.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and these style of clips; but I was looking for the larger ones (that you can pull your whole head of hair up with). The picture was a bit misleading. I still use them, such as to hold back my bangs when I wash my face and to help section my hair when styling, but I can&#x27;t give full stars because it wasn&#x27;t obvious enough that these were the size they are.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair and I&#x27;ve tried many types of clips to hold my hair up for styling purposes or when I&#x27;m trying to curl sections of my hair.  They never really seem to hold the hair quite right.  I was pleasantly surprised with these No-Slip Grip Chunky Jaw Clips - the name of the item says it all.  It really works and holds my hair securely.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and long, I use these clips for the front to keep hair out of my face. The only problem is they are small so it&#x27;s easy to misplace them or step on them. Overall I love it</li>
    <li> Love it! Great quality, and has rubber lining inside so it doesn&#x27;t slip off.</li>
    <li> I really love these clips. I&#x27;ve been using them for 5 years and buying them in store. Lately these have been hard to find so I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries them and at an affordable price too!</li>
    <li> Reasonably strong, 3 black and 2 tortoise shell.</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I use them for my hair but also for curtains that don&#x27;t stay shut, cables that need to be clipped together, etc.  Multi purpose.  I have a lot of hair so I use it to hold up the sides or one in the back.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. I thought I was going to get something to hold ALL of my hair back. These are mini.</li>
    <li> very cheap quality!  All are broke and thrown away already.</li>
    <li> I bought clips similar to these from target before, and at the local 99 cent store. the 99 c store ones broke within a few days, the target ones within a few months. but these ones I got on amazon, lasted me a very long time. but the price is almost the same. so I&#x27;m buying these again.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for a year now.&lt;br /&gt;Super resistant, stylish &amp; comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy them again and again.</li>
    <li> hard to find in stores...love the no-slips! They don&#x27;t tear the hair, but do hold it in place.</li>
    <li> Love the size of these</li>
    <li> These things are tiiiiiny!!! As in smaller than one inch. One of 5 was already broken upon arrival.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I had previously bought them from Rite Aid, and they are the best hair clips</li>
    <li> My fault. I clearly did not read the description as these were the teeny tiny clips, when I wanted to order the larger ones. So the rating is just to serve as an FYI to buyers, but otherwise the quality is as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> These small clips are perfect for pulling half your hair up. I have long, thick hair and they stay perfectly with the grip material inside the clip. I have bought a few different kinds of these clips, but these are the best, no slipping down.</li>
    <li> I must have missed the size somewhere. This does not clip up adult hair, let alone 3 year old hair. It&#x27;s very small. Good quality, but I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Maybe I misread something but I don&#x27;t recall seeing anything in the description about how big these actually were.  I&#x27;ve got curly hair and these small ones do almost nothing for me.  I need the next size up seeing as how these are the teeny ones.</li>
    <li> I have wildly curly, shorter hair, and these clips will hold all my loose strands for hours. I always have at least one in my purse, and also find them helpful for sectioning hair while styling.</li>
    <li> These are the size clip between the very tiny ones and the ones that can usually clip up most of one&#x27;s hair in the back. They are perfect for pulling back the top of my hair (crown) and keeping it out of my face. The rubberized grip is the best part of this brand. I have several items from their &amp;#34;no slip grip&amp;#34; and they all work great. I also have the other two sizes of these. If you get the correct size that you are looking for, you should like these.</li>
    <li> I love the No-slip clips. These are a small/medium size, but they do come in the larger size. Because my hair is long and thick, bands usually slip and work their way out, scrunchies do the same and look tacky, and other clips with out the no-slip feature tend to work free as well... especially if I&#x27;ve straightened my hair. This size is perfect to hold the top half of my hair in various styles, and I like the larger size for holding all of my hair in a twist. Either way, highly recommend spending a little more on ones with a no slip feature than settling for cheep clips with nothing extra to secure hair.</li>
    <li> They are called the chunky jaw clips but they are actually the mini jaw clips. They&#x27;re good clips, but tiny tiny tiny</li>
</ol>
