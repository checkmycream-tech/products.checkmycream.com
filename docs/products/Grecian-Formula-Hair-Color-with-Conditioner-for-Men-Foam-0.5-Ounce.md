      <li>I believe it; can&#x27;t be good, so go lightly.</li>
      <li>Very accurate description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Even my latest hair cut didn&#x27;t fix it.</li>

      <li>this white foam works great !</li>
      <li>I was able to find Grecian Plus Gradual haircolor foam.</li>
      <li>I hope it is safe to use -</li>
      <li>Much better than the liquid.</li>
      <li>It cost more than liquid, but works better &amp; quicker.</li>
      <li>I threw it in the trash and then ordered more of the liquid Grecian which I do like.</li>
      <li>This product works so much better than hair dye.</li>
      <li>Great product.... puts such an easy color to my hair as well as leaving it more manageable......</li>
      <li>easy to use and spread on my hair</li>
      <li>Always easy to use.....</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>and it seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>While the coloring aspect of the product is okay, is it worth the possibility of getting cancer?</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is that I would like the company to make it unscented or a much more appealing fragrance.</li>
      <li>This product is great for gently reducing the grey hair, just use it like mouse.</li>
      <li>For me it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>Kind of  sticky actually.</li>
      <li>I like Grecian formula it does just right for me.</li>
      <li>Amazon is a great site to shop, when you not sure where to find them; You got Amazon to help you to locate.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t use it on your eybrows, so you have to use dye on them anyway, or look kind of strange.</li>
      <li>and it is still the same great product with the same results.</li>
      <li>His beautiful salt and pepper mid-50s full head of hair turned into a solid mass of dark brown.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, that can be hard to find.  </li>
      <li>Make sure that you don&#x27;t put any of this on your facial hair!!!  </li>
      <li>The foam is a lot less mess than the liquid and has a more pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all I need to put in my hair it does keep the gray from showing as much</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>but if you live in a hot climate like Nevada/Arizona in the summer hair turns orange...</li>
      <li>/&gt;They say that hair dye is a cause of cancer; particularly bladder cancer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already try using it everyday for more than 2 weeks now.  </li>
      <li>My hair is pretty thick/corse silvery white.</li>
      <li>My hair is no longer WHITE and it simply looks light brown naturally.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i prefer gradual change on stinking for 1 week ,this product smells a little but not so strong .&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural.</li>
      <li>wow...</li>
      <li>It blends with your natural hair color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With Grecian, the salt and pepper remains, but the salt is more silver/grey and the pepper gets subtly darker.</li>
      <li>I used to dye my hair to get my original color back but cannot anymore due to the fact that I have allergic reactions to hair dye and can never use them again.</li>
      <li>Not only is my hair slowly returning to its natural color, it also feeler thicker and has so much more body then before.</li>
      <li>After viewing several websites, my primary concern is if I happen to have a small open wound on my scalp (i.e., by a comb) and this stuff gets into it.  </li>

<li> when you go to bed and shower in the morning will keep the gray down, and the roots looking normal.  </li>
<li> but it was more money, I have been using the foam everyday, once a day for two weeks, my hair is much darker then when I started, the chemical odor doesn&#x27;t seem too bad to me, and seems to go away very quickly, I highly recommend it, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it to see how dark my hair gets..</li>
<li> b careful to wash your hair only once or twice a week, otherwise it tends to wash out---even though it is not a dye per say.</li>
<li> I have been grey for about 15 years now, and never colored my hair before, so decided to purchase Grecian Formula from Amazon, I also found it in CVS</li>
<li> /&gt;Delivery was 2 days earlier than expected.</li>
<li> And that white stripe down the middle?</li>
<li> I wash my hair every other to every third day</li>
<li> It adds a little color to his white hair making him gray, and looking younger!</li>
<li> The no lead formula is only sold in countries other than the US</li>
<li> , i use this product in the evening after shower ( on dry hair ) and shower again in the morning&lt;</li>
<li> Not to mention that &amp;#34;white stripe&amp;#34; down the middle of my head when the roots needed a touch-up.</li>
<li> Apply to DRY hair!</li>
<li> Yes, it smells for a few weeks so you can get your color back.</li>
<li> I use it for my eye brows and side burns, which are both areas that are harder to get with the Grecian liquid.</li>
<li> Perhaps it can only make my hair slightly grayish while I&#x27;d like it to make my hair black?</li>
<li> this has gradually turned my hair from 70% grey to 10% in a few weeks.</li>
<li> Works ok, does smell bad and not washing your hair for the first two weeks while using this is a little on the unrealistic side.</li>
<li> The bottom line is that it is not worth the risk.  </li>
<li> As I wrote to you, I purchased the item when I though I will pay less then</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 9 months with little to no success.</li>
<li> Customer support is ridiculously slow and not very clear on answers.</li>
<li> but it seemed to take a little longer than stated.</li>
<li> Smells a little sulphur-y though.  </li>
<li> so it is taking a little longer than it should</li>
<li> For the past two years I couldn&#x27;t find it hear in West Virginia.</li>
<li> I recommend the cream because this productio is hard to handle, became liquid easly and is hard to keep it out from scalp...</li>
<li> I tried using the shampoo coloring treatments (Just for Men) and they are just to hard on my scalp.</li>
<li> I bought four cans in case it gets hard to find.</li>
<li> Hated my white hair and just got tired of &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (A pain, troublesome and messy) and &amp;#34;Supercuts&amp;#34; (didn&#x27;t last)</li>
<li> is probably to thick.</li>
<li> The prise was too expensive becouse of the transportation</li>
<li> I have very thin hair</li>
<li> I like the liquid Grecian even though it smells alittle bad.</li>
<li> Very disappointed....</li>
<li> It looked awful.</li>

    <li> The prise was too expensive becouse of the transportation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cpst of the transportation was too hith</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product. Gray coverage well and discreetly.</li>
    <li> I has and is doing a great job of keeping the gray away!  The foam is the best Grecian product&#x3D;.</li>
    <li> Make sure that you don&#x27;t put any of this on your facial hair!!!  I was using this on my gray beard area and took me a while to realize that my skin kept breaking out (like teenage acne).</li>
    <li> Really works. Follow instructions. Apply to DRY hair!</li>
    <li> Works ok, does smell bad and not washing your hair for the first two weeks while using this is a little on the unrealistic side. I was able to go three days max, then couldn&#x27;t take the feeling.  Can&#x27;t use it on your eybrows, so you have to use dye on them anyway, or look kind of strange.

    <li> I have been using the foam for years for the eye brows and side burns. For the past two years I couldn&#x27;t find it hear in West Virginia. I saw it on Amazon, bought it and it is still the same great product with the same results.</li>

    <li> Easy to use. Very effective</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for some time.  However, a friend brought to my attention that this product contains lead, which can cause cancer.  After viewing several websites, my primary concern is if I happen to have a small open wound on my scalp (i.e., by a comb) and this stuff gets into it.  The bottom line is that it is not worth the risk.  While the coloring aspect of the product is okay, is it worth the possibility of getting cancer?</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this.  It adds a little color to his white hair making him gray, and looking younger!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for about a year now and it does work. A coworker of mine noticed my hair seemed darker and asked if I had done anything to it? No of course not. My hair is pretty thick/corse silvery white. I am probably using 4 - 5 golf ball sized foam applications. Two to three just does&#x27;nt cut it. May be my hair is probably to thick. For me it&#x27;s worth the money. I tried using the shampoo coloring treatments (Just for Men) and they are just to hard on my scalp. Causes a severe scalp reactions.</li>
    <li> Smells like the liquid version</li>
    <li> This stuff works but it does stink.  I wonder why WalMart does not sell it.  I hope it is safe to use - I bought four cans in case it gets hard to find.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in the time stated and works well but it seemed to take a little longer than stated.</li>
    <li> Great Price $3 vs $9 wow...thanks</li>
    <li> this has gradually turned my hair from 70% grey to 10% in a few weeks. The foam is a lot less mess than the liquid and has a more pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Very accurate description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it in a form of foam cause it easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Like it a lot !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 9 months with little to no success. Does not work on stubborn gray hair.... And Yes... I have used it religiously as instructed by the application sheet. Customer support is ridiculously slow and not very clear on answers. I personally would not recommend this to anyone. Stinky smell and leaves an unnatural feeling to your hair. Kind of  sticky actually. Would rather just color my hair and be done with... If I could I would give no stars... Very disappointed....</li>
    <li> Hated my white hair and just got tired of &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (A pain, troublesome and messy) and &amp;#34;Supercuts&amp;#34; (didn&#x27;t last) dye jobs. Besides, they turned yellow over a short period of time. Not to mention that &amp;#34;white stripe&amp;#34; down the middle of my head when the roots needed a touch-up. So I turned to the ball-cap forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later I discovered this product. I LOVE IT! Yes, it smells for a few weeks so you can get your color back. But I just love the stuff. My hair is no longer WHITE and it simply looks light brown naturally. And that white stripe down the middle? Even my latest hair cut didn&#x27;t fix it. But what does is (1) &amp;#34;Hollywood Instant Hair&amp;#34; and (2) &amp;#34;Fullmore Colored Hair Thickener&amp;#34;. (Google them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Product works well, but b careful to wash your hair only once or twice a week, otherwise it tends to wash out---even though it is not a dye per say. I only ordered it as an addition to save shipping charges. It is not cheaper than going through your local Walgreens however. It cost more than liquid, but works better &amp; quicker.</li>
    <li> NEVER DID WORK FOR ME, EVEN AFTER 3 CANS!&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason, this product, though it has been around for probably 50 years, never worked in the slightest for me.</li>
    <li> This product contains Lead acetate, which is a carcinogen and a reproductive toxin. Grecian formula is banned in Canada and Europe because of that.</li>
    <li> But not overnight.  Three of four times a week when you go to bed and shower in the morning will keep the gray down, and the roots looking normal.  I don&#x27;t know how you could do the recommended span of several days…gotta shower every day…but it works as noted.  Subtle…not even my hairdresser believes I use anything.  Smells a little sulphur-y though.  Not awful, and you get used to it, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Cheaper to buy it here than in retail drugstore.  Works as stated, gradual, but color does come off--I see the discoloration of my towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say that hair dye is a cause of cancer; particularly bladder cancer.  I believe it; can&#x27;t be good, so go lightly.</li>
    <li> easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> I used to dye my hair to get my original color back but cannot anymore due to the fact that I have allergic reactions to hair dye and can never use them again. I have used grecian foam for two weeks now and definitely see quite a difference. Not only is my hair slowly returning to its natural color, it also feeler thicker and has so much more body then before. I have very thin hair and it makes my hair look great. I wash my hair every other to every third day so it is taking a little longer than it should but that&#x27;s fine. The only problem I have is that I would like the company to make it unscented or a much more appealing fragrance. The smell is not so great but I just put on a lot of perfume to mask it and it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> great result after 1 week , i use this product in the evening after shower ( on dry hair ) and shower again in the morning&lt;br /&gt;i prefer gradual change on stinking for 1 week ,this product smells a little but not so strong .&lt;br /&gt;bottom line this white foam works great !</li>
    <li> easy to use and spread on my hair</li>
    <li> This is a great product, that can be hard to find.  I use it for my eye brows and side burns, which are both areas that are harder to get with the Grecian liquid.</li>
    <li> This product works so much better than hair dye. My husband tried that, once. His beautiful salt and pepper mid-50s full head of hair turned into a solid mass of dark brown. It looked awful. With Grecian, the salt and pepper remains, but the salt is more silver/grey and the pepper gets subtly darker. He looks great. It&#x27;s so natural.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It enables me not to have gray hair at 71 years of age.  There is nothing&lt;br /&gt;obvious about it and I apply it only once a week.</li>
    <li> I recommend the cream because this productio is hard to handle, became liquid easly and is hard to keep it out from scalp... I didnt check colour changes with this product.</li>
    <li> I like Grecian formula it does just right for me. It&#x27;s all I need to put in my hair it does keep the gray from showing as much and I like it I use it I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
    <li> As I wrote to you, I purchased the item when I though I will pay less then $9,&lt;br /&gt;but when I received the message that they shuped it, it was $67.&lt;br /&gt;First they send a double item, and they took $52 for the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;It is a theft.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the same item from eBay and it cost (total including the shipment $18).&lt;br /&gt;I asked the postoffice to return the item, and I hope they will return my money (as they promised).</li>
    <li> I have been grey for about 15 years now, and never colored my hair before, so decided to purchase Grecian Formula from Amazon, I also found it in CVS but it was more money, I have been using the foam everyday, once a day for two weeks, my hair is much darker then when I started, the chemical odor doesn&#x27;t seem too bad to me, and seems to go away very quickly, I highly recommend it, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it to see how dark my hair gets..</li>
    <li> Much better than the liquid. Applies even and where you want it!</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  I&#x27;ve already try using it everyday for more than 2 weeks now.  Perhaps it can only make my hair slightly grayish while I&#x27;d like it to make my hair black?</li>
    <li> Product smells and doesn&#x27;t seem to work after months of use</li>
    <li> Great product.... puts such an easy color to my hair as well as leaving it more manageable......Always easy to use.....</li>
    <li> This product is great for gently reducing the grey hair, just use it like mouse. It blends with your natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was 2 days earlier than expected. Great product, great on time delivery at a great price.</li>
    <li> Product works..but if you live in a hot climate like Nevada/Arizona in the summer hair turns orange...look like a pumpkin head..</li>
