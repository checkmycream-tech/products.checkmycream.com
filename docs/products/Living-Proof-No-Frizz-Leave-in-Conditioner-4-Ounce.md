      <li>I love great smelling hair and this is just plain.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair appear full and well</li>
      <li>I love the whole Living Proof line....</li>
      <li>Maybe more effective in a less humid environment.</li>
      <li>But I got a free sample of this and noticed that my hair looked much better after I blew it dry and that the volume and shine lasted longer, so I decided to invest in a full bottle.  </li>
      <li>I did not notice any improvement from the cheap products I normally use.</li>
      <li>my hair is now in control less frizzy and is not dry at all ,i use this along with the Living Proof Prime Extender and my Hair has never looked this healthy very pleased with this product and would buy again.</li>
      <li>some really great stuff and a quality product for color treated hair and hair that is hard to manage</li>
      <li>Fast shipping Thank You!</li>
      <li>First off, I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
      <li>(being a beauty cheapskate),  this really is much better than the L&#x27;Oreal and Garnier products I&#x27;ve been picking up at my local drugstore, so I will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I use it on the top of my head where my hair gets especially frizzy and dry--I wet my hands and rub on the top layer of hair.</li>
      <li>This one feels especially gooey and similar items, better items are available in drug store for 1/4th the price.</li>
      <li>It smells like straight up cologne.</li>
      <li>It really manages frizz.</li>
      <li>Much to my chagrin</li>
      <li>THIS DETANGLES AND MOISTURIZES REALLY WELL.</li>
      <li>like I normally do; my hair was still straight and sleek, no kinks/frizz.</li>
      <li>It only take a dab of product and my hair stays fresh and clean for several days.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to improve the softness and weightless feel.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and straight.</li>
      <li>My hair was becoming increasingly shiny, less frizzy, soft to the touch, with steadily increasing bounce to my curls.</li>
      <li>Seems to make my hair soft.</li>
      <li>but I noticed how soft and manageable it stay with this.</li>
      <li>Finally i figured out fast</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and tames the flyaways (my hair is medium frizzy).</li>
      <li>when i first used this i believe i added to much and it weighed down my hair</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure about this product when i first started using it, I have Thin hair that is very Fizzy in the Summer months or in the Winter with dry heat,</li>
      <li>-- I am not too big on strong scents with hair products and this one is slightly too perfumy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Those of us with complex, extremely curly coiled hair search high and low for good products.</li>
      <li>so no other complaints.</li>
      <li>Works very well with the very dry ends of my hair.</li>
      <li>Then I wet my hands again and add a small amount of conditioner and rub my hands together to make the conditioner thinner so that it spreads better.</li>
      <li>but I find I can&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair-- as it weighs my hair down too much.  </li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>I have fine thin wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returning all the products, they&#x27;re not worth the high price tag.&lt;br</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive hair products, under the theory that the drug store brands are just as good.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, after letting my hair dry with the conditioner in, it looked no different than it did with any other kind of leave-in conditioner -- I noticed no frizz control at all.</li>
<li> i needed just about a dime size for the length of my hair and this time it wasnt oily or flat</li>
<li> I have a tourmaline flat iron that has always done well on my hair.</li>
<li> I had to flat iron/straighten my hair.</li>

<li> You need only a small amount--about the size of a pea--it costs nearly $20, but lasts a very long time.</li>

<li> But, in the middle of the process I noticed some thick liquid on the side on my iron.</li>
<li> My hair is thin, sparse and naturally kinky/frizzy regardless of humidity, so I was hoping that this leave-in conditioner would get rid of my ratty-looking nimbus.</li>
<li> On the downside, while my hair doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;dirty,\\&quot; it did feel a little weighed down by the product -- it&#x27;s very flat, with very little body.</li>

<li> so it&#x27;s much less damaging.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, or at least for me.</li>

    <li> **I have fine, wavy/curly hair at a medium length.  I am the type of person who does not like to wash my hair every day-- every other day or every two days, and I don&#x27;t like to condition more then once a week-- I prefer a leave in conditioner every time I do wash my hair. I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer-- only let it dry naturally.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my hair type his product works great but I find I can&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair-- as it weighs my hair down too much.  I can use it once a week and it does keep my hair looking shiny and healthy.  The smell is o.k. -- I am not too big on strong scents with hair products and this one is slightly too perfumy.  I am not planning on buying it once I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This leave-in is great.  It keeps my hair feeling great.  I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner and find them great as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very smoothing, not gunky, does not cause a ton of build up. Light and fresh leave in conditioner, perfect for those off days in between washing my hair when my curls need a boost.  Also, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found for this product anywhere</li>
    <li> Works very well with the very dry ends of my hair. You need only a small amount--about the size of a pea--it costs nearly $20, but lasts a very long time. It says to use on wet hair, which works well. Sometimes I use it on the top of my head where my hair gets especially frizzy and dry--I wet my hands and rub on the top layer of hair. Then I wet my hands again and add a small amount of conditioner and rub my hands together to make the conditioner thinner so that it spreads better. I rub this on the damp hair, at it brings it back to life. Sometimes when hairspray gunks up my bangs, I wash just my bangs, then use a tiny amount of conditioner. It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> It works and it smells great. I have done product testing for Living Proof as well and they really do hire good scientists in Cambridge, MA. This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and its amazing. It really manages frizz. .. I love the whole Living Proof line....</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, sparse and naturally kinky/frizzy regardless of humidity, so I was hoping that this leave-in conditioner would get rid of my ratty-looking nimbus. Unfortunately, after letting my hair dry with the conditioner in, it looked no different than it did with any other kind of leave-in conditioner -- I noticed no frizz control at all. However, once I flat-ironed my hair, I did notice that my hair was shinier and softer. It also seemed to straighten with only a couple of passes of the plates. The next day when I woke up, I didn&#x27;t have to touch up my hair like I normally do; my hair was still straight and sleek, no kinks/frizz. On the downside, while my hair doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;dirty,\\&quot; it did feel a little weighed down by the product -- it&#x27;s very flat, with very little body. Not good, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair. I can see this working really well for people with thick, curly hair, as long as kink/frizz isn&#x27;t a big problem. Probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Nothing out of the ordinary, just the same as others,</li>
    <li> I did not care for it for my hair.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. My hair lies somewhere between a 3C and 4A and I&#x27;m Caucasian. My hair shrinks in length at least 6-8 inches as it dries. It is frizzy, coily and dry. When I discovered these products, I was using the method of washing my hair with conditioner leaving some behind on the ends, using a sulfate free shampoo once a week, drying with t-shirt, a conditioning mousse to finish and NO silicone products. My hair was becoming increasingly shiny, less frizzy, soft to the touch, with steadily increasing bounce to my curls. When I began using living proof products, the condition and look of my hair took a rapid nose dive. My hair was frizzier especially at the ends, dry, and my curls were MUCH less defined. I&#x27;m returning all the products, they&#x27;re not worth the high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Those of us with complex, extremely curly coiled hair search high and low for good products. Caring for this type of hair requires research, effort and can be quite time consuming. I had hoped this product would live up to its claims, sadly it did not for me!</li>
    <li> This is a very expensive for a very small amount of product.  It did not help my frizzy hair at all.</li>
    <li> Works well. Seems to make my hair soft. Not a great smell, though. I love great smelling hair and this is just plain. Nothing fruity or perfumed, but it does it&#x27;s job so no other complaints.</li>
    <li> Save your money. I bought 3 products in this line, after seeing on TV. This one feels especially gooey and similar items, better items are available in drug store for 1/4th the price.</li>
    <li> I personally do not enjoy this no frizz product. I have thick, dark, curly hair. First off, I don&#x27;t like the smell. It smells like straight up cologne. It also does not spread well in hair. When I get out the shower I will scrunch this leave in conditioner in and it would gunk up on 1 piece of hair. It also made my hair FRIZZIER in the front. Also, DON&#x27;T use this when your hair is dry and you need to use heat tools. It put it on my hair when it was dry and had some frizz. It coated it evenly and only used a dime- sized amount. I had to flat iron/straighten my hair. I have a tourmaline flat iron that has always done well on my hair. But, in the middle of the process I noticed some thick liquid on the side on my iron. It was not melting some rubber material I know because nothing was around it, not even the cord. I turned out that it was the living proof conditioner! I had to scrape it off because I needed to continue straightening my hair. Overall, I did not like this product on my hair. It might work for detangling straight/wavy hair but it not for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> best solution for frizzy hair and smells great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive hair products, under the theory that the drug store brands are just as good.  But I got a free sample of this and noticed that my hair looked much better after I blew it dry and that the volume and shine lasted longer, so I decided to invest in a full bottle.  Much to my chagrin (being a beauty cheapskate),  this really is much better than the L&#x27;Oreal and Garnier products I&#x27;ve been picking up at my local drugstore, so I will continue to use it.  I may even invest in one of the Living Proof styling products .</li>
    <li> My hair got as many freezes as without it!</li>
    <li> Smooths out frizz perfectly</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I had high hopes for this product. Before buying this fairly pricey leave-in conditioner, I  went to the Living Proof website and read all about the science upon which the development of this product line is based and was looking forward to using it. I can&#x27;t speak to the no-frizz promise because of the climate here, but as a leave-in conditioner, it left my hair dull and looking lifeless. It proved very disappointing; and I&#x27;m very unlikely to try any other products from the Living Proof line.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I love it!</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure about this product when i first started using it, I have Thin hair that is very Fizzy in the Summer months or in the Winter with dry heat, when i first used this i believe i added to much and it weighed down my hair and i was left with that oily look.Finally i figured out fast i needed just about a dime size for the length of my hair and this time it wasnt oily or flat my hair is now in control less frizzy and is not dry at all ,i use this along with the Living Proof Prime Extender and my Hair has never looked this healthy very pleased with this product and would buy again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner actually works! It tames my frizzies on humid days and adds a nice shine. Smells nice, too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Living Proof has lived up to its name. I really love these products, yes a bit pricey but worth every penny and you do not need a lot. A little goes a long way, or at least for me. My hair use feel very dry but I noticed how soft and manageable it stay with this. I have been buying these products for the last two years. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to improve the softness and weightless feel.</li>
    <li> I have tried several conditioners. This one is ok. Easy to apply, leave in, and then comb my hair. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and gives it good control. Makes my hair appear full and well controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not five stars because of price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the L&#x27;Oreal product is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AREI6DC L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Hydracharge Leave-In Cream, 6.0 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Fast shipping Thank You! This product is small 4 oz. but does not take a lot to make your hair feel instantly better! Has a nice light clean smell.I am glad I purchased it,😊</li>
    <li> I really love this. It makes my hair soft and tames the flyaways (my hair is medium frizzy). It does cost a chunk, but I go through it slowly.</li>
    <li> I HAVE THIN FRIZZY HAIR. THIS DETANGLES AND MOISTURIZES REALLY WELL. IT DOESNT FLATTER MY HAIR AND I DONT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BUILD UP</li>
    <li> some really great stuff and a quality product for color treated hair and hair that is hard to manage</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and straight. Don&#x27;t have to flatiron my hair all the time so it&#x27;s much less damaging. I&#x27;m buying the big bottle next time!</li>
    <li> Maybe more effective in a less humid environment. In Texas, in the summer, forget about it!  I did not notice any improvement from the cheap products I normally use.</li>
    <li> Works great, but too pricey.</li>
    <li> I have tried 3 different products until I watched a video for deep wave hair that helps with frizz. So I went on Amazon and ordered it, it came before it was suppose to. When I tell you I saw the difference after the first use I was so glad. I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin wavy hair. Living Proof provides, by far, the best line of hair care products for my type of hair that I have ever found. The No Frizz shampoo, conditioner and leave in condition works best for me. It is expensive, but it is worth it. It only take a dab of product and my hair stays fresh and clean for several days. This is the only shampoo I have used for 6 months and I have only used 1/2 of the 8 oz bottle. My hair is shiny and the curls are well defined. I am getting so many compliments on my hair now. Everyone has products for thick, frizzy hair.Thank you Living Proof for creating a product that works on fine to medium hair.</li>
