<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I do not like purple at all, but this is so fresh. Had my manicurist put it on as soon as it arrived. It is actually a little deeper than pictured. Gets a bit lighter outdoors. Can be worn any season.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely beautiful shade of purple. It has a slight glimmer to it. I get compliments on it everytime i wear it.</li>
    <li> This color is a pretty purple.  It takes on different color shades in different lights.  It&#x27;s a shimmer.  I prefer mattes but if you like purple polishes from OPI I think you will like this one.</li>
    <li> Beautiful purple... not too grapey, just a hint of shimmer.  Beautiful when it catches the sunlight.  An excellent find!</li>
    <li> Darker than it looks here.</li>
    <li> .... outdoors. This is a gorgeous purple. Caveat? It makes me wish I worked out of doors. It&#x27;s so shiny and glossy outside. Glints in the sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is a little boring indoors. That said, it goes on smoothly and has great staying power.</li>
    <li> This is a fave colour of mine. This would be my second bottle I love it so. The shipping was very fast, but I wonder if this was a used bottle? Possibly a return? The formula applied weird and thickly and the brush was ratty. I am leaving off the other stars due to this. Not necessarily displeased with the service, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t been sold this particular bottle. I plan to try and find this colour elsewhere. I&#x27;d rather do that than struggle with this one.</li>
    <li> Another shade of purple heaven, love he colr.  Love the shade and most importantly.... I love how it looks on my hand.....</li>
    <li> I love OPI, never can wrong. I love this color. The shipment was fast too. Just need about a few coats and it looks awesome. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of my new all-time favorite colors.  It is so pretty.  It is a plum color, but when the light hits it there is a reddish-orange iridescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a base coat and OPI top coat this polish lasted almost an entire week.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI, right?! Purple is my favorite color, and so of course I wanted to order this when I was the rick purple plum color this has with specks of gold. The picture doesn&#x27;t do the color justice. I love this purple and I have only worn it a couple of times so far, but I prefer to rock some of the dark and richer colors this fall and into the winter!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend asked me to buy this and I did and she Loves it .. She loves the color options and shades that they come in .. i like the crazy twist on the names</li>
    <li> love the color and love opi as well. the colour is a bit shiny but very classy, it looks so nice of the fingers and it does last... very happy with the ourchase.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this color today and I am SO happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it a is a fun medium purple color with a light gold-toned sparkle to it. I think it is the best of all of the colors to come out of the Holland Collection. if you like purples then I would definitely invest in this one, because it is GREAT</li>
    <li> I am an LSU fan. Our colors are purple and gold.&lt;br /&gt;This gives me the proper shade of purple to be a low key fan.&lt;br /&gt;Go Tigers and get your purple Opi.</li>
    <li> OPI nail polishes are, in my opinion, the best nail polishes!  This color looks great in the sunlight, just like the website color. In dark places the color isn&#x27;t as bright as in the sunlight, but&#x27;s still a pretty shade of polish. I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the color.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear with a Halloween costume....but it looks so fabulous I wear it all the time. This s not an overly bold purple.</li>
    <li> Great soft medium purple with a touch of coppery shimmer! Great on toes for any age at any time of the year, but I usually go neutral on my fingers. This could easily become my favorite *colored* polish!</li>
    <li> thankyou for the order</li>
    <li> I love how well it paints on and STAYS on.  It&#x27;s the most beautiful deep purple with just a hint of sparkle in it.  This nail polish is my new favorite, hands down.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI colors, this is the best nail polish.</li>
    <li> So, I dig OPI polish.  This is a pretty color.  It&#x27;s gonna look great this summer!  OPI lasts a long time without chipping.  And no one has colors like they do!  Amazon as the best prices!</li>
    <li> Very pretty color! A touch darker than I anticipated but I still love it! OPI is great polish and it arrived in the mail quickly.</li>
    <li> I am a LSU fan and I wear it everytime that there is a game on it is very pretty and get many compliments.</li>
    <li> I consistently return to OPI because of ease of application and durability.  Was able to discover this color online.  Shade is true to the picture.  Arrived quickly and at a price lower than I could find in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Just a great shade of purple.  It seems to complement many of my clothes and crossed over into spring from winter.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to add a purple to my collection.  This was way beyond my expectation.  Beautiful purple with the prettiest orange/copper fleck inside.  Absolutely gorgeous.  You will need a top coat.</li>
    <li> Product not as described....cheap quality and the color is different then in the picture. It&#x27;s looks too plane and nothing special</li>
    <li> Love love love this color! I get so many compliments. Like someone said earlier, it does have a gold shimmer so it really sparkles in the sun. So happy I found this color!</li>
    <li> I gave this polish 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen what it looks like on. It looks good in the bottle though.</li>
    <li> Love the OPI nail brand.  Wonderful colors, long lasting. Purple is my favorite color and I just love this shade.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color love OPI</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE LAVENDER WONDERFULL COLOR FOR FALL AS WELL AND ANYTIME OF YEAR IF YOU WANT TO MATCH IT WITH WHAT YOUR WEARING LOVE IT SO MUCH THANKYOU</li>
    <li> This color is really pretty and has great coverage. I went through one bottle and wanted more, but I never, ever pay full price so.....I use coupons at a local cosmetic store where the only thing I buy is OPI. They, however, seem to be carrying fewer and fewer of the colors so I started shopping online, specifically through Amazon and Nails and Beyond. Great service, great packaging, and arrival times way under the predicted time. I am having way too much fun and I don&#x27;t have to drive out of the way to find the store does not have anything I want.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. It is a very nice shade of purple, suitable for any season. I even wear it to work in a corporate environment. I love this polish. It also wasn&#x27;t as thick as other OPI polishes, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Nice color, i also like it with the matte top coat</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color! The purple with a hint of shiny gold is so beautiful, it reminds me of Spring!</li>
    <li> Color is beautiful- rich dark purple, goes on smoothy and has a nice shine.  Shade is perfect for any season but especialy now-going into fall</li>
    <li> First time purchasing OPI Nail Polish, and the shade is perfect! Goes on smoothly, was shipped quickly, and packaged well. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Since I am a purple freak, I just had to get this color.  Plus I am a hug fan of OPI</li>
    <li> I LOVE OPI!  This color has a slight metallic look to it, and is so much nicer than the picture shown.  This is the perfect true purple polish, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I think I love every OPI color!  This is a perfect purple.. Not to dark and not a pastel.. Very cute!</li>
    <li> I love the color purple, and this nail polish is so pretty! it has a very nice pinkish shimmer in it that I really love.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the color and it goes on very well. It also last quite well too. If you are a purple person this one is for you.</li>
    <li> I wore this for two weeks straight, so pretty!  Good formula, levels off nicely.  The color is seasonless, can go with everything.  Wore for Valentines Day with &amp;#34;Nothin&#x27; Mousie &#x27;Bout It&amp;#34; over the top - was nice without being to cartoony or childish.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
    <li> the colour i recieved was not the colour shown on your web page.It was suppose to be purple the colour  sent to me was a iridescent ugly dark sparkly, i was very disappointed.The colour on the web page is ( PURPLE ).As a result of this misrepresentation i am now not confident to order further nail products. VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a richer purple color with gold undertones and a bit on the warmer side this is it! Just sad I had to try so many other colors before I found this one.</li>
    <li> And I do!!  Always have.  Great color, a bit flaky, and gold can only be seen in daylight, but still very nice color.</li>
