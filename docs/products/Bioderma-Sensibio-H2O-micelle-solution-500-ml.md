<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first purchased this product during a trip to France.  Since then, I have been using it consistently to remove makeup before using my Clarisonic.  I do not use waterproof mascara so, I could not comment on the quick removal of those types of products, but I am totally satisfied with this wonderful solution for my purposes.  I find that I use two cotton pads to remove all my makeup and it requires very little product to accomplish this.  Therefore, a bottle lasts a long time.  I have also purchased the travel size.</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have to write more.  I am straight forward with my comment.  Again, This product is great and very refreshing. I highly recommend it. Oh my gosh!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to break out with lets say 90% of products I try. Basically any regular drug store cleanser and many higher-end cleaners are just way too much for me leaving my skin irritated and dry. Even Philosophy Purity, supposedly the most gentle cleanser out there, broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, though, is GREAT. I use some on a cotton pad and it takes off all my makeup without and problem. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes AT ALL, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or dry. I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Very nice product works very good. Gets all the make up off and does not make my face break out and was shipped on time.</li>
    <li> My favorite make up remover! No alcohol , so it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or skin. Takes off the dirt off your face like no other solution will. Give it a try, you wouldn&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical of this stuff and thought the price was over the top initially, but at the suggestion of several friends, I tried this out on my extremely sensitive, reactive skin. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with how to use it - depending on what I&#x27;ve been wearing in my skin I will do a gentle quick rinse after using this and sometimes I don&#x27;t feel I need to. I have been using this for a couple months now and it is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate and actually removes makeup and gunk. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Can&#x27;t live without it! It is gentle in the skin and cleans well. Easy to use. Good price and comes with instruction and pump. Nice universal size ball and quality rubber. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Before this make up remover, I have been using Shu Umura for a long time which has a good reputation and all my friends use it. Then I realized that my acnes break out more frequently and I change to Bioderma which is amazing. Its waterish and not oily at all. I only need one cotton pad to remove the makeup for my eye and it cleans effectively. The only shortcoming is that the water goes away to fast. For a bottle of make up remover oil, it usually last for half a year! But I think I need to get a new one for one and half a month for this magic H2O.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover EVER!!&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate, dry out skin or leave a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;No harsh scents, just a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser/toner. It doesn&#x27;t totally remove makeup on it&#x27;s own, but if I splash water on my face first and then wipe the Sensibio on using a makeup pad it works great. Don&#x27;t forget to rinse afterwards as well. Keeps my face pimple prone free and feeling great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It removes my make up effortlessly with no residue and it does not burn my eyes</li>
    <li> I am in my 40th with dry/combination skin.  My skin is very very good and people mistaken me for at least 10 years younger.  I bought this after seeing the review from Lisa Eldridge.  It works fine and it&#x27;s very mild.  However, it does not take off eye makeup as well as some of the following I have been/am using;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Lancome Bi-Ficil - excellent.  Takes everything off without irritating my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* La Mer Cleansing Lotion - excellent.  But I prefer to use a wet cotton pad when removing eye makeup.  Then use La Mer to cleanse the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Shu Uemura Cleansing Oil - excellent.  But I prefer to use a wet cotton pad when removing eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found my perfect balance - first use Lancome Bi-Ficil to clean my eye makeup, then use either La Mer or Shu Uemura for the face.  IF you don&#x27;t mind using a pad with lotion or oil then either La Mer or Shu Uemura will work perfectly well on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using it everyday to remove makeup before I use my regular routine cleanser and clarisonic. Extremely gentle and non drying! I just wish it was conveniently available at my local drugstore but I guess I will have to replenish her quite often.</li>
    <li> Love this Product.  It Removes all make up with out drying or stinging the skin!&lt;br /&gt;I Will be re ordering&lt;br /&gt;Prompt Delivery</li>
    <li> I use this product for a very long time, and this is the first time I buy it in USA. It is the same quality as I bought in Paris</li>
    <li> i use this product after my makeup wipes to touch up anything that may have been left behind on nights when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face. On days when I do wash I still use this after washing as a toner before moisturizing. Love the effects I&#x27;ve had so far and the shipping was amazingly fast.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a magical amazing potion due to all of the reviews I&#x27;ve heard. It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s not perfection. It seems to remove everything but not all in one swipe and sometimes Ill wipe my face with a towelettes and still see residue. I love the fact you don&#x27;t have to rinse off and your face feels moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t remove easily all of my mascara even though I rub my eyes for quite a bit! note i use clinique natural look mascara which i believe is not even waterproof.. The good think is that bioderma doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (i have an acne prone skin)</li>
    <li> This is the first 1 star review i wrote on Amazon. But this thing burns my eyes when i remove eye makeup. I have no idea why people recommend this. But I would not recommend my friend to buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is great for eye make up removal.  It&#x27;s pretty gentle and works well.  I will repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> This water is very gentle with your skin. And cleans the make up realy well. It is good to clean your face when you have acne scars that are healing.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used and I have spent thousands of dollars on professional dermatologist, bougie department store, all natural and drug store cleansers. I&#x27;ve tried them all, oils, glycolics, clarisonics, etc. and nothing has made my skin as happy as Bioderma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff takes off every ounce of waterproof makeup and eye makeup effortlessly. I have some super stubborn water proof sunblock that my sponge and body wash can&#x27;t remove in the shower but some Bioderma on a cotton ball takes that stuff right off! It is non-drying, actually moisturizing, which is excellent for my oily acne prone skin- it keeps it moisturized and from getting too oily. It is so easy to use I never have an excuse to not wash my face at night. It is the only cleanser I use- I wipe with clean cotton balls until there&#x27;s nothing coming off onto the cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible gentle even when my skin is irritated or I&#x27;ve OD&#x27;d on the glycolic retinol serum. The ingredients actually prep your skin for your skincare regimen and the fatty acids in here allow your skin to absorb more active ingredients and nutrients that are otherwise only fat soluble (or so I&#x27;ve read). I can&#x27;t remember what life was like before I stopped washing my face with soap and water but I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found Bioderma. I highly recommend this for any skin type but think that those troubled skin like acne, over sensitive, dry or aging with find that this gentle simple solution will help solve a lot of issues.</li>
    <li> This is so gentle, and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry or greasy. I use this to take off my makeup every night, and it is so great for those nights where you are too lazy to go to the sink and wash your face. It does such a thorough job!!</li>
    <li> I have every very sensitive skin and this product is the only one that works the best. Gets rid off all the make up including waterproof mascara. you do not need a separate eye-remover when you use this. highly highly recommend using this/ trying it if you haven&#x27;t before. you will love it.</li>
    <li> Works well! I see what the hype is about... this does make your skin feel clean and refreshed. I put it on before putting on moisturizer and makeup, etc.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite eye makeup remover ever!!  This was a repurchase.  It lasts a long time, so don&#x27;t be afraid of the price.  It is so gentle and takes off even waterproof mascara with ease.  Just use a cotton round, apply the solution, place it on your eye with gentle force for a few seconds, and gently rub the make up off.  Works awesome!!</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin. It is almost a non-smell water type solution. Also good for wiping all make up except the eye areas.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Leaves your skin very clean and very soft. Love it and would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;Great size bottle, priced right ;)</li>
    <li> YouTube beauty bloggers rave about this product. Not readily available in the US, and rather expensive on Amazon, I have to agree it is pretty awesome. Removes eye makeup easily without irritation. Either US cosmetic distributors need to catch up or someone needs to find a way to import this product for a reasonable cost to consumers. For now, I&#x27;m just trying to use it sparingly and keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I have now bought about a half dozen bottles of Bioderma. It removes all of my make up, including waterproof mascara, without rubbing, dryness, irritation, stinging or redness. I generally can remove all of my make up with one moistened cotton, making it more economical than seemingly cheaper brands. I also use this as a cleanser in the morning or when I am feeling a bit lazy. There is no scent. It works like a dream. This is why I keep buying it.</li>
    <li> With all the hype I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work but it does and quickly. The French know how to get it right with skin products remove all trace of make-up and leave skin fresh and very clean.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. This stuff is great! It removes all trace of makeup without irritating my skin or breaking me out. I use it a little bit differently, however. I pour a small amount into my hands, rub them together and then rub the solution over my face and eyes. Then, I DO rinse with water and use a  face cleanser. Since I&#x27;m acne prone, I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving this on my skin and not rinsing it off. The reason I love this so much is that most gentle cleansers for sensitive skin don&#x27;t remove makeup (ahem...cetaphil...) so I can use this first, then use my gentle cleanser after it.</li>
    <li> This is one my favorite beauty products ever. I have been using it for more than six years and it is one of few products I&#x27;m truly loyal to. It cleans better than soap or any other cleaning/ make up removal product. It is also very soft with your skin and I&#x27;m usually very sensitive. My favorite part is that you don&#x27;t have to wash your face afterwards. You put it in a pad, clean your face and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;If there were more stars I would give it more. You won&#x27;t regret buying this product</li>
    <li> I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes on occasion and find this remover to take off all traces of makeup ad yet it&#x27;s gentle enough where it feels like water. It&#x27;s one of those removers that you would not have to rinse off unless you prefer to wash your face afterwards.</li>
    <li> If you loath oil make up remover and have sensitive skin, look no further, this is for YOU. I never want to try other brands because for me, this one is hands down the best.</li>
    <li> I have acne so I&#x27;m very careful when it comes to selecting facial products. Especially with cleansers, cuz the wrong product can easily dry out the skin and gives more break out. This makeup remover is very gentle and all i need to do is pour it on cotton pad and wipe my face with it&lt;br /&gt;I normally wash my face with regular face wash after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my second bottle and I gonna keep using it!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product but it doesn&#x27;t remove all your makeups as early as it claims it does. Doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes and has no smell also this product last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased Bioderma and I now can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. The first time I tested Bioderma out, I purchased the mini travel bottle. After I went through that very quickly, I made the jump to purchase the largest bottle I could. It is worth every penny. My skin feels so clean after I use it and it never leaves that greasy feeling that I often get after using other makeup removers.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It takes out even waterproof mascara (which is usually very difficult with other makeup removers)&lt;br /&gt;SUper recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years and it is the best way to remove your makeup. I&#x27;ve also tried Vichy&#x27;s Micelle solution and Bioderma&#x27;s product is much better. This one takes more makeup in less time, therefore irritates less your skin.</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite makeup remover. Very good deal for such a large quantity. I will definitely recommend this item and probably will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This was good for my sensitive facial skin. Every time I change facial cleansers, I would have skin troubles. But not anymore! This is really good for me, but not for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best make-up removers  I have used.  It takes every drop of make-up off, and leaves my skim feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is awesome and it is worth the money. Before using bioderma, I was using regular wipes for make up removal and they were not inexpensive by any means if you compare the value and quality that you get bioderma.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Bioderma in Canada for a long time, but now my job has changed and I no longer travel there for work. This product from Amazon stings my eyes and caused terrible redness and inflammation.  I feel like I have sand in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product looks real; however the barcode is crossed out and there is a sticker with a Greek label.  Who knows where this from, where it has been and how the seller got it.  Bioderma clearly is not encouraging the sale of their products in the US.  Wish they would change their mind, but I am not putting anything in my eyes again that I don&#x27;t now exactly who made it and how it got there.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and flare up when using most eyemake removers.  This one is amazing!  Very gentle, takes off all makeup, including waterproof mascara.  I use it all over my face with a cotton pad.  Once the pad comes away clean, I know all my makeup is off.  I do rinse after (even though you really don&#x27;t need too) just because for me, I like the feeling of the water after.  I love this product.  It&#x27;s now a part of my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well to remove my make up. But still I would recommend to wash with water after using it since the sensitive skin like me can break out.</li>
    <li> Love this so much!!! Great for sensitive skin I use it to remove my make up at night and I love it!! Best Stuff ever wish they sold this in stores instead of online only</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good I give this product a five star rating&lt;br /&gt;But the picture should be more clear for the product and more information, sometime it&#x27;s not look the same as in the picture.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of dermalogica cleansing oil and now wanted to give a try to micelle water solution. I saw multiple reviews online of beauty gurus and how much they rave about this cleansing water.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited and tried the very 1st day to remove all my eye makeup repetitively twice. It could just take away my eye shadow fully but it could not take out the waterproof mascara as well as bobby brown gel eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if this is a genuine product as I have bought it through a third party seller from amazon. Please let me know if you guys have the same experience.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive and this takes off my face makeup nicely and gently.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product I would recommend it to anyone! I really enjoyed what I received. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year</li>
    <li> This is the best make up remover ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of stuff but nothing is like this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s French,  and really hard to find.</li>
    <li> Item does exactly what it is supposed to do. It removes my makeup with ease and it feels great and refreshing afterwards. I also use it as a toner with my Shiseido facial cottons. I love this stuff! The seller had my item arrive in great condition and right on time!</li>
    <li> This works great to remove ALL of my makeup! Gentle on my hyper-sensitive skin yet thoroughly cleansing. I pour a little on my Medline disposable dry wipes, wipe face once or twice and no more makeup (including waterproof mascara). I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> I read an article about this product and finally decided to spend the extra $$ and get a bottle. What a find!&lt;br /&gt;This is the absolute best makeup remover I have EVER EVER used. It does NOT burn my eyes, it does NOT make my eyes red, and it removes even the heaviest, 4 layer black mascara without leaving residue or smears. Bioderma has never broken me out and it is NOT SOAPY. Amazing stuff. Lasts a long time too. The 500ml bottle lasts me 6 months, using it every day on cotton pads.</li>
    <li> Clean, not over-dry skin, convenient to use, you don&#x27;t need water to rinse, good for travel, too. Best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Third bottle. Nothing to complain. But may change to Shu Uemura since I m alttle bored of it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this to take off makeup but to wash my face.  I&#x27;ve gotten away from using soap on my skin so I use it in the morning to clean my face and anytime I don&#x27;t need to remove makeup.  I love it and with how I use it a bottle will last a long time.  It&#x27;s kept my skin from being over dry from tap water and soap.</li>
    <li> Using this product every day to remove my makeup makes my skin feel like silk.  No more need for water.  Takes eye makeup off with ease and leaves my skin dewy pretty all day.</li>
    <li> I only purchased this product because my make-up-snob teenager declared it absolutely necessary. I thought really?  Fancy water...spare me!  But I must admit I started using it after washing with my cleanser and it actually picks up what my cleanser missed.  I was really blown away by how clean and less tight my forty-ish face felt. We will definately continue using Sensibio H2O.</li>
    <li> I buy this water to clean my face with all the time! I hardly use anything else for cleaning my face from makeup. It does the job well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky, pore-clogging film. Removes mascara, makeup, lipstick. It&#x27;s really worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best of its type.  I use it mainly when I travel - on flights etc., or in any circumstances where I don&#x27;t have access to fresh running water.  It&#x27;s clean and pure and effective!  Highly recommend - it&#x27;s always on my shelf!</li>
    <li> It works good as tonic water, but not good as a make up remover. but for a tonic water, the price is not so cute though.</li>
    <li> It removes makeup so fast, clarifying the skin and after use it feels so clean to touch!&lt;br /&gt;I just love it! and keep repurchased it over and over again!</li>
    <li> This make up remover is amazing, i use a liquid fondation and a little powder along with eye make up and mascara, and this solution works awesome by removing all most all of it... i put mine in a spray bottle and spray a few squarts on my face and then use a cotton pad to wipe away the day!! Then i use a face cleanser and my face is absolutely clean!!! I also have sensitive skin so this works well.</li>
    <li> Even though the price went up 8 dollars in a year it&#x27;s still worth it. The bottle is HUGE so it lasts a long time and removes  my make-up  perfectly. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and my eyes no longer burn like they did with my old product. A must in every skin care routine!</li>
    <li> Love it. Since I prefer not to use anything with oil on my skin, since I don&#x27;t like the residue it leaves this was perfect.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product to use，it is easy to help me remove makeup， i really like this product.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great makeup remover. The big 500 ml bottle I have had since February and wear makeup including mascara about 5 days a week most weeks, sometimes on weekends too. This product works , but It leaves a burning film behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I got lucky and found a black and brown eyeliner that actually stays on my waterline (inner rim) until I remove it. So at first I thought the remover on a q tip taking off the liner from waterline was what was creating this weird filmy eye booger thing inside my eye that burned till I would pull eye open and take a wet (with water) q tip to remove it. sometimes i would just have to take my finger to get it out. I would try to just cry it out but it NEVER stopped burning till i remove it. Then i stopped wearing my favorite eyeliner which is pantone mechanical pencil from sephora by the way. So removing all other makeup including mascara STILL get this weird burning makeup eye film. so I try not using it on eye makeup removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With removing other makeup like lip stains and long wearing foundation it works just as well with no burning feeling. It makes getting clean a breeze. It is worth a try especially if you wear a lot of makeup and hate the oily makeup removers on the market. I know i have wasted double the cost of this in the past on makeup removers that were too oily, didnt work or smelled like rubbing alcohol. This smells like water and feels like water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try the sensitive one and see if that works better.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this...</li>
    <li> This is the most gentle and effective makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used, and the bottle lasts me a really long time. It does a great job at even removing really waterproof makeup!</li>
    <li> Gentle. Perfect. Worth it. Received well and with no complaints. Thank you!</li>
    <li> After using my clarisonic, I loosen up the dirty and wash a lot of it away but i always clean up with this bioderma. It takes even more stuff off! and it doesnt leave my skin dry. I have normal to dry skin type</li>
    <li> This is now officially my Holy Grail Face No Rinse Cleanser!  You do not have to wash your face anymore if you buy this! All I do is apply it to a cotton pad and rub it in my skin and it gets everything including water-proof makeup off instantly! When I used to just use my Chanel or Purity facial cleansers, they always left dirt or makeup residue behind and I still had to use tons of toner etc to get everything off. The Bioderma Sensibio H20 gets everything off with only 1 cotton pad! It will last a very very long time. I will never wash my face again because this is a Non-Rinse Facial Cleanser.  This is not only a makeup Remover but an Everything Remover for Face and Neck. I will buy this for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> You can use it in your skin and eyes and is very soft. It is not grease. Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect make up cleaner for sensitive skin and very mild, it almost feels like water. Takes majority of my make up off, have to work a little harder for my waterproof mascara but overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I wish Bioderma were sold in regular US stores!!  It&#x27;s awesome!!  Gentle and effective!  I have extremely sensitive skin and am on my 5th or 6th large bottle of this.  It feels like you are just rubbing water on your face, but it removes makeup/sunscreen wonderfully.  Love this!!</li>
    <li> This product is watery so I put it in a spray bottle to not waste it by pouring into my hands and then applying to my face.  I like the way it removes my makeup and I still wash with another cleaner after.</li>
    <li> Love it! I am a licensed esthetician of 32 years standing and this product is so gentle yet so thorough. I&#x27;m surprised that more people don&#x27;t use it. It is fantastic for sensitive skin and truly removes every last trace of make-up without stripping the skin of it&#x27;s natural and essential oil mantle. I highly recommend it to any type of skin, but especially to anyone who has hyper sensitive skin and needs a gentle cleanser that will leave their skin soft and receptive to serums and other treatments.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good makeup remover and this is by far the best I have ever used. Easy, painless, and not harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the original one! the sticker was different it seems they printed the sticker. The smell was different too.</li>
    <li> While Bioderma isn&#x27;t the cheapest product around, it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it to clean off my makeup at night, I can clearly see the differences from the rest of my makeup to the now clean skin. It is definitely worth the expense and will be buying more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to a reminder: this is not a substitution for moisturizer or anything like that.</li>
    <li> I do not appear as verified buyer because I do not buy this through my Amazon account, but from my local pharmacist.&lt;br /&gt;I have (self-diagnosed) combination to dry, extremely acne-prone skin, but I avoid products for acne since they tend to strip my skin of all its oils.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great solution for taking off my makeup, which is only one PART of my everyday cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about 2 cotton pads, first one to remove eye makeup and forehead/temples and the second one for the rest of the face and neck. Then I lather up with my usual facewash and scrub away with a muslin cloth. Yes, I do get some (and I mean only some) trace of makeup when I wash. Sometimes I feel like I could do a third cotton pad if I wanted to, but I do not see the reason why. I can understand some people not wanting to wash afterwards, that is why I say it is only one part of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this to successfully remove the following foundations: Bourjois Healthy mix (before 2013 reformulation), Chanel VA, Shiseido Sun Protection liquid foundation. All these with water-resistant sunscreen and primer underneath, then powder, bronzer and such. Usually, the Shiseido one may require another pass, but not always.&lt;br /&gt;For eyes, it takes away my shadow over TFSI, mascara, pencil liner. Please note that, depending on the product, some need to be soaked on the product first and may require some more work to come off. Nothing that I have tried ever took away waterproof mascara, so I do not honestly expect this to do it. I massage some olive oil on my lashes to loosen the product (Shiseido&#x27;s perfect water resistant something) and this takes away the residue effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has no smell, it does not irritate my eyes or my skin (except if I squirt it on my eyes, then yes, it does sting a bit but no surprise here). As I said I follow up with my foam wash and muslin cloth so I cannot tell you how my skin feels with only this as mu remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is very convenient because I now have only one bottle on my bathroom instead of three (eye mu remover, cleansing milk, toner). Also, I save on cotton pads since less are required for each cleansing session. It lasts about 4 months with daily use and I have already repurchased. All in all, a great product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I&#x27;m a happy user.</li>
    <li> Bioderm does take out my eyelash make up with no problem at all. I love that it works like a charm</li>
    <li> no way! I won&#x27;t believe makeup-cleanser water any more! I got pimples!!!</li>
    <li> I got one half a year ago, and have been using it everyday to remove daily make-up. I find that I can&#x27;t be without it. It is the best make up remover I have ever used. Neat, efficient and absolutely clear for my face, and also very moist afterwards. And it seems that you don&#x27;t have to use loner or lotion in the summer after having it. You can just head for bed directly when you are tired. 100% recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice but a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with a new &amp;#34;Tube&amp;#34; mascara. Regular cleansers just don&#x27;t remove the mascara thoroughly. Bioderma will forever be a staple!cthis product removes everything!vdirt, grime, makeup you name it, and leaves your skin clean and hydrated!</li>
    <li> since it is a cleansing toner i am expecting a little more for the cleaning function, i don;t think it is bad, but i don;t see it works ...&lt;br /&gt;so 3 starts... but it can be only me.....</li>
    <li> The Bioderma solution is amazing. It is so effective at taking off the makeup and very cooling on the skin.</li>
    <li> I usually can&#x27;t use new products (due to sensitive skin/ breaking out slightly) but heard people from different countries using it on YouTube and tried it and loved it. Very gentle. Cleans skin. Use with a flat cotton puff.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few eye makeup removers that DOES NOT STING my very sensitive skin. It is very pricey stuff, but worth it to me to not have sore, burning eye skin. It performs better than most at dissolving makeup. There may b something better out there, but I have tried A LOT of removers over the years and i am sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my whole skin care routine for the better. It is so quick and easy to use that I never miss my nightly cleansing anymore. It does work well to take off waterproof makeup and mascara, although you do have to put in a little bit more effort on those areas. It is very gentile on my combination acne-prone skin. I use oversize oval cotton rounds to apply. I don&#x27;t rinse with water following use - just put my moisturizer on. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love having Bioderma when I&#x27;m tired and want  a quick way to remove eye makeup and wash my face.  It&#x27;s light and gentle and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Pro&lt;br /&gt;1. It cleanses makeup without residue although I always wash the already clean face once again with a foaming cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;2. Also, it&#x27;s very mild even to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;You would have to soak the cotton pad completely to see the full effects. Then, obviously, this product is quite costly.</li>
    <li> Bioderma are great products have purchased many of their products.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased this product. I like to use with my morning make up routine to clean up around my eyes. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
    <li> The best makeup remover I&#x27;ve come across so far. Love the giant bottle, too. Makes me feel like the supply is endless.</li>
    <li> this is the best eye and make up cleanser in the market, works really well with sensitive skin, don&#x27;t leave any residue and your skin feels like a newborn.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this product to anyone but specially to sensitive sking women&lt;br /&gt;thanks !!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It is a really gently solution and takes make-up off like a dream! I usually use it after cleansing my face but I have used it to remove make up mistakes and to take make up off in a hurry at night when I am too tired to wash my face. It needs no rinsing and leaves your face feeling soft. I have sensetive skin and some things burn or they leave your skin feeling sticky. Nope not this though it is great! wish se could get it in the states!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! It&#x27;s amazing what comes off your face even after you wash it in the shower!! My husband absolutely loves it! His face has never been clearer! I suggest to use it everyday or every other but still wash with face wash occasionally.. Definitely will repurchase this! Excellent shipping too! :-)</li>
    <li> This is what models and makeup artists use -- it&#x27;s a total insider industry product and I&#x27;m so thrilled I found out about it.  It&#x27;s different from the typical cleanser/makeup remover because there&#x27;s no need to wash your face after you use this.  You simply soak on a cotton pad, wipe and you&#x27;re good to go.  I have extremely dry skin that feels tight immediately after cleansing and this is seriously the only cleanser I&#x27;ve used that does NOT give me that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistency of water, no smell and does not irritate my eyes at all.  It gets rid of waterproof mascara quite well.  There is something about the science behind the \\&quot;micellar solution\\&quot; that breaks down makeup very effectively with no residue or drying effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is nothing short of AMAZING; you will not regret buying it if you use any makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Amazon tells me I bought this product 6 months ago and I&#x27;ve still got about a quarter of a bottle left of the 500 ml.  I use it perhaps 5-6 times a week.  Very cost effective.</li>
    <li> Feel good on my skin, skin looks and feels so very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have sentive skin and it works great for removing my makeup. My skin is very dry and after removing my makeup it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I bought this because I have really sensitive skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any negative reaction to this. It takes off all of my makeup easily and I absolutely love that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel too dry or too greasy after using this product.</li>
    <li> It is very mild and it does work! However, sometimes it is hard to remove eyeliner with it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite skin care products out there. Its the most gentle makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried and leaves no residue, whatsoever. It feels exactly like water, yet works. There&#x27;s no scent, and I&#x27;ve found that it removes even waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I really like this for removing eye makeup especially! It does not sting or irritate my eyes, I&#x27;ve even accidentally got some in my eye and it didn&#x27;t sting at all. Good makeup remover overall but I must say that I haven&#x27;t tried too many.</li>
    <li> WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR REASONS THAT I WOULD PREFER TO RETAIN.&lt;br /&gt;REVIEWS CANNOT ALWAYS BE ABOUT THE PRODUCT ITSELF BUT ALSO SHOULD BE VOICED&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE SERVICE AND COTS INVOLVED. IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE ENTIRETY OF THE PURCHASE&lt;br /&gt;THAT THE BUYER (CUSTOMER) HAS THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS. THERE CANNOT BE TRUE FEEDBACK OR&lt;br /&gt;CRITICISM WHEN THE CLIENT IS CENSORED.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. This is my second purchase and will buy again. It&#x27;s a little counter-intuitive for us Americans, because we have been programed to use water for all out cleansing needs, but this stuff really does take off dirt/makeup without leaving behind a residue (not waterproof mascara though! I found that out the hard way). I have VERY dry skin in the winter and there is no drying affects at all with this product. I have been turning away from American face products for awhile now (including makeup) and it started with this product. It&#x27;s a must have now for me.</li>
    <li> Bioderma is a great product! I love using it to take of my makeup off and a toner! It&#x27;s great on my dry, sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;This product is the BEST!</li>
    <li> The best, most mild make-up remover I&#x27;ve found.  No smell, doesn&#x27;t burn eyes.  Went through a 250mL bottle in a few months-- went back for the 500mL.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this product from makeup artist Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s blog. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This is wonderful for removing makeup prior to washing your face. I often use this on a cotton pad to wipe away eye makeup, including waterproof. It is very cool and gentle, non-irritating. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> When my dermatologist recommended I was a bit concern if it will do both jobs (serve as a cleanser and toner), but i was pleasantly surprise, works wonderful in my skin</li>
    <li> I have just purchased my second bottle of Bioderma Sensibo H20 and will continue using it forever,  It is a little on the pricey side,&lt;br /&gt;but we only have one face.  Better to take care of it while we have it...  No matter what the cost!!  I&#x27;ve been amazed how fresh my&lt;br /&gt;skin feels.  No more dryness.  No tightness.  Just smooth as a new born&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to discover this&lt;br /&gt;product.  Better late that never tho.  And at 80 years young I&#x27;m fortunate to be on a &#x27;roll&#x27;. Thank you, thank you and thank you&lt;br /&gt;again.  If there are any &#x27;con&#x27;s&#x27; I&#x27;m happily unaware of them.  I&#x27;ll never be without my Bioderma.  Often use it mid-day just to re-&lt;br /&gt;experience the cool fresh feeling once again..  Forever a fan.  Yours truly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help make my makeup removal routine easier before bed, and after reading reviews on this I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. I like the fact that it&#x27;s just a couple of simple steps of applying to a cotton pad or ball and gently going over the face without the need for water. It removed my makeup without leaving an oily residue. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be irritating my sensitive/acne-prone skin. What I didn&#x27;t like is that it does NOT remove waterproof eyemakeup very well. I still had to pull out my Neutrogena eye makeup remover for that. The opening irritates me a little because it seems to &amp;#34;throw&amp;#34; the first couple of drops onto my counter, no matter how gently I try to direct it onto the cotton. All in all, I will continue to use it and will most likely reorder.</li>
    <li> i received the bottle which is broken.&lt;br /&gt;really sad about it.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing face cleaning. I have been using it for years and my skin is smooth and I don&#x27;t have practically any wrinkles like my friends.</li>
    <li> Already knew the product. High quality and does what it proposes.</li>
    <li> First let me tell you about my skin.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  I would say 80% of skincare products found in drugstores and in the market are of no use to me because they irritate my skin and make me break out, so I have to be VERY careful what I put on my face.  The clarisonic mia made me break out, just to give you an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was very weary to purchase this but felt it was ok after watching numerous youtube video reviews on this product.  It looks like water and when I tell you it gets all makeup off of your skin, it really does.  I use it on my whole face and neck including my eyes, and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen that some people use this as their cleanser and/or toner and don&#x27;t use moisturizer after the fact.  That may work for some, but basically my regimen, is I use the bioderma to get all makeup off my skin.  Then I use the Skin 79 BB Cleanser to deep cleanse and get all the dirt underneath.  If I&#x27;m exfoliating that day, I use Cure Natural Aqua Gel.  I then use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel to tone and Embryolisse Lai&#x27;t Creme Concentrete to moisturize.  If you have very sensitive skin, you may want to try these products out because they have improved my skin immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this makeup remover does not burn and it feels amazing on your skin!</li>
    <li> great for my skin takes all the oil out</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this product and thought it was hype, but it wasn&#x27;t. Great produce. Best I have tried and I have tried high and low end.</li>
    <li> Always happy with this product, great for my rosacea + acne prone skin to lightly take off my makeup. Buttttttt..... the cap of the bottle came smashed so the came wasnt even attached to the product and the base of the cap was cracked. Kind of bummed me out, but oh well. :)</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this after seeing it in the GlossyBox magazine. Went to Paris and bought a few bottles. Everytime I used it to remove my eye makeup it stung like crazy and left my eyes very red and sore. Tried it a few more times and finally gave up on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife as eye makeup remover.  Every time she uses this product, it irritates her eyes.  Her eyes would be red and swollen.  She would also experience a burning sensation in her eyes for hours.  Despite all the positive reviews from Amazon, this product may not work for everyone especially for the eyes.</li>
    <li> great product, works well with hitachi N810. I wash my face after using this product though. I think you should do that too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It removes makeup (even waterproof makeup!) better than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried.  Most makeup removers are oil-based and will leave an oily residue, which is especially unpleasant when removing eye makeup.  This stuff leaves no trace of any kind. I&#x27;d be happy with it just as an eye makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what makes this even more amazing is how gentle a cleanser this is on my sensitive skin.  It is so gentle that I can feel guilt-free about wearing a full face of makeup, because I&#x27;m not scrubbing away at nor irritating my skin to remove my makeup. I&#x27;m happy to use to clean my face even on days that I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  It really makes my skin feel refreshed and clean. Without the dry tightness that most cleansers come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. Throw away all your other makeup removers and face cleansers.  This stuff puts them all to shame.</li>
    <li> bioderma is amazing at removing makeup and leaves the skin feeling hydrated and soft. Great for sensitive skin and eyes.</li>
    <li> Love bioderma! My skin is very sensitive and gets dehydrated, especially in the winter. I also get occasional breakouts and often use harsh benzoil peroxide products to prevent acne. Since using bioderma, I haven&#x27;t broken out once! My skin is clearer, less blotchy, and softer than before. This product is quickly becoming a staple for me.</li>
    <li> Good! I like it! My friend told me this product is really great cleaner. I agree with her. It really useful.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Works well to remove make up easily, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or stung my eyes.. Will definetly be purchasing again, although it will be some time from now as a little goes a long way!  My reasoning for only giving it four stars is that the top of the flip top cap broke in transit, and I am left with the nub and small piece/shard attached to the nub.  Would have sent it back for replacement however I really wanted to start using it upon receiving it.  If not for this fact it would have been five stars easily.</li>
    <li> Feels like water, but magical water that takes off your makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face. Love this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see myself ever stop using this product in the future. I learned about it from Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s beauty blog. If you don&#x27;t know she&#x27;s a makeup artist goddess. Google her, you&#x27;ll thank me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to the product itself. I found it very soft and gentle. It quickly and effortlessly removes all cosmetic products with ease. I really find the price high for a product I want to use so often, but I&#x27;ll be bitting the bullet and purchasing anyway. I have very sensitive skin and this product feels like heaven. Not oily, doesn&#x27;t sting, and most important, no irritation at all. I&#x27;ve had other makeup removers on my wish-list but I really cannot justify buying anything else since I&#x27;ve found this product. If it works don&#x27;t fix it right?</li>
    <li> This product removes makeup, eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling fresh.  I even put this on my Clarisonic and it leaves my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> This product is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used thus far. Im glad i bought it and u will be too.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this make up remover. Its very gentle and cleanse the skin well. A bottle will last you quite sometime but still the price is high. If i can find a similar product that is cheaper I might try that instead of repurchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Would definitely recommend the smaller size for travel and the big one for makeup artist.</li>
    <li> I have used many, many makeup removers since I wear makeup for work 5 days a week. I have heard great reviews on this stuff and I was a little skeptical and never tried it. I just ordered it and received it and took my make up off with it, and boy was I amazed! This thing removed my full eye makeup, my foundation and it was gentle and it did not irritate my eyes. I am in love, highly reccommend and will repurchase again...</li>
    <li> This remover is a holy grail item of many make up artists.  I am so glad I finally purchased this. It is gentle but WORKS!  It even removes my waterproof eyeliner and mascara!  The one i received even came with a convenient pump! That was a pleasant surprise!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to choose another makeup remover to substitute it.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It came on time, but the cap was broken and the product wasn&#x27;t having a seal, it&#x27;s impossible to use this product when it&#x27;s not sealed. First time when I bought the product came properly sealed. Not this time. Amazon must demand proper packaging.</li>
    <li> no color, no fragrance, easy to remove makeup by cotton pad, cheaper than other department store brands but French product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing all the hype about this product and I really don&#x27;t know why people like it so much. I mean it&#x27;s a nice cleanser/toner but that&#x27;s it, just nice. It&#x27;s gentle to the skin but does not remove makeup very well, and definitely does not remove waterproof makeup. I like it but it&#x27;s not a lifechanger for me</li>
    <li> It just feels like water, doesn&#x27;t have any smell or color. It removes makeup easily and after that, the skin feels very fresh and clean, doesn&#x27;t feel tight like some other products. I love it!</li>
    <li> This makeup remover works very well even after 10+ hours of makeup wear.&lt;br /&gt;Its very good for sensitive skin like mine and does not irritate the skin. I have noticed a slight oil on my face after applying this but this oil does not break me out or anything. If one wishes, this makeup remover can be used a lone makeup remover and it will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;What I personally like to do with this makeup remover though is take a napkin or equivalent and dampen it with this makeup remover solution, then I go ahead and wash with my Mia 2 to make sure everything has been removed.</li>
    <li> It is very gentle, non-irritating, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. This product is also great for eye make up removal.</li>
    <li> I love using this at the end of the day to get whatever makeup my makeup remover wipes missed.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Bioderma is the best product line out there.  I am sad that their whole line is not available on amazon because i would buy it all.  This product is no different from all the others in the line.  It cleans AMAZINGLY and leaves the skin soft and moisturized.  I do use their moisturizer after but it is not fully necessary.  My makeup comes off so easily and there are not enough words to say how good this product is.  I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This works very well. I usually end up using a washcloth the get all the rest of my makeup off.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Bioderma about a year ago since I started breaking out real bad.  I went to dermatologist and got some medication and creams.  The prescription that my dermatologist gave me has helped me so much but it is not a life time medication so I tired to figure out what really caused this massive break out on my face.  As I tried to figure out, I learned that most of acne is caused by not having the facial skin as clean as it is supposed to be.  So I started looking for the magical cleanser.  I have tried so many brands from an affordable one in drugstore to an expensive one on counter brands. Finally, I found this Bioderma and I stick with it since then. I admit that it is expensive but it is amazingly worth it because it cleans my face thoroughly and it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling or even dryness on my face.  My face feels really clean and if I have break out again it would cause me more to go to dermatologist and it would leave marks on my face. There are couple bad things about it. First, I heard that there are fake Bioderma out there. You just need to look for a reliable seller. Second, no actual store carries this product so you really need to be a smart buyer.  This is my 3rd bottle and I am still very happy with it. Well, I&#x27;d rather say I can&#x27;t live without it.  My face just love this thing.</li>
    <li> Love this product,I would recommen it to anyone who needs to clean their face.It is gentle and gets the job done with making my face red and irritated.</li>
    <li> Wanted this on my last trip to Paris but didn&#x27;t want to pay shipping.  Love this stuff!  I use this and then cleanse with Avene.  Great when used with Shesiedo pads!</li>
    <li> IT IS THE BEST MAKE UP REMOVER I HAD EVER USED&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN USE IT TO CLEAN UP YOUR MAKE UP EASY</li>
    <li> Best micelle water I&#x27;ve tried. Sephora brand is similar but not as good. A little goes a long way. This literally has improved my skin tone.  Gets even most stubborn eyeliner off. Can&#x27;t live without this</li>
    <li> Great eye make up remover.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best makeup remover on the market.  it is incredibly gentle and easy to use.  Simply dampen a Shisedo cotton pad and viola!</li>
    <li> have bought the third bottles. very gentle and effective</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin -- as in I have to worry about not only about what I put on my face and hair but what face and hair products my husband can use so my face doesn&#x27;t get irritated.  For a while, I quit wearing makeup altogether.  Now that I&#x27;ve found this, I&#x27;ve started using makeup again (yay Jane Iredale, Laura Mercier and Too Faced!) as I now have a way to reliably and very easily get ALL the makeup off and cleanse my face, without ANY harshness or irritation.  Sephora should seriously pay Bioderma a commission because I&#x27;m buying (lots of) makeup again now that I&#x27;ve discovered this stuff.  :)  It truly is wonderful.  I am buying my second 500ml bottle.  It really does feel like water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and also, I heartily recommend the S.W. Eco Cotton Rounds.  I grew tired of all the waste I was generating with the cotton rounds and found ones that were organic and reusable/washable.  (Truly.  Read up on how regular cotton is grown; it&#x27;s one of the dirtiest crops out there in terms of pesticides and chemicals used.  I figured it was easy enough for me to stop this habit by buying the reusable ones.)</li>
    <li> The absolute best for taking off eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I have vey sensitive eyes and had no problems. I&#x27;m getting ready to place another order. You don&#x27;t need much of the product to remove the eye make up. Dent leave an oily feeling behind. It lasts a long time. Really nice product.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleaning water -- i use every night to remove my makeup prior to washing my skin</li>
    <li> Could rave on and on about this product. Truly a great make up remover. I understand all the hype about it. I will def. repurchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.. and I find most makeup removes designed for sensitive skin just don&#x27;t take off my makeup well enough and leave residue.. which later on ends with me having breakouts. THIS doesn&#x27;t do that. This removes last traces of makeup and leaves my skin clean and not irritated. I hate stripping my skin when I cleanse, and this product doesn&#x27;t do that. I know makeup artists use this product on models in fashion shows and it&#x27;s a staple to them. All around, I&#x27;ve ordered this product 3 times already and I cry each time I run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as it was recomended by a dear friend. The very first time I used it I was utterly amazed. This is no less than a miracle. It is like miracle water. No less.&lt;br /&gt;I had sort of stop putting make up on because the make up removers I was using left my face burning or way to grease. And I always buy the best as far as face products is concern. With this baby, I put on make up every day and do not fear the removing of it because it comes off very easy, and all kinds of make up, even the highly pigmented like MAC.&lt;br /&gt;I think of it as the make up &amp;#34;magic eraser&amp;#34;! I recomend this to everyone. This amazing predict need to get out there!!</li>
    <li> My skin turns red and feel irritated after the first try.  If someone want to try, I would be glad give it away.  However, I would not recommend it to anyone.  My order was sold by Miaderma and they don&#x27;t accept return once the bottle is opened.</li>
    <li> I purchased this directly from a French site (to ensure it was authentic so I could make an accurate judgement), &amp; I&#x27;m on the fence about purchasing this again.  It does remove makeup completely without tugging and without residue (a plus on those nights when I&#x27;m tired/lazy &amp; really don&#x27;t want to take my makeup off), but it doesn&#x27;t seem remarkable enough to warrant the high cost.  My Pond&#x27;s cucumber cleanser removes makeup just as well for a fraction of the price, though it does require rinsing, and it supposedly contains more toxic ingredients than this (because I rinse it, this doesn&#x27;t concern me as much).  I am going to try this on my teen son&#x27;s acne/rosacea prone skin- this may be just what he needs to remove sunscreen from his face during the summer.  For those with oily skin looking for an effective makeup remover/cleanser this is recommended and worth the cost.  For others, it is recommended to keep on hand as a no-excuse night makeup remover.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good for me. and this is the sixth bottles I used. and you won&#x27;t regret to buy it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this for a little over a year now and really love micellar water as a product.  i have very dry and somewhat sensitive skin and because these types of products are as gentle as (you guessed it) water while also removing all makeup / dirt / oil, they are ideal for my skincare regime.  i use bioderma during makeup application, too, if i need to clean up my eyeliner or pick up eyeshadow fall out.  this product is one that i also use in place of an american-style toners (which can be harsh) to make sure that -- even if i haven&#x27;t worn makeup that day -- there&#x27;s no build up on my face.  combined with oil cleansing, bioderma has done well for my skin and performed exceptionally well in all the ways it promises to.  i also love that it&#x27;s a multi-use product, which helps to justify the cost, and i&#x27;ve repurchased it twice since my original purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve only used bioderma thus far bc there has been a gap in the market, but now garnier and i think olay have come out with micellar waters, too.  like bioderma, both are not available in u.s. stores (probably bc the u.s. market has yet to really &#x27;discover&#x27; micellar waters), but are on amazon... i&#x27;ve heard great things about the garnier one and will likely try it next as it&#x27;s considerably cheaper per mL than bioderma.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. When will we get it in the US? Until then I will be ordering it From amazon! I hate makeup remover wipes, they never seem &#x27;wet&#x27; enough to remove makeup. Just soak a cotton round and wipe away, makeup glides off. This formulation is great at removing makeup, even eye makeup. My skin feels so cleansed, soft and moisturized after each use.  I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin. I find this to be a fabulous addition to my skin are routine. In addition to the bioderma I use all Lush products with my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the many good reviews. Not sure is people lying to promote this product or not. But this doesn;t work at all. I been rubbing my face trying to get my make off , its like im using water only. So I can;t remove my make up. Not only that the other reviewer is right about that you can&#x27;t return this item due to some kind of chemical rule non returns. Just giving warning to buyer not to waste their money on this product.</li>
    <li> I have a super sensitive skin and my eyes water at everything. I love this product and it&#x27;s true sensitive skin mission.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels just like water but removes make-up about as well as the oiler, heavier types. It also it gentle enough to use with contacts still in.</li>
    <li> Great for all skin type. You do not need to rinse after you finish removing your make up. Very great product.</li>
    <li> I agree that it is like water and it does work well. Has a bit of a problem with mascara. And I&#x27;m talking regular mascara, not water proof. Leaves that residue line on the bottom lash. Other than that it works beautifully and I agree with the other reviews.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe i wasted so much time not purchasing this before. I&#x27;ve been eyeing for 2 years and just recently decided to invest in it. Seriously. You need to throw out all your other make up removers. I have found my holy grail product. And I am sticking to it. This doesn&#x27;t burn. Doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. Removes water proof mascara amazingly. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. And leaves it feeling really clean. No residue or film on skin. The awesome part is if you tip your bottle on its side with the cap open you won&#x27;t spill anything. Because you have to squeeze the bottle a little to dispense the liquid. This product came with an original holgram sticker for authenticity.</li>
    <li> I have heard so many good things about this product. Not sure what they were using but it is not this. This product is just like water. It will not remove any make up and burns the heck out of my eyes. How can you promote something as an eye make up remover if it burns your eyes? I would not recommend this product to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! Little bit more expensive than the other ones but worth every penny!! I&#x27;ve been using it for many years now and never found anything better!</li>
    <li> People raved about this but it&#x27;s not one-stop makeup remover. I like Shu Uemura Cleansing oil way better. I gave Bioderma a try because I thought I could save money from buying Shu but I was wrong. I had to use 3 rounds of cotton square to remove the makeup on my face and the mascara did not come off easily. I ended up using more product than when I used Shu Oil. I&#x27;m going back to Shu after this. 500ML lasts me a year+ but this one probably won&#x27;t last 3 months.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product.:)</li>
    <li> Good product. Easy to order. Shipped on time. Easy to use. Also arrived on time. Practical product that helps regularly.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it works for my sensitive skin.  It takes awhile for it to get my mascara off, but its fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good makeup remover but that&#x27;s pretty much all there is to say about it. I don&#x27;t really understand all the hype.</li>
