      <li>It absorbs very quickly, leaving my skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>I ordered 2 which is the regular price for a 4 oz jar and got 2 full size cleansers and 2 full size toners as if they were free.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 72 years old</li>
      <li>I read all the hype about this product but saw NO results after using it completely.</li>
      <li>This product was a good price for what you got, but I was not impressed with any noticable results as was advertised by this company.</li>
      <li>The facial cream is not too heavy and not too light.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product so can&#x27;t give you any info on how it does over time but what I can say is the products make my skin feel so good.  When I wake in the morning my face is still soft and the wrinkles aren&#x27;t as prominent.  The only thing against it would be the smell of the cream itself.  They could have done better with a light fragrance.  The smell of the cleanser and toner is great.  Don&#x27;t know how they let the cream fall thru the cracks.  All in all, I think I&#x27;m going to like this product.  It&#x27;s for more than just your face.  Kudos to Amazon for offering this fantastic gift set.  The cleanser and toner are full size.  I ordered 2 which is the regular price for a 4 oz jar and got 2 full size cleansers and 2 full size toners as if they were free.  I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> got started on using this product a few years ago which i bought at jcpenneys ( just the cream) now i find i can get this on ebay fast and easy live in rural area and beleive me we have nothing</li>
    <li> Looks good but taste no good.  Looks nice but the quality of EB5 is bad.  The cream ( for eyes and face ) is quite different compare to another product.I do not like those.  After using this products for a fews days, my skin has been changed. Itching and appear many red spots.  I bought this because of the Ad. , so I try.  I will never touch or buy that Items from EB5.    If somebody think this products is good or want to prove, I can sell to them with a lower price, because I just use a little ( few days ).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least five (5) years.  I am 70+ and when I tell someone that they go \\&quot;No Way\\&quot;.      The facial cream is not too heavy and not too light.  It makes your skin feel supple.  the toning formula is perfect before you apply the facial cream.    I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for at least ten years and I wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, its the best.  I&#x27;m 72 years old and I&#x27;ve been told many times that I don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
    <li> I purchased the eb5 Gift set which includes the facial cream, cleansing formula, and toning formula.  The cleansing formula gave me a hot sensation after washing my face the first time.  I didn&#x27;t think much of it and then the facial cream is too oily for my face almost feels as if I poured oil on my face.  The toner was the only good thing out of this entire set.  Unfortunately these products are not for me.  That&#x27;s great other people can benefit from these products.  Maybe its only good for those with non sensitive skin and if your skin is dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Eb5 for about a year now. So far I really like it. It really looks good under your foundation makeup. I use it everyday. Also looks good on my face when not wearing foundation. I have a couple of friends that have been using it for years now and they both wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else. Amazon always has the best prices on Eb5.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is not greasy and my make up does not get streaked and stays on all day when I use the toning formula and facial cream.</li>
    <li> I read all the hype about this product but saw NO results after using it completely. I would not recommend this to anyone, waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the wole kit.  It makes it easy to keep your skin looking younger!</li>
    <li> THE 3 PIECE SET OF CLEANSING CREAM, TONING AND FACIAL CREAM ARE A PERFECT SET.  THEY ARE VERY EASY TO USE AND I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> i found this product awful, unpleasant smell, greasy and thick.  sent 5 emails to their customer service with NO reply.  i finally threw the product away, and figured good money wasted.  hope someone reads this and thinks twice before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love this product, makes my skin feels amazing. I notice my wrinkles are gone and my skin feels more tight and firmer and super soft. Give this product about a week or two to start seeing results. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time trying anything else again. Great price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the cream in this package.  It is too oily and I blame it for my break-outs -- at age 60 -- God forbid, the ONLY positive thing about aging.  I have seen EB5 advertised for years in my local newspaper and could not resist Amazon&#x27;s price to try it out. I like the cleanser and the toner, but would not recommend the moisturizer/cream because of the results I experienced.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product tremendously.  When I first used it, I thought the cream would be to thick but not so.  It absorbs very quickly, leaving my skin very soft.  Great price from Amazon also</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  The toner seems to run out faster than the rest and wish I could purchase it separately.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of EB5 products!  I have been out for a while now &amp; was very happy to get more &amp; at a great price!!</li>
    <li> This product is the best skincare products that I have ever used! I am 50 plus years old and I get so many complements on my skin. I have no wrinkles, my skin is smooth. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love these products. I used to use Clinique, and you know how much that costs, but now I&#x27;ve changed for the better. This gift set lasts me almost 6 months and for the price that&#x27;s a bargain. Works great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this facial cream but it was pretty expensive at the drug store. Getting 3 of their products for just a little more than the cream was a great bonus.</li>
    <li> This product was a good price for what you got, but I was not impressed with any noticable results as was advertised by this company.</li>
    <li> I did not find it useful at all. I think it&#x27;s over-priced because it didn&#x27;t serve the purpose for which it&#x27;s advertised. It&#x27;s just an ordinary cream and nothing special about it. The toner is too strong to the extent that it can damage you skin. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My mom swears by these eb5 products. She is 82 and has youthful skin , says thanks to Eb5 for the youthful skin.</li>
