<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes when it comes eye make-up removers and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It also takes off all of my make-up with ease- even waterproof mascara. I only have to use one cotton ball for both eyes and it works fine. This bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> After having tried most drugstore makeup removers out there, this is the most effective at removing eye makeup without leaving behind that yucky oily residue that many other removers do. The lock-cap mechanism is also nice. Bottom line, it works and there&#x27;s no icky residual oils after.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores, but this is my favorite make up remover by far. Happy to be able to buy it from Amazon. For waterproof mascara, you might have to give it a few more swipes, but works well and removes make up perfectly and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or give me any allergic reaction (unlike some other brands out there)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting mascara off, but this works like a dream.</li>
    <li> Gets literally anything off.  However, it leaves kind of an oily residue. Nothing a quick splash of water to the face can&#x27;t cure!</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to. Removes stubborn eyeliner like a dream, but i just dont like how &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; it feels. Even after washing my face it still leaves a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda pricey for an OK product. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Used to by Clinique&#x27;s make up remover.  Bought this one day when I ran out and will never go back!  Works every bit as well!</li>
    <li> I only wear waterproof mascara which can be very difficult to remove.  I have tried all type of eye makeup remover and nothing removes my waterproof mascara like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris Clean Artiste remover.  No rubbing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between different brands of waterproof mascaras and this removes them all.  :)</li>
    <li> This cleaner takes off all waterproof eye makeup so well I would never use anything else. I have been a fan for several years.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few years. This is the only thing which can remove the \\&quot;kissme\\&quot; mascara. Fine with sensitive eyes. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had realized how much oil is in this, it left my face feeling oily &amp; didn&#x27;t work any better</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with the waterproof remover that conditions lashes (not the waterproof/long wearing). It removes all make-up, with little effort and leaves you lashes conditioned. They break off less frequently, and the eyelids feel great, too.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful product but must be used before bed or long before you plan on putting makeup on again. I used this remover for my eyeshadow and eyeliner which I had had heavily caked on for a dance recital. To my pleasure when I applied it to my cloth and wiped my eyes it came off immediately, no hassle whatsoever, and almost all of it gone the first swipe. It left the skin around my eyes and my eyelid feeling very soft and I was very happy with it. I went to bed, did my makeup the next morning, didn&#x27;t get a chance to take it off before bed that night and when I woke up the next morning I went to use the eye makeup remover after my shower to rid of the eyeliner before applying new makeup. Again it was taken off immediately and again the skin around my eyes felt very soft. I applied my new make up and was very annoyed to see that within an hour later my usually secure makeup was smudged more than ever before. The soft feeling left behind is the residue from the remover. It seems it doesnt matter how many times you attempt to dry it it really just needs time. When used before bed or hours before you plan on applying makeup, this is a wonderful product, but beware of the time of use. Or you might be using it more than you bargained for.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover is light and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue behind.     Removes long lasting makeup very easily and doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes. Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Takes off my makeup very well and has never caused me any problems acne wise. It leaves my skin very soft and clean. Although it can smear makeup so be careful, I don&#x27;t recommend using this when you mess up your eyeliner or something</li>
    <li> THE CAP OF BOTTLE CANNOT BE OPEN!!!</li>
    <li> works ok, ive had it for about a week now. the cap is NOT that hard to get off, its the same concept as any pill bottle you just push down and turn. dont forget to mix it! its separated like oil and water and you have to shake it before use or it wont work. doesnt make your eyes oily or greasy like some long-wearing/waterproof makeup removers do. by the same token though, your make up wont just slide off easily you kind of have to wipe/scrub it gently.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Almay pads, both the non-oily, and the oily, to try to get rid of the industrial strength mascara I have been using (seriously this stuff is like glue, more than any waterproof mascara I have ever used). I would use the oily, then the non-oily, then wash my face, and the mascara would still be on my lashes the next morning after I washed my face and dried with a towel.   Not with this stuff. I am very pleased that it takes off the mascara on its own, I don&#x27;t have smeary black marks on my towel after I use this and wash my face.   I kind of reminds me of the Chanel I used to use but of course the price is much better.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this item and liked it very much. Will definitely reorder for her</li>
    <li> I usually use ALMAY but thought I would give this one a try.  The product was fine but there is no stopper and it just pours out.  I was gone very quickly.</li>
    <li> While this product does a great job of removing eye makeup, even waterproof makeup, it is not the best for sensitive skin.  My skin can handle me using this remover maybe once a week.  If I should happen to use it two days in a row, the skin around my eyes becomes all puffy and inflamed.  It&#x27;s rather uncomfortable feeling and I look even worse.  ;-)  I wish I could find a product that works this well but that is still gentle enough for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It takes EVERYTHING off &amp; does it gently.  It&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores around here and usually costs $8 if I do find it.  It makes my lashes soft &amp;  seems to help them grow.  I&#x27;ll be very sad when this is ever discontinued.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to try this mascara remover with the rave reviews it received on amazon.  I&#x27;ve tried so many that didn&#x27;t work at all.  I previously used baby oil, but it plugs the tear ducts and causes my eyes to water the following day.  This works, does not leave an oil residue, and my eyes didn&#x27;t water the next day.  I&#x27;m sold, in fact I&#x27;m going to order another bottle today.  Wish it would come in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I agree with most of the other posters. This is a very good product. Mascara comes off easy and it feels very easy on the eyes.</li>
    <li> The product works well for me but the lid is so ridiculously hard to open it&#x27;s not worth it! It&#x27;s just like reviewer Twins Fan \\&quot;Jake\\&quot; reviewed it, 3/4 remaining and I can no longer remove the top. At the end of the day the last thing I want to do is fight with my eye make up remover. I am going to give it another try so that I can hopefully transfer it to a different bottle. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. I use many long-wearing and waterproof type eye makeup products so I wanted a remover that would take it all off - it DOES take all the makeup off including foundation, blush, budge-proof lip products etc BUT I absolutely hate the baby oil-slick residue feeling left on my face! AFTER washing my face at least 3 times with my usual facial cleanser, I HAD to use a liquid dish detergent to finally get that baby oil-slick feeling OFF my face! I just cannot use this on my face ever again, so I may try to use this up cleaning my brushes.</li>
    <li> Really good makeup remover</li>
    <li> Did NOT have safety seal on.. It could&#x27;ve just been some soap water with oil in it !! Don&#x27;t trust it!!</li>
    <li> I love the blue bottle of Clean Artiste and figured this would be great too but many a little more effective.  I was very disappointed that this is oil based and leaves my eyes feeling greasy.  Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Takes my  makeup off instantly and moisturizing without being greasy</li>
    <li> This remover works so well!  Here was my old &amp; annoying ritual with other brands: 1) Wash face at night, then wipe away eye makeup (appears to be gone). 2) Take shower in the morning &amp; wash face again with gentle cleanser. 3) Realize there was still more makeup on, so need to re-remove makeup. Using these products in the morning is annoying because it interferes with my contacts &amp; new day&#x27;s makeup.  My new routine is step 1 and that&#x27;s it.  No need to re-remove.  Other key points:  A little oily but not bad: I have used other products that were SO oily. I would call this average.  Contacts: no matter what remover I use, I always take out my contacts first. I also avoid using remover right before I put my contacts in. Sometimes I need to though, and with this product I have had no problems (blurry vision, ruined contacts).   Using it before makeup: in general I think remover should not be used before makeup so I am not surprised at the experience another reviewer had with smudged makeup. Actually with this product I have had to do this a few times. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with running makeup. Maybe I was just lucky those times.</li>
    <li> i was in search for the longest time for the most effective makeup remover &amp; my search ended when i found this. I always wear waterproof mascara so its very important to find a remover that wont irritate my eyes when I use it every night. I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena (various wipes &amp; liquids), oil of olay, and a few other drug store brands and this is hands down the BEST.  i dont need to rub or use a lot of it, just 1 quick dab &amp; a few swipes across the eyes &amp; i&#x27;m clean &amp; ready for bed.  i absolutely love this product and i could never travel w/o it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many makeup removers, both drug store and department store and this is my absolute favorite.  It does a great job of removing waterproof liner and mascara, but is still very gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling overly oily.</li>
    <li> This has helped remove the most stubborn of mascaras.  I&#x27;ll occassionaly have just a bit left on, but another pass with a fresh cotton round generally does the trick.  I would highly recommend it.  I haven&#x27;t had any eyelash breakage with it.  Very gentle and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have finally found an eye makeup remover that isn&#x27;t oily and/or works without having to use 10 cotton balls to get the job done..and this isn&#x27;t caked on make up either. I bought this a few months ago, loved it..ran out..then couldn&#x27;t find it again anywhere so I settled for the non long wearing stuff..meh..that stuff sucks in comparison...so now I will stock up via Amazon and will be able to take my eye makeup off quickly, easily AND CHEAP!!! I highly recommend this stuff</li>
    <li> I have not received item and have not been able to find a number to call.  Hope it comes in the next few days.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products that claim to be the best at removing waterproof eye makeup. This product puts all of those to shame. I just pour a little on a cotton pad and within a couple swipes, my layers of waterproof mascara come right off. It is very moisturizing and does not irritate my sensitive skin. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> False Advertising!  I did not receive the product as advertised.  The package is old and damaged, looks as if it was recycled.  The fluid inside is green and looks like dish soap.  And this is something that is applied directly on your EYES.  When I went to return the item I am informed that it cannot be returned because it&#x27;s considered hazardous waste.  Don&#x27;t buy this item.  You will not recieve the legitimate product and you will not be able to return.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this transaction and now I&#x27;ve learned not to buy cosmetics on Amazon.  I find this especially offensive because this is something that could cause physical damage to the eye.  Who knows what is actually in this old recycled bottle.  Shame on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Best waterproof mascara remover that I have used. I use makeup wipes but one of my waterproof mascara&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t come off. This takes it off so easily. No oily residue either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok in removing eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle, but it does leave greasy residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> the worst eye make up remover ever</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  Takes off waterproof mascara very quickly without an oily or sticky mess.  Having sensitive eyes and wearing contact lenses, this is a must.  I used the more expensive stuff for a long time, but no more.  This is my go to.</li>
    <li> Read about this on beautypedia, and decided to try it. I love it, it removes even my most stubborn makeup in a flash. The bottle doesn&#x27;t leak, I&#x27;ve carelessly packed it in numerous trips now and never had any spills. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice product. It removes makeup well, only leaves a small amount behind. Which is fine because I have to wash my face afterward as it&#x27;s very oily. Also, it irritates my skin. But, I have very sensitive skin. Overall, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This leaves your face feeling very greasy. I would rather use Neutrogena oil free.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Waterproof&amp;#34; is the key! Great product, works!!!</li>
    <li> Takes off my eye makeup but burns my eyes and skin around my eyes. Wish it was more gentle.</li>
    <li> I tried this as an alternative to Lancome&#x27;s Bi-Facil and actually like it better than Lancome&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s fragrance-free and breaks down the makeup without tugging.  I highly recommend this, especially considering the price!</li>
    <li> Works great but is a little oily. No rubbing need to remove makeup. Quick and easy, wipe on, wipe off</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It removes my waterproof mascara and eyeliner with ease and no rubbing.  I don&#x27;t feel it to be greasy nor does it bother my eyes.  I saturate my round cotton pad and place on my lid for a couple of seconds before I start wiping it off.  I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Even tho I have tried all kinds of expensive waterproof mascara removers, I was surprised to find that this one works the best of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND it is has a great price!!!</li>
    <li> works well, even removes Benefit &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara, which tends to be very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> works as well as Mary Kay with a cheaper price tag, but not as effortless as I would like on my lashes. seems to have a slight greasy feeling. I need to wash my face after removing makeup.</li>
    <li> LOVE, love, love this, it&#x27;s all I use!! Excellent at removing eye-make-up!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now. It&#x27;s the only remover that will take off waterproof mascara without being too oily. Well it&#x27;s not the only one but I would say it&#x27;s the only one in this price range that&#x27;s not from a department store. I had the hardest time finding an eye makeup remover that would take all of my mascara off. For while all I could find was oil free removers and they were pretty much like rubbing water on my eye and would not get all of my mascara off. This stuff takes it all off and is not entirely oil. It also does not leave behind that oily film like some do.</li>
    <li> I like it ok but hate that you have to shake it and press in on the lid to open it.  It works great though</li>
    <li> Removes waterproof mascara, long-wearing eyeshadows such as Maybelline Color Tattoos easily. I&#x27;ve used several brands of makeup remover and this is definitely on me repurchase list. Although, it&#x27;s sometimes hard to find since most stores only carry the blue bottle.</li>
    <li> Have used much better products in past.  Not as good as neutrogena brand.</li>
    <li> This could have been a 4 star but due to the problem that I have acquired during my multiple attempts to open the bottle, I have to give it a 3 star instead. Trying to open the bottle is ridiculously hard and time consuming. I had to use my tools to open the bottle! The removal product was working as it had advertised. However, it left the surface oily thus I have to wipe the residue by cotton balls.  Given the price is so low cost, perhaps I will buy the product again. I would say this bottle is very ideal for traveling ... check out the photos and you will see why lol.</li>
    <li> Hey -- what can you say. It gets the makeup off your eyes without stinging and works on the rest of the face too. Might leave a little residual of the stain makeups but a little foaming makeup cleanser get the last of it off.</li>
    <li> It Performs exactly like the high end Lancôme brand. The only makeup remover that works and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
    <li> I usually use Neutrogena oil free makeup remover, but this was a better deal, so I thought I would give it. I have to use twice as much to get my normal eye makeup off..I think that it is too gentle. Although it does not leave a oily feeling after use:) I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Quite oily, but definitely works.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with waterproof eye makeup as described. Had to go back to Merle Norman remover.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product twice but it is not worth all the time spent trying to open the cap. No matter whether you push down or tilt it up, the cap is impossible to open.  Its easier to open baby oil and use it as a replacement to this product</li>
    <li> My fiance will not use anything else. It does it&#x27;s job and I could not ask for anything more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boom!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people complain about the oil used in this remover and it being allegedly bad for your tear channels. Well... Maybe after 80 years of every day use... I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and I&#x27;m happy with it. The oily texture helps you easily remove any mascara without pulling the skin, unlike those oil-free removers. I prefer to wash off the oil after using it than rubbing the eyes with an oil-free remover until they&#x27;re red.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit greasy/oily once you finish taking makeup off with it. Need to wash face with water and cleanser afterwards for it to be gone.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup remover.  Works great on long lasting and waterproof makeup.  I have been using this product for about 3 years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Super, super good makeup remover! I&#x27;m so impressed by this product I&#x27;m stocking up. It&#x27;s just as good as pricy Mary Kay makeup remover. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This remover cleans up every kind of mascara! A must in my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an eye makeup remover that actually removes eye makeup and I think I&#x27;ve found my winner!! I have used expensive brands such as Elizabeth Arden and Estee Lauder, and the more moderately priced Mary Kay, and none of them compare to this product. This specifically states that it removes waterproof eye makeup and it does a great job on my BareMinerals waterproof mascara and my Tarte waterproof eyeliner. Nothing to wipe off on my towel after I get out of the shower anymore!!</li>
    <li> Cleans waterproof mascara very well. Remember to shake it before use to get the soapy action going on. I would recommend it. You only need to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> It still takes a little work to get the waterproof mascara off, but this product definitely works, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to work well and *not* be greasy. It left my skin very oily and is only a remover I would use at night time b/c in the morning, if there&#x27;s leftover eye makeup on my eyes, he oiliness of this product makes it difficult for me to re-apply eye makeup.</li>
    <li> There is only one other eye-make-up remover that works as well but it is priced FAR higher.  This is a bargain and works on even waterproof mascara.  I bought 3 and will buy MORE.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Only eye makeup remover that removes the super waterproof mascara that I use. I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands, but always come back to this!</li>
    <li> I like it. I have been using it for 2 years, and I keep using. I used up one bottle about every three months.</li>
    <li> Work great getting the eye makeup off.  Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and it&#x27;s definitely my favorite (good price too). Light and not greasy. Effective. (Caveat: not sure how it works on mascara as I only use eyeliner and shadow.)</li>
    <li> Love it!!! just love it.. Just ordered my 4the bottle.. that speaks for itself!! it works..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at nite, do-not use if you intend on putting on New make-up..  it seems to take some time for the eyelids, otherwise eyeliner kinda slides off.  so Be patient, and clean face  at nite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can also use for cleaning make--up off entire face..  just wish it came in larger bottle.. so I&#x27;ll just keep ordering More.. really works!! you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this in my local stores anymore, I found it here, thankfully.  It&#x27;s gentle. I have very sensitive skin that&#x27;s allergic to many things and this doesn&#x27;t bother my face. It is very oily but my normal routine is: take off my waterproof mascara with this, then wash my face, which gets rid of the oil. Works for me.</li>
    <li> This does a great job of taking off most of my water-proof eye make-up and mascara.  Great price when you use Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> This actually will remove waterproof mascaras! Not as greasy as other eye makeup removers I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Gave it 4 stars because I have to have patience in using it to remove all of my waterproof mascara. On the up side, I don&#x27;t have that oily filmy feeling that takes awhile to clear up. I&#x27;m a repeat customer for this product.</li>
    <li> This is amazing it takes off my waterproof mascara and eyeliner without a problem, it doesn&#x27;t burn or itch or leave a sticky or oily feeling behind. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or create any break outs. It took off my halloween make up without a problem, no residue left behind or make up. The only thing left behind was soft skin. I used it on my 2 1/2 year old daughter to take off her halloween make up and it worked wonders. Even the tear free shampoo makes her cry but this stuff didn&#x27;t even phase her and no redness of any kind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of makeup removers and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve found.  I only wear waterproof mascara and hate the super oily residue that most makeup removers leave behind.  Normally, to get waterproof makeup off you get an oily face, or you find a remover that isn&#x27;t oily, but it doesn&#x27;t get all of your makeup off.  This is the best of both worlds, and I always order it in multiples because my pharmacy doesn&#x27;t carry it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking to change eye makeup removers for a long time, as I&#x27;ve been dissatisfied with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover, in the clear blue bottle.  Even though it is oil-free, it always left my skin feeling extremely oily, and I was sure it was clogging the pores at the tops of my cheeks, under my eyes (I stopped using Clinique&#x27;s Take the Day Off for this same reason).&lt;br /&gt;Clean Artiste does have a much cleaner feel, and takes off my waterproof mascara very easily.  I apply it to a cotton pad, and lay it on my lashes for about five seconds, before I start to try to wipe off my mascara.  The left-over residue does not bother me at all.  I believe I will be using this product for years.</li>
    <li> Product and shipping as stated. Very easy interaction</li>
    <li> This product is oily enough to take off waterproof mascara but not overly oily.  The residue of the product is easily rinsed off with water or wiped off with a dry makeup pad.  It is my favorite eye make up remover so far. I even like it better than Clinique at half the price.</li>
    <li> I love this remover! I received a free sample of Bi-Facil a few months ago and fell in love, but couldn&#x27;t justify the price after my sample ran out. After a little research I found out Clean Artiste is almost the exact formula. And after trying it I can confirm, it works just as well as the more expensive brand and for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is oily.  After using a small amount on a cotton ball to remove mascara, it actually left a film on my eyes that was very difficult to clear up.  I used it once and now have to throw it away because it&#x27;s not returnable.</li>
    <li> I bought this so remove waterproof mascara. It does not do this. I tried it on regular mascara and it doesn&#x27;t remove it either. I would have to say this stuff is totally worthless.</li>
    <li> Works great on waterproof mascara.  Really love it.  I wear contact lenses and it does to bother them at all.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like oily products but this one is okay.  Works great and removes my eye makeup as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  I wear waterproof mascara and it was always such a struggle to get the mascara off at the end of the day.  This product gets the mascara off with such ease and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a makeup remover for a new waterproof mascara I bought and this stuff is great! I used to have to scrub my eyes in the shower and then use makeup remover and still not have it all off. This remover takes all the mascara off without having to rub my eyes raw. Just a few dabs on a cotton round will do the trick. I press it down on my lashes for a few seconds to kind of &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; before gently wiping the mascara away. And it takes it all off! it does end up a little oily on my skin, so I use it at night instead of before applying new make up for the day in the morning. I recommend for waterproof makeup!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could find anything that compared with Estee Lauder eye makeup remover, but this is it. And it&#x27;s probably half the price!</li>
    <li> This remover is like magic.  I got this new mascara that I love love love, but it is like glue.  It doesn&#x27;t say waterproof, but it must be (that and fireproof, nuclear bomb proof, etc).  I tried my usual baby oil and I had beautiful glistening long black eyelashes -- but that mascara didn&#x27;t come off.  I tried \\&quot;waterproof eyemakeup remover pads\\&quot; that were goopy; the mascara came off, but I had to sit down and watch t.v. while I pulled and tugged on my eyelashes.  Enter Clean Artiste by L&#x27;Oreal.  It has come from the heavens.  A little bit on a cotton round, a swipe or two of the lashes, and the mascara comes off.  Sure, you have to keep wiping to get the excess bits of mascara and eyeliner, but it immediately starts removing the mascara the second the cotton round touches your eyelashes, and you don&#x27;t need to tug and pull on your lashes.  I am buying a lot more in case they run out or something.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It does a great job of removing makeup, even hard-to-remove waterproof mascara comes off with little effort.  But it makes my skin really greasy, and even after washing my face I still feel like it has left a greasy residue on my face.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Works like a charm.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was the same one I purchased before. It is oily and I wanted non-oily make up reomover. I know there is a green and a blue remover, but the last time I purchased the green it too was non-oily. I didn&#x27;t know there was a green oily and non-oily solution.</li>
    <li> It cleans mascara well and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Unfortunately I got pimple around eye area after about 5 days using this.</li>
    <li> the perfect eye makeup remover for the price. Only a small amount of liquid is needed on a cotton ball to get all the eye makeup off and you get a perfect clean.</li>
    <li> The is the best eye makeup remover for waterproof eyeliner. Not only does it remove the eyeliner without having to rub the delicate eye lid too hard, but it doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue behind!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for someone to make this product that wasn&#x27;t Mary Kay. I&#x27;m tired of paying $15/bottle for the Mary Kay stuff. This stuff works just as well and really takes off my waterproof mascara without me pulling out eyelashes. If you use this with cotton rounds, it works wonderfully. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed. I was not even able to use the product before the cap jammed. I have had four people attempt to open it with no success. Seriously, U.S. Customs has nothing on the lid of this eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and love it. It removes waterproof makeup and does not feel oily or leave oil behind.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful user of the L&#x27;Oreal eye makeup remover in the blue bottle for years, but thought I would give this one a try.  No comparison.  The Clean Artiste version does not remove my eye makeup as well and it stings my eyes terribly.  There is also a slightly greasy feel to it that is not present in the blue version.  I will not buy this product again and am tossing out the remainder of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Terrible stuff. Does not remove makeup, just adds sludge to your face so you look like a greasy rainbow colored oil slick of a clown. La Fresh wipes work much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried seriously every eye makeup remover you can think of, from Clinique to Neutrogena, from high end to drug store brand. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. It smells nice, it removes my waterproof mascara and eyeliners with ease, and it&#x27;s so affordable. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle opening, it&#x27;s too big, and makes it hard to control how much remover you pour out. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I use waterproof beauty tubes mascara and this product barely gets it off. It&#x27;s takes super scrubbing. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
</ol>
