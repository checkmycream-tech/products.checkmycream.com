<li> ; my face felt extra soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
<li> It is easy to use sparingly, so the small bottle should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Does not dry out my skin.</li>
<li> and they were gone in less time than normal.</li>
<li> I have used it on bug bites, chafing and rashes and it seems to heal the area much quicker than usual.  </li>
<li> Furthermore, the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
<li> I applied a little bit directly on my acne spots with my fingers.</li>
<li> Thank you for making a natural product that I can use on trouble spots.</li>
<li> I have a problem with minor breakouts</li>
<li> I do not have acne problem, but every now and then, some zit would come out and when it comes out, it takes long time heal.</li>
<li> this must be a leave on type of product, even though that part still is not clear to me.</li>
<li> First of all I only gave it four stars because the smell is terrible and so overwhelming.</li>
<li> I just dab it on and it doesn&#x27;t take long for my skin to heal after I use it on my breakout!</li>
<li> I was surprised at how small the bottle was when I received this.</li>
<li> I only noticed it when I touched my face a few minutes after applying it</li>
<li> A little bit goes a LONG way!</li>
<li> The next day you could hardly see where they were.</li>
<li> It comes in a small bottle but a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I just dabbed it on a few times a day</li>
<li> Nonetheless, I did not know if I was supposed to wash it off after a few minutes or leave it on as you would your moisturizer.</li>
<li> She has been using it on her trouble acne spots and have notice that spots getting lighter.</li>
<li> and it did work on the few pimples I had.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t a heavy or sticky film.  </li>
<li> I have used this product for about 2weeks now on my trouble spots.  </li>
<li> consistency is similar to a thin lotion that comes out in drops instead of globs.  </li>
<li> However, since it is so small I cannot do that.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t usually pay attention to the number of milliliters</li>
<li> I guess because it is all nature ingredient, the smell is hard to control or compromise.</li>
<li> My pimples were gone slowly.</li>
<li> but it wasn&#x27;t the worse either.</li>
<li> Although it has a weird smell to it, it works wonders for blemishes.</li>
<li> but after rubbing into my skin, there was no sticky or weird feeling at all.</li>
<li> Smells horrible.</li>
<li> Worst stuff I have ever used for my acne.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works great, I don&#x27;t have bad acne but I can see a difference already and it makes your skin very soft and feels fresh</li>
    <li> Loving the natural effects of this product and I have been starting to see some difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow, My teen daughter and I both love this! She is more acne prone than me and loves this product! We both thin it smells great and it goes on thin and light. NOT heavy! A little bit goes a LONG way! Really like the look of the product as well, the bottle is nicely decorated and sits on it&#x27;s top so that the product is right inside the opening, making it effortless to get the cream out.</li>
    <li> I wanted something for my daughter that is not chemical made because she needs to put this on her face every day.  This is a product that works and smells great.  I can see blemishes become lighter after using it for 5 days.</li>
    <li> The smell is overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, but the smell is horrid.</li>
    <li> leaves my skin feeling great. Plus it helps with acne which is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.  I use it all over my face instead of on spots.  It leaves a very light and breathable protective film.  It isn&#x27;t a heavy or sticky film.  I only noticed it when I touched my face a few minutes after applying it; my face felt extra soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is similar to a thin lotion that comes out in drops instead of globs.  It is easy to use sparingly, so the small bottle should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural botanicals are used, so it has that light pine medicine smell that I have found a lot of organic products to have.  It is not an offensive smell but it is a little strong so I don&#x27;t use it if I am going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I got this product at discount in exchange of my unbiased product review. I do not have acne problem, but every now and then, some zit would come out and when it comes out, it takes long time heal. I put this treatment on couple times before I go to bed. It sure helps the zit growing and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all which is a super plus. However,  the smell...  hmmm.. I guess because it is all nature ingredient, the smell is hard to control or compromise. Well, since it works, I give it 4 stars...  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product so far. The more I use it, the more I love it. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I have a problem with minor breakouts and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my acne since I have received this gel. It&#x27;s convenient enough to carry with me so that I can use it during the day if I need to. I just dab it on and it doesn&#x27;t take long for my skin to heal after I use it on my breakout!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2weeks now on my trouble spots.  I have noticed the spots are a lot lighter now.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  The smell is a bit strong but nothing that I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> Came opened and leaking. Smells horrible. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It feels great on the skin and make it smooth. Very good product and safe to use, too.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife...She has been using it on her trouble acne spots and have notice that spots getting lighter.</li>
    <li> Smells great, it has a somewhat strong herbal scent that dissipates quickly.  It comes in a small bottle but a little goes a long way.  I have used it on bug bites, chafing and rashes and it seems to heal the area much quicker than usual.  It reduces itching.  I love that it is an all natural product.  I received a discounted product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> This really works. I have tried everything to get rid of acne and this is by far the most effective.</li>
    <li> Wonderful gel. Thank you for making a natural product that I can use on trouble spots. Since I am older my skin dries out too easily with normal acne products. It is working great!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter, seems to work very well on adolescent acne issues.</li>
    <li> Anti-inflammatory &amp; anti-bacterial face cleaner! I&#x27;ve been having a little bit more acne. As one clears up, one pops up. Very aggrevating to have acne and not a teen! This facial gel smells good and keeps my face clean. I&#x27;ve noticed a improvement with breakouts after about 1-2 weeks of use. Does not dry out my skin. Love that it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
    <li> Worst stuff I have ever used for my acne.  I did a patch test as the instructions suggested and did not have an adverse reaction.  I later used it on my face and my acne freaked out.  Thanks but no thanks.  It may work for some but not for me.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Although it has a weird smell to it, it works wonders for blemishes. This is a highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I agreed to give an unbiased review in exchange for receiving the product at a discount. First of all I only gave it four stars because the smell is terrible and so overwhelming. The plus is that it is an all natural product and it did work on the few pimples I had. I just dabbed it on a few times a day and they were gone in less time than normal. So that was counted as a success. The smell could use some improvements for it does do the job.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well this is working but giving it more time.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most natural product I&#x27;ve purchased in Amazon. Really smoothen my skin, I&#x27;ve been using it for pimple treatment, it works great. My pimples were gone slowly. Really recommend this Manuka Honey Gel, try it and see it for yourself!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how small the bottle was when I received this. I know it says it in the description but I don&#x27;t usually pay attention to the number of milliliters a product says. The description says it’s a gel cleanser so I thought I would use it to wash my entire face or even body, if needed. However, since it is so small I cannot do that. The directions say to apply on acne spots. Nonetheless, I did not know if I was supposed to wash it off after a few minutes or leave it on as you would your moisturizer. Therefore, I went back on to Amazon to read how I was so supposed to use this product. In the description information, it said how you could leave it on overnight. So then, I realized okay this must be a leave on type of product, even though that part still is not clear to me. That said, the product does seem to work good on my acne. I applied a little bit directly on my acne spots with my fingers. The next day you could hardly see where they were. It worked quite well and I was impressed. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but it wasn&#x27;t the worse either. It is all natural and organic, which I appreciate a lot. Furthermore, the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long so it’s not a big deal to me. It&#x27;s not like I was washing my body with this. Remember, this is a spot treatment not a face wash or body wash. As long as the product is working, I’m happy. The product does feel like a gel cleanser but after rubbing into my skin, there was no sticky or weird feeling at all. It was just gone and so were my pimples (by the next day). Since I’m spot treating my acne, I do not need to use very much and this bottle should hopefully last me a while. I agreed to give an unbiased review in exchange for receiving the product at a discount.</li>
    <li> This product works great, so glad I tried it!!!</li>
