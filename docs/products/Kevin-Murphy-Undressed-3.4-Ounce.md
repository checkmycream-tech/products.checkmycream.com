      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love this hair product!</li>
      <li>Probably great for women who want a light, run through stuff in their hair.  </li>
      <li>Kind of HOPED for something</li>
      <li>This has a very strong scent and I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>I like it better than any of the styling pastes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never paid more than 5 bucks for hair products until now.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Perfect, a hair styling product above the rest!</li>
      <li>I tried the product and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>it turns out I LOVE this paste even more.  </li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s more of a wax and works better for my shorter hair/styling.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love at bought some at the salon.</li>
      <li>and I love this one.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
      <li>The scent could be better</li>
      <li>this paste leaves my hair super soft and none greasy i love it!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a moderately strong, musky fragrance, with just a touch of mintiness, that mostly dissipates in 15 minutes and fully in an hour.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like really strong, candy/artificial scents, so I tend not to deal well with a lot of drugstore</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, which I like.</li>
      <li>Light hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an important part of your look.</li>
      <li>Very worth the price.</li>
      <li>Another reason I loved it is because I live in a very hot and humid climate</li>
      <li>It is not the same as the first container that I was so happy with.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair and this product is great if u want a product that really blends into your hair and let your hair the way that want!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve almost run out and the price on amazon was substantially more reasonable.</li>
      <li>girls love how soft my hair feels, they can run their fingers with no problem.</li>
      <li>last stylist used this product, and I was immediately drawn to the smell (like black pepper, so awesome).</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find a great product that doesn&#x27;t become greasy in the humidity.</li>
      <li>I bought my first container from a salon before ordering from this site.  </li>
      <li>It makes my mornings so much easier!</li>
      <li>I have been testing out products for along time trying to find a product that gives a good hold but not giving a firm hold to it.</li>
      <li>It gives just the right amount of texture to my short, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>That is not to say that it is a light hold - use a bit more, and it becomes fairly firm.</li>
      <li>I love the peppery smell and the matte finish too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too sticky, but holds my hair in place really well, while still leaving it a bit malleable.</li>
      <li>It arrived fast</li>
      <li>I have a super short pixie cut and too much product can really gum up my hair.</li>
      <li>so my biggest problem is my hair has attitude so different days i need to chose either right or left side otherwise when my hair chooses a side it will curl on that side so this product make my hair smooth and straight throughout.</li>
      <li>A few reviewers described it accurately as &amp;#34;It&#x27;s more of a liquid type of paste, completely different than &amp;#34;Kevin Murphy Night Rider Matte.</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine, somewhat dry fly-away hair.</li>
      <li>I have medium long naturally wavy hair and this is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>I like how natural my hair looks when using this product!</li>
      <li>It holds, gives the hair body, puts the hair in place but is not stiff or greasy.  </li>
      <li>It holds, gives the hair body, puts the hair in place but is not stiff or greasy.&amp;#34;  Buying this again.</li>
      <li>At first, I just liked how it made my messy bed head a little more chic, but it does actually make other styles I might manage to eek out last all day.</li>
      <li>I can literally &#x27;mould&#x27; my hair the way and still have it look natural.</li>
      <li>Its very liquid type of paste, completely different than &amp;#34;Kevin Murphy Night Rider Matte&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Lite and sublime For a natural look.</li>
      <li>And if I pull through it, it keeps my hair soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely the most expensive hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it was so worth it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and I love the black pepper scent.  </li>
      <li>It enhances the natural waves in my hair and is pliable enough to mold.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other very similar products at a much lower price.</li>

<li> Now that my hair is in the awkward stage of &amp;#34;just beyond short&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not yet long enough where I don&#x27;t have to bother styling it&amp;#34;, I needed something to work some magic into my straight, thick Asian hair.  </li>

<li> Only a small amount (1/8&amp;#34; thick layer on the pad of my index finger) is necessary to keep my hair (over-ear length, long bangs) in place just strongly enough to look neat.</li>

<li> The consistency and scent are totally different than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten in salons and on Amazon in the past.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I can go back to anything else at this point.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s lifts my hair and defines my natural curl without leaving a waxy finish behind.</li>
<li> the night rider makes your hair tight and greasy.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t break into flakes, isn&#x27;t hard when dry and keeps the hair in style all day.</li>
<li> so i bought a few extra.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to learn this is not true and that it will be sold for the foreseeable</li>
<li> A little hairspray</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like putting a lot of time in it, but I want to look polished and put together (or messy</li>
<li> adds a LOT of volume and control without making my hair look stiff and Callista Gingrichie.  </li>
<li> My hair stays (and looks) styled/combed all day without feeling or looking stiff.  </li>
<li> Not at all like the first container I bought :(</li>

<li> I am really lazy when it comes to my hair.</li>
<li> A small amount of this product applied to damp hair  </li>
<li> I got compliments and people asking how do u do your hair like that few times at least.</li>
<li> It is gooey and very heavy on the hair.  </li>
<li> but when I opened the lid, the product was all over, very messy.</li>
<li> not sticky or heavy, nor does it make my hair feel dirty -  </li>
<li> It turned out to be the wrong product for me:</li>
<li> Kevin Murphy products are expensive but truly</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too expensive to be so unhappy with it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff!  Gives your hair a lot of volume and hold.  I now have opened the container of un.dressed that I bought here.  It is not the same as the first container that I was so happy with.  It is gooey and very heavy on the hair.  I bought my first container from a salon before ordering from this site.  I don&#x27;t know if the company has changed the formula for this product or if this is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; of some sort.  I will not buy this online again.  It&#x27;s too expensive to be so unhappy with it.  Not at all like the first container I bought :(</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have a super short pixie cut and too much product can really gum up my hair. This stuff blends into my hair so well that it feels almost like nothing is on my hair. And it smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely the most expensive hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it was so worth it.</li>
    <li> Terrific product.  Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have been testing out products for along time trying to find a product that gives a good hold but not giving a firm hold to it. Another reason I loved it is because I live in a very hot and humid climate so it&#x27;s hard to find a great product that doesn&#x27;t become greasy in the humidity. THis has been the best product I&#x27;ve used. The shipping came in 3 days and loved that.</li>
    <li> It works alright but the tips of your hair stick together so you can&#x27;t run your fingers through it with out pulling your hair. Once this $40 product is used up I won&#x27;t be buying it again</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used it the last time and I thought it was nice and smelled good. I am so happy I bought it. It makes my mornings so much easier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never paid more than 5 bucks for hair products until now. I had a stylist at a salon use Kevin Murphy Undressed on my hair after my haircut, and it looked rad. Since I want my hair to always look awesome, I figured I&#x27;d take a pro&#x27;s advice and continue to use this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, which I like. It&#x27;s not too sticky, but holds my hair in place really well, while still leaving it a bit malleable. I&#x27;m not sure I can go back to anything else at this point. Isaac Mizrahi once mentioned that if there&#x27;s anything you should overspend on/pay extra for, it&#x27;s your hair - keeping it cut the way you like, styled the way you like, colored the way you like. It&#x27;s an important part of your look. So, pay the extra money and buy hair products like Undressed. You&#x27;ll look rad.</li>
    <li> Now that my hair is in the awkward stage of &amp;#34;just beyond short&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not yet long enough where I don&#x27;t have to bother styling it&amp;#34;, I needed something to work some magic into my straight, thick Asian hair.  I thought I loved Night Rider from Kevin Murphy.. it turns out I LOVE this paste even more.  Instead of using a comb, I blow dry and then use this paste as I run my fingers through my hair.  Voila, my hair looks styled.  A little hairspray and I&#x27;m out the door.  A few reviewers described it accurately as &amp;#34;It&#x27;s more of a liquid type of paste, completely different than &amp;#34;Kevin Murphy Night Rider Matte. It holds, gives the hair body, puts the hair in place but is not stiff or greasy.&amp;#34;  Buying this again.</li>
    <li> Never using a product like this before it would be too gummy but I actually like it. When I do curls this helps to define and set them without any gummy feel. The scent could be better but it&#x27;s not horrible. Kind of HOPED for something coconut like but ah well!!!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, my haircut place says there is good stuff in it.  It turned out to be the wrong product for me: I&#x27;m male with fairly short hair, this gives very little hold, it only provides a little styling ability.  Probably great for women who want a light, run through stuff in their hair.  I&#x27;ll go back to the Night Rider stuff, that&#x27;s more of a wax and works better for my shorter hair/styling.</li>
    <li> This appears to be counterfeit. The consistency and scent are totally different than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten in salons and on Amazon in the past.</li>
    <li> I got compliments and people asking how do u do your hair like that few times at least. Good product. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged after a shower. I can literally &#x27;mould&#x27; my hair the way and still have it look natural.</li>
    <li> I am really lazy when it comes to my hair. I don&#x27;t like putting a lot of time in it, but I want to look polished and put together (or messy chic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last stylist used this product, and I was immediately drawn to the smell (like black pepper, so awesome). I don&#x27;t like really strong, candy/artificial scents, so I tend not to deal well with a lot of drugstore products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the perfect texturizing paste. At first, I just liked how it made my messy bed head a little more chic, but it does actually make other styles I might manage to eek out last all day. And if I pull through it, it keeps my hair soft. I can sleep on it without being uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for less than what Amazon sells it for (my salon carries it), but it&#x27;s worth every penny, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it three starts because the product was not well packed when shipped. It arrived fast but when I opened the lid, the product was all over, very messy. I tried the product and it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve tried other very similar products at a much lower price. Would not recommend the product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Perfect, a hair styling product above the rest!</li>
    <li> It gives just the right amount of texture to my short, fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and I love the black pepper scent.  Even though it&#x27;s geared towards men, it works equally as well for women.  I like it better than any of the styling pastes/texture taffies that I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> great product! I like how natural my hair looks when using this product!</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this!! It doesn&#x27;t break into flakes, isn&#x27;t hard when dry and keeps the hair in style all day.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser and it&#x27;s everything the promo says it is. It&#x27;s lifts my hair and defines my natural curl without leaving a waxy finish behind. It&#x27;s even still doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do on Day #2. Very worth the price.</li>
    <li> This has a very strong scent and I couldn&#x27;t use it. Otherwise it worked great on my hair!</li>
    <li> Its very liquid type of paste, completely different than &amp;#34;Kevin Murphy Night Rider Matte&amp;#34;. i have a skin fade and my hair is till my nose. this paste leaves my hair super soft and none greasy i love it!!! the night rider makes your hair tight and greasy. girls love how soft my hair feels, they can run their fingers with no problem. i also have wavy hair so my biggest problem is my hair has attitude so different days i need to chose either right or left side otherwise when my hair chooses a side it will curl on that side so this product make my hair smooth and straight throughout.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product! My hairdresser introduced me to it, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the description states, this product effects a flexible hold. That is not to say that it is a light hold - use a bit more, and it becomes fairly firm. Only a small amount (1/8&amp;#34; thick layer on the pad of my index finger) is necessary to keep my hair (over-ear length, long bangs) in place just strongly enough to look neat. Definitely apply to towel-dry hair, or distribution will be inconsistent. Does not leave a greasy or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS FRAGRANCED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a moderately strong, musky fragrance, with just a touch of mintiness, that mostly dissipates in 15 minutes and fully in an hour.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all and I love this one.  It holds, gives the hair body, puts the hair in place but is not stiff or greasy.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair stays (and looks) styled/combed all day without feeling or looking stiff.  Kevin Murphy products are expensive but truly, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine, somewhat dry fly-away hair. A small amount of this product applied to damp hair  adds a LOT of volume and control without making my hair look stiff and Callista Gingrichie.  It does not dry out my hair. I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this product is great if u want a product that really blends into your hair and let your hair the way that want!</li>
    <li> I had heard that this was no longer being sold so i bought a few extra.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to learn this is not true and that it will be sold for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;I like it!  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Makes hair sleek. A little goes a long way. Light hold. Another great Kevin Murphy product. It will last forever.</li>
    <li> not sticky or heavy, nor does it make my hair feel dirty -  it&#x27;s perfection in a box !  and it has a pleasing scent</li>
    <li> This was used on me by a stylist and I fell in love at bought some at the salon. I&#x27;ve almost run out and the price on amazon was substantially more reasonable. I have medium long naturally wavy hair and this is by far my favorite hair product. It enhances the natural waves in my hair and is pliable enough to mold. I love the peppery smell and the matte finish too. I think I use about 3 quarter sizes each time on damp hair, depending on the time of year it&#x27;s the only styling product that I need.</li>
    <li> Lite and sublime For a natural look. Not for a perfect hold like a wax.</li>
