<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Never had a better mirror. Just great!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.  The size is perfect, solid, sturdy, attractive in design, functional...works perfectly and I love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Can see everything! Love this mirror and the light around the mirror is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas present and after using about four times the lights stopped working and would only show a very dimmed light. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best Makeup Mirror I have ever owned.  When something happens to this makeup mirror, I will order another one like it.</li>
    <li> I Love this mirror!! I can finally see to pluck my eyebrows. It&#x27;s magnified just right, and the lighting helps me alot.</li>
    <li> Although mirror was as pictured, I was VERY disappointed in its lack of lighting.  The lighting works but it highlights outside of the mirror images.  I would return it if I could.  It is 10x and I see better in my small old 10x mirror than this one.  Pretty but not usable.  Think twice if you need a mirror for finding those unwanted hairs, etc.  You just wont see them when you look in this mirror.  If  didnt know better I would think it was more 5x than 10x.  But most of all, the light on this mirror does not do the job.  I have used magnifying mirrors for my face for at least 15 years and this was my least favorite.  Think I will try and sell it on craigslist and get one of my old favorites again that do what I want.</li>
    <li> After searching high and low for a good makeup mirror, I relied on the reviews of 6 (of 7) people that unanimously gave this a thumbs up.  The price was also very reasonable.  I am very pleased with this mirror.  It is just the right size and the magnification leaves nothing to the imagination.  The outlet in the back is also very practical and a really good plus.  The only disappointment I have is with the lighting - I wish it was brighter on the highest &#x27;day&#x27; setting.  But then again, I like a lot of light!!  Using the mirror in a lighted room solves this issue.</li>
    <li> From the minute it arrived, I was hooked! The light not only helps you see all the things that you&#x27;d sometimes wished you didn&#x27;t see on your face but it also warms up with time which helps to open up your pores! It is wonderful! Even my boyfriend discovered it and sometimes analyses his face! Fantastic buy!</li>
    <li> After looking at at least 12 mirrors, we selected this as a gift and the receiver was very happy.  It arrived in good condition also.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to find a good replacement for my old makeup mirror. I decided to try this one based on the reviews on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased that I did. The mirror is just what I needed. I sit to apply my makeup so the mirror is the right height for that. I love the outlet in the back of the unit, as it is such a convenient addition. The magnification on the flip side works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned the lighting. I use it on the highest light setting consistently, though I have always used makeup mirrors with my bathroom lights on. However, if one has a vanity area for hair/makeup in a bedroom without bright lights, I can see where the mirror&#x27;s lighting may be too dim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase and hope it will last for years to come.</li>
    <li> Great to use for applying makeup and tweezing eyebrows.  Only problem is the lights don&#x27;t last as long as they should.  I&#x27;m on my six set of lights (which I can only find on Amazon).</li>
    <li> The magnified side of the mirror had only one very small spot where you could see clearly.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Mife loves this new mirror, specialy when putting on make up and eye lenses. The 10x magnify makes it easier to see and the light around it helps alot.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I have had not one single problem with it since I received it as a Christmas present two years ago. I am buying one for my daughter this year!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this daily and really likes it.  Two sided mirror with different magnification and the lighting is good. Dimmer switch allows for control of amount of light. Looks nice and is what you will find in quality hotels.</li>
    <li> Had a mirror that looked almost identical and same manufacture....however, this mirror appears cheaply made and the center turn knob came off and had to be put back on.  Even though it feels cheaply made I still like it over others I have seen in stores.</li>
    <li> Perfect Lighting.  Previously had my own ... same mirror ... sent this to my daughter&#x27;s home so I can use it when I fly there to visit.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my dressing table!  Enough light, excellent magnification for tweezng and blading,  easy to keep clean. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was one of many  christmas present for my wife.  She loves the mirror and uses it every single day.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent make up mirror for the price. It is perfect quality and the lighting is enough to allow you flawless makeup-ing potential without making you feel as if you can see every microscopic flaw. It has become a beauty \\&quot;essential.\\&quot; Very impressed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror after using my aunt&#x27;s. I like the double sides and was shocked to see how many eyebrow hairs I had been missing. I use this everyday for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Love the huge magnified mirror side. I can finally see good to put my makeup on. It&#x27;s perfect for just me!</li>
    <li> This was a perfect gift I sent to a friend in October.  These are very nice, I had one also.  Loved it when I needed to see&lt;br /&gt;My hair roots, still not going grey, LOL!  I did not like using this daily, it really shows all the normal eye can not see, I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, searching for past orders, anyone able to get a 2 year History of their account?&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy Amazon.com, help, need gifts fast, seeking one book, I ordered a bunched forgot the author&#x27;s name, need history to order last book for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need the darn books names, please forgive me for the late thank You and review, These can make one self conscience after a couple years, glad I ordered a new one for another female who is mid 20s, they should give a lot of Botox along with this?</li>
    <li> I wound up cutting the cord and using this as a non-lighted mirror because something inside the base broke. I can hear something rattle around and the control knob does not seem to be connected to anything. I have no idea why this happened. I didn&#x27;t drop it and the mirror was used sparingly and with care. I only needed it to shape my brows. Of course, it still works as a mirror and the magnification is perfect for plucking brows. I really wished the light still worked. Conair has failed me the last 3 times I bought their products, so I am just going to buy something else from now on.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, I love it! I saw this mirror at a friends house and loved it.</li>
    <li> The lighting is poor, the edges of the mirror are distorted. You have to be perfectly centered to see clearly with the 10X side. Further the stand is too low, not a proper height for me anyway. I sadly missed the deadline to return this item or I would have:( I found a 20X better lighted mirror, The Sunter Natural Daylight mirror w 10X/1X magnification and it is PERFECT!</li>
    <li> As I age, my eye sight is getting worse and worse.  I had an 8X before I got this one, it was wonderful, had it probably, 8 years or more.  So, when my eyes changed, I felt I needed to get the stronger mirror.  I now have the 10x.  WOW, what a difference.  I can see now.</li>
    <li> when you get older you can not see as good,  But something are better off not to  see that good.  This works great, had use several others and took them  back,  This one is a keeper.  The light is an extra bonus, and the size is a great size you can see your whole face in it if you want to.</li>
    <li> I have had this same one for 10 years. Bought my daughter it for Christmas. She loves it. Replacement bulbs also available via amazon.</li>
    <li> I own one of these and purchased this one for a friend.  Since our eyes are getting older, this makes a big difference in tthe application of makeup and skin care.  Have used mine for years.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The mirror seems to be exactly as described and my mother is very satisfied with it. She highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> The mirror I ordered had an outlet in the base for a hair dryer or curling iron in it.  The one the shipper sent did not.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was extremely rude.  Amazon was wonderful, returned the mirror and received a refund.</li>
    <li> I  searched everywhere for a mirror  with an outlet on the base like my old one, this  one  has one. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> The magnification side is useless. Only the center is clear and you have to sit really close which leaves no room for your hands if you have to pluck or put makeup on. Also it got really hot around the light. Didn&#x27;t feel safe.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the magnify side of the mirror has to be viewed looking dead on or the image is distorted. LOVE the outlet in the back of the mirror!!</li>
    <li> I had this same exact mirror last year but broke it in a housecleaning acciident.  So I replaced it with the same one and got one for my sister as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best around.  Light could be a bit brighter but the magnification level makes up for it.  Solidly built, stays sturdy on your make up dresser.  You make up the cost of this mirror quickly because you can now do your own eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seriously magnifies every flaw.  Be ready.  You might have a love-hate relationship with it in the end.</li>
    <li> The light is not bright enough. Maybe the bulb needs to be replaced but this is brand new. The morror is fine as long as you are in a well lite room.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror. Lighting adjusts easily.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my daughter in law for her birthday. At first, she was taken aback and not too thrilled to see her face magnified 10X, but now she loves it. The light is good and changes settings. It is wonderful!! The price was also great...I looked all over the internet, and this was the best.</li>
    <li> I spent days reading reviews on makeup mirrors, until I came across this one. It was definitely on the pricier end, but I think it was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mirror, has used it everyday, no Issues.</li>
    <li> Not what expected for a true Magnifier Mirror</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Especially the added outlet so I can plug in my heat tools and do hair and makeup without using up outlet space, I had no idea how convenient it was until I had it!</li>
    <li> This is a well designed, sturdy product with a high quality switch, but the light is not very bright.  It would be much better with a high intensity LED type of light system.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good size, very attractive, love the 10X/1X and the outlet on the back, but it just isn&#x27;t bright enough.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I am 60 and LOVE this lighted mirror. I had lasik many years ago and that, coupled with aging, has done a number on my close-up vision. This mirror fixes that! I am surprised at the comments that complain about the lack of light - I find it to be fine, although I always have either natural light or additional light on in my bedroom when I use it. I have blond eye lashes and eyebrows so being in control of mascara and eyebrow color is imperative for me - need to be able to detect those little smudges and flecks that always seem to happen. The combination of the light and the magnification insure that they&#x27;re applied properly and also (very important!) not overdone.  I use the plain side with my glasses on to be sure that the total job was done right - so easy to flip it from one side to the other. Have had it for 2 years - never a blip...thinking of getting 2 more for my daughters.</li>
    <li> Pros: Good size, nice make up mirror, good magnification&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Light is not so bright and the you need to be real close to the mirror to see anything properly with 10x magnification.  That is why I took out 1 star</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the height. It&#x27;s too short on my bathrm counter to use while I stand. If you plan on sitting the height may be OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is too strong to use. I feel a little sick to my stomach if I look at the magnified side. I wanted alot of detail and I&#x27;m old enough I can&#x27;t see well but that is really too much. It ends up on my counter not being used at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light isn&#x27;t that bright so only if you need a little light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty and sturdy.</li>
    <li> The magnifier mirror is horrible. I loved my last Conair magnifying mirror but hate this one. The regular side is fine but the other side is distorted.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months -- had to replace the one I LOVED after husband broke it and was scared I wouldn&#x27;t like it as much.  I like this so much more.  The magnifying is perfect for someone who can&#x27;t see close up.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my bathroom lights are very warm and wanted a bright white light for makeup application, it was not white or bright enough to simulate light through a window and after only five months of use, the light shorted out yesterday.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my daughter in law for her birthday. At first, she was taken aback and not too thrilled to see her face magnified 10X, but now she loves it. The light is good and changes settings. It is wonderful!! The price was also great...I looked all over the internet, and this was the best.</li>
    <li> Great design, great lighting and great price but....I bought this for the magnification and unless you find the sweet spot in the mirror, everything else is one big blur. Trying to figure out if I want to get used to it or find something else.</li>
    <li> The Conair Illuminations Makeup mirror is an entirely satisfactory mirror for applying makeup.  I especially like that it has an electrical outlet in the base for my hairdryer.  The magnified side is almost \\&quot;too magnified\\&quot;, it&#x27;s possible to see every pore on your face.  My only complaint is that I feel as though the bulbs could be brighter.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;She says she is happy with it but the metal joining the shaft and&lt;br /&gt;base was not fully meshing causing a wobble. She wanted this&lt;br /&gt;model and she will live with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for a great price. Love the magnification side and light. It does get a little warm with extended use...</li>
    <li> This is the second mirror I bought. It arrived damaged but I bought one at the store and it&#x27;s beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t really look like nickel. It looks more sterling silver to me.</li>
    <li> For the price should have been better quality (looks cheap). The 10x side you have to be to close to the mirror to see your face. Feels like a fun house mirror until you find the right spot(makes me dizzy).  The 1x side is good and I like the plug in back.</li>
    <li> I love it !! Is perfect for me I&#x27;m more than 40 and Now I need fit when I do my make up</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She used one in Wendover and said how much she liked it so I went to Amazon and purchased it.  The shipping was timely I always recommend Amazon to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, use both sides, the brightness is just perfect, will buy again (if I drop it like i dropped my last one) oops</li>
    <li> I would recommend this makeup mirror to anyone that needs the magnification to see to put on their makeup.  If you don&#x27;t need magnification, you can flip it over to a regular mirror.  I use the plug in the back of the mirror for heating up my curling iron while doing my makeup.  I give this 4 1/2 stars simply because I wish the light was a bit brighter; however, it is very doable the way it is!  I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my God Daughter and she just loves it. It has several settings and make it easy for her to do her makeup under the right lights</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this mirror one day.  At first, I was disappointed because you have to get so close because of the 10x magnification.  I might be happier with a 7 or 8 so I can get back a little, but now that I&#x27;m getting used to it, it seems my makeup went on flawlessly, especially if someone isn&#x27;t looking at it magnified!  I like the lighting because since you do have to get so close, I think it might hurt your eyes if it were brighter, at least it would hurt mine.  But overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had another make up mirror that you touch to light up and what a pain that was.  This knob is in a great spot and the mirror is great.  Very well made and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This Conair 10X mirror was bought as a gift for our daughter (in her 40s).  It&#x27;s just like the one I have and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with mine.  She likes it, too.  Seems to be very well made.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing a make up mirror.  A lot of factors came into play...magnification, lighting, size....etc.  After purchasing, I can say that I am very happy wit the Conair Makeup Mirror.  I love the amount of light it provides, and the magnification is perfect.  It also has such a nice feature of an additional plug in the back which has come in very handy for plugging my flat iron into.  I really like this mirror and would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Wife bought this over 15 years ago.  I occasionally put a new bulb in for her.  Doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll ever break.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s great!  The lighting has a adjustable feature, you decide what setting you want.  The stronger 10x magnified mirror is also is great.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Mirror as described. Pretty, looks nice in the bathroom. Mirrored area is a nice size, two different magnifications. Nice to have the different levels of light. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror, however the magnifying side is a little strong for putting on makeup. I really like&lt;br /&gt;the satin finish, though.</li>
    <li> The product looks great and mirror is helpful. The light around the rim is not that great and you need other lights for better visibility!</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  I especially like the side that makes your face bigger or should I say the magnified side.  I have looked all over for one comparable but could not find one with this much magnification.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mirror.  It is made well, Has numerose varied lighting settings, four I believe.  Easy to control manual switch.  One side of mirror is regular and the other is 10X magnified.  It also has an electrical outlet in the base if you want to use a hair dryer, curling iron, or straightening iron.  You will be pleased with this mirror.</li>
    <li> I used this in the Palazzo in Vegas and loved it, so I found the product on Amazon and love it. It has a switch for day, night, and in between for the correct lighting</li>
    <li> I was replacing my old one that I loved. The lighting is good on this one, butnthenquality of the mirror is not nearly as good as my old one.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family or just anyone who asked about the quality and use. I saw every bump etc on my face and the light give a great luminous look when recording in front of the mirror (for you you-tubers).</li>
    <li> My friend was thrilled with the mirror as she just had cataract surgery and this is great for seeing up close for makeup</li>
    <li> Looks very nice in my bathroom. As in other reviews, I agrees the light could be a little brighter but it works just fine. Hopefully it will hold up.</li>
    <li> The main thing I love about this product is that I can finally see to put on my makeup! The lighting and magnification meet in perfect balance. It is everything I expected and more!</li>
    <li> This is the one Kyle Richards uses religiously in Real Housewives whenever she&#x27;s primping or getting ready on shoots. Since this would be my first mirror, I wanted to rely on her choice since it seems to have lasted her a few seasons now! Sturdy, attractive, and glamorous!</li>
    <li> I love how I can have different light settings! The magnifying side is a bit strong but it&#x27;s great because you can spot anything easily. I do wish the cord was a bit longer but besides that it works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has always wanted one for shaving, etc. because our favorite hotel has a similar one.  Well, when I saw how great it was for seeing those pesky stray eyebrows hairs, etc. it immediately made it&#x27;s way into my bathroom &amp; that&#x27;s where it has stayed.  Sorry honey!</li>
