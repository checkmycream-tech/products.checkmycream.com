<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Actually works! Was skeptical but found it does work very well.</li>
    <li> I find it to be a good product.  It is refreshing and lingering.  It seems to help with my dry mouth through most of the night.  Wish it would be more lasting till morning.</li>
    <li> Very effective for dry mouth days and even tastes OK.</li>
    <li> The calcium in this mouthwash helps restore your enamel. I have a front-facing chip in my bottom-front tooth and this is the only mouthwash that has helped make it less noticeable. Not to mention the nice non-drying nature of it, safe to use before bed, you won&#x27;t wake up with a dry mouth and realize you have horrible halitosis. Listerine and other mouthwashes dry out your mouth and can actually make your breath worse. This mouthwash has natural saliva enzymes which eradicate the glucose and calicum to restore enamel. It&#x27;s expensive but worth the money.</li>
    <li> Biotene has been a lifesaver for me since it first came out, it really works, I take some meds that dry out my mouth, dry mouth is real bad for your teeth, your teeth need saliva washing over them to keep the germs out of your mouth and teeth. They just reformulated it and to me ,it tastes different, does not do the job it used too. It looks almost the same, but it does say something different on front of bottle, and the ingredients are changed. I was happy tonight, I found an old bottle in a CVS, old formula. I bought a big bottle, I am good for a month. It also upset my stomach, I notice that it does not have aloe anymore and it has sorbitol, I do not think it has all 3 enzymes that it had before. Just watch and see how it does for you, I will have to find something new.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t buy this size many places, it&#x27;s not cheap in stores and if you have to use it 3X&#x27;s a day, this was a great find.  Came sealed and I bought 3 at a time.  Makes my dentist happy!</li>
    <li> has dry moth secondary to meds, he loves it and uses 2x per day, he loves it and says it really helps</li>
    <li> I for the last 7 years I have LOVED this product, that changed last night when I opened my new bottle.  Imagine my surprise when I noticed that the flavor was different, and I had a slightly stinging sensation in my mouth which Biotene had never caused before.  I checked the bottle to make sure I had purchased the right formula and then double checked it against my old bottle.  Yes, it was the right type of Biotene, UPC matched on both bottles, BUT the formula has changed.  It now no longer contains the beneficial enzymes that the old formula contained and it makes the claim of \\&quot;NEW Improved pH Balance\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old ingredients: PURIFIED WATER, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, XYITOL, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, POLOXAMER 407, HYDROXYETHYL CELLULOSE, SODIUM BENZOATE, FLAVOR (peppermint oil), benzoic acid, disodium phosphate, zinc gluconate, lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, potassium thiocyanate, aloe vera gel, calcium lactate, glucose oxidase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New ingredients:  PURIFIED WATER, glycerine, XYITOL, sorbitol, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, POLOXAMER 407, SODIUM BENZOATE, HYDROXYETHYL CELLULOSE, methylparaben, propylparaben, FLAVOR, sodium phosphate, disodium phosphate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients that are the same in both forumulas I wrote in all caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I liked the old formula a lot better.  If I asked nicely, alright it I begged, do you think they&#x27;d change it back?</li>
    <li> The best for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Use for throat cancer</li>
    <li> When you sleep and breath, like I do, through your mouth, you might as I do awake with dry mouth. This product solves that. It also feels refreshing after I brush my teeth. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the mouth wash and the price is great.  My only complaint was that it arrived damaged in the box because they did not but any packing at all in the box, and it was able to move around during shipping which cracked the top of the mouth wash container.  luckily it was a small crack and it ended up leaking a little less than 1/4 of its contents into the box.  .</li>
    <li> Simply put, biotene helps with dry mouth and it also helps to keep your mouth clean and healthy.  At least it has helped my family.  I had trouble with my gums and my dentist recommended I start using biotene every morning before brushing and every evening as well.  It has stopped the problems I was having, so I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.  I plan to order the toothpaste today from Amazon, too.</li>
    <li> MY DENTIST RECCOMMENDED THIS BRAND TO ME FOR MY DRY MOUTH WHICH HE SAYS CAN LEAD TO TOOTH DECAY. I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> there is a problem i find with this product... aside from not being able to destroy biofilm...    you have to keep using this product daily in order to have good saliva flow through out the day, now ive been using this product for 2 weeks i dont have dry mouth    but if i stop using this for 4 days my mouth feels a little dry and i guess your mouth cant sustain those \\&quot;protective\\&quot; enzymes.. they claim to revive your mouths natural saliva production and fend off bacterial intruders...</li>
    <li> excellent for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> This product has been recommended to me by a number of hygienists and dentists.  I fail to see why it is so recommended.  The taste is icky sweet and it has a strange gluey consistency that is unpleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work that well either.</li>
    <li> Great price and need it everyday. Dentist  said i need it this for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash for several years.  It was recommended by my dentist because of my dry mouth.  I love it and find that using it cleans my mouth and leaves it feeling good.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this mouthwash to relieve dry mouth, which resulted from the allergy meds I take. For those who don&#x27;t know, dry mouth encourages tooth decay. I can&#x27;t say yet whether it has affected my rate of tooth decay, but I can comment on the product&#x27;s sensory appeal. It has a pleasant taste and mouth feel, with no burning astringent feel like some other mouthwashes. The price was a few pennies more than in local stores. Amazon shipping was free. If I had had to pay shipping, I probably would have bought locally.</li>
    <li> Prescribed by Doctor aids the problem as suggested.</li>
    <li> Really works for those of us with dry mouth at night, which I developed several months ago.</li>
    <li> This product is very helpful. I with my dentist had recommended it years ago, perhaps I wouldn&#x27;t have needed periodontal work when I did.</li>
    <li> Helps a lot with the dry mouth and the price for the 33 oz size is the same or less than Target charges for their 16 oz size.</li>
    <li> I had this item sent to a friend. He advised me that it had leaked all over the inside packaging. When he unscrewed the top, the silver seal was missing which could mean it was tampered with!!  He threw the bottle out since it was all wet and a mess.   There is no way I can have this rectified by Amazon&#x27;s system of returns so I guess i&#x27;ll have to eat the little loss.  I have never had this happen anywhere.   I use the product and would rate it 4 stars. But I will be extra careful of the lid cover.</li>
    <li> Good product. They recently changed the taste . I don&#x27;t like it as well.</li>
    <li> I recently switched my anti-depressant medication and one of the lingering side-effects has been dry mouth. I never thought dry mouth was that big of a deal until I had it EVERY DAY. After thinking it would just go away, my mouth started to really bother me and I started reading up on remedies for dry mouth. At this point, switching medications isn&#x27;t an option, so I had to find a solution to this annoying side effect. I read about Biotene on Amazon.com and saw that it got good reviews. I went to Target and purchased a pretty sizable $5 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only mouthwash I&#x27;d ever used before was Listerene, so I prepared myself for the assault on my mouth. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find out Biotene isn&#x27;t harsh at all! It&#x27;s kind-of sweet and very gentle feeling. I swished it around in my mouth for 60 seconds and it was completely tolerable. After I spit it out, my mouth felt fresh and immediately, I could notice the dry mouth feeling going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every day and my dry mouth is no more! At the cost of $5 per bottle, this is 100% worth it. I have no complaints whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist and it&#x27;s nice to find it at a competitive price on Amazon.  This is best mouthwash whether you have dry mouth or not.</li>
    <li> Feels slightly oily in the mouth and not the most pleasant taste, although it doesn&#x27;t taste nasty either. I have noticed I don&#x27;t wake up three times a night to drink water, now just once or twice, so maybe it&#x27;s working. My dentist recommended it. The bottle is huge.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn at all when you&#x27;re using it. Has a pleasant, sweet taste. I have very dry mouth in the morning and this really helps quite a bit. A very large bottle at a good price. Leaves you feeling very fresh as well.</li>
    <li> Really helps with dry mouth</li>
    <li> Prefer to other treatments.</li>
    <li> I use the subscription service for my wife.   Works out very well.  She has to use this mouth wash.</li>
    <li> My wife and I were given some samples of this stuff to try. I would guess that it works if you have some kind of medical condition that requires it, but it&#x27;s pretty close to the nastiest thing I&#x27;ve ever had in my mouth. And I&#x27;m not all that picky--I even like the taste of Waffle House food. This product feels like a mouthful of runny petroleum jelly and tastes disgusting. I thought I was going to gag.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping thanks! Package arrived without much damage...needs a little more tape next time.</li>
    <li> Got this for a care package for my mom before she started chemo. It&#x27;s been a great product for her to have on hand and the price was better than my local target and walmart, so it was a great buy with free shipping.</li>
    <li> Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash is a great and healthy mouthwash to use, especially when you&#x27;re suffering from dry mouth. Dehydration, diabetes, antihistamines, diuretics and many other common medications may cause dry mouth. This can lead to bad breath, gum disease, and damage to the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is alcohol free, unlike most mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth has become dry since I&#x27;ve been on decongestant medicine. Biotene Mouthwash is an oral lubricant which also helps inhibit harmful bacteria. It helps the overall health of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps loosen plaque formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tablespoon swish around the mouth for a minute gives me a fresh, minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my dentist and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this mouthwash without hesitation to anyone with drymouth.</li>
    <li> I suffer from a dry mouth due to medications, and my doctor had suggested I try biotene to help.  Unfortunately, it does nothing to relieve the dry mouth, and instead, it leaves me with a bad taste, too.  I can&#x27;t complain, though, about the condition of the product or the rapidness of its arrival -- both were more than adequate.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist.  It is perfect for anyone with dry mouth issues or anyone who wants to avoid alcohol.  It does not contain any harsh irritants or alcohol.  If you have sensitive mouth or gum issues, you can avoid further irritation by using Biotene. I hate very sweet or very strong mouthwashes.  This is not overly sweet or strong.  This large size bottle is convenient and you can transfer a smaller amount to a different or designer bottle for your vanity.  This has a squirt top so you can just squirt directly from the bottle into your mouth without contaminating the top. I would call it a mouth rinse rather than a mouth wash because a few swishes quickly eliminate dry mouth, freshen your mouth, and do not irritate your mouth or gums. Since it is alcohol free, it is safe for children and recovering alcoholics. This is a great product and I will never buy another mouthwash.</li>
    <li> moistens mouth during night helps stop dry mouth</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes my breath feel fresh and its good for your gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Biotene and Oasis and Biotene seems to keep my mouth hydrated for longer. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one for now.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with severe dry mouth due to taking antihistamines, so I have been using this mouthwash for a couple of months to combat the dryness and its side effect, a receding gumline. It has a pleasant, minty taste, with a consistency somewhere between a gel and a liquid. I like that it has natural ingredients like peppermint and enzymes that are naturally present in saliva. I also like that it is alcohol free, as most traditional, alcohol-based mouth rinses did nothing to alleviate my dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene does not completely cure my dry mouth, but it does help. Used before bed, its moisturizing effects generally last for 6-8 hours. I have also found that gargling with it works wonders for a sore throat. The best part is that you can use this mouthwash as often as you like, with no harmful side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble with dry mouth, you should definitely give this product a try. The gel form would probably work even better, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to find it in my local drug or super stores (although Amazon carries it).</li>
    <li> Biotene is a wonderful product.  Have used for a long time and am sure glad I found it.  It cleans the mouth but does not burn like so many mouthwashes.  Also keeps the mouth from getting dry.</li>
    <li> The new formula, which contains none of the enzymes they claimed did the job, simply does not work for me. Years ago, Biotene practically saved my life by preventing the ongoing pain I was experiencing due to severe dry mouth. Why did the formula change? How were you planning to improve a product that was already so highly regarded? Are you saving money by using new ingredients? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, go back to the old stuff. In the meantime, I&#x27;m looking for something similar to the old formula, and if anybody has any suggestions I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
    <li> I have M-S and my medications (for bladder issues and anti-depressants) tend to make my mouth dry all of the time, which is one cause for tooth decay.  This product tastes good, refreshing and helps alleviate the dry mouth symptoms from my medications.</li>
    <li> I take medication that causes moderate dry mouth.  I have heard people say wonderful things about this product so I thought I would try it out.  If I am having a casual day at home with minimal need to speak, it works okay.  Unfortunately, my dry mouth is worst when I am coaching soccer and need to direct my players, or I am in need to speak more than usual.  In these cases, the rinse did not work at all for me</li>
    <li> Yucky taste and left a dry film in my mouth.</li>
    <li> the rinse was coming out the top biotene bottle when I open the box ,but not lot</li>
    <li> Love the Biotene products!!! use them religiously and it keeps my mouth irritations away!</li>
    <li> I  liked it very much, thought is was pricey though,  is there any store that I can buy it in ?</li>
    <li> It helps dry mouth conditions, but be aware it doesn&#x27;t kill germs.  Don&#x27;t drink it straight out of the bottle, it gets contaminated.  My family tends to think it&#x27;s an antiseptic mouthwash when it&#x27;s not, hence the reason for four stars.  I had to purchase Dixie cup dispensers for all bathrooms and instruct family to use a dixie cup EVERY time they use this.</li>
    <li> My husband had radiation on his throat for lymph node cancer.  The radiation made his mouth and throat very dry and this seems to help a lot.  He carries a small bottle with him at all times.</li>
    <li> Buy for my Mom who loves the dry mouth relief</li>
    <li> Best product for people who Snore!!!</li>
    <li> Great for dry mouth due to medications.</li>
    <li> The new Biotene is OK, but old formula left my mouth feeling moistened and fresh.  No doubt I&#x27;ll get used t new taste (seems more spearminty) but mouth and lips felt more moisturized with OLD formula for me.  Will look in local stores for older stock.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a new dentist I choose because my previous one gave me some feedback that I did not trust.&lt;br /&gt; My new dentist, knowing that I have a continual dry mouth issue, highly advised me to try Biotene.  I am so very grateful I have.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful product, keeps my mouth from having a horrid taste, and makes it feel refreshed.  I use it at least 5 times daily,&lt;br /&gt;and especially at bedtime so when I wake up in the morning my mouth does not feel totally dry, and does not have a smelly taste&lt;br /&gt;in my mouth.  This product does a great deal more than help with the dry mouth issue, and when I have dental cleaning checkups&lt;br /&gt;it certainly shows.  THANK YOU.  Jan C</li>
    <li> My husband recommended this because he used to need it years ago and he said it worked for him. However, it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I used it so many times a day and it didn&#x27;t help in the slightest. Maybe my medication makes my dry mouth too severe, I don&#x27;t know. Unfortunately I have like four bottles of this crap to go through because three were given to me from hubby&#x27;s parents. Ugh.   It tastes fine though and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in MY mouth like other reviewers have said. At least, the taste it leaves isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as the taste my dry mouth causes. It&#x27;s thick, which is weird, and it&#x27;s annoying how you have to squirt it out of the cap so I&#x27;m glad I had one of those old mini medicine cups lying around.</li>
    <li> Although this product is not really marketed for this purpose, I have found that it is quite helpful in preventing canker sores with regular muse. I often bite or nick the inside of my mouth and if I rinse a couple times a day right after, it will sometimes heal instead of forming a canker sore. That is weeks of pain avoidance for me and almost never happened before I found this product. It is not 100%, but is a very good improvement. It is also pleasant and refreshing to use.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dentist for dry mouth and it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Excellent if you get dry mouth from medications.  Fresh taste, not alcohol like aftertaste.  However I can&#x27;t always find it on Amazon sadly.</li>
    <li> If you need to use a non drying mouthwash then Biotene Oran Rinse is a great product to use. It tastes great and works well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse for many years and loved the product.  It was always gentle and effective.  Imagine my surprise when I tried my most recent purchase and it caused my mouth to burn so badly that I had to rinse it out. There was also a strong \\&quot;minty\\&quot; smell that was not there before.  I bought another lot thinking it was a lot problem but it was the same.  I am deeply saddened that I cannot use this product any more and wonder what I will do.  Also I am miffed that I paid big bucks for two bottles of Biotene that I can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would a company make a horrible change like this.  It is new product development gone horribly awry. People with dry mouth also often have a very sensitive mouth.  DUH.  Lets make a product that our customer base can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the the company posted a response to one of the amazon reviews saying call us and let us know about your problem.  I called twice today and after waiting over ten minutes each time gave up.  I then sent two emails, neither of which have been answered.  So much for their caring and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Since I had to stop using the reformulated Biotene Mouthwash because it caused terrible burning I have developed serious problems in my mouth.  Five years of using Biotene with great success and now I am in trouble. Set adrift without notice to try and find another product that might work. How can a company ignore its loyal customers, people who depend on them, and reformualte so drastically a product that worked so well for so many people for so many years.  When I finally got through to customer service, after many minutes of waiting on many tries, their answer was basically tough luck. Don&#x27;t support a company that would do this.  There are other products out there, or at least I hope so.</li>
    <li> Great product works for at least 3-4 hours very well</li>
    <li> Not that effective I would say.as my title says, I purchased this product and used it for about a week. the taste  although not the worst is not that pleasant and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It also did not work that well to resolve the dry mouth problems. I would say it would work for a couple of hours and then the treatment would have to be repeated. My suggestion to people with dry mouth is to get either gum or candy (Sugarless or not) to chew on and suck on to create their own saliva.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I get this product when I told him I was waking up with a dry mouth every morning and after getting this and using it nightly, I&#x27;ve not had the problem any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the cap design.  The small nozzle makes it hard to pour into a cup as it shoots out fast and can get all over the counter top but I still give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> it tastes great and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;No alcohol products are good for your health. And I&#x27;d love to pay more for such a non-alcohol mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry mouth sufferers!!</li>
    <li> I have sjogrens and this helps a bit.</li>
    <li> help moisturize mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Biotene mouthwash for dry mouth and was very happy with the product. Yesterday I bought a new bottle and rinsed with it last night. It left a terrible taste in my mouth....and rinsed it out with water. I checked the bottle and sure enough, they changed the formula. It&#x27;s GROSS. That&#x27;s progress??</li>
    <li> This product has changed it&#x27;s formula.  The label was deceptively changed to look the same, when actually it is a different product.  It no longer works for me.  This is not the same product I was using.  I no longer recommend this product.  Before the changes were made it was great.  I was disappointed when I bought the same bottle only to find a different  and ineffective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Biotene&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Propylene Glycol, Xylitol, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Poloxamer 407, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Benzoate, Flavor (Peppermint Oil), Benzoic Acid, Disodium Phosphate, Zinc Gluconate, Lactoferrin, Lysozyme, Lactoperoxidase, Potassium Thiocyanate, Aloe Vera Gel, Calcium Lactate, Glucose Oxidase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Biotene&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Glycerine, Xylitol, Sorbitol, Propylene, Glycol, Poloxamer 407, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Flavor, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate</li>
    <li> Yes I want to keep my teeth and not have to get anything but my natural teeth. It really is what my dentist wants me to use.</li>
    <li> Do you have Dry Mouth? You need to know it needs to be managed. Why? Because if untreated can lead to fairly serious dental problems. While sipping water may help, it doesn&#x27;t protect ur mouth the way saliva does. There is smth better- BIOTENE-with its protein-enzyme formulations, offers help in 3 management areas. a-Soothe &amp; Moisturize  b-Daily cleaning as mouth rinse    source: danodentalarts dot com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry mouth problems from asthma medications for quite a while.  This product really did very little for that problem, and did little to clean my teeth either.  The taste was ok, but I really hate this product because the adds for it are everywhere saying it is so effective, dentists and doctors all say \\&quot;its sooo effective, yeah yeah have you tried Biotene yet?\\&quot;  There&#x27;s better treatments, like candy or gum.</li>
    <li> It absolutely is the best.  I recommend it to anyone with dry mouth.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my doctor to prevent thrush which can result from inhaler use. It has worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> I suffered with dry mouth for years due to medication side effects.  It is amazing how much discomfort dry mouth can cause from minor irritation to sensitive tongue and you are much more susceptible to canker sores and other discomforts.  Your mouth can become so dry it hurts to swallow and over time the minor discomforts become more severe as they did for me.  This mouthwash is a miracle worker and indeed does all it claims.  It provides the enzymes necessary to produce saliva in the mouth which helps dry mouth as well as coats the inside of the mouth to help alleviate any pain or discomfort.  With continued use your dry mouth and symptoms will definitely be under control.  And the mouthwash taste is very good and is very soothing.  It contains no alcohol and also provides all the benefits of a regular mouthwash like relieving bad breath as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry mouth I highly recommend you give this product a try.  You will be very pleased.  I also recommend the Biotene toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Interesting to me that though I only remember to use this once per day it has helped very much with my dry mouth problem.  I use it first thing in the morning and find it pleasant to use overall.  Yes, it has glycerin so is a bit slippery in the mouth, but not overly so, the taste and fragrance are mild and overall I am very happy with the results.  I will try to remember to use it more often to increase the benefit.....</li>
    <li> This new and improved product is not the Biotene product that many have relied upon in the past. As an oral cancer patient I was subjected to a blast of Radiation to my mouth which essentially killed my saliva glands. This was the only product that helped for an extended period of time. Recently GSK has changed the formula of all the Biotene products to make it neutral ph. As a result the Enzymes that actually made it unique and useful are all gone. GSK has added nothing of value to the product. If you are still paying the very high cost of this product stop, compare the label, save your money.  This appears to be all about bottom line profits and to hell with the people that actually needed this for a decent quality of life.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it! I tried ACT dry mouth and hated the aftertaste. I came back to Biotene and.....the same awful aftertaste! I wrote to the company asking if they had changed it, thinking I must be &amp;#34;losing it.&amp;#34; Unfortunately they confirmed that they HAD changed it! I PRAY they go back to the original flavor, because it now has a terrible aftertaste! I have to rinse my mouth after using it to get the taste out of my mouth! SO disappointed!</li>
    <li> Biotene rinse&lt;br /&gt;Itt has reaslly helped my dry mouth. It gives my mouth a clean and fresh feeling. Maude Holston I reccomend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> In addition to its commendable mouth wash/dry mouth capability, this is an excellent prevenative for pipe smokers as a remedy for tongue bite.  I use it on a regular basis to combat dry mouth and periodically anytime I&#x27;ve over-smoked my pipe.  For new pipe smokers suffering from bouts of tongue bite this will help.  This is a nop notch product for its&#x27; intended use, with a bonus capability to soothe an irritated tongue.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mouthwash.  So refreshing and moisturizing</li>
    <li> I believe this works just as well as the expensive ph balancing stuff I buy from my dentist, and I don&#x27;t appear to have allergies to this the same way I do to that.  It leaves a strange film in your mouth that takes some getting used to but really helps dry mouth, especially at night if you take allergy meds like I do.</li>
    <li> Would just like to make others who use and depend on Biotene know the original Biotene formula has changed.  Many of you are probably already aware if you&#x27;ve tried and were surprised by the horrible taste and burning sensation their new formula causes.  The new formula DOES NOT include the beneficial enzymes it once did.  I called the makers of this product, Glaxo Smith Kline and was told they have no plans to bring back the old formula.  I asked them why they made such a change.  The young lady on the other end of the line was not able to fully answer my question, other than to offer up that the formula was changed to make it more PH friendly.  She stated the new formula was more in-line with the human mouth&#x27;s PH level.  She also suggested that the new formula would be more beneficial for dry mouth.  I explained to her I suffered from a condition called Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, which causes severe and sensitive dry mouth amongst other things.  I told her the new formula does not work as well as the old formula did for my Sjogren&#x27;s!  When questioned further about the enzyme removal, she had no answer at all. She sounded robotic, as if she were reading from a script card.  I told her they just lost another customer, as the new formula is going in the bin.  She said they would mail me a refund, so that&#x27;s that.  Sad their loyal customer&#x27;s who have used and relied on this product for many years will now have to find another alternative.</li>
    <li> They took out the beneficial enzymes, which was the main reason biotene worked originally. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m stuck with 2 bottles of this because i didn&#x27;t check before I bought it. Time to look for another brand with the good enzymes in it.</li>
    <li> I am a registered dental hygienist working in California.  Ever since biotene changed their formula I&#x27;ve had patients complain that it no longer works for them, their parents, or other loved ones.  Patients that have been using biotene for years are now having frequent aphthous ulcers, where with the old formula, they rarely had them.  Dry mouth is a serious oral problem that leads to destruction of the oral hard and soft tissues.  Not to mention, it lowers ones quality of life.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by brand loyalty.  Sometimes, it&#x27;s the big names that are the most deceiving.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY WORK IF YOU HAVE DRY MOUTH SYMPTOMS DUE FROM MEDICINE. THE TASTE IS NOT THEY MAD.I WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for people with dry mouth problems. This is the only product I use and find it very, very  helpful.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot; Biotene and absolutely HATED it! My gums burned, tongue swelled and became numb and the taste was that of cough syrup. I was told that Biotene plans to change all its products to this formula and I am here to BEG Biotene to please keep the old formula. I have been a long time fan of Biotene and attribute my good oral health to it for managing my severe dry mouth. However, these changes have made the product completely unusable. I am totally dependent upon this product and so I tried this new product numerous times but each time these negative reactions ocurred. I know Biotene said it is trying to make the product closer to \\&quot;natural saliva\\&quot; with these formula changes. But what good are these changes if the product is unusable? I am fairly certain natural saliva doesn&#x27;t cause burning on the gums and swelling and numbing of the tongue or taste like cough syrup. The old formula worked beautifully, was gentle, moisturizing and had a fresh mint taste. Who wants oral pain and the non-kissable taste of cough syrup at bedtime? I All I can do now is stock up on the old version and start to look for another product. I regret leaving Biotene as I loved the product and its benefits to my oral health but regrettably I must. Please Biotene, bring back the old version! As the old saying goes \\&quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mouth wash--have been using it for ten years ever since my oncologist recommended it when I was taking chemo.</li>
    <li> Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mouthwash because it was alcohol free, but my brother actually has dry mouth and he thinks it&#x27;s amazing! He thought he would have to suffer with dry mouth forever, but the simple solution was Biotene. He thanked me for introducing him to this product and his dry mouth has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash does not burn (as long as all toothpaste/gunk is washed out first) and it leaves your mouth feeling refreshed. The flavor isn&#x27;t the greatest but it is pretty good. And I don&#x27;t care that it is 3 times more expensive than most brands. It truly works and is worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to stress that Biotene did not cure my brother&#x27;s dry mouth, but it improved his dry mouth. To cure it, you must see a doctor, but Biotene is a supplemental fix. We both still use it 1 year later and have not had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the squirt top because it makes the mouthwash easy to use---just squeeze the bottle. No mess, no clean up and no back wash (for those of you who normally put mouth directly on container)...</li>
    <li> Product is as expected and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Recommend for chemo mouth care</li>
    <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s and I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Works well for mouth issue</li>
    <li> I use this for my dry mouth symptoms and it does help some.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this new formula is worse than using nothing. It leaves a metallic taste in my mouth and now food even tastes metallic. I am returning all the biotene products I have and am looking for another brand. I am very sad because, like so many others, I really loved the old biotene. I do not understand why they would change the formula without testing and learning what a failure the new biotene is. I also believe Glaxo Smith Kline is extremely irresponsible in removing a product that so many people need.</li>
    <li> A smooth and comforting rinse for ones mouth......would buy again</li>
    <li> The recent change in the product formula was not an improvement. There are no longer enzymes in the product and the flavor has changed. Glycerin is now the second ingredient listed and the rinse is thin and watery. The new rinse stings my sensitive mouth.  I had just ordered in two new bottles and now I am stuck with a product i can&#x27;t use. I have an old bottle and a new bottle and compared the ingredients and there are other changes also.  Why change a perfect product?</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. No changes in dry mouth. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> A standard product for people who can&#x27;t take alcohol-based mouthwashes. It&#x27;s rather expensive, but we have not found a cheaper substitute.</li>
    <li> When you use as much Biotene as we do in this household, getting it for a great price is wonderful, and the convenience can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> Very good product medications dry my mouth out terribly and biotene really works very well.</li>
    <li> Biotene Oral Rinse is an essential product if you have persistent dry mouth. Although there are less pricey store brands on the market, I&#x27;ve found the Biotene products to be far more effective. I use this as a rinse before going to sleep and during the night if I wake up. I also use this rinse and the gum before exercising. Although there isn&#x27;t much that can be done for dry mouth, this line of products does ease the discomfort. I also use the gel and toothpaste; products I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son whom lives in a different state.  I think it is helping his dry mouth. So, kinda hard to rate this..He is using it everyday. The toothpaste is good as well because he gets canker sores and hopefully, this will help also.  That is all I know now cause I don&#x27;t need to use it except I did purchanse your toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Suffer from dry mouth as a side effect of a medication. When I use Biotene I get a good deal of relief from this problem.</li>
    <li> I use it every night after I brush my teeth.  I use a Cpap.</li>
    <li> My dad has terribly dry mouth because of his chemo treatments--this works wonders for him!</li>
    <li> This stuff used to be king. The old formula is a 6 out of 5 stars. Was the only mouthwash I used. Had a natural refreshing mint taste that didn&#x27;t burn and worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the new formula is gross. When I first got a new bottle I thought there was something wrong with it. I returned it for a new bottle and same thing. Then I checked the ingredients and almost started crying. They removed the aloe vera gel, replaced with nasty chemicals you should avoid. The mint flavor tastes like chemicals now, and there is burning that never used to exist before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the quality ingredients have been removed and replaced with crap. It is sad but all good things come to an end I suppose. Sadly I will have to try and find a new mouthwash that will get the job done, because frankly, the new formula doesn&#x27;t even come close to the old one and it is clear they are lowering the quality in hopes to make more money.</li>
    <li> i found out the hard way about Biotene and reflux suggest you google Biotene and  GERD before using. GERD is Acid reflux</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product as recommended by my dentist and have nothing but good things and checkups since. No chance I&#x27;m stopping now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both this and the gel paste and honestly neither work well nor last.  I don&#x27;t care about the taste -- it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; at all</li>
    <li> This product contains parabens which are known carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.  I contacted Biotene countless times and they refused to comment on this. By the CVS brand instead</li>
    <li> Yes, this is Biotene and yes it is for dry mouth however, it is not the PDF formula.  The Biotene products have worked very well for me and this will as well however, I am of the opinion the PDF formula is even better.</li>
    <li> I take many medications that cause dry mouth. But I began one, two months ago, that is necessary for living but the dry mouth was driving me insane. I guess that the severity didn&#x27;t really hit me until last week and I ordered the Biotene oral rinse (this product), spray and gel. When the rinse and spray arrived this morning I tried this product, the oral rinse, first. I rinsed for 30 seconds, as recommended, and my dry mouth went away immediately – IMMEDIATELY!!! It was 3 ½ hours before I felt the dry mouth returning and I tried the spray. I couldn&#x27;t get the entire mouth coverage with the spray as I did the rinse. I should get the gel later this week and ucompare all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% sold on this Biotene oral rinse – I&#x27;m going to look around Amazon to see if I can find some small plastic bottles that I can use to keep the rinse at the ready. The quantity required is so small (1 tablespoon) that the bottle need not be large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it looks as if I won&#x27;t need to take yet another prescription for dry mouth. This oral rinse brings instant and lasting relief.</li>
    <li> When my mouth is dry I also lose my sense of taste. Biotene restores moisture to my mouth and my sense of taste is greatly improved. I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> This rinse is a medical necessity for me.  My dentist recommended it because I am taking meds that dry my mouth out.  You will get cavities in short order if your mouth is dry of saliva.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for anyone who has to take a lot of medications or is a chemo patient. Totally helped my mouth from being dry all the time and has a nice taste.</li>
    <li> Seems like magic, but doesn&#x27;t help much with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I take medication that dries my mouth out quite a bit. My dentist recommended that I start using this, and I noticed results after only a few days. My mouth now feels soothed and hydrated instead of dry and stiff. The rise doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of aftertaste like some other mouthwashes do. I was able to get the 33 oz size on Amazon for the same price I was paying for the 16 oz size at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews with people complaining about a formula change. I can&#x27;t speak on their behalf and I&#x27;ve never used the previous formula myself. I can say though, that I don&#x27;t notice any sort of chemical taste and it&#x27;s never made my mouth feel numb.</li>
    <li> Not really sure if it works.  I didn&#x27;t expect or like the coating that it puts in your mouth.  Feels slimey</li>
    <li> Works good, just gargle about 30 seconds before bedtime and kiss dry mouth good bye, well almost.  It works, sometimes great and sometimes better than not using it.  If you wake up or are awakened by your mouth being so dry it almost hurts this it the product for you.  Or you could get a bung cord and strap it under your jaw and hook it over your head to keep your mouth shut.  Both will work</li>
    <li> Biotene seems to be the standard by which other dry mouth rinses are measured by. Having said this, it could explain why this household name is the most pricey. Yes, it&#x27;s an effective treatment for dry mouth, and it&#x27;s alcohol-free, but so are many store brands out there. I&#x27;ve found that my local store brand works just as well, and without the price tag. Of course, Biotene has a diverse product line of mouthwashes, rinses, sprays, toothpastes, etc., so the temptation and trust is there to go with a big name brand. I recommend this rinse for dry mouth, but if savings are a priority, try your store brand first (or second), and compare.</li>
    <li> We all love it.  Negative: there is not nice flavor.  It does the job well.</li>
    <li> This is thicker than other mouth washes and seems to coat the teeth before bedtime to protect your teeth/gums at night.  Good for dry mouth.  Cheaper on Amazon than the local grocery store.</li>
    <li> The new formula is AWFUL. I used Biotene despite the fact that is cost twice as much as everything else. I hate the new taste and the new &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34; I get when I rinse with it. I noticed that The company has provided a customer service number to call to express concerns. I called the number recently and they said, basically &amp;#34;too bad&amp;#34;. I mean, great that they care enough to talk about it but what&#x27;s the point if they aren&#x27;t going to do anything? All of the comments about the new formula are negative. Come on, Biotene - what does this tell you?</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth problems because of medications I take.  My dentist recommended Biotene.  I use it regularly and think it is helpful.  The price on Amazon is better than I can usually find.</li>
    <li> big, works, super fast shipping. everything i need</li>
    <li> I have used the Biotene Oral Rinse for dry mouth for a couple of years and it really does help me.  It also leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean and brushing my teeth.  I am probably on about my 4th or 5th bottle of Biotene.</li>
    <li> Works for my mother with dry mouth....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Australia and I&#x27;ve used Biotene (imported from the US) for 12 years ever since I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve got Sjogren&#x27;s. Biotene products have helped until they changed the formula. I only found that they&#x27;ve changed the formula 2 weeks ago. New mouthwash was burning my tongue and after a week of using it, some of my teeth started to hurt and became very sensitive. I thought, it was me rather the new formulation for awhile until I found the reviews about the new mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to send an email to Biotene which is owned by GlasoSmithKline to let them know, how shamful it is that the new formuation doesn&#x27;t help sensitive dry mouth. Here&#x27;s the reply I&#x27;ve got from the company;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear,&lt;br /&gt;We have received your e-mail on our Biotène® website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have reached the United States division of GlaxoSmithKline. In order to comply with regulatory restrictions, we are unable to address inquiries from outside the boundaries of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have marketing rights for our products only in the U.S. We would suggest that you speak to your physician.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara&lt;br /&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare&lt;br /&gt;Case # 4265840&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a disappointing response...Obviously, they&#x27;re not getting it. I wasn&#x27;t talking about marketing or refunds. I was talking about the new formulation which is US made and sold all over the world and customers are not happy with it. I get the impression that the company really don&#x27;t care, whether it helps or not. Maybe all they care is cheaper manufacturing costs now. All we can do is that NOT buying their products. I&#x27;ve found that Oral Seven (in Australia) products have identical ingredients. So I&#x27;m switching. Bye bye Biotine...</li>
    <li> I have been using Biotene Oral Rinse for dry mouth symptoms for about three years now, it was recommended by my Dental Assistant at Florida Health Care and it has been a wonderful fresh rinse for my dry mouth symptoms.  My mouth feels clean and stays moist and fresh.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who suffers from dry mouth  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried.  try it and see for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I tend to stock up on items like this and just finished off the last of the 5 or 6 bottles I had in my closet. I picked up 2 bottles today at Rite Aid - even made a special trip because I just got my teeth cleaned and this is the one product that seems to prevent tobacco stains and plaque build-up on my teeth, while at the same time SOOTHING my gums - and they changed the formula? I even pulled the old bottle out of the trash to make sure. This new formula BURNS, and my gums do NOT feel hydrated like they did with the old formula. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times this year a company has changed its formula on a product that was perfect just the way it was (conditioner, cat food, etc...) And each and every time they have lost me as a customer. Please bring back the old formula, the one that contains egg and milk derivatives, the one with the enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: While at the store today I checked the ingredients in the new PBF Biotene Oral Rinse (GREEN bottle), and the ingredients in THAT formula are PRETTY close to the ingredients in the original formula blue bottle. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried the PBF Biotene Oral Rinse today (green bottle). Though it has the same smooth &#x27;feel&#x27; as the original Biotene and it doesn&#x27;t burn, it tastes HORRIBLY bitter and leaves a chemical taste in my mouth. If you were fond of the original Biotene, you will NOT like the taste of the PBF.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my dry mouth. I would highly recommend getting XyliMelts like everyone else. Makes decent mouth wash I guess.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to actually help make my mouth feel any less dry other than immediately after use. It doesn&#x27;t make it any worse though as many mouthwash&#x27;s do. I prefer the Oasis Mouthwash but it is difficult to find at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample of this last week. So far it has not worked and TASTES HORRIBLE.  Judging from other reviews on here, the sample I received is the new formula -- with propylene glycol, sorbitol, and xylitol (3 alcohols - even though they advertise it as &amp;#34;alcohol-free&amp;#34;?).  One of the other bad things that happened when I started using this was a developed two canker sores, which is something I used another well known antiseptic mouthwash to prevent.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this rinse for my mouth. I love it. It&#x27;s nothing like Listerine where you want to spit it out right away. Biotene works just as good as Listerine.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go along the Biotene Dry Mouth Toothpaste for my husband, so they can work together on his dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very glad I purchased Biotene. I have had radiation treatment in my mouth and the Biotene certainly is a help. I love it.</li>
    <li> Because I take pain medications, I suffer from a dry mouth. My dentist warned me that dry mouth makes me susceptible to cavities. Regular mouth rinse has alcohol so adds to dry mouth. Biotene works great but because it is a little pricey I am careful how much I use with each rinse. Works great!</li>
    <li> I found that harsh alcohol based mouthwashes were actually damaging my mouth tissues, as they kill the beneficial bacterial, remover protective layers and make dry mouth worse.  I had been using Biotene Toothpaste for a while (it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS, which is a foaming agent that is somewhat hazardous to good oral hygiene, and causes sores), so I tried their mouthwash with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your mouth fresh but not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains Purified Water, Glycerin, Xylitol, Sorbitol, Propulene Glycol, Poloxamer 407, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Flavor, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate.</li>
    <li> Good price and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> This would have been better if it also works for eliminating bad breath.</li>
    <li> just bought for my mom, base on the advertisement i have seen on television it is suppose to be good, so as soon as she lets me know how it is going for her, i will give another review, but price was good.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes horrible! Plus it doesn&#x27;t make your mouth less dry because it&#x27;s very strong with a strong spicy after-feeling. It made the corners of my mouth, which are so dry, sting. Yuck! Also, unbelievably, it contains propylparaben and methylparaben, which skin care product makers are leaving out of skincare products now because these chemicals are so bad for you (linked with breast cancer). Imagine eating them with your mouth rinse!</li>
    <li> good product and delivery</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this to me for the symptoms of cancer treatment, which can leaves sores in your mouth, dryness, and bad breath. I&#x27;m not nuts about the flavor, but it really did quite well to keep my mouth from feeling like a moat.</li>
    <li> I have gotten by for many years with a condition called dry mouth. On the suggestion by a individual at the VA I decided to try BIOTENE. This was one of my best buys, this product gives me a great deal of relief and I would highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me a bottle of biotine as a gift after she heard me complaining about dry mouth issues i&#x27;ve had since being paralyzed and taking all kinds of medications that create this problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in Biotine.  1. It does nothing for me that taking a sip of water was doing for me through out the night. 2. it does  have a horrible taste... 3.  I expected a spray to coat my mouth, what i get when i depress the pump is a &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34; of liquid in my mouth. Like a stream that requires several &amp;#34;shots&amp;#34; then having to use my tongue to spread it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was under the impression that biotine worked to stop the dry mouth problem with consistent use. It does not. It only works to rid your mouth of the symptoms at that time.  As for the fresh breath etc etc. i get that with my morning routine of brushing and mouthwash. What I DID want was no more dry mouth during the night and not having to wake up several times a night to correct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the high expense of biotine, i will just continue using the glass of water I keep by the bed to alleviate dry mouth symptoms. It&#x27;s far cheaper then having to do it several times a night with biotine, without the nasty taste.</li>
    <li> a few sips of Gatorade are just as good if not better</li>
    <li> Pricey - but amazing - and the best in the industry - my dentist gave me a sample, and I&#x27;ve never gone back.  Now I can&#x27;t go to bed without using this product - keeps me from that dry mouth issue when I sleep.</li>
    <li> We like Biotene and have been using it for years. Decided to go with the refills as it turns out they are cheaper to buy then the regular 16oz. It does take the dryness out of your mouth and is good to use anytime. Will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> It really does help.  Recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I like the product and it preforms very well for me.  The only problem is that the maker of this mouthwash (toothpaste &amp; related products) has figured out they can make even more money by extravagantly raising the price.  I&#x27;ve unfortunately experienced this same problem with a few other very good products.  I don&#x27;t mind if the maker makes a lot of money just as long as it;s not on me.</li>
    <li> THE QUALITY WAS BAD. THE TASTE WAS NOT THE SAME AS PRIOR SHIPMENTS.YOU SHOULD CHANGE DISTRIBUTIRS OR INFORM MANUFACTUROR ABOUT POOR  QUALITY</li>
    <li> This is not a new product for me. I had throat-cancer surgery many years ago which left me with a dry mouth. It will never be as good as your own saliva, but I guess it&#x27;s the next-best thing until I find something better.</li>
    <li> This can be bought at Walmart for 10.00 (33.8 ozs) Sorry Amazon, stick to books and things. I love this product but it is costly but not at 24.00 a bottle.</li>
    <li> While I used to really, really love this product, they have recently changed the formula. Not only is the flavor now really chemical-y tasting but it also makes your whole mouth numb. The enzymes have been taken out and they&#x27;ve also added methyl- and propyl-parabens, which many people try to avoid.</li>
    <li> GlaxoSmithKline&#x27;s \\&quot;Biotène dry mouth oral rinse\\&quot; is at fault for misleading advertising because there are at least two different versions sold under this one label. The consumer does not know which they will receive when they order!&lt;br /&gt;They contain very different ingredients. One is identifiable in smaller print as \\&quot;Protein-Enzyme System, Alcohol-Free, Refreshes without Burning\\&quot;, the other as \\&quot;Smoothing Moisturization, Alcohol-Free, New Improved pH Balance\\&quot;. GlaxoSmithKline ask for customer questions or comments at 1-800-922-5856 weekdays, but their computer does not allow customer comments or answers.&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste of one but not the other. I order in bulk since I had oral cancer and radiation treatment damaged my salivary glands, getting through two bottles a month. I currently have 11 33.8 oz bottles of the one I do not like and they will have to be returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> My kids (ages 4 &amp; 6) like using this mouthwash.  It&#x27;s an odd minty flavor that doens&#x27;t burn.  It has ingredients that I like (xylitol &amp; enzymes), and omits the stuff I avoid (artificial flavors, dyes, aspartame, saccharine, fluoride, etc.).  The dentist commented on improved condition of my 6-yr old&#x27;s teeth since we started using this 2x daily.</li>
    <li> because of the neck radiation from cancer this product burns the roof of my mouth so i use it very seldomly and when I do it only lasts for a short period.</li>
    <li> It works for me.  It does wear out during the night but that&#x27;s o.k. and the taste is not bad.</li>
    <li> Tastes awful but it really does work.  If you have a problem with dry mouth this is going to help.</li>
    <li> When I learned Glaxo no longer contained the protein-enzme I read up on it and Returned before opening of course. Good for amazon to honor us.</li>
    <li> Formula change!!  See my review on the toothpaste, same applies here!  My dentist is no longer recommending this mouthwash after I informed her that the formula has changed.  I am also the 2nd person to complain to her that it is not working for them....after I told her the ingredients changed, she figured out why it no longer works!!</li>
    <li> Large bottle, nice taste!</li>
    <li> My husband is recovering from head and next cancer which left him with very little saliva. He says this product is the only one that really works for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> this is a must product for people who have dry mouth problems. A perpetually dry mouth will lead to gum recession and more cavities. I was introduced to this product a few years ago, and I wish I had been using it for the last three decades. After you rinse, it is best not to drink any water for the next half hour. The price I paid on Amazon was significantly less than that CVS etc.</li>
    <li> This leaves your mouth feeling fresh....I am sure it eliminates bad breath and germs the creates cavities.  Try using natural&lt;br /&gt;remedies instead of prescriptions...would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s which makes my mouth extremely dry at night.  This is supposed to help ease the symptoms, but I still wake up with a very dry mouth and can&#x27;t wait for a drink of water.</li>
    <li> this product is great for dry mouth</li>
    <li> my mouth dryness was so bad i had sores on my tongue and the insides of my cheeks, and i could NOT eat solid food without constantly sipping water to moisten the food. my teeth were LITERALLY falling apart. i went to my dentist and he recommneded biotene. he even had some in the office he let me try. if i could give it 10 stars, i would. i LOVE the flavor (it&#x27;s a matter of taste for each individual, but it&#x27;s a VERY MILD mint flavor). within a couple of days my sores were healing, and while i use it twice a day, in the morning and before bed, there have been a few times i&#x27;ve missed even 2-3 \\&quot;doses\\&quot; and my mouth still did not get as bad as it used to. i went back to the dentist today, and while i still need to get some work done for irrepairable damage, he says he can see a HUGE difference in how healthy my mouth looks.  i have NO CONS about this product.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with purchase.  The bottle came unprotected with no Shrink Seal Wrap.  Needless to say I could not use unprotected and possibly unsafe merchandise.</li>
    <li> After using it for just a short while I noticed that everything wasn&#x27;t tasting the same. Had to stop using it &amp; in a few days my taste buds were ok.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; tastes, this is great.  My mouth uses it several times a day.  Between her age and medications she has had issues with not producing enough saliva.  Initially she was unhappy with the honey-like consistency and sweetness but now feels it has helped and says she knows when it is getting time for another rinse.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed the words \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot; on the bottle of mouth rinse I bought recently.  So I was shocked when the rinse immediately had a strong unpleasant taste and started burning my mouth.  I had to discontinue it.  Last night the same thing happened with the original toothpaste.  So now I&#x27;m done with Biotene products altogether and I&#x27;m disappointed.  I have bought and relied on Biotene products for many years and am now looking for an alternative product line.  Thanks to the person who posted the ingredients comparisons -- the new formula is so different that the whole product line should probably have been renamed. It is in fact a different product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist originally recommended Biotene years ago -- I plan to let him know about this change.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and I got what I have expected to receive.</li>
    <li> Like many other previous Biotene customers, I didn&#x27;t like their new formula.  I used to buy in large quantities, and still a bit left.  But, I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement mouthwash and toothpaste.  Unbelievable, but I think I found a mouthwash that is gentler and cheaper; Tom&#x27;s of Maine mouthwash.  I tried their peppermint flavor, and was totally surprised how gentle it felt in my mouth.  At this point, I am not sure if I will be going back to Biotene even if they go back to their old formula.</li>
    <li> Was a really effective product, now so so.  The formula change is not good.</li>
    <li> better value than I can get at my local store and size - good mouthwash for dry mouth, although other members of my family use it as a basic mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes do and freshens mouth.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery,great product &amp; price.</li>
    <li> Really helps loosen plaque before brushing so that I dont have to brush so hard near the gums. Gentle and effective with a pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> i have trouble with dry moth from the medicines i take. this helps so much. I really love the Biotene Gum but I think they&#x27;ve stopped making it, I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they can be HORRIBLE.. Yeah Biotene!</li>
    <li> Biotene mouthwash for dry mouth does just what it claims, that is, helps in producing more saliva.  It is best if you use it for the full recommended 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> Excellent, this product does what is supposed to do, it keeps you mouth moist through the night</li>
    <li> I have a dry mouth problem and have been using this since 1997. It works, doesn&#x27;t taste bad or irritate my mouth. I frequently recommend it to friends and relatives who have mouth sores.</li>
    <li> This product is not the miracle worker some reviews claim it to be but it certainly helps. I think it probably would do even more when accompanied by the toothpaste. As a stand alone mouthwash it certainly aids in helping decrease my dry mouth but just don&#x27;t expect it to completely cure it. The best thing you can do to get rid of your dry mouth is to switch medications (if you can), and drink more water. If you sleep with your mouth open I highly recommend a humidifier.</li>
    <li> normal mouthwashes are too intense for me and this doesn&#x27;t have the sting of listerene so i like it. not for everyone though - my husband thinks it has the consistency of spit.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash tastes yummy and freshens your mouth.  It&#x27;s not icky like other mouthwashes. I use it many times a day.  This big bottle is a good deal, you should get it.</li>
    <li> Dry mouth from medication pain was almost intolerable for me, and my medical docs weren&#x27;t good with oral health concerns. My dentist, on the other hand, was fabulous and pointed me to Biotene. I used the mouthwash morning and night, and carried the Biotene gel with me throughout the day to deal with pain along the gum line. Biotene let me sleep through the night! I recommend it to anyone going through chemo or taking Prednisone. (Talk to your dentist about it all, too. Mine had me on Biotene and a prescription toothpaste.)</li>
    <li> This really works for me, much better than their tooth paste(which I continue to use).  My first swish out of the bottle kept my drug induced dry mouth away all day.  We&#x27;ll see if it continues to work over time but for now \\&quot;this stuff kicks butt!\\&quot;     Highly Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve not been disappointed with any of Biotene&#x27;s products yet.  My husband is on medical oxygen and we use quite a number of their &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; products.  This rinse is very pleasant, without the harshness of alcohol or the sickeningly sweet aftertaste of sugar substitutes.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist because I have extreme dry mouth at night.  Just brush with the biotene toothpaste and rinse with this oral rinse and it fixed it in a few days.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is effective for me as a night-time reflief for dry mouth. I use a CPAP machine and am unable to regularly breathe through my nose, causing me to breathe through my mouth a large portion of the itme. The light &amp;#34;syrup&amp;#34; texture of Biotene essentially coats the inside of the mouth protecting against the loss of moisture to some extent. It isn&#x27;t a perfect solution, but it certainly improves the situation.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m an old guy, I have that need-to-get-up-during-the-night syndrome.  Dry mouth makes it worse.  Dentist introduced me to the Biotene products and other medical advisers agreed.  I used to sip water when I got up, but that just made me get up more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my routine:  At bedtime I coat my mouth with the Biotene gel (B003XIXH38).  When I awake I swish my dry mouth with just two or three drops of this product, the oral rinse -- and do whatever else is necessary to relieve myself, if you get my drift.  With this pattern I have cut my nighttime risings in half.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Hope it helps you!</li>
    <li> I had been using Therabreath which worked great for my dry mouth but I thought I&#x27;d give Biotene a try. GROSS! Taste was horrible compared to therabreath which has no taste at all. It also didn&#x27;t work whatsoever! It made my dry mouth even worse! I was constantly using it trying to get relief and it never happened. I threw the bottle away and went and bought therabreath which I only have to use twice a day and I forget I have dry mouth!</li>
    <li> I am in therapy for chemo and was told to use this because chemotherapy will dry my mouth and cause sores.  I have no sores thank to  Biotene.</li>
    <li> Really works as advertised. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent Oral Rinse for Dry Mouth and very helpful.  I use it to clean my mouth, help me give fresh breath and it even help remove food particles.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes after using this first at bedtime and then brush my teeth, it gives my mouth and teeth a very clean fresh feeling!  The dentist recommended this and this is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I did not find this product helpful for dry mouth. The effect did not last more than a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I decided to try this product, because it has been a blessing for me. I suffered with dry mouth for a long time until now! It seems as though it has helped with my dry sinuses also. I&#x27;m very pleased with Biotene Oral Rinse.</li>
    <li> This is basically a pretty good mouth wash.  I get very dry mouth at night, especially in the winter.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement when I use this product.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT GIVES MY WIFE RELIEF FROM DRY MOUTH.&lt;br /&gt;WISH IT LASTED LONGER BUT MAYBE THAT IS JUST THE NATURE OF THE BEAST</li>
    <li> I use this rinse to help protect my teeth from excessive decay due to my dry mouth condition.  I had radiation treatments that killed off half of my salivary glands and biotene is an important part of my oral health maintenance.  It is recommended by all of my doctors and nurses.  I like the cool and refreshing sensation.  I also use the xylimelts tabs to give longer relief from the dryness.  The biotene rinse adds extra enzymes for that added protection for your enamel and warding off thrush.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have an extremely dry mouth, this helps and it doesn&#x27;t burn like other rinsed.</li>
    <li> Biotene does not dry out my mouth like other mouthwashes do.  My pharmacist tells me it&#x27;s because it has enzymes that replaces the natural enzymes in saliva that keep the inside of your mouth moist.  Great for a dry mouth.</li>
    <li> New formula is horrible! The old mouthwash product was great, but Biotene has changed it&#x27;s formula and is now awful. It tastes bad and irritates my mouth. Oh how I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed it.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is very good at controlling dry mouth.  I order it whenever I am nearly out.  It works.</li>
    <li> Biotene, alone, did not seem to alleviate my dry mouth symptoms. However, Biotene in combination with my prescription medication, Salagen 5 mg taken twice a day, did the trick. After I&#x27;ve used up my supply of Biotene (I purchased 5 - 33.8 oz bottles), I&#x27;m going to see if Salagen, alone, will take care of my dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Use this product on a daily basis. It&#x27;s excellent for dry mouth caused from my CPAP machine.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Not overwhelming and it really helps</li>
    <li> Really helps if you have dry mouth.  Its not just a gimmick.  I was doing mints al day to counteract dry mouth.  Between this and  the mouth waste, its no longer much of an issue</li>
    <li> I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewers refer to when they say the foruma isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t been using this very long, but I happen to love it.  Whatever is being sold in 2014 is great, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like alcohol based mouthwashes.  My dentist recommended this for dry mouth.  I think the taste is great - a little fresh, like mint.  It doesn&#x27;t require much swishing, and I don&#x27;t feel any stinging sensation like I do with alcohol based mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When finished, my mouth feels a little fresher, but with noticeably more saliva - which tells me this product works.  When used before bed, I wake up without any dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> does the job for my dry mouth problem.</li>
    <li> It really works for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> When my dad was undergoing chemotherapy, he had to take shots of hephrin to keep his gums healthy against the chemo. He hated those shots so much he asked for any other option. Biotene was the answer he was given so using my prime I had a bottle before he started his second round. The rinse worked great, he never did develope any issues with his gums during his four month illness.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT products!!!! Someone complained about the taste of the PBF oral rinse....all you have to do is shake the bottle&lt;br /&gt;a little...presto, good taste !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a retired hygienist and I strongly recommend these products for ANYONE over age of 50 or one who has suffered dehydration....&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t hurt ANYONE to take these products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the service...FAST delivery to my front door!!!</li>
    <li> with dry mouth symptoms. Definitely aware at night when I forget to use before going to bed. Mint flavor more subtle than other mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great buy.  The variety of choices - keep the large size in your bathroom and have the travel spray sizes - great.</li>
    <li> This product leaves ones mouth very comfortably refreshed and moistened. I prefer the taste over the Biotene PBF oral rinse.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad or burn like some other rinses. The price here is fantastic and Subscribe &amp; Save is great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, cures cotton mouth. That is what we used to call it years ago, for a different reason entirely. Works really well before sleeping. If you snore or wear a breathing apparatus( sleep apnea) this is wonderful stuff.  Will buy it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> My wife has Sjogren&#x27;s, this is effective for her in increasing mouth comfort, maintaining moisture and oral health. She likes it and wants only this.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry mouth due to medication.  This was recommended by my dentist, he gave me samples. The product works well to relieve constant cotton mouth, bad breath.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the flavor, but it does what it is supposed to for a dry mouth. will purchase again throu A&#x27;s subscription service if it remains at this price.</li>
    <li> I do not suffer from dry mouth syndrome particularly but need to take care of my gums. This mouth wash introduced by a friend in the states is mild, pleasant tasting and does the job.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product, but I&#x27;ve had to change my review several times this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Amazon raised the price, then they lowered it back to a reasonable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they have an outside vendor providing it at an OUTRAGEOUS PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the formula of the product has changed. I don&#x27;t dislike it as much as some of the other reviewers, but it does have more of a \\&quot;bite\\&quot; than it used to. I still prefer it to alcohol-based mouthwashes, but I&#x27;d prefer that they bring back the old formula. But I will never buy it at $24 dollars a bottle!!!</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to start using this and it works great. Combine that with the subscribe and save from Amazon, &#x3D; one happy customer.</li>
    <li> Being a health nut has many benefits as well as curses. Taking multiple vitamins can have negative side effects. For me, it was dry mouth. For almost two weeks I suffered from having dry mouth. My lips cracked, my throat was sore and it hurt to swallow. I felt terrible. I saw biotene in a grocery store and it worked miracles. I only needed to use the product twice a day: once in the morning and at night before I went to bed. My dry mouth is no more. I am looking forward to trying more of the biotene products such as the tooth paste, gum, and of course the oral mouth rinse.</li>
    <li> Water does not relieve dry mouth.  This product does.  You probably have to re-rinse every hour, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a great rinse for those with a dry mouth. My wife and son really like it. Its convenient spray applicator dispenses a narrow, gentle stream of mild liquid that makes me mouth feel very fresh.</li>
    <li> excellent shipping and product</li>
    <li> It seems to work. Purchased as an add-on.</li>
    <li> Tasty. It can be bought locally.</li>
    <li> did great for dry mouth the only down side is the numbness afterward!</li>
    <li> This really works for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth and I keep it by my bedside so when I wake up at night I use it or I would not be able to go back to sleep.  Could not do without it.</li>
    <li> I lack saliva due to radiation treatment for head and neck cancer in 2002. Since that time, Biotene products have been a significant help in my life. They enabled me to go long stretches without debilitating symptoms of dry mouth. The key seemed to be the replacement of crucial enzymes normally present in saliva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, GlaxoSmithKline bought the company. I&#x27;m not sure when they first reformulated the products, because there was a lot of original product out in the retail channels. Eventually, I started buying the new versions. First I noticed that the rinse tasted differently and that the toothpaste tasted and looked differently. Then I started experiencing occasional bouts of gastric reflux. The rinse was no longer soothing and sort of burned. My dry mouth no longer was particularly relieved by the products. There was no mention of enzymes on the packaging or in the ingredient listings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GSK seemed to think that substituting moisturizers and humectants was an adequate solution. Perhaps that was true for some folks who have medicine-induced xerostomia, but not for those of us who cannot produce any saliva. They cannot but claim otherwise, but the strong suspicion is that cost was the driving force to the reformulation. But let&#x27;s give them the benefit of doubt. Dear GSK, the experiment failed. The products are worsened—not improved. Please restore the old formulas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always encouraged head and neck radiation survivors to use Biotene products. I&#x27;m sad to lose this solution. Unless the enzymes are reintroduced (and the parabenes removed!), I, for one, will not buy any more Biotene products. Here are ingredients that used to be but are no longer present in the products: hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, benzoic acid, zinc gluconate, lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, potassium thiocyanate, aloe vera gel, calcium lactate, glucose oxidase (most of these are enzymes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge readers of this review to look elsewhere. Unless the packaging clearly states that enzymes are active ingredients, do not look for any kind of long-lasting relief of dry mouth symptoms from Biotene products. They are largely ineffective and now certainly over-priced.</li>
    <li> Essential for dry mouth</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dr and dentist to help with dr mouth from medication. When I use it faithfully it helps and has prevented more cavities.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use to get regular dry mouth because of a medication I&#x27;m on. The biotene mouthwash made it much more manageable.</li>
    <li> I first used this while i the hospital and loved it. I just like the way it makes your mouth feel after use.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is fantastic for dry mouth. I seem to get the dry mouth at night just before bed, and gargle with this really helps. They have a spray, too.</li>
    <li> II want to also attest that, as a user of this product for years, the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula is absolutely terrible. By removing the enzyme system and replacing it with what looks like (more) glycerin it is quite obvious to me that this new owner of the brand is trying to save money by making as cheap of a formula as possible-- and those that the old formula helped can be damned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the current description is misleading in part and more true than they care to admit in part. Here is the bullet-point description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic&lt;br /&gt;-A soothing mouthwash that cleans and refreshes the mouth&lt;br /&gt;-Gently cleans a dry mouth, moisturizing minor irritation&lt;br /&gt;-Alcohol-free and refreshes the mouth without burning&lt;br /&gt;-Helps protect against the odors associated with dry mouth&lt;br /&gt;-Uses the LP3 salivary enzyme-protein system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On point 1: YES, it DOES taste like plastic now.&lt;br /&gt;On the last point: Deceptive advertising as this enzyme system has been REMOVED and no longer exists in the product, thus making it worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and it really DOES taste like plastic now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I noticed that they changed the formula I stocked up. I was lucky enough to be able to do so. But I use it so sparingly now because I dread running out of it and do not know what to replace it with. This corporation has NO conscience for doing this to us! It&#x27;s clearly a money grab. Why would they ruin such a great product like this and then IGNORE our complaints other than to reply with COOKIE CUTTER responses? Of course they want us to CALL. THAT wouldn&#x27;t be documented like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all: please write your own reviews and keep it up! Maybe we can finally help this shameless company see what damage they are doing in the name of PROFIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE star is one too many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. They ruined the entire line of products, not just this one. BEWARE.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - Keeps mouth feeling fresh - Helps free &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; stuck between teeth - Arrived on time - I will reorder</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample and I was sold. It&#x27;s a bit costly, but works very effectively. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how awful this tastes. There is a slight sweetness to it, but overall it tastes worse than vomit. Reminded me of the scene from the movie \\&quot;Big\\&quot; when Tom Hanks tries caviar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re like some reviewers who seem to tolerate the taste, you&#x27;ll likely find yourself going back to the sink a number of times to keep spitting. It seems that it does stimulate the salivary glands, so perhaps it&#x27;s useful, but I really doubt that I can keep using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and he was delighted with it for the first night. Now, after more than a week, he doesn&#x27;t see a difference. But for occasional use, it might do the trick. Amazon&#x27;s price was much better than the drugstore&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist when I complained of dry mouth at night. He was right; it works like wonder and leaves no after taste.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a similar problem, day or night.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have to take several medications that cause dry mouth. My dentist turned me on to this and naturally, I found it cheapest on Amazon. It works. It has no &#x27;minty&#x27; flavor or cover up, it just does what it says it will. Not much more you can expect.</li>
    <li> great product at a great price on amazon.  This price is about 1/3 of what I would pay at Rite Aid, CVS, or a grocery store.  I like this rinse as it does not irritate my mouth.  It&#x27;s great for snorers, open mouth breathers, and for those on meds that cause dry mouth.  I use it before bed and again anytime I get up during the night.  I do believe it greatly reduced the amount of time in the chair during my annual cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the several days I have used this.  Not sure there is much improvement with this rinse.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> was just like using mouthwash..</li>
    <li> Propylene glycol is fifth ingredient in this mouth rinse. You can find this in antifreeze. It is a known toxic substance and I certainly would not put it in my mouth.  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> great transaction and great product</li>
    <li> Hi! I bought Biotene for Mom. She gets dry mouth side effect from medications. I&#x27;ve never used this product. Mom can&#x27;t do without Biotene. I&#x27;ve bought other dry mouth oral rinses but Biotene is the one she prefers. Therefore, this product gets a 5 star rating from Mom. Swish, spit and wa-la. Mouth will be happy!</li>
    <li> I have been using Biotene mouthwash for many years as I rely on it for my dry mouth due to having Sjogrens.  I brought my regular order recently and I can no longer use it! They have change the product to a so called new formulation. It is terrible! It&#x27;s burns and hurts and no longer moisturises the mouth. I can no longer use it and can&#x27;t find a replacement. I&#x27;m devastated. They have lost me as a customer as I am sure they will lose many more!</li>
    <li> it is a good rinse does what it says if you have a dry mouth it is good otherwise don&#x27;t expect extraordinary results</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with what I thought was constant thirst the past few years until I saw a commercial for this stuff which said many people have dry mouth now due to medications... I decided to look it up and both of my medications can cause dry mouth so I thought I would try this to see if I really was always thirsty or just had dry mouth.  Well the first morning I used it, I noticed a huge difference and it felt great to not have that dry mouth thirsty feeling.  I use it several times a day.  I would absolutely recommend this product</li>
    <li> My Dentist gave me a sample about a year ago. It worked well. I have dry mouth from a drug taken daily, plus using a CPAP. I bought a couple of bottles over the next two months and it did not taste as good. Not only that, it did not work nearly as well. So, I put on my glasses and read the ingredients list. I still had the original bottle in my cabinet to compare to. I was keeping what was left because it was a travel friendly size. To the point, the ingredients had changed quite a bit. Included in the new ingredients were two different Parabens. These are chemicals that are used in a lot of cosmetics. They can can be absorbed through skin, blood and the digestive system. Parabens have been found in biopsies from breast tumors at concentrations similar to those found in consumer products. There is much more, but this will make the point. I no longer buy the product, obviously. I use Act dry mouth. It&#x27;s not as good as Biotene used to be. But, it is much safer and does do the job. If Parabens can be absorbed through the skin, blood and digestive system, it is pretty certain that you don&#x27;t want to swallow it! Oh, I know they say not to swallow. Now, you try to use it and not swallow. And don&#x27;t forget it is absorbed through the skin.....that&#x27;s what your mouth is lined with......oops! I can only assume the manufacturer found they could produce the product cheaper and that those already used to buying it would not even be the wisest. Perhaps their decision will be proven to not be the wisest. I still look at the ingredients when I go to the store just to see if it has changed. I told my Dentist at the last visit about my concerns and he was unaware. I told him because his hygenist recommended it again. They did their due diligence and said they would not be recommending it anymore.</li>
    <li> After just a few repeated rinses my dry mouth symptoms greatly diminished. This product is a little more viscous than regular mouthwash but still easy to rinse with. Good taste too!</li>
    <li> This, combined with an oral-b electric toothbrush is my secret to being a 35 with never a cavity or any other teeth problems.  Listerine is a bunch of marketing malarky.  I&#x27;m not sure about the others but this stuff is probably the greatest single investment I&#x27;ve every made in my lifestyle.  It tastes mild and it is extremely effective.  Bad teeth can lead to heart problems, stroke and other nightmares.  Bite the bullet, open your wallet and use this regularly.</li>
    <li> I have been having significant problems with dry mouth and oral thrush and this stuff helps a lot.  I use it first thing in the morning, after brushing my teeth, and at bedtime every day.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS AS IT IS ADVERTISED. REALLY HELPS DRY MOUTH AS SOON AS YOU USE IT.  IT MET MY EXPECTATIONS.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it and don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> great for keeping mouth healthy during chemo</li>
    <li> Great product can get a 33oz bottle @ Costco for $8.99.</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> It helps with my dry mouth, especially in the AM but I use it anytime.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I use it several times a day and feel that it was helped improve my overall dental health.</li>
    <li> Its totally a diferente sensation when you rinse your mouth with this. I really like it. I use other mouth wash before that gave me a similar feeling, but it did not last as much.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff.  My hygienist noticed a great difference in my dental health after my first bottle, so I&#x27;m keeping it up!</li>
    <li> Dry mouth, is also called xerostomia, it is a persistent feeling where there is not enough saliva in your mouth. It makes talking and eating difficult or embarrassing. Saliva lubricates and protects your mouth from infection caused by the chemicals that may come in contact with in your mouth from the atmosphere as well as from hot food and drinks. Saliva coats your teeth and protects them. Reduced saliva flow, which causes dry mouth, can damage mouth tissue and contribute to both dental decay and, cause dental decay and bad breath. I take medication which dries my mouth, particularly at night. I have noted since I had chemotherapy that I have a tendency to have dry mouth. My pharmacist recommended Biotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene&#x27;s major function is to moisturize and lubricate dry mouth tissues with saliva substitutes, and to stimulate saliva to help clean and lubricate your mouth. This is an oral rinse that cleans, refreshes and relieves dryness and soothes oral irritations. That oral rinse is Biotene, and it contains beneficial enzymes found in saliva to help maintain the oral environment and help relieve dryness. It does not have saccharin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene is a soothing mouthwash and it is refreshing. It does not have any alcohol, which is also a drying product. It also helps tp protect against the odors associated with dry mouth. I have found it particularly helpful, and keep a small bottle with me. You swish a&lt;br /&gt;small amount in your mouth and then spit it out. Your mouth feels fresh and clean, truly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-21-12</li>
    <li> great product.  definitely helps with dry mouth.  use it twice a day.  Not much more to say, it is mouthwash.</li>
    <li> As long as one uses the rinse according to directions, it does a good job with moisturizing the mouth.</li>
    <li> Biotene Oral Rinse for Dry Mouth Symptoms is an excellent product, alcohol free, good taste, does a great job of helping prevent annoying dry mouth symptoms. Aids in overall gum health as well.</li>
    <li> I was taking a lot of meds that dried out my mouth after spinal fusion and my doc recommended this and the toothpaste. after about a week I could sleep thru the night and not wake up with my tongue glue to the inside of my mouth. Really pleasant taste. Need to use 3-4 times a day for best results.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for dry mouth.  My dentist recommended it.  The have dry mouth due to a medication and I am a mouth breather because of my sinuses are congested most of the time.  It has no alcohol which can be uncomfortable to someone who has dry mouth.  The flavor is very mild.</li>
    <li> I have a deviated septum and sleep with my mouth open and I snore.  I get an extraordinarily dry mouth as a result.  I really hoped that this would help, sadly; it does nothing.  I cannot comment, and will not judge those that have dry mouth due to medications or other symptoms....but if you have dry mouth at night because you sleep with your mouth open...this will do nothing to help.  I will not be buying it again because of the cost; it tastes fine, and I didn&#x27;t notice any problem with the &#x27;thickness&#x27; or &#x27;sweetness&#x27; of it that some others have said.  But if I am going to use it as just a plain old mouth wash because it does nothing for my dry mouth, then I will stick to Lysterine.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended using Biotine toothpaste and mouthwash to help with dryness of the mouth especially at night. I do like it and believe it helps.  It tastes better than Listerine and  doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like the Listerine does.  I can buy it in a larger size at a cheaper price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biotene products for years at the recommendation of my Dentists and I don&#x27;t miss the harshness of Listerine.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and super fast sevice</li>
    <li> works for short periods</li>
    <li> does helps with dry mouth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with Biotene.  I occasionally suffer from dry mouth -- day or night -- and I simply have to rinse with this product to feel better instantly.  Better yet, the symptoms don&#x27;t come back very often, which is a good thing (for me, anyway, not for the manufacturer) because I don&#x27;t need to use it as often as I did before!</li>
    <li> I use it first thing in the morning and it works for most of the day. Then I use it in the evening to help me sleep.</li>
    <li> Suddenly the formulation changed (not mentioned in description) and it&#x27;s no longer eligible for Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, so I&#x27;m surprised that this is a different formulation than pictured; apparently they&#x27;ve changed the ingredients by simply removing the enzymes and several other components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still effective, perhaps less so, but it&#x27;s not what is pictured (as of 7/30/13). This is a big change and I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not mentioned here. The flavor is different and less appealing as well.</li>
    <li> Works really well for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this; we buy this large bottle and use it to refill two smaller bottles in our separate bathrooms.  Great value.</li>
    <li> totally does exactly what it says it does! i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll ever use normal mouth wash again. tastes great, doesn&#x27;t feel burny like some brands. love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good mouth wash. Helps with dry mouth symptoms. Would be better with a little flavor added.</li>
    <li> Bought for  family member</li>
    <li> Most people who seek out Biotene products do so after being recommended by their dentist or hygenist, as these products have proven effective for dry mouth in most patients. i was not aware that most mouthwash has alcohol as it&#x27;s active ingredient.  Those who suffer from Sjogrens syndrome may find some relief, but no claims are made. For the average person who has no complex medical or chronic condition, this is excellent. The oral rinse is central to the relief of dry mouth when used in combination with the [[ASIN:B001ET7I6U Biotene Dry Mouth Toothpaste]]. This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;fix\\&quot;, it is a palliative that provides temporary relief. The toothpaste and rinse products must be used both morning and night, and I am lucky that I am able to use after lunch as well. If I am on the road and cannot, I will have the [[ASIN:B0062N7K20 Biotene Moisturizing Mouth Spray]] or mints to relieve dryness that arises during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may seem like overkill, but I&#x27;ve found that the brushing and rinse are an essential foundation, but are not enough. Sleeping for seven or eight hours drys my mouth so badly, my tongue sticks to my mouth. I cannot stress enough the need to use the [[ASIN:B003XIXH38 Biotene Oral Balance Gel]] at night to keep saliva active during sleep. yes, it can get expensive, but after you get a handle on the routine, you can try varying things somewhat, but I would not go without the gel for the entire night.</li>
    <li> Helps for dry mouth overnight.  I have to sleep on my back due to neck surgery, so I use it nightly.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it works wonders to get rid of white fungus on tongue etc.</li>
    <li> My review is this. I sent a negative review about a mop I bought and that review was not accepted with the excuse that manufactures some times changed their products, in which case you should have notified me before you sent it. I am still disappointed in you and would rather you not ask me for my review if you only are interested in positive ones.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Chuck Smith</li>
    <li> I could not survive without this as it gives me the moisture that I need every night,</li>
    <li> It pretty much does what it says it will do. It leaves my mouth fresh and moist.</li>
    <li> Works great for dry mouth.  I&#x27;m a mouth breather due to sinus issues.  a splash of this and everything is back to normal, I hope.</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with dry mouth for several years now and I was told to use biotene products to keep my mouth moist.  All the products that I have used, including this oral rinse, have worked great.  I would recommend it to anyone who has a dry mouth from medication or any other reason.</li>
    <li> It has helped me tremendously for dry mouth condition.</li>
    <li> Works well but this product leaves a weird after-taste in your mouth. I use it and would recommend it because this is the best product of it&#x27;s kind but I would get a smaller bottle before buying the big one, so you can try it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 10 years for dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use  it four times a day. Recommended by my Dentist.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash to use when meds  dry your mouth.</li>
    <li> Medications give me chronic dry mouth.  Biotene helps a lot!  Toothpaste is dairy, so I do not use it after a meat meal.</li>
    <li> works fine for those of us who have med side effects</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as she was suffering with dry mouth and had developed some sores. After 3 days of using 3 times a day her mouth had healed and she was a happy camper again!!!</li>
