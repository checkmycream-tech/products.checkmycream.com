      <li>It&#x27;s not super-strength but for me it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant, and the product is of premier quality.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells INCREDIBLE.</li>

      <li>Great hold, great shine, great moveability.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really great.</li>
      <li>Great for semi lift when applied at roots.  </li>
      <li>Great purchase experience.</li>
      <li>Great for taming and directing hair.</li>
      <li>and i love using this on my ends when I do a &amp;#34;braid out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;twist out&amp;#34; on my hair!!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>So glad I came across this, this is my product!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>- so glad I could still find it!</li>
      <li>this product smells good, feels light, non-sticky and works amazingly!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product gives a nice shine while helping piece layers.</li>
      <li>Also, the product is not &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; and so while I recommend rubbing to distribute to your fingertips, you need not rub and warm the product up like a hair oil.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice too.</li>
      <li>Great product....not sticky, hair feel soft, smells great.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Product could be better</li>
      <li>product is a favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>Oh, and Amazon definitely has the best prices I&#x27;ve found on line!!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
      <li>I like this better than another wax product I purchased.  </li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I have continued to use it with my now much longer hair and it still works great.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve even used twice in the same day; like if I&#x27;m going out in the evening &amp; it still looks great!</li>
      <li>This one I purchased came with a foil seal under the lid, so I felt good knowing it was fresh and not tampered with.</li>
      <li>My favorite product for my medium fine curly hair is ISO TAMER FOAM.  </li>
      <li>Then there&#x27;s the smell - some people are loving this, but I&#x27;m the rare person, I guess,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than gel, it doesn&#x27;t get hard, just gives great hold!</li>
      <li>I also use it lightly when I do a roller set</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll add more if I think I need it, but rarely ever do.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair, and whether I wear it straight or curly this putty is an awesome styling finish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to work with, washes out of my hair easily</li>
      <li>This is the perfect product for me, although it&#x27;s not necessary &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t noticed much more than a touch of gloss &amp; personally I think that adds to the look of the texture &amp; highlights.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>This gel or modeling putty for wizards, is the absolute best product I have found for hair that is rather fine and wants to lie flat rather than styled!</li>
      <li>vendor shipped quickly and product arrived as described.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair look super greasy and smells like play-dough.  </li>
      <li>have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a style very well.  </li>
      <li>This works for my fine, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>But for those of us who have fine soft hair or don&#x27;t want a sticky thick wax, this is a great light putty that is easy to use; maybe even layer with another product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having fun with the product.</li>
      <li>(For reference, the price here is about 40% more than other sites - look around for a better deal.)  </li>
      <li>The product description says to put this in dry hair, but I have found it works brilliantly for me to run a small amount through my damp (naturally wavy and very fine) hair, twist a few sections, and diffuse it for a perfect, never frizzy, curl.</li>
      <li>My hair is somewhere between wavy and curly, extremely fine, veering more towards dry than greasy.</li>
      <li>First off, I have longish (bra-strap length) hair that is fine, oily, and super soft, therefore doesn&#x27;t hold style well.</li>
      <li>and it is the perfect product for my (Asian, ever-so-slightly-wavy heavy hair).</li>
      <li>On its own it can leave your hair gummy especially if you use too much.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I do not like about this is how sweet and strong the scent is...</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t using very much (about the size of a pea).</li>
      <li>I bought this modeling putty to add some texture and separation to the layers in my hair and it does exactly</li>
      <li>I was a hair product junkie, constantly on the search for the latest spray, gel, mousse, cream, paste, pomade, etc.</li>
      <li>I used an extremely similar product called &amp;#34;surf hair&amp;#34; by garnier fructise for many years...</li>
      <li>putty is just what I need to hold style in while leaving my hair soft and keeping it looking and feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I have your typical blond hair, fine, thin, straight &amp; fly away!</li>
      <li>The downside of the ISO product is that it doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of volume or texture.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair shiny but interferes with pin straight hair.  </li>
      <li>It smells very youthful and like candy.  </li>
      <li>It works very well indeed</li>
      <li>really *doing*</li>
      <li>thanks for all your help with this.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the hang of &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; but I haven&#x27;t found that this product does much for my hair, or even for piecing out my point-cut bangs.</li>
      <li>I recommend playing around with it a bit, I think it can be very versatile in its applications.</li>
      <li>I have very think hair &amp; it&#x27;s a great product difficult to style hair.</li>
      <li>It does add shine and manageability to freshly cut very short straight hair.</li>
      <li>I think is formulated for those who want to straighten, but if you apply it to damp hair and let it air dry its very effective at creating a &amp;#34;curl cast&amp;#34; which results in soft, but firm shiny curls.  </li>
      <li>Since I have very fine short hair, I typically use something to enhance texture and volume, and this product was recommended to me a by a trusted stylist.</li>
      <li>I first used it on the advice of my hairstylist when I had very short hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now, and actually just bought more not because I ran out, but because I realized how upset I would be if they stop making it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Then when I am done smoothing, straightening or whatever, I may go back and touch up a little more on the ends if needed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been reading a fashion blog for a long time that happens to be run by a woman whose hair texture is exactly like mine, and she had recommended it.</li>
      <li>I really like this product though its not the only hair product in my arsenal.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t appear to be sticky and leaves hair soft.</li>
      <li>Like all Davines products, there is no filler in the product, so you only need to use a bit and it makes it last forever and is definitely worth your money.</li>
      <li>I put a tad too much on one section and it&#x27;s slightly greasy, so I&#x27;ll be more careful next time.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that this lasts all day because I use such a small amount and comb my hair throughout the day, but I still love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more money, but it&#x27;s worth it to not smell like a desperate 16 year old boy.</li>
      <li>Once it has dried, only a few minutes; you can barely see much gloss at all, it just looks like healthy hair to me.</li>
      <li>Most of the texturizing products leave my hair weighed down &amp; greasy, regardless of how little I use.</li>
      <li>I used it again on wet hair, spreading a small amount on my fingertips and applying it just to my roots where I needed lift, blowdried as usual, and it looks great.</li>
      <li>but it really does last a long time.</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy naturally and the product enhances the waves especially in humid weather.</li>
      <li>my hair, not for everyday at all, therefore the price will be worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used on day 2, when for whatever reason I don&#x27;t wash my hair; touch it up with a small flat iron, &amp; toss it w/the putty; sometimes it actually looks better the second day!</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and worth the money</li>
      <li>This is one of the few beauty products I keep coming back to - there is nothing I like better for adding soft definition to my thick hair.</li>
      <li>I have body thanks to the shampoos and conditioners I use, but most products are useless since anything that holds style (with flexibility) will weigh hair down.</li>
      <li>I curl it every day in tight curls and it keeps the curl looking fresh all day with just a minimal amount of hair spray added to it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for semi lift when applied at roots.  Can reapply next day without washing.  Makes hair shiny but interferes with pin straight hair.  My hair is wavy naturally and the product enhances the waves especially in humid weather.</li>
    <li> This gel or modeling putty for wizards, is the absolute best product I have found for hair that is rather fine and wants to lie flat rather than styled! It is expensive for such a small tube but it really does last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now, and actually just bought more not because I ran out, but because I realized how upset I would be if they stop making it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a style very well.  For example, curls from rollers or a curling iron will fall out in a couple of hours.  Or I&#x27;ll blow dry my hair carefully to add a little body to the layers in it but it will just end up looking flat and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This putty is just what I need to hold style in while leaving my hair soft and keeping it looking and feeling silky and smooth.  It&#x27;s not super-strength but for me it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Terrific hair wax/pomade for sculpting waves and curls. I apply a bit on my strands and mold them to my desire. The scent is very pleasant, and the product is of premier quality. Doesn&#x27;t appear to be sticky and leaves hair soft.</li>
    <li> this product smells good, feels light, non-sticky and works amazingly! I love it!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair look super greasy and smells like play-dough.  Also despite the greasy look and feel it does not affect my hair&#x27;s manageability.</li>
    <li> First off, I have longish (bra-strap length) hair that is fine, oily, and super soft, therefore doesn&#x27;t hold style well. I have body thanks to the shampoos and conditioners I use, but most products are useless since anything that holds style (with flexibility) will weigh hair down. I found this and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since all the reviews were just short of deeming this a miracle. Maybe for some, but not for me. I tried to use it as directed (on dry hair) and - holy moly - boy,was that the worst idea ever. It tacked up my hair, greased it up, and just separated it, resulting in a stringy mess - and I wasn&#x27;t using very much (about the size of a pea). Then there&#x27;s the smell - some people are loving this, but I&#x27;m the rare person, I guess, that doesn&#x27;t like her lotions/products to smell like food. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it&#x27;s vanilla/cupcake/frosting/donuts/something. It&#x27;s awful, and of course this would be the ONE product my hair holds the smell of. (And my hands - I&#x27;ve washed them 3 times and can&#x27;t get it off.) I used it again on wet hair, spreading a small amount on my fingertips and applying it just to my roots where I needed lift, blowdried as usual, and it looks great. I put a tad too much on one section and it&#x27;s slightly greasy, so I&#x27;ll be more careful next time. (This is only my second attempt at this stuff before I was going to give it away.) I&#x27;ll continue to use it when I&#x27;m really *doing* my hair, not for everyday at all, therefore the price will be worth it. (For reference, the price here is about 40% more than other sites - look around for a better deal.)  Edit: I attempted to use this many more times and had awful results - and I use as much as about the size of a pencil eraser or less. If it isn&#x27;t making my hair greasy, it&#x27;s dulling it and making it look matte and dirty. It makes it totally untouchable and I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it - this gives it &amp;#34;traction&amp;#34; almost. I have an all-natural beauty routine, so maybe my hair just can&#x27;t take synthetic/chemical-laden products. Threw this away and had hardly made a dent in it.</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve been reading a fashion blog for a long time that happens to be run by a woman whose hair texture is exactly like mine, and she had recommended it. My hair is somewhere between wavy and curly, extremely fine, veering more towards dry than greasy. This stuff is amazing. It has hold for my curls, isn&#x27;t gross and stiff, doesn&#x27;t smell disgusting, stops frizz, and gives a nice gloss that doesn&#x27;t look like grease. I used an extremely similar product called &amp;#34;surf hair&amp;#34; by garnier fructise for many years...but they rebranded it for teenage boys and it now smells like axe deodorant. This has been a lifesaver. It&#x27;s a lot more money, but it&#x27;s worth it to not smell like a desperate 16 year old boy.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the hang of &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; but I haven&#x27;t found that this product does much for my hair, or even for piecing out my point-cut bangs.</li>
    <li> Great hold, great shine, great moveability.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I have your typical blond hair, fine, thin, straight &amp; fly away! Most of the texturizing products leave my hair weighed down &amp; greasy, regardless of how little I use. After cutting my hair short in a new exciting do; I had to use some product to give it texture and volume. I tried about 8 different products before trying this; and this is the one! I LOVE IT! I use the salt spray on my hair when it&#x27;s damp, blow dry and then put a little of this in my palm, rub around in my hands and then basically toss it through my hair, shake it out &amp; then use a small amount on finger tips to touch up. This is the perfect product for me, although it&#x27;s not necessary &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t noticed much more than a touch of gloss &amp; personally I think that adds to the look of the texture &amp; highlights. Once it has dried, only a few minutes; you can barely see much gloss at all, it just looks like healthy hair to me. It&#x27;s super easy to work with, washes out of my hair easily &amp; I&#x27;ve even used twice in the same day; like if I&#x27;m going out in the evening &amp; it still looks great! I&#x27;ve also used on day 2, when for whatever reason I don&#x27;t wash my hair; touch it up with a small flat iron, &amp; toss it w/the putty; sometimes it actually looks better the second day! It&#x27;s hard to find a product because there r a zillion to chose from &amp; it gets confusing. So glad I came across this, this is my product! even if I let my hair grow out I&#x27;ll stick to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not real heavy, so for some w/very thick hair who r looking for a heavier wax type product this may not b for u. But for those of us who have fine soft hair or don&#x27;t want a sticky thick wax, this is a great light putty that is easy to use; maybe even layer with another product. I&#x27;m very happy with this product! Have already stocked up w/another 2 tubes just in case they decide to chg the formula or discontinue. At the rate I use it, it should last me a very long time. Oh, and Amazon definitely has the best prices I&#x27;ve found on line!!</li>
    <li> I like this better than another wax product I purchased.  It does add shine and manageability to freshly cut very short straight hair. It even holds a scrunched in \\&quot;curl\\&quot; wherever I decide to add it to my hair.  I&#x27;m having fun with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the only styling product I like, and I&#x27;ve tried about 10!  Not too stiff, but enough hold to keep my short hair in place.</li>
    <li> Great purchase experience. Product could be better</li>
    <li> I will be returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;It left may hair flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in it.&lt;br /&gt;Yuck</li>
    <li> This works for my fine, straight hair.  I curl it every day in tight curls and it keeps the curl looking fresh all day with just a minimal amount of hair spray added to it.  Not greasy and helps separate the curls perfectly.  Love this!</li>
    <li> product is a favorite of mine. vendor shipped quickly and product arrived as described. thanks for all your help with this.</li>
    <li> This product gives a nice shine while helping piece layers. Just use a tiny bit. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I bought this modeling putty to add some texture and separation to the layers in my hair and it does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair hits about mid-back; I use a pea sized amount for the bottom third of my hair and that has been sufficient.  I&#x27;ll add more if I think I need it, but rarely ever do.  Also, the product is not &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; and so while I recommend rubbing to distribute to your fingertips, you need not rub and warm the product up like a hair oil.  I can&#x27;t say that this lasts all day because I use such a small amount and comb my hair throughout the day, but I still love it.  The only thing I do not like about this is how sweet and strong the scent is... It smells very youthful and like candy.  However, it does dissipate and is not so terrible that I will stop using it.</li>
    <li> Since I have very fine short hair, I typically use something to enhance texture and volume, and this product was recommended to me a by a trusted stylist. It works very well indeed, I like the feel and shine it provides, as well as the fact that it is neither sticky nor heavy. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I have short hair, and whether I wear it straight or curly this putty is an awesome styling finish. It gives shine and tames hair, but never feels greasy, even if heavily applied (which it never needs to be). Like all Davines products, there is no filler in the product, so you only need to use a bit and it makes it last forever and is definitely worth your money.</li>
    <li> I really like this product though its not the only hair product in my arsenal.  On its own it can leave your hair gummy especially if you use too much.  My favorite product for my medium fine curly hair is ISO TAMER FOAM.  I think is formulated for those who want to straighten, but if you apply it to damp hair and let it air dry its very effective at creating a &amp;#34;curl cast&amp;#34; which results in soft, but firm shiny curls.  The downside of the ISO product is that it doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of volume or texture.  This is where DAVINES comes in: I rub a pea size quantity between my hands/fingers and run them through the underneath layers of my hair.  Instant volume that lasts all day!!! It&#x27;s really great. I think the first time I used this product I thought it was weird and I was confused as to how to use it. I recommend playing around with it a bit, I think it can be very versatile in its applications.</li>
    <li> I was a hair product junkie, constantly on the search for the latest spray, gel, mousse, cream, paste, pomade, etc. A few years ago I went to a new hair stylist who introduced me to Davines #4 and it is the perfect product for my (Asian, ever-so-slightly-wavy heavy hair). Since then I have thrown out all my other hair products and use this as my go-to. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The product description says to put this in dry hair, but I have found it works brilliantly for me to run a small amount through my damp (naturally wavy and very fine) hair, twist a few sections, and diffuse it for a perfect, never frizzy, curl.</li>
    <li> I had bought this cause I grew my hair a little longer.  It gives it a little shine, smoothness and texture all at the same time.  I dont&#x27; know what it&#x27;s made of but it&#x27;s like magic.  Subtle.  don&#x27;t worry about the price.  A little goes a long way and worth the money</li>
    <li> Makes hairstyling a breeze...will purchase again &amp; again! In fact, I&#x27;m placing my order today...looking forward to trying additional Davines products.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I have very fine hair and this helps my hair hold curls like a charm! Totally worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> The best!  I have very think hair &amp; it&#x27;s a great product difficult to style hair.</li>
    <li> Great product....not sticky, hair feel soft, smells great. Product goes a long way, only need to use very little per application so the product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product - so glad I could still find it! Great for taming and directing hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few beauty products I keep coming back to - there is nothing I like better for adding soft definition to my thick hair. I first used it on the advice of my hairstylist when I had very short hair and it prevented hair-helmet beautifully, and giving me pieciness and definition after drying. I have continued to use it with my now much longer hair and it still works great. I can use it before blowdrying or after, or both for that matter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub a pea sized dot or two of the thick, pasty cream between my palms and stroke my hair all over to prevent chunks. Then when I am done smoothing, straightening or whatever, I may go back and touch up a little more on the ends if needed. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells INCREDIBLE. This one I purchased came with a foil seal under the lid, so I felt good knowing it was fresh and not tampered with. Wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair (I am Black) and i love using this on my ends when I do a &amp;#34;braid out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;twist out&amp;#34; on my hair!! It&#x27;s better than gel, it doesn&#x27;t get hard, just gives great hold! I also use it lightly when I do a roller set and it gives my big curls major fluff and hold! I only apply it once and it just maintains my style for at least a week. I love it, hated that my local beauty salon stopped selling it, so I don&#x27;t mind paying the extra cost. It lasts for over a year, you don&#x27;t need a lot!</li>
