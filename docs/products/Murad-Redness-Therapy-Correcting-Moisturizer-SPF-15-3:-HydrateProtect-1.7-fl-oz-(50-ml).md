      <li>If you find another product that works better let me know.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love.</li>
      <li>I love that too.</li>
      <li>Feels light and helps with the redness!</li>
      <li>Better price then the retail stores.</li>
      <li>and i just love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love how this smells, feels and how it leaves my skin.  </li>
      <li>The good thing about it that it will keep your face nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I think that my skin looks smooth, healthy, and non-irritated when I use this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This product was recommended by my skin care specialist because I have a very mild case of rosacea.  </li>
      <li>easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I Have super sensitive skin and this ha seen great</li>
      <li>good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have used it for years, very nice to have for multiple sources</li>
      <li>And have been searching high and low for the perfect moisturizer that would hydrate and matify my skin...</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the product and this is a much better price than buying it from my local beauty supply store.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; all the red but its definitely a good product for those with mild redness.</li>
      <li>I have a mild case of rosacea.  </li>
      <li>days when I am not having a severely dark-red flare up, that light correction is enough to allow me to put on a light liquid foundation, or even just buff a powder foundation over my skin (which feels much better than having to layer on product after product).</li>
      <li>But.... Still worth it.</li>
      <li>, Murad line is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Also the shipping on this was super duper fast!</li>
      <li>Recommend to all who need a light moisturizer for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>If they only knew :)</li>
      <li>Very noticeable change with rosacea!</li>
      <li>I had an allergic reaction (first reaction from a skin product in my life) and broke out all over my face and neck.  </li>
      <li>first time I try a Murad product.</li>
      <li>I love the facial wash as well.</li>
      <li>My skin also tends to itch during certain times of the season and this moisturizer eliminates itching.</li>
      <li>Guys lack the options available to women for covering and blending in red blotchy areas.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
      <li>It works very well for my redness and dryness, however it&#x27;s not a miracle</li>
      <li>arrived lightening fast, thank you so much.</li>
      <li>It softens skin and really helps with redness and irritation.  </li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>I honestly stopped using it earlier this year because my skin was no longer red like it used to be!</li>
      <li>Came exactly as described and packaged exactly the same as when I bought at the spa and paid almost twice as much.</li>
      <li>The Murad tones down the redness and helps my concealer go on more</li>
      <li>The green color kinda eliminates the red from my acne, my skin looks and feels good.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>While these help with the pimples, I do find they can incraese increase redness and dryness, particularly if used frequently.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and subtle.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, and applying anything increases the redness.  </li>
      <li>I tend to use a serum or treatment underneath it, and if my skin is extra dry I will also use a light moisturizer underneath.</li>
      <li>My face has always been very red my whole life.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it to his friends or someone without sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>been using it for several weeks but don&#x27;t see much change in the redness of my skin</li>
      <li>Most white sunscreens make my skin look very uneven.  </li>
      <li>Together, the entire regime offers smooth protected skin, minimizing redness and with protection but without any heavy lotion feel</li>
      <li>Normally I use the skin perfecting lotion (blue label) and never had any issues, but decided to try the redness therapy line.  </li>
      <li>Will go back to my old one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s green but blends right into your skin.  </li>
      <li>I am 50-years old and my skin is normal, but on the reddish side, with few blemishes throughout the month.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s green but blends right into your skin.  </li>
<li> I am 50-years old and my skin is normal, but on the reddish side, with few blemishes throughout the month.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve learned that instead of trying to cover up all of my redness, that by letting a little show through the foundation it simply looks like I&#x27;m wearing blush, or have a natural rosy complexion.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and have the usual -- some age spots, a few surface wrinkles, large pores, and loss of elasticity and,</li>
<li> This cream seems to be a little too drying  for my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I really like the green tint, which is very slight, but tones down my face&#x27;s natural redness.</li>
<li> I have rosacea, redness with areas of dry skin and some bumps/pimples.  </li>
<li> A little bit of the cream goes a long way so this lasts several months.</li>
<li> But it also gives me -light- color correction, which I believe is the key to why it works for me where other green tints have failed.</li>
<li> I suffer with really bad oily combination skin , with some acne, mostly on my chin and jaw.</li>
<li> Use with other Murad Redness Therapy products.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit oily</li>
<li> It&#x27;s often dry, but applying product usually results in adding pimples without fully resolving the dryness.    </li>
<li> I have combination skin and slight rosacea on my cheeks</li>
<li> I use this cream everyday with my resurgence line.</li>
<li> i had been using this for years, but had trouble finding it in stores.</li>
<li> urge others with redness problems to try it, even if you&#x27;ve stayed away from green tints up until now.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t notice how the green is to help with the redness.</li>
<li> basically you pay a lot for just a plain moisturizer.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t blame the product for that, however since i have very odd skin.  </li>
<li> In the past I&#x27;ve had little luck with green-tinted products for my rosacea or my under-eye redness.</li>
<li> The tube is kinda small.</li>
<li> /&gt;Under my eyes, it is often impossible for me to put on any concealer without it breaking up, looking dry and \\&quot;dotted\\&quot; and messy.</li>
<li> but unfortunately i was wrong.</li>
<li> It keeps my skin hydrated even though its cold now but not overly greasy.  </li>
<li> I used this moisturizer for a week and in that time period it turned me a horrible red/purple color and dried me out to the point my skin began to flake off and bleed in spots.</li>

    <li> THIS DOES HELP, THANK YOU .</li>
    <li> repeat customer of this product, Murad line is worth the price.  arrived lightening fast, thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described and packaged exactly the same as when I bought at the spa and paid almost twice as much. I like Murad products.</li>
    <li> I have a mild case of rosacea.  Most white sunscreens make my skin look very uneven.  Guys lack the options available to women for covering and blending in red blotchy areas.

    <li> Love this moisturizer!  Feels light and helps with the redness!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that I like because it is not greasy and it does not irritate or contribute to my break outs. I am 50-years old and my skin is normal, but on the reddish side, with few blemishes throughout the month. My skin also tends to itch during certain times of the season and this moisturizer eliminates itching. It also is great underneath my minerals foundation. I think that my skin looks smooth, healthy, and non-irritated when I use this moisturizer. I buy it on Amazon rather than locally since I save about $10.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my skin care specialist because I have a very mild case of rosacea.  I am very pleased with the product and this is a much better price than buying it from my local beauty supply store.  It&#x27;s green but blends right into your skin.  I honestly stopped using it earlier this year because my skin was no longer red like it used to be! A little bit of the cream goes a long way so this lasts several months.</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it claims.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had little luck with green-tinted products for my rosacea or my under-eye redness. But I decided to try the Murad Redness Therapy based upon the company&#x27;s reputation, and I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on smoothly, feels rich, and smells wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of product to cover your entire face, and I do use it under my eyes. I tend to use a serum or treatment underneath it, and if my skin is extra dry I will also use a light moisturizer underneath. The Murad works best as a primer, helping my foundation go on more smoothly without settling into my pores. But it also gives me -light- color correction, which I believe is the key to why it works for me where other green tints have failed. Murad does not make my skin look like I&#x27;m trying out for the part of Wicked Witch of the West!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I am not having a severely dark-red flare up, that light correction is enough to allow me to put on a light liquid foundation, or even just buff a powder foundation over my skin (which feels much better than having to layer on product after product). I&#x27;ve learned that instead of trying to cover up all of my redness, that by letting a little show through the foundation it simply looks like I&#x27;m wearing blush, or have a natural rosy complexion.

    <li> This cream seems to be a little too drying  for my sensitive skin. I ended up giving it to my husband. It seemed to help his skin. He liked it . I would recommend it to his friends or someone without sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very light moisturizer, good for day use. Bought it for rosacea, and very happy with it. Recommend to all who need a light moisturizer for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Works great on my skin. I don&#x27;t notice how the green is to help with the redness. It kinda just fades into the skin. It is soothing. Also the shipping on this was super duper fast!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any inproovment in my face apperence .</li>
    <li> Very noticeable change with rosacea! I love the facial wash as well. I am 65 and people always comment on my skin. If they only knew :)</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion I have ever used for acne prone skin. Better price then the retail stores.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t do any kind of correcting that i can see, and i have been using it for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;so basically you pay a lot for just a plain moisturizer.</li>

    <li> This product is great!  ...and finding it on this site is excellent it is all a Five Star Rating!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad products for about a year now and find them to be very effective in repairing my skin.  I&#x27;m 52 years old and have the usual -- some age spots, a few surface wrinkles, large pores, and loss of elasticity and, of course, redness).  Their redness therapy isn&#x27;t as luxurious and I don&#x27;t notice any change in the redness in my face.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> yes i love this product</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction (first reaction from a skin product in my life) and broke out all over my face and neck.  Normally I use the skin perfecting lotion (blue label) and never had any issues, but decided to try the redness therapy line.  Big mistake! Will go back to my old one.</li>
    <li> I use this cream everyday with my resurgence line. I wash and use a step 2 from resurgence line but love this cream for the daytime. It smells great to not to greasy.</li>
    <li> My face has always been very red my whole life.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of redness reducing products including the Eucerin daily perfecting lotion.  I like this the best.  It keeps my skin hydrated even though its cold now but not overly greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; all the red but its definitely a good product for those with mild redness.</li>
    <li> This is the product that finally got me using sunscreen every day. I really like the green tint, which is very slight, but tones down my face&#x27;s natural redness. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit oily and I&#x27;d prefer something lighter.</li>
    <li> i had been using this for years, but had trouble finding it in stores. finally found it here and i just love this moisturizer. it helps with my facial redness.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It softens skin and really helps with redness and irritation.  It&#x27;s also lightweight and helps to enhance whatever murad moisturizer you&#x27;re using.</li>
    <li> been using it for several weeks but don&#x27;t see much change in the redness of my skin</li>
    <li> I love how this smells, feels and how it leaves my skin.  It leaves me feeling moisturized without feeling oily.  I have combination skin and slight rosacea on my cheeks so this evens me out a bit and also has sunscreen SPF 15 in it, so I love that too. Don&#x27;t have to worry about remembering to put any sunscreen on.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, redness with areas of dry skin and some bumps/pimples.  My skin is very sensitive, and applying anything increases the redness.  It&#x27;s often dry, but applying product usually results in adding pimples without fully resolving the dryness.    This product seems to help with the redness and provides moisture without increasing pimples.  I would buy this product again.    I also tried the [...], which helps with redness, but seems to increase dryness.    For flare ups of bumps/pimples, including on the eyelids/lashes, I use a tea tree oil product such as [...] or Zia Acne Mask (...).  While these help with the pimples, I do find they can incraese increase redness and dryness, particularly if used frequently.</li>
    <li> I Have super sensitive skin and this ha seen great do moisturizer  and daily sun protection ... Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritate my skin</li>
    <li> I used this moisturizer for a week and in that time period it turned me a horrible red/purple color and dried me out to the point my skin began to flake off and bleed in spots. I will never use their products again after this experience.</li>
    <li> Great product - worth the money if you have redness. I have used it for years, very nice to have for multiple sources</li>
    <li> Will I have red spots on my cheeks. so I thought this will help but unfortunately i was wrong. The good thing about it that it will keep your face nice and soft. But i will not remove or even reduce the redness on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So No i will not buy again and I do not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> good for sensitive skin. easy to apply. first time I try a Murad product. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;quick delivery. thanks.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. I suffer with really bad oily combination skin , with some acne, mostly on my chin and jaw. And have been searching high and low for the perfect moisturizer that would hydrate and matify my skin... Specifically under my make up.. And this stuff works. The green color kinda eliminates the red from my acne, my skin looks and feels good. The scent is nice and subtle. Doesn&#x27;t cause any brake outs. It does have a kinda minty feel. But it&#x27;s nice. My skin feels moisturized and not oily. Perfect duo. I deducted one star cause of the price tho... The tube is kinda small. But.... Still worth it. $70 at sephora!!! Same size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the serum since I discover it at Ulta.  It works very well for my redness and dryness, however it&#x27;s not a miracle and it sometimes doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t blame the product for that, however since i have very odd skin.  Purchasing it here is a no brainier since at Ulta it&#x27;s more expensive</li>
    <li> Eh. Didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
</ol>
