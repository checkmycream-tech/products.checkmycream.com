<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product! It doesn&#x27;t tangle at all in my hair and my hair holds the curls.</li>
    <li> It really is great, works just like it should!</li>
    <li> I liked it  very much</li>
    <li> So, to start. I am in my mid forties and I have thick fine red hair and it is very difficult to curl. This is the first iron that I have used since the 80&#x27;s that has curled my hair in less than 45 minutes. So, one of the aspects of reviews that I notice is that the individual states they either like the product or don&#x27;t like the product,  although gives little information about the item itself. So, here is what I would like to know before purchasing an iron :&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Curls quickly&lt;br /&gt;Digital display&lt;br /&gt;Cool tip&lt;br /&gt;Balanced in hand during use&lt;br /&gt;Long swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;Works on fine hair quickly&lt;br /&gt;Curls hold most of the day without products (fine and long hard to curl hair)&lt;br /&gt;Barrel rotates for ease on hand&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Clip release too close to rotation buttons&lt;br /&gt;Can accidentally hit rotation buttons during use (having a lock could solve)&lt;br /&gt;Learning curve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the fundamental pros and cons that I have found while using this curling iron. Overall,  a sensational device and out performs my Babyliss curling iron that cost me 3X as much from Ulta. My hope is that this iron will last as long as my previous iron,  which lasted almost 15 years. (Conair)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps those who are looking for a great curling iron.</li>
    <li> Love it - so easy to use!</li>
    <li> I would have to say this is the best curling iron I have ever used.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9113a0fb3e0a628ec78e5b2d0e983221]] I wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to expect from this curling iron because in the past I&#x27;ve seen gimmicky descriptions that don&#x27;t really turn out to work the way they try to market themselves to work. So when I received this one for free* to try and review I was actually surprised that it lived up to it&#x27;s description. This video is of my teenage daughter using the curling iron for the first time herself and what we thought of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in very neat and sleek looking packaging that thought and cost was put into, it wasn&#x27;t just a flimsy box or plastic. Once opened and out of the package the curling iron is very sleek looking as well it&#x27;s all black with the exception of the brands name on the handle and the temperature display when turned on. The one thing I quickly noticed before using it and really liked was the long cord that twists around so you can hold it any way you like and not have to worry about how the cord comes out of the device or get caught up or tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When plugged in the instructions said that it takes 2 minutes to fully heat up, but it seemed like it heated up quicker than that. The other thing is that you can change the temperature to suit your hair needs. When playing with this we used it at 350 on both mine and my daughters hair, but with more use and experience we can find the perfect temp for each of our hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the real question does this curling iron really rotate? Yes it sure does! This is why I give it four stars, but also why I drop it a star. There is two buttons a L and a R and they are positioned a slight bit below the clamp lever. Place the end of your hair in the clamp then hit the necessary button for the direction you want to curl your hair. It winds up really quick and then you can let go and hold for the time necessary for your hair. Use your finger to hit the clamp lever to release your hair and a cute curl comes out. The problem though is the learning curve. Once you get the hang it is not so bad, however we found that often when we hit the clamp lever you also accidentally hit one of the rotation buttons as well. If you catch yourself quickly let go and no big deal, however there were a few times it surprised us and we let it get to tight but were able to get it out of our hair before it burned our scalp so we&#x27;ve been lucky. With more practice we are both getting better at using it and it is not happening now that we know to be SUPER UBER careful. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to let my teen use this alone but she has been learning how to use it carefully and so I have given it to her to use because she needed a good curling iron. She has long hair, and my is a bit shorter so she will use it much more often than I will, a couple times a week where I would probably only use it about once or twice a month. It was really hard to give away to her though, I wanted to keep it and hoard it for myself but I also want it to get a lot of use so it makes sense to let her use it since she will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this rotating curling iron and that is why it got 4 stars, just user/buyer beware that it will be a learning curve and might not be for everyone. (If you find you burn yourself often on a regular curling iron this might not be the one for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this item for free this is our 100% honest opinion.curve.

    <li> I am very impressed with how well crafted this curling iron is.  It looks very expensive and nice (unlike most of the cheap ones I have purchased int he past).  I think it is built to last, which is very important...especially considering the price point. I have never tried an auto rotating iron before so it was a bit challenging and it took me several times to get the hang of it.  If you aren&#x27;t careful you can hit the wrong button and end up pulling your hair (because one button is to curl your hair/wind your hair onto the wand and the other is to release/unwind your hair).  So you have to get used to which button is which.  I still have to look at the buttons before I push them (because I have pushed the wrong one several times--lol).  Also, if you don&#x27;t get the iron situation just right on your hair you can end up with the curls looking funny, but that would be the case with a regular iron as well.  In general I would have to say when I get more comfortable with this iron it is going to be my favorite.  It has a nice ceramic barrel, a swivel cord that is a nice LONG 8 feet and an automatic shut off.  It gives you a nice curl too.  I was given the opportunity to try this and give my honest opinion. I gave it 4 stars simply because it can take a little while to get used to and it may not be for everyone.  However, if you like trying the newest thing experimenting with different ways of curling your hair (like I do), give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest new way to do my hair so that I don&#x27;t look like a ragamuffin. I&#x27;m not gifted in the way of hair, and I&#x27;ve never had good luck with a curling iron, but was intrigued when I read more about their product. The XTAVA Curling Iron makes the process so easy (even for a beauty novice such as myself!) and gives me a great curl. It has temperature control buttons that you can change by the degree from 210*F to 430*F, not just &amp;#34;low / medium / high&amp;#34;, so you can really adjust it depending on your hair type. I kept it on 350*, as I didn&#x27;t want a very tight curl and it worked great for my thick and curly hair. There is a little bit of a learning curve with the &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;R&amp;#34; buttons, but even if you start going the wrong way, its really easy to just stop and go the other way. The best part? Because of the auto rotate feature, my arms didn&#x27;t get tired and it took me just around 10 minutes! Whenever I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair in the past, it&#x27;s taken at least 30 minutes and never looked quite right, so I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
    <li> curls actually hold and they are silky!</li>
    <li> Is a little scary getting used to the twirling barrel. But after some practice curls turn out beautiful.</li>
    <li> Auto rotating button does not working after I use only one time...very disappointed</li>
    <li> Stopped heating after only a few uses. Amazon took it back but charged almost $7 for &amp;#34;restocking&amp;#34; fee.</li>
    <li> The best curling iron ever owned. Digital readout for hair temp so you know what works best and when your scorching your air. The barrel leaves a shiny glow as well. Very versatile rotating barrel, swivel cord,  auto shut off, and easy to reach buttons as well.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! Gives great curls! easy to use. Not as expensive as others I&#x27;ve tried and returned. This will not be returned.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this curling iron at all.  It did not curl my hair and it did not get hot enough.  Returned.</li>
    <li> This rotating curling iron works great I really like that you can adjust the heat settings because I have very thick wavy tough to style hair yet my daughter has thin fragile hair so it is really nice to be able to set it differently when I style her hair vs when I style mine since we are polar opposites in the hair department thank you Xtava for providing us with a sample to test out we love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling iron. It is amazing. I love using the thing that makes it rotate. I did get this for a review, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
    <li> Im in with this curling iron. It has great packaging. Sleek and professional look. It has such a great features. It was my 1st experience with a rotating curling iron that is why I was nervous and excited at the sametime. I was not sure how it will actually work but once I start using it, it as so eaay to make curls. Awesome. Im impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair. Curling my hair is a tough and time consuming job. Xtava rotating curling iron made my life easy. Now curling my hair is not hard.&lt;br /&gt;Im planing to curl my hair on Valentines Day and surprise my hubby. He loves  when I do hair n makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this curling iron. This is the best curling iron I have ever owned. I received this curling iron in exchange of my opinion.</li>
    <li> Hard to use with long hair (mid back length).  I feel like the wand could be just a bit longer but I do like the way it operates.</li>
    <li> The Good&lt;br /&gt;1. The barrel is smooth --doesn&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; marks.&lt;br /&gt;2. Auto-off feature is a mandatory feature for me.&lt;br /&gt;3. Adjustable temperature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;The placement of the rotating buttons is in the way of the lever, causing me to almost damage my hair when it started rotating the wrong way and &amp;#34;yanked&amp;#34;, almost pulling my hair out.  I want to place my hair in position before it rotates. not try to inset hair while it&#x27;s rotating.</li>
    <li> What a great concept, I wished it wouldn&#x27;t have stop working after a week it didn&#x27;t heat up any more had to return it.</li>
    <li> Great iron but it worked for a few weeks. It reads that the temp is hot however, the iron is ice cold. Still hoping they will honor their product and issue a replacement. But so far no luck after many weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, best one I have ever used. I like the auto-rotating curling iron features so that my wrist doesn&#x27;t have to twist and the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled. It makes the perfect size curls, just the way I like it. !!! I&#x27;ve spent years trying to become an expert at curling my own hair and I literally have never been able to use a curler the way I like, I always end up crimping the end with the clamp, burning my hair, pulling it out - it was horrible. The XTAVA Professional Auto Rotating Curling Iron is so easy to use, I absolutely LOVE styling my hair now. It has buttons that allow you to curl to the right or left. The LCD screen is great because I like having control over the amount of heat I add to my hair. I swear, I was able to fully curl all of my hair the first time I used it, I am not exaggerating. , I&#x27;ve been so happy with the results. I love the fact that my curls look beautiful and last more than three days. I am so happy I receive a sample of this curling iron for quality evaluation. This hair styling tool is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> It may work well for longer hair, but I have accidentally burned myself a few times as the rod turns very fast, and it is difficult to use.  I tried to use it as a regular curling iron since I kept burning myself with the push button turn method, but it is too easy to accidentally push one of the buttons and have it start twirling unexpectedly.  Hope this makes sense.  Again, this review is for shorter hair.  May work great with long hair. (?)</li>
    <li> I have never posted a review before. This curling iron is the best product I have  bought on Amazon. I have VERY thick long hair. With this iron I can curl my hair in under 10 minutes!!! Usually takes me 30-40. I am so happy I tried this product!! Best thing ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any rotating hair curlers before so I was so happy to receive this product to review. I think it&#x27;s so innovative because it makes it much easier to curl your hair. All you have to do is clip a small strand of your hair and press the button to turn left or right and the barrel will rotate around your hair. I used this on my mom since my hair is still kind of short but as you can see in the picture that her curls look ravishing. This hair tool really makes curling your hair quick and easy. It would also make a great gift for any lady in your life. I love Xtava&#x27;s products and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> The good thing about this curling iron is that it gets really hot and your curls hold. However, it is so annoying to use! The clip is not long enough and it rotates along with the tip, which makes it hard to find when you want to release the iron.  It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally hit the rotate buttons. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Once I practiced how to use the spinning curling iron, I found I was able to get pretty curls</li>
    <li> This is a great iron!!  My second one!!  I wish they made it in a smaller barrel, as I have short hair, but they don&#x27;t!!  Sigh!!&lt;br /&gt;But, I do just fine!</li>
    <li> Xtava brand of curling iron is sleek and classy.. It comes in a beautiful box, has great, easy to follow instructions, in English :) The curling iron itself is excellent. My hair is very thick and I always have to use a very hot curling iron if I want the effects to last any significant amount of time. The high quality of this one is really evident. It has a good Medium curl size, depending on how tight you old the curl in and if you brush it out. I will be getting rid of all my old curling irons now that I have this one, I do not need them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning how to curl my hair with this, and was frustrated at first but with some tweaking and youtube tutorials I&#x27;ve managed to get great full head of curls in 10-15 minutes after only a week of practice. Simple design and well made. Looks very cool and sleek too.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this curler except that it doesn&#x27;t have a way to lock the spinning control because it gets annoying when you don&#x27;t want it to spin!</li>
    <li> LADIES - look no further - this is THE curling iron you have been searching for! This curling iron has so many attractive attributes that it quickly became my most favorite hair tool! Right off the bat I was attracted to the digital temperature setting which can go from 210 to 430 degrees.  The swivel cord not only works wonderfully (if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; irons who claimed to have a swivel - only to tangle up on itself from the get-go).  The clamp tab has a nice rubberized grip to keep finger slipping to a minimum.  Xtava took all of those nice features and went one step further to make the barrel itself on this one fully rotate to either the left or right.  Not only is this unique, it is by far my favorite feature.  This is incredibly handy when you&#x27;re doing a head full of beautiful spiral curls on yourself or someone else.  It sure saves your wrist from all of the hard work! On top of all the incredible features of this iron it is built solid without being too heavy.  It fits ergonomically in your hand and the barrel itself is made of ceramic tourmaline which smooths the hair while the heat is being applied.  I received this model for testing and review purposes and highly recommend this if you are in the market for a great curling iron!</li>
    <li> My wife was looking into another spiral curler that cost twice as this one. This unit doors deserve the 5 star reviews because it&#x27;s easy to use and it works. Very simple.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. Heats up fast, wonderful curl and easy to use..glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I was looking at a more expensive curling iron on another site, it had the same rotating barrel and heat options; I am so glad that I chose this one instead. Heats quickly and easily gives me the beach you waves/ curls that I wanted.</li>
    <li> The automated curling feature is useless. It&#x27;s also very sensitive to the touch and makes the tool difficult to use.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work good with my hair type as my fingers kept getting burned and it kept sliding out my hair.  But it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m sure there are people that love it.  The seller was so sweet and offered me a refund for return of the curling iron.  Which I did.  Great seller.  Item arrived in a very speedy fashion to me and was in new con5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I hesitated purchasing this product because all the reviews and photos were of women with a different hair type than my own. I have naturally curly hair, my parents are ethnic so I have mixed textured hair. I washed my Hair and blow dried it. I got my hair nice and as straight as possible. I turned on the curling iron and set it to a low setting and tested it out on the back of my head. Not impressed.  So I turned the temp up to 410 and tried it again. I literally curled my entire head in 15 minutes... curls were bouncy and alive! The rotating device takes some getting used to ... as the buttons are sensitive.  BUT Once you Get IT Together. You will wonder 1. How You ever lived without it.  2. If you can get all that time and sore muscles energy back from having to do it the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; way. Very impressed.  I will post a photo after I do it again.</li>
    <li> I love the design of this curler--it&#x27;s sleek, black, and elegant. It gives me really pretty, pinup-girl spiral curls. The auto rotate is a nice function but I&#x27;m still learning to use it. I wish that the curl release lever were a little more pronounced since I have a tendency to hit the rotate buttons instead. Overall, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever, but I just had to say I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. It&#x27;s really easy to use and I can now get perfect curls in half the time it used to take me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 months since I got this curling iron, and I have only used it for 4 times and now it just won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s great, but I would thought this curling iron would last a little longer than 3 months considered the price I&#x27;ve paid.</li>
    <li> A waste of money. The rotating function is useless and a pain to use. The curling iron is unsafe and keeps rotating while I am try to use it or if the buttons for rotating are accidentally hit. You are much better off just buying a curling wand instead. What a waste of money. UPDATE: I have been trying to use this curling iron time and time again and the rotating iron is unsafe due to the design of this product. While you are trying to get your hair in the iron, your hand accidentally hits the buttons and the iron will rotate while you are trying to do so! You will end up burning yourself badly. Also, if you do manage to get your hair properly in the curler without burning yourself, while you are curling the hair, you may hit the buttons and undo the curl or burn your scalp.</li>
    <li> The Xtava auto-rotating curling iron Is the absolute best curling iron I&#x27;ve had. I already put my other ones in storage as a just in case i drop or break line and this is the only one I will use now. I was so happy to get this. I actually also bought their straightener and was as impressed as this one so if you like straightening your hair, also buy it. Now, My hair is super curly already and thick and not to mention long. In order for my hair to look OK with curls, I have to first straighten may hair and then curl it which was a big pain. The curls always came undone and it took about two hours for my to curl it. It was a complete waste of time because i knew in an hour they would become loose curls which  sometimes wasn&#x27;t the look I wanted.This curling iron I really love because it leaves your hair smooth, silky, with absolutely beautiful curls The rotating is a huge perk also because it saves time. Another thing is that the curling iron heats evenly which makes your hair curl evenly so you are not curling one part and not another. Like I have said before I have thick, curly and long hair and one thing I also noticed is that I in no way had to turn up the heat all the way which I had to to with my previous ones. They also made this with an 8 foot cord which I like and a automatic turn off feature which is great for us forgetful ones. Please try this. I am sure you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I got this product free of charge and reviewed it with my honest opinion. All opinions are my own and I only recommend products that are good for my audience and products I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with.</li>
    <li> I love the way it curls my hair! Not a huge fan of the L &amp; R buttons, but maybe I&#x27;m not using it right.</li>
    <li> It is very useful for curling my hair ,but the only defect is the turning speed seems to fast ! It might burn your face if not use carefully ~~</li>
    <li> I just tried this curling iron for the first time and it is really wonderful!!! I love it!!! Very easy to use. Love the auto rotation! I finished my hair in half the time! I would definitely reccomend this curling iron!!! It was worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> This curling iron was the first that worked for me in...ever. I have long, straight, and thick hair that does not hold curl well and takes forever to curl. I was so pleasantly surprised with the results because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work or to be easy. I&#x27;m not great at styling my hair and have stuck to only straightening or blowdrying it but thanks to the rotating feature on the curling iron, I have a lot more options and do not lost patience with curling. The rotating is genius because it produces curls that are uniform but can still be as tight or loose as you want, depending on how much hair you put in at a time and how long you leave the iron in. The temperature controls and display are also well placed and easy to use.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best curling iron i have ever used! this comes with all the features you could possibly want in a curling iron! my favorite is the auto rotating, take your strand that you are curling, place it in the curling barrel and it rolls up that strand! it is brilliant! the cord is extra long and swivels so your movability is as great as you have always wanted when curling hair! it also has wonderful adjustable heat temps which is great! i have thick hair and my daughter has thinner hair so being able to adjust that temp means no one gets their hair scorched! i strongly recommend xtava&#x27;s auto rotating curling iron to anyone looking for professional quality and very versatile styling! i know you will enjoy it as much as we do! i am pleased to have tested and reviewed xtava curling iron complementary and bringing you my thoughts and opinions about the wonderful xtava auto rotating curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It&#x27;s smooth on the hair and sturdy in the hand. It&#x27;s rotating feature is extremely useful and saves me the extra work from having to maneuver the wand to get the curls. It heats up quickly, curls well and automatically shuts off after leaving it on for a while. My only complaint which I would have taken a 1/2 star giving it a 4.5 is that when I go to release my hair with the clip I accidentally hit the L/R button causing the curler to rotate and burned my skin twice. I think if they can design the product to be a little more secured from accidents or have a lock feature then it would be perfect! I still recommend this curler and happy with my purchase. Just be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely look into purchasing other products from this company. Very nice curling iron. I will probably purchase a larger barrel iron if they make it (either with or without the rotating feature).</li>
    <li> Barrell was too large, love the idea, but would love one with smaller barrel..</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing a rotating curling iron but I LOVE this product.  It is so easy to use and creates a great curl.  The price is certainly a plus as well especially compared to curling irons that are over $100.  I cannot imagine a more expensive product working better.</li>
    <li> I love this product. There is a learning curve, but it is so worth it...</li>
    <li> I did not care for it.</li>
    <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve ever ever owned</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything you can&#x27;t do manually. Does produce nice curls though.</li>
    <li> Since the iron is automatic, it just takes a little time to get used to the direction this iron will go if you push one or the other button. Otherwise, the iron is actually pretty efficient and easy to use. Gets really hot and temperature may be adjusted if needed.</li>
    <li> Finally!  A great curling iron!  This one is not going into the graveyard!  I highly recommend this. The barrel is about 1&amp;#34;, for those of you wondering.  Has a long clip, unlike another rotating iron I purchased. That made a world of difference!</li>
    <li> I love the concept of this iron and hope that with practice I will become more skilled at using it.  The first time out, I burned my neck and wrist (don&#x27;t ask!).  I like being able to control how tight or loose the curl is, and the self spinning mechanism makes it much easier to curl those hard to reach spots.  BUT, there is a major design flaw in the fact that the buttons you use to spin the iron toward your scalp is directly below the button you use to release your hair from the iron.  It is very, very awkward to use and many times I accidentally hit the spin button while I was trying to release my hair, causing the iron to spin further up toward my scalp and against my neck (hence, the burns).  When it spins, it spins pretty quickly so by the time you&#x27;re already up near your scalp, if you accidentally hit the button again, you&#x27;re already in &#x27;burn mode&#x27; before you have time to react.  To further complicate things, when this happens, your hair is spun so tightly that it&#x27;s also harder to get out in that precarious position!  They really need to address this in future versions of this tool.  Would have given five stars if not for this major issue.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, especially since I&#x27;m getting arthritis in my wrist. I&#x27;ve tried the rotating air brush and just got tangles. This is wonderful!!! Soft waves or tighter curls by adding time. Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> My wife loves the curling iron she has a hard time with her arms holding it up with this automatic Curling it works really good for her</li>
    <li> This is yet another fantastic Xtavia Product that works really well has a really long cord and heats up really fast. I really love the longer cord . the rotating action is very smooth and the digital display makes it very easy to read the heat setting. This is so much better than others that have just a vague dial for a heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that you get a lot of different heat settings for different curls . its easy to use and is so much less expensive than other auto curlers I have tried .I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I dont usually have much luck curling my hair with a curling iron. The curls would fall flat or would never last. I have fine, very straight, long hair, that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well. I used this and the curls not only lasted all day, but still looked fresh the next morning. This iron gets very hot so the curls actually stay in all day, and since it rotates itself, it takes almost half the time as a traditional curling iron. It is so easy to use, and it curls my hair exactly the way I want it to. Doing the whole head took maybe 15 minutes, maybe! I am happy to recieve this awesome curling iron to review. I would (and have) highly recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> Stop burning yourself on your curling iron! You know what I’m talking about. You’re trying to get the perfect curl and that means you need to wrap your hair a little tighter around the barrel. You’re either moments away from tangling your hair into a knotted spiral or burning your fingers. Only the professionals seem to get the perfect curl every time. Not anymore! Xtava has the Auto Rotating Curling Iron that does most of the work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete with a tourmaline barrel you’re one button click away from shiny, long lasting curls. You clip your hair to the barrel and it rotates bi-directionally for maximum ease and comfort. Don’t worry about adjusting the heat because this Xtava curling iron has you covered. The accurate heat control operates with 11 temperature stages that range from 210°F to 430°F. Here’s a hint: Use lower temperatures for fine hair and higher temperatures for thicker hair. There’s no guessing on the heat because the LCD display notifies you on the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonuses are the 8 foot swivel cord, universal dual voltage travel power adapter plug, and the automatic shut-off function. Xtava has added tons of convenience options to this hair styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was purchased with a promotional code or discount coupon.</li>
    <li> I received this curling iron completely by accident, and what a happy accident that turned out to be.I ordered a different Xtava product and amazon sent this by mistake. I was so intrigued i kept it and re-ordered the other item. I love to try new things with my hair, be it products or color or styles or tools, so i was excited to try this auto rotating curling iron. I have never seen another auto rotating curling iron like the Xtava. With the simple push of a button the barrel rotates and your hair is curling. That&#x27;s just one of the many great features on this curling iron i love. The 8 foot cord that swivels is another great feature. No more worrying about trying to share counter space and still be close enough to the plug, no more cord getting in the way. I also like the adjustable temperature setting. I have thick hair and need the high temperature, but my best friend has fine hair and needs the lower temperature. Next time we both get ready at my house she can curl her hair and then i can curl mine at the right temperatures with just a few pushes of the temperature button. Plus the barrel is ceramic, so it heats evenly and is less damaging for your hair. The only thing i can see as a downfall is that the clamp button is close to where the rotation buttons are, so i did hit them on accident a few times. Still, this curling iron is the best i have ever used. It&#x27;s 1000 times better than any cheap curling iron i have ever used, and i prefer it hands down to the curling wand i was using before i got it.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a learning curve here.  But, that has to more with the switching from turning the barrel clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending upon which side of the head you&#x27;re trying to curl.  The clip catches the end of the lock of hair pretty easily, although I wish the clip were a skosh longer; it might make that a bit more manageable.  But overall, this is a fine product, and I plan on continuing to use it, even though I cut my hair to just slightly above shoulder length the other day, to lose some of the weight that was pulling down my 50something-year-old hairline and causing a little bit of hair loss.  I figure I might have another learning curve with the shorter hair, but I can&#x27;t wait to try.  Will post another review on that aspect of it after I&#x27;ve had a chance to try it a few times.  This is a well-made iron.</li>
    <li> I am pretty happy with my purchase.  My hair is fine &amp; doesn&#x27;T hold a curl well, but thiis wand makes it fairly easy to get some body.  Easy to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t take much time. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that my curl turned into body instead of lasting curls. If your hair curls easily or if you are looking for body, you should consider purchasing this product.  The automatic curling buttons make it easy on the arrms.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful concept! I like the ability for the curling iron to rotate, which makes sure there is even distribution of heat. The buttons are clear and easy to use. You can rotate the iron in both clockwise, and counter clockwise. I&#x27;m not too sure how well the rotation will work if you are adding product while curling. I know with a regular curling iron your hair tends to stick to the iron itself if the product dried before removing. I myself have not tested this out because of fear of sticking. The display is clear and easy to read, as rotating plug is a must!! Only reason for my 4 star review is the weight of the product. I did not expect it to be as heavy as it was. Otherwise it is a wonderful product. I receive this for testing purposes at a low cost.</li>
    <li> Awesome curling iron......took a little time getting used to the auto rotating.....but know that I have it down it really cuts down the amount of time it takes to curl my hair!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Works really well.  I got so many compliments.  I was able to do it easily and get the slight beachy waves I wanted.  Slight learning curve but I did my whole head in approximately 15 minutes the first time I tried.  I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this, however it is not a user friendly. I definitely need a youtube for that and this is definitley made for those with long and thick hair. I have mid length fine hair and it was not for me. The curl came out like it was burnt and frizz. Also it rotate with very fast speed that you have to be very careful, or you&#x27;ll burn your scalp. I really wanted to like this, Xtava but sadly had to return. :(</li>
    <li> I love this iron! I have coarse, often frizzy hair and this iron hasn&#x27;t damaged my ends at all, AND makes beautiful curls much faster and easier. It only takes a minute to get the hang of the buttons, and I get consistently great results.</li>
    <li> Good one  easy to use  We still waiting to see if will work efficiently for along time or not&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron.  Great curls. Has a longer barrel than my other Xtava irons. There is a small learning curve with the auto rotating barrel, but the results are amazing. Works great on extensions too.  I also own the 5 piece interchangeable curling iron/wand set, and a large flat iron (my all time favorite).  I ended up throwing away all my non Xtava products. I no longer need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed there was no black storage bag included, which I recieved with all my other Xtava silk products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the black bag was included - 5+ stars</li>
    <li> This is great. You need to be careful maneuvering the spin portion. The curling iron is good quality and I thought it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This iron does a great job!  I have long thick hair with this iron I can curl my hair in half the time takes with my other iron.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a rotating iron, but am not that skilled with my hair. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on one. This is great! Easy to use. A little practice is needed. The only thing I would say is negative, is that the L&amp;R buttons are too easy to hit by accident.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional when it comes to doing hair. I&#x27;m more of a &amp;#34;throw my hair in a mom ponytail&#x27; type of person. I do know how to curl my hair but I never have the extra time to do it. One of the most frustrating things that I have came across while trying to curl my hair is that my arm starts to hurt after 10 minutes. All the twisting and pulling can really put a strain on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I looked into when deciding to get this was the fact that it had a ceramic tourmaline barrel. I learned that ceramic heats up quickly and evenly and creates a far infrared heat that penetrates the hair shaft, preserving hair&#x27;s natural moisture and luster. Tourmaline technology maximizes the negative ion output and closes the cuticle layer, creating smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the temperature setting is adjustable. It starts at 210* and goes up to 430* making it easily used by many different hair types. I have thin straight hair so being able to set it at one of the 11 temperature settings is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is 8 ft long and that makes it easy to maneuver so that I didn&#x27;t feel constricted by standing in one spot. The fact that it swivels at the base makes it an even more easier task. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wrapped around my wrist or getting tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I probably think is the best added bonus to this curler is that it has an automatic shut off when left on for too long. I don&#x27;t know how many times I have rushed out the door only to get a text or call from my husband yelling at me about leaving my straightener on. I&#x27;ve even came home to find my counter partially melted. Thankfully, this curler has a little stand on the bottom that keeps the barrel elevated so that it&#x27;s not touching the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole overview: While I really liked the idea of this it was very hard for me to get used to. It took me at least 15 minutes to get one good curl. My hair is very hard to curl as it is so after messing with the heat setting and getting my coordination in check it got a little easier. The &amp;#34;left&amp;#34; &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; buttons are VERY touchy so I surprised myself many times by accidentally touching them while reaching for the clip. After getting the hang of which way to turn the barrel it became more natural. I found that using smaller sections that you normally would with a regular curling iron gave me more precise curls. I had to make sure that every part of my hair was actually touching the barrel without being twisted for it to get a nice curl unlike when I use my curling wand. Another great feature is that the tip of the curler has a good amount of space that doesn&#x27;t get hot at all so you can hold the tip to have more control. I do think that this is a great product for the experienced hair doer. For the inexperienced it will definitely take some work and getting used to which is why I gave it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product was provided for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.after messing with the heat setting and getting my coordination in check it got a little easier.

    <li> Once I got the hang of this, I really enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was forgetting about the button and accidentally pushing it when I put the hair in place. Then it took some practice to remember which way I was turning it but after a few times I could do it with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this one because I previously purchased a very expensive curling wand but found it very awkward to hold the hair in place and twist it myself; so when I saw this auto-rotating version I knew I could provide an unbiased opinion, whether it worked for me or not.&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be a lot easier to maneuver than a curling wand, and because it has a clamp I don&#x27;t have to use a hot glove to hold it in place and the ends look much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;It was SUPER easy to curl hair under horizontally, so the next time I used it vertically (like a wand) and it took a lot of the bulkiness out of my hair around my shoulders that has too much volume at times.&lt;br /&gt;I like to take a small piece of hair, put the curling iron near the end, before the hair tapers down, push to twist and then release the clamp slightly while curling so that the ends are smoothed as well. It may not be the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; approach but it works for my thick coarse hair and looks much nicer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;It gets very hot, so hours later my hair still looks great, even without using a lot of product. I love when you can set the temperature like this, it goes over 400 degrees, and the temp buttons are way down at the bottom so there&#x27;s no accidentally turning it down like I do on some tools.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous other automatic curlers and while they work, the Xtava Professional Auto Rotating Curling Iron stands apart from them and in a really good way. Unlike others, this one does not &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; your hair into it. It&#x27;s a traditional looking barrel iron that after clipping your hair on the barrel can be rotated in either direction so you don&#x27;t have to do the rolling part. I love that I can use it with the auto feature or use it as a traditional manual curling iron. For someone like me with longer hair (shoulder length or longer) it&#x27;s hard to use the auto curlers that suck my hair in because of the length. This Xtava iron is so much better for me. I can curl a thicker strand or a skinny strand just as easy with this iron. And the curls this iron produces are simply beautiful. There is also no worries about my hair getting stuck in an automatic curler with this one. The iron also has numerous heat settings which is great because not all hair curls at the same heat. You can see the temp on a LED screen. I think all irons should have this but they don&#x27;t so Xtava is different and better for me. The iron heats up fast in about 90 seconds and cools down fast too. It did come in a nice black box which is great for keeping to store the iron in or for gift giving. The cord is also very long so no need to have an outlet and mirror directly next to one another. I did receive complimentary as part of a promotion. Regardless, my thoughts and opinions are always unbiased and completely honest.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on 5 star review. But the clip does not hold my hear, so they slip away.&lt;br /&gt;It is not possible to hold the hair in this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;It is not for me, I just returned it, too bad because I was really looking forward to have this curling iron.</li>
    <li> not what i was expecting :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a similar rotating curling iron similar to the Xtava before that cost half as much. The quality of this one is better, and I like how it allows you to adjust the temperature. But one thing it lacks is a &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; button where the direction will return back to the middle. Also when you&#x27;re doing your right side and push the right button, it curls towards your face instead of away from it. It should be the other way around, so I&#x27;m having to use the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; button on my left side and vice versa. Another thing is that they only have 1 size, I would have preferred a 1 &amp; 1/2 or 2&amp;#34; option for bigger barrel curls. It took me too long to do my whole head because I have really long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the 10th curling iron I own (of all sizes and brands) and my advice is to skip the Xtava. I feel like most of the reviews I read was glowing because the person got theirs for free. Honestly I wanted to be totally impressed too but for the price it&#x27;s not that mindblowing. Go with an affordable, standard regular curling iron (like Hot Tools) that will save you time and money.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It makes beautiful loose curls. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
