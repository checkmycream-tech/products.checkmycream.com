    <li> Just the other day i walked past a group of ladies wearing this smell good, and simultaneously their underwear literally flew off and they began to chase me. The harder i ran the more ladies started to chase me. I pleaded with them to leave me alone, \\&quot;I&#x27;m a happily married man with a young child\\&quot; i told them, but they wouldn&#x27;t listen. They chased me through a river and i was swept away by the current but they still chased, in the end i fell over a waterfall and clawed my way up the bank, by the time i got to the top i was totally covered with mud, i slumped onto my back and braced my self as the ladies followed and climbed up the muddy bank. something about the mud must have made me invisible to them and they just walked by as if i were not even there. later that day i mad a big ass fire in the woods and made manly war crys.... no wait, i seem to have drifted into the plot of the Predator movie.... Ahhh maybe this was just stuff that happened in a dream.... hummm it does smell good though, honest.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  I have had positive comments from several ladies since I started wearing this, but unfortunately my wife says it bothers her nose.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve purchased deodorant sticker thinking that it was spray. It was weird. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out how to use with clothes. Smells good but my old Chanel spray smells much better</li>
    <li> Enjoyed it, thank you</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this deodorant but only off putting thing about this is the alcohol smell.  I have a YSL deodorant and it has NO alcohol smell what so ever.  The only downfall or complaint I have about this product is that.  Other than that, great smell and lasts a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> great scent, no sweat and no stains on clothes</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this through Amazon, but thought I would leave a review anyway, since no one has mentioned my only problem with this deodorant stick. I find it hard to believe this is just me, but, when I put it on, it slowly starts to get hotter and hotter. Maybe that&#x27;s normal, being an alcohol-based deodorant, but it&#x27;s quite uncomfortable for a while. It&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;ve done it on a dare to see how long I can take the burn. It also has a strong alcohol odor when you first put it on, but the smell and the burning sensation, eventually subside (for me, about 10-15 minutes after application). Once the initial attack on my senses goes away, I love it, so I gave it 3 stars. Just a heads-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it before and it&#x27;s the same. It smells great, stays for a long time, and I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> AN EXQUISITE DEODORANT, LOVE THE SWEET FRAGRANCE AND THIS IS EXQUISITE; THIS IS FRAGRANT DEODORANT BEFORE PONERCE LOTION; REALLY LOVE ME AND JUST LIKE FOR MY VA; WE RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Nothing Compares to this...</li>
    <li> This product  works great and my family all wanted to order it. The product keeps you dry and smells great!</li>
    <li> love the smell of this item. is very good an smell like the Perfume.</li>
    <li> Excellent, last for long time.</li>
    <li> The product was really good</li>
