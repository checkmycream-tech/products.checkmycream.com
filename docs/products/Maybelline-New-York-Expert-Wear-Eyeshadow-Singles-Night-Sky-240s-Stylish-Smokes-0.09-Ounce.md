      <li>but stays on pretty well</li>
      <li>Love the actual product, but they shipped me one that had been opened and USED!!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several black shadows and this is far and away the best out there!</li>
      <li>Got it Fast.</li>
      <li>It really is.</li>
      <li>Good true black without being charcoal dark.</li>
      <li>Decent size.</li>
      <li>I happen to be very sensitive to metallic flecks, so I wear this very seldom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Dry is lighter and wet is much darker but both equally nice.</li>
      <li>Wow, huh?!  </li>

      <li>The sparkle is not enough to be very noticeable but is very subtle and I love it!</li>
      <li>The Night Sky eyeshadow color is absolutely stunning with subtle amount of glitter .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also buildable and very intense if applied wet.</li>
      <li>Comes out darker if you wet the brush first.</li>
      <li>There is very little shimmer to this, which I found while searching for a black it is hard to find it with out any, so this is a pretty good match for someone looking for a cheap flat black!</li>
      <li>Or Just In General</li>
      <li>Seems to stay on all day..it does wear on to your bottom eyelid if you apply closely to the top lash base, so I don&#x27;t suggest it for someone who likes to go light on the lower lid line.</li>

<li> I prefer to use the eyeshadow wet because there is a much more dramatic look.</li>
<li> Sparkly shadows can be difficult to apply, but this goes on smooth.</li>
<li> I even use this as a substitute for eyeliner if I don&#x27;t want dark black on a particular day.</li>
<li> It has good pigmentation and stays on quite well even without primer or a base.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like the actual night sky black with glitter stars.</li>
<li> Not quite what I had expected.</li>
<li> But I should have expected that since its &amp;#34;night sky&#x27;</li>
<li> my only negative comment would be that the web site does not indicate that the eyeshadow is a shimmer color containing metallic flecks.  </li>
<li> and I was looking for something totally black.  </li>
<li> I thought it would be all black, but it has some sparkles in it</li>
<li> use black powder instead of eyeliner for a softer look.</li>
<li> and I have black hair</li>
<li> I thought i was getting a a plain black eyeshadow not a sparkly one.</li>
<li> VERY VERY VERY DARK</li>
<li> Waste of two dollars.</li>
<li> This was the black I was looking for!</li>
<li> The makeup brush was black and scrape marks were in the makeup itself!  </li>
<li> In the pan, it looks very sparkly, but it&#x27;s not too bad once applied.</li>
<li> It has some sparkle to it, but not overwhelming.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s small and sparkly</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not great with make up, and was looking to try the smokey look.</li>
<li> So wrong....</li>
<li> very disappointed.</li>

    <li> The pigment s not deep enough</li>
    <li> Seems to stay on all day..it does wear on to your bottom eyelid if you apply closely to the top lash base, so I don&#x27;t suggest it for someone who likes to go light on the lower lid line. There is very little shimmer to this, which I found while searching for a black it is hard to find it with out any, so this is a pretty good match for someone looking for a cheap flat black!</li>
    <li> This was a re-order so I knew what I was getting- something I use regularly because I love it :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as described. I&#x27;m not great with make up, and was looking to try the smokey look. This did the job.  Comes out darker if you wet the brush first. But I really liked it.</li>
    <li> You have to try this eyeshadow! The Night Sky eyeshadow color is absolutely stunning with subtle amount of glitter . It&#x27;s like the actual night sky black with glitter stars. Love that you can wear this eyeshadow dry or wet. Dry is lighter and wet is much darker but both equally nice. I prefer to use the eyeshadow wet because there is a much more dramatic look. Smooth application. Decent size. Nice case. Super fast delivery. Good packaging. Awesome price at only $2.59 and thats including shipping. Wow, huh?!  Recommend this eyeshadow to everyone. Completely satisfied with overall purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, color doesn&#x27;t stay on too long, but I have never had one that stayed on all day</li>
    <li> This was the black I was looking for! I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase again.</li>
    <li> It has some sparkle to it, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several black shadows and this is far and away the best out there! #MaybeHesBornWithIt</li>
    <li> Sparkly shadows can be difficult to apply, but this goes on smooth. Lasts for a while before reapplication is necessary. Good true black without being charcoal dark.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I had expected. Too sparkly. But I should have expected that since its &amp;#34;night sky&#x27;</li>
    <li> Love this! With Emori Eyeshadow Primer it lasts all day and looks fabulous. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Such a good deal! The color is great for smokey eye and I have black hair so use angle brush and hairspray for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This product is really great and applies smoothly. It has good pigmentation and stays on quite well even without primer or a base. In the pan, it looks very sparkly, but it&#x27;s not too bad once applied. It&#x27;s also buildable and very intense if applied wet. I use this as a regular eyeshadow, as well as a way to set gel/liquid eyeliner. I even use this as a substitute for eyeliner if I don&#x27;t want dark black on a particular day.</li>
    <li> I love the color. It also has a  nice shiny color to it. This is Perfect for a smokey eye look!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Got it Fast. this item is perfect for Halloween Purposes. Or Just In General</li>
    <li> Night Sky is essential if you want this season&#x27;s fashionable \\&quot;smoky eye\\&quot; look.  This eyeshadow is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t clump or cake in creases.  Beautiful color all day long!</li>
    <li> Love the actual product, but they shipped me one that had been opened and USED!!!!  The makeup brush was black and scrape marks were in the makeup itself!  So wrong....</li>
    <li> I thought i was getting a a plain black eyeshadow not a sparkly one. very disappointed. it&#x27;s small and sparkly</li>
    <li> If you want something simple... this is the product for you! I don&#x27;t need to re-apply it throughout the day, it just stays on! I like to put it on like eye shadow because I think it stays on better. I also will never buy another brand of eye shadow because of the amount that is in each package, I swear this product lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This does not work well at all. Waste of two dollars. It really is. Don&#x27;t buy unless you can work wonders lol</li>
    <li> my only negative comment would be that the web site does not indicate that the eyeshadow is a shimmer color containing metallic flecks.  Had I known that, I would not have purchased it.  I happen to be very sensitive to metallic flecks, so I wear this very seldom.&lt;br /&gt;I use black powder instead of eyeliner for a softer look.</li>
    <li> beautiful black matte shadow makes a beautiful smoky eye</li>
    <li> a cor do jeito que eu queria e mostra na imagem</li>
    <li> VERY VERY VERY DARK&lt;br /&gt; but stays on pretty well</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at how this eyeshadow would look because of the price but was happy with the results!!! The sparkle is not enough to be very noticeable but is very subtle and I love it!</li>
