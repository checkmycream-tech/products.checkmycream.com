      <li>I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist and my clients love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The steam isn&#x27;t very powerful unless you leave on the high button in which case the steam runs out really quickly.  </li>
      <li>and they still didn&#x27;t get it right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve have notice that my hair is healthy, it don&#x27;t itch and its not dry</li>

      <li>I love my steamer only used it a handful of times at my salon</li>
      <li>and I am now using as I type for the first time.</li>
      <li>and so I had to make some calls to make sure I was using it properly.  </li>
      <li>cought on fire please read your directions to everyone and make sure they all know how to properly use it</li>
      <li>First off this review is for the PRODUCT and not the SELLER.</li>
      <li>The seller was awesome, the product unfortunately was not.&lt;br /&gt;Ther</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was the outlet because the building our salon is in</li>
      <li>I feel this should&#x27;ve lasted much longer than it did!  </li>
      <li>Once I get my new or repaired unit I will hopefully change my review to 5 stars!!</li>
      <li>Came on time like this steamer a lot easy to put together uses regular water from the faucet works really well</li>
      <li>Everyone is telling me how much longer my hair is grown,</li>
      <li>and I guess it&#x27;s better than the average alternative out there.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>They are going to send me replacement parts, apologized for the inconvenience and were very professional.</li>
      <li>He assembled it together but it seemed pretty simple.</li>
      <li>Natural hair is included, it&#x27;s a miracle product!</li>
      <li>I asked early on if the replacement was refurbished or new and was told that it would be a new replacement.</li>
      <li>The steamer doesn&#x27;t use all the water so you always have the water half full which I really don&#x27;t like (collected old water from forever over time).  </li>
      <li>If you have natural hair this device is a must have.</li>
      <li>is fairly old</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and is moist.</li>
      <li>granted 2 stars simply because the steamer didn&#x27;t not take up as much space as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>My clients text me and tell me their hair never felt so soft and looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first purchasing this steamer, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>The replacement, not only did not work, but emitted a hideous loud beeping noise when I plugged it</li>

    <li> I am very glad that I purchased this steamer! It is an excellent option to a hair dryer because it moisturizes the hair instead of dry it out.</li>
    <li> Was very easy to put together, love this product.</li>
    <li> I love my steamer only used it a handful of times at my salon but it works great!</li>
    <li> Oh Oh oh, I love this steamer!  It works great.  I&#x27;ve have notice that my hair is healthy, it don&#x27;t itch and its not dry like it use to be.  I steam my hair about once every 2 weeks.  Everyone is telling me how much longer my hair is grown, of course I couldn&#x27;t tell since im the one that does it but more and more people are complimenting me on my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit and have to admit that I picked this one because of the price.  Another hairdresser told me these were great for processing colors!  So I dove in and ordered it.  The unit came without instructions and so I had to make some calls to make sure I was using it properly.  It seemed to be working fine and 36 days after receiving the unit, it shorted out.  At first I thought it was the outlet because the building our salon is in is fairly old and so I plugged into another outlet and it blew that one out too!  I had to pay an electrician to fix the outlets and now I can&#x27;t return it for a refund because the 30 days were up.  Plus if I want it repaired or replaced, I&#x27;ll have to spend close to 20.00 to ship it back to the company!!  I feel this should&#x27;ve lasted much longer than it did!  I don&#x27;t trust this unit and feel like just tossing it in the garbage and cut my losses.  I&#x27;m happy to say that the supplier is willing to credit my account a certain percentage to offset the shipping to send the unit back for repair...thank you!  Once I get my new or repaired unit I will hopefully change my review to 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the steamer a month ago, my daughter and I love it.  But today, we had a problem getting the unit to work properly.  I immediately emailed the seller thru the Amazon site.  How about, got a personal phone call from a representative asking how they could fix the situation.  I got that call within hours of submitting the issue.  WOW, best customer service ever... They are going to send me replacement parts, apologized for the inconvenience and were very professional. Great customer service!!</li>
    <li> It did not come with directions so you dont know how to fill it up.  Other then that, v the steamer is great</li>
    <li> The steamer is great! It was very easy to put together. When I first received the steamer a piece of the hood was broken. I called the company and the customer service representative was awesome. The company sent me a replacement hood immediately and a return label to send back the broken hood at no cost to me. I use the steamer weekly and I can tell a difference in my hair. My hair is soft and is moist. I am so glad I purchased this steamer.</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever! It has made a huge difference in the moisture retention in my hair. I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> The Hair Steamer has easy straight to the point instructions to put it together, and how to use it.  I use my steamer once a week and I love it!  When the steamer heats up on high it really heats up (not burn your hair off heat, but good strong pore opening steam).  In the instructions it does state to turn it down to low to conserve electricity.  I was afraid when I turned it to low it wouldn&#x27;t be enough steam, but I was totally wrong.  I was skeptical at first purchasing this steamer, but I am so glad I did.  My curly hair looks so healthy!  I wish I had purchased this years ago.  Don&#x27;t pass this steamer up!!</li>
    <li> When it worked it was ok but it melted after about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Since using the Deluxe steamer my hair is so hydrated and  soft. I also have less breakage, my hair is Africa American hair. I use the Deluxe hair steamer twice a week.</li>
    <li> Great so far. Easy to put together.</li>
    <li> Hair steamer was fairly easy to put together. I think I need more practice on using it though. Next use should be perfect. Love the quality so far it works fine.</li>
    <li> The price is good for this item but if I were to purchase it again, I would not. I would rather pay much more for a steamer that is stronger, well made and work better. After having my steamer for a short time and used it twice when during that time it malfunctioned by way of the heating element burning out and melting the water cup.  I read and followed the instructions thoroughly prior to ever using the steamer when I assembled it for use.  It was good that it was under warranty so after talking with customer service I had to send photos of the damage beforehand.  Customer service leaves little to be desired and needs work. The agent was suppose to follow through with it and let me know what was determined after receiving the photos and he didn&#x27;t. I had to call back a couple times before someone took over where he dropped the ball. Arrangements were made to send only the upper hood part which I paid to ship. About two in a half weeks I received a replacement and it was missing a major part to hold the water drip cup so I called and explained this and gave a description of it all and they still didn&#x27;t get it right. I gave up and my husband rigged together a way to remedy the problem. I asked early on if the replacement was refurbished or new and was told that it would be a new replacement. At this point for having it a year it&#x27;s no longer under warranty and I don&#x27;t use it constantly so I cross my fingers with every use that it holds out as long as possible.</li>
    <li> Light weight water drips out of the side can be a little difficult when clients are sitting under it</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. After several uses my hair is revitalized.  My hair is soft yet stronger; has experienced less breakage and is growing beautifully.</li>
    <li> Came on time like this steamer a lot easy to put together uses regular water from the faucet works really well</li>
    <li> All of these that look like this are from the same manufacturer. You MUST put in water every single time you use it or it will burn out. And yes they all drip water. I have owned 5 of these in the last 15 months. I use it to process my clients hair color, which it does an excellent job of.  I consider the cost of replacing this unit every few months the cost of doing business. It&#x27;s too bad that you can&#x27;t  buy and replace just  the heating element that burns out.</li>
    <li> It processes my colors faster and leaves the hair in great condition. Clients are very happy with this treatment too!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Horrible product, no instructions. Pieces don&#x27;t fit. Hood won&#x27;t move. The cheaper ones are better than this over priced product.</li>
    <li> Very dangerous if someone uses it without knowing what they are doing!&lt;br /&gt;Mine cought on fire please read your directions to everyone and make sure they all know how to properly use it</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!  If you have natural hair this device is a must have. Steam is good, steam is great! Order your steamer today because your hair can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> The steam isn&#x27;t very powerful unless you leave on the high button in which case the steam runs out really quickly.  Even with just the low button the steam runs out in about 20 minutes.  Easy install but it drips a lot, even if you don&#x27;t overfill.  If you overfill then forget about it, it&#x27;s a flood. The steamer doesn&#x27;t use all the water so you always have the water half full which I really don&#x27;t like (collected old water from forever over time).  Already I am seeing some black bit floating around in there and not sure how to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I can get some steam out of this and I guess it&#x27;s better than the average alternative out there.  But don&#x27;t expect greatness.  Expect ok steam for about 20 minutes and have a towel below it to catch drips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist and my clients love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to assemble and came with instruction. And you they have a tutorial on YouTube on how to put the bottom together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give the steamer a 8/10. It does drip a little. I have my clients wear a cape.&lt;br /&gt;Half way filled it&#x27;ll stop steaming. I have to refill.&lt;br /&gt;And I accidentally over filled, it leaked a lot. I just let it steamed out. When you fill, make sure you don&#x27;t over fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for your hair it&#x27;s the best! My clients text me and tell me their hair never felt so soft and looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;And I process color with it and the color process faster and great for gray coverage.</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble, shipping was quick and not to mention the product is awesome on all textures of hair. Natural hair is included, it&#x27;s a miracle product! Would recommend to any one looking for an excellent steamer.</li>
    <li> I love this steamer.  I used it when pre-conditioning my hair with essential oils prior to shampooing my hair. After blowdrying - my hair was so shiny.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does drip a lot.  Be prepared.</li>
    <li> First off this review is for the PRODUCT and not the SELLER. The seller was awesome, the product unfortunately was not.&lt;br /&gt;Ther hair steamer simply did not work.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the sparse instructions to a tee and it was a no go. The power buttons didn&#x27;t even light up. I immediately contacted the seller, who after asking a few troubleshooting questions sent out a replacement hair steamer. The replacement, not only did not work, but emitted a hideous loud beeping noise when I plugged it up.&lt;br /&gt;I see they have a video on YT explaining how to assemble the base of the steamer, but they really need to have a video on the set up and operation of it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I granted 2 stars simply because the steamer didn&#x27;t not take up as much space as I thought it would. I just wish I got to use it.</li>
    <li> So my boyfriend got this for me as birthday gift and I am now using as I type for the first time. I absolutely love it. It looks fantastic, and it seems to be working well. He assembled it together but it seemed pretty simple. For those of you who may not have the instructions here is a pdf version http://www.salonguys.com/fileuploader/download/download/?d&#x3D;1&amp;file&#x3D;custom%2Fupload%2FFile-1399913009.pdf. I hope this helps. It gives step-by-step instructions on how to assemble it as well as how to use it eg (where the water goes). So far I love it! Great product. Will be sure to update if anything goes wrong.</li>
    <li> I  like the product it steams hair great. Only problem, I cannot figure out how to adjust it. It sits high and therefore have to stack books in order to get the full effect of the steamer.</li>
