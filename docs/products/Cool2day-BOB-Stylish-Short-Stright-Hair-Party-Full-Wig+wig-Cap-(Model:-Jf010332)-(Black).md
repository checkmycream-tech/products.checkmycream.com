      <li>I am satisfied with this wig it does the job.</li>

      <li>The overall length &amp; style is perfect.</li>
      <li>It looks mostly like the picture.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The product is okay.</li>

      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I bought another one, the same size and fitted me perfectly, but thi one didn&#x27;t even let me put my head in... :</li>

      <li>I most certainly will buy from this company again good quality style and price</li>
      <li>It has a nice feel to it, kind of feels close to my real hair.</li>
      <li>wow what a beautiful wig so cute i wear it every day and so cheap it save me alot of money</li>

      <li>My face is long so it fit perfectly .</li>

      <li>cheap is all i can say.</li>
      <li>the wig is nice but to much hair lost..</li>

      <li>it detangles easily and is fun and easy to wear.</li>
      <li>This product also did not look like a wig more of a straight cut bang look but it is easy to&lt;br /&gt;take care of.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>It took a while for it to arrive, but it was worth it!</li>
      <li>much better quality than I expected - Have worn it many times for costumes and outfits - still in pretty good shape after nights of partying and abuse.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the adjustable sizing of this wig, especially since I have a smaller head size than many people. It arrived before I expected it to. My favourite part about this wig is how soft and realistic it is!</li>
    <li> This unit looks very shiny and does not lay down like in the picture..its a bit sloppy on the head and cap is very large. would not order again .....Threw in trash ..</li>
    <li> Sheds alot and is hard to get wig to stay in place.The wig also tangles very easily.</li>
    <li> This wig sheds so much. The hairs are not tied properly and fall out in clumps. You can&#x27;t brush or comb it at all. I would advise you not to  buy this wig.</li>
    <li> not the color i order. looked like Plastic ugly didn&#x27;t even was to try it on put it in a bag and threw in the trash. Thought that would be cheaper then sending it back. very unhappy</li>
    <li> It took a while for it to arrive, but it was worth it! People who did not know me assumed it was my natural hair, while those who did asked me why I colored it! It was comfortable to wear all evening long, not too hot either! Made my Halloween!</li>
    <li> I loved the picture of this wig when I saw it online this is why I purchased it when it arrived I was more shocked to see that it was far more beautiful than the picture itself oh boy I most certainly will buy from this company again good quality style and price thank you for an excellent product</li>
    <li> The texture and feel of the wig is super soft; it almost feels like real hair!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it makes it easy to style and wear.</li>
    <li> It was very thin and the hair kept falling out and it doesn&#x27;t fit tye way it looks in the picture</li>
    <li> This thing sheds ALOT. I am afraid to use it. Not a good investment. But on the up side I received the product a lot sooner than I expected. Also my black turned out to be brown.</li>
    <li> I got such good remarks on this for Halloween. Now I wear it out on dates w my boyfriend for a change :)</li>
    <li> This wig is excellent. It&#x27;s thick, with life-like strands and absolutely wonderfully natural looking. It came within the estimated shipping time, and I have no problems with it at all. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this wig to any friends who come looking for an inexpensive but high quality wig!</li>
    <li> I like it no complaints I came when it said it would and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
    <li> The quality fits the picture, as does the style. No terrible surprises or dissatisfaction here. Easy to style and definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> It has a nice feel to it, kind of feels close to my real hair. BUT it is shorter than in the picture. It barley hit my chin length. I was disipointed in that but it is still cute. Im using it for a Halloween Costume.</li>
    <li> This wig is not what I expected .It doesn&#x27;t even look black plus it&#x27;s to straight It&#x27;s shedding strands and I haven&#x27;t even wore it because it looks to fake. I need to know how I can go about returning it I don&#x27;t want it. It&#x27;s not like the wig in the picture!</li>
    <li> Excellent wig, fits well. Came with a wig cap thing that helped to wrangle my hair, before putting it on. Wig is slightly shiny, but very realistic. Co workers thought I had cut and colired my long hair! I&#x27;m using in a Domino cosplay because it is the perfect style.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t come shaped like a bob but when I wanted to send it back, I did not received any problems from the seller.  so Kudos to them.  If you are handy with a razor then you can make it into a cute bob.</li>
    <li> This is a total &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; moment... This wig is TERRIBLE. It does NOT look like the picture for starters. Then the tracks literally started coming out in groups, like it was A family reunion. To top it all off, it started  burning my ear! Oh and it shade like crazy. You really get what you pay for when it comes to this wig. Could&#x27;ve used that money toward a charger.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to wear with my halloween costume. The quality was great and I got a lot if compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Bad quality hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not evenly cut nor did it resemble the picture shown.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy at all. I was really hoping that I could become a regular satisfied customer and&lt;br /&gt;would had loved to refer more customers.</li>
    <li> The wig is really not worth $15 I only paid 8 and I wish I had not the wig holds lots of static doesn&#x27;t look like the picture I can&#x27;t even get it to look decent enough to wear which really sucks I  was really looking forward to wearing the wig</li>
    <li> I really like this wig it is light weight and easy too manage , for a quick do I recommend this wig, thank you .</li>
    <li> Cheap and very cute wig, sheds and the cap is a little small but for the price I can deal with it.</li>
    <li> Very good wig. Shorter than I thought it would be but that&#x27;s my bad. :) it detangles easily and is fun and easy to wear.</li>
    <li> No clips inside.only bumer.otherwise great.</li>
    <li> cheap its already freezey after only wearing for 2 weeks</li>
    <li> This thing is hideous.  It honestly was like a mullet. It was horrid. Didn&#x27;t really matter I bought it to play a prank on my husband by making him think I cut my hair off but no way he would believe I&#x27;d cut it so badly and competley looked fake.</li>
    <li> Nice weight, looks just like the pic. I was pleased by the product, fast delivery. Low shedding cute with a head band.</li>
    <li> cheap is all i can say. when you brush it it started to shed like a cat! i would only use it as a costume wig cause trying to be cute with it is not it.</li>
    <li> So elegant &amp; sexy , aaa love it so much. My face is long so it fit perfectly .</li>
    <li> Very nice with good fit, but not very good quality .. since the strands out very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I totally over use my wig. Its been months since I bought it and I love it. Its starting to look it&#x27;s age so I think i&#x27;m in need of a new one.</li>
    <li> Everything was just wrong with this item.</li>
    <li> Was happy and very satisfied</li>
    <li> The worst dont recommend,  waste of time and money, it very low quality like a stringy dolls hair the really cheap dolls , exactly like that!</li>
    <li> Great wig and price it&#x27;s nice to find a short wig that looks good without paying over the top for it. Service was great ordered it late friday was at my door by monday and that was standard shipping. Cool2day has great service and I also ordered some other wigs from them can&#x27;t wait until they come. I will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> This wig is MUCH shorter than it shows in the pictures....only reaches just past my ears in the back and sides....pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> the hair arrived on time and in tact. it feels wonderful and real. the hair in the front was longer than i expected but with a pair of scissors that problem can be solved. All in all a good buy.</li>
    <li> In my original review I explained that the product received was slightly damaged. Since that time the  owner contact me personally to ensure I knew every option available. Maysu handled the situtation with such professinailism that I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase products from her company in the future.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2A7XRV72PYIG0]]Turn off the sound in my video. :) I basically just mumble to myself while showing you guys the wig (and I even try it on for you because Mom wasn&#x27;t available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought this for my mom, I really /did/ read the reviews that told of the wig&#x27;s shedding. I ignored those comments and bought the wig, regardless. They weren&#x27;t lying. It really DOES shed. Run your fingers through it as soon as it&#x27;s out of the package, and expect to find around 5 or so hairs with every other pass of your fingers. Because of this, try not to comb/manipulate it very often. This, however, is a good temporary/low-budget/final-resort/im-only-gonna-wear-this-thing-for-Easter-church-service-under-a-hat-once-a-year wig. If you have plans of keeping this wig long-term with extended periods of use/combing, it may not last as long as you wish. It&#x27;s very shiny (like Barbie-doll hair), but there&#x27;s a trick to reduce shine by using baby powder. Overall, it&#x27;s pretty nice for my mom&#x27;s intended use. Plus, it&#x27;s budget-friendly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: The bangs are abnormally long in the face (seriously... like a sheepdog), so wearing it at an angle (or cutting it) may be preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and by the way, because the wig is from China, expect a wait of one month and a half. :)</li>
    <li> the track are too lose in on the wig i even braid my hair under it as well as add clips and it still didn&#x27;t work. So I now wear the wig under a hat or something because it clearly don&#x27;t look great without something covering it.  Most of all it was cheap and that was the only good thing about it</li>
    <li> I wish it was a lot like the picture.  I could not do much with it, because it has such a plan look.  I would not purchase this wig ever again.  I gave it an OK rating, because its not really bad nor good, just OK.</li>
    <li> this would be my 12th wig.  I have purchased wigs from $6 to $60.  This is my second online wig purchase and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  It looks mostly like the picture.  The bangs are really long which is the only real difference but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s so that you can cut them to the length you want.  It is super soft and thick.  It is really shiny but once you put a little baby powder on it looks a little more natural.</li>
    <li> Ahhh love love love, the wig came in 2 weeks and looked great! My new summer hair. I love it so much</li>
    <li> Very cute wig to wear in the summer. It does have straps inside, it also came with a wig cap. It&#x27;s silky, VERY soft and not at all wiggy like most wigs are. Haven&#x27;t worn mines yet so I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll hold up all day but all in all I&#x27;d say this wig is pretty decent.</li>
    <li> The wig I ordered came in quickly and perfectly! It came with a wig cap which I never get so I was overhoyed about that, thanks again for the great wig for a great price!</li>
    <li> It was small for my head. I bought another one, the same size and fitted me perfectly, but thi one didn&#x27;t even let me put my head in... :(&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s ok. Quality is very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this wig it does the job. I would recommend it for everyday wear. Good value for the price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I just received my Bob wig today, and I tried it on right away. I haven&#x27;t worn it out, and at this point not sure I&#x27;ll be wearing it much at all. This wig is more for fun and costuming, maybe just a one time thing, so be prepared for that. I was more interested in a casual day wearing wig since I like the bob look but don&#x27;t want to cut my hair just yet. So just thought I&#x27;d try this because it was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came a week ahead of estimated delivery date; the delivery date is very long for this item however. I took it out of the package and tried to figure how to put it on for a while. I&#x27;ve just recently got into wigs, and the only others I have are both Freetress drawstring wigs -- more like halfwigs even though they say full cap...Anyway, I was getting kind of fustrated figuring out the front from back, since it wasn&#x27;t tagged, marked or come with directions. Once I finally sorted that out it was hard to figure how to get it on securely, only because I&#x27;m used to the wigs with combs and drawstrings. However, I think the cap is a little small, or at least could have been structured differently. It has two hooks on semi-elastic in the back that you hook together I guess, and that did help it feel a bit more secure; I think I&#x27;ll still need to pin it some how. Plus, since the wig is shorter in the back, I felt the wig cap wasn&#x27;t large enough to cover my hair pinned up in the back. Overall it looked nice. The biggest issue I have with this is the shedding! As soon as I took it out the package, I brushed it a little since it was kinda messy. A few strands; nothing drastic. I brushed again, very gentle and soft, while I was in the middle of figuring out how to get it on. After finally getting it on, I noticed a small weft had come out! Probably a piece of about 5 - 10 strands. By the time I had finished trying it on, two more pieces had come out, the same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shedding, I&#x27;m not sure how long this will last if worn a lot or just out and about ona regular day. But overall, the hair is nice, soft and not too wig looking for me at least. I&#x27;m black, but I think it still looks nice and not unrealistic. The color I ordered was black, and under certain light it did look like a very dark brown. This isn&#x27;t a problem, since in certain light, my natural hair looks the same too. I&#x27;d put the color of the black at a 1B/Black w/Brown mix equivalent. I really like the style. Hope this helps, and I may upload a picture of it later...I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again though...</li>
    <li> The wig came faster than expected and it was really soft and shiny, I  think it is one of the best black wigs I have ever bought!</li>
    <li> This product looks good when looking at it, but when I put it on it will not fall in place like the picture portrays. More than likely I will bless someone else with it. It might just be me don&#x27;t know how to fix it.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the picture. Just horrible; unwearable! This wig is like a Halloween horror party wig. A total disaster; belong in the trash.  Much too large and ugly. It seems that it was made for an huge elongated abnormal head. Some of the hair were incorrectly sewed in. Wig  shredding everywhere; jet black and very glossy/ shiny fake looking! Extremely poor quality. Wig shipped from China. The Seller is very resistant to give refund and demands that I take pictures of the wig and send to him. Reported problems to Amazon. Will NOT... NOT purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> horrible, it did not even fit my 7 yo...</li>
    <li> Hair is short and silky with a sheen. The look is just perfect. The package has a wig cap and hair looks natural.</li>
    <li> loved this wig......very stylish and CUTE...WILL BE ORDERING ANOTHER..MY SISTER LOVED IT SO MUCH...SHE STOLE IT LOL...DEFINETLY WOULD ORDER from company again.</li>
    <li> The wig was black and not that shiny.  There were a lot of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on the wig which covered everything.  It was soft and didn&#x27;t feel stringy.  The bangs were too long.  I tried pushing them to the side but wouldn&#x27;t stay.  When I finger combed the wig, the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; came off easily.</li>
    <li> I liked this wig, the bang was a little long so I had to cut it but over all it looked great on me.</li>
    <li> wow what a beautiful wig so cute i wear it every day and so cheap it save me alot of money i hope they more wigs</li>
    <li> This is a nice wig I wouldve looked very pretty in it if somebody didnt steal it from my door step yesterday!</li>
    <li> much better quality than I expected - Have worn it many times for costumes and outfits - still in pretty good shape after nights of partying and abuse.</li>
    <li> the wig is nice but to much hair lost..The colour I received was somewhat brown and not black..but the wig is workable</li>
    <li> I received the wig today in the mail and the product met my satisfaction. You cannot go wrong for the price. The quality is pretty good considering the price. The wig is playful and very cute! I am not sure how the wig will last, but I think if use a wig head, or turn it inside out when not in use it will be protected and will last longer. I would order from this Seller again in the future. If you are thinking about getting it this wig, go ahead and get it. I will upload pictures at a later date with me wearing the product.</li>
    <li> I somehow didn&#x27;t really like this wig but EVERYONE ELSE seemed to have liked it. I&#x27;m Afro American and have been transitioning to natural hair from relaxed/permed hair since February 2013. Everyone knows that it a pain when transitioning and trying to comb that hair (break a bunch of combs) so therefore I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of wigs- from my local beauty store, and various stores online. Out of the 6 wigs that I own from February until now April, this wig has gotten the most compliments. The reason I didn&#x27;t really like it was because I&#x27;m in the military and conflicting grooming standards prohibits the hair from falling below the collar and this wig falls below and it&#x27;s so silky that putting in a bun would be almost impossible. Therefore, if you&#x27;re not in the military and don&#x27;t have the problems that I did then this cute little bob is for you :)</li>
    <li> I bought this wig being cheap. Got what I paid for. Not only did this wig take a long time shipping to me (it comes from China just so you know) it was VERY,VERY SHINY. I wound up throwing it in my closet. SUPER straight &amp; it does look like a dark brown color as stated from previous raters.Not the 1b color I ordered. I prob would have to try to work on it to get it the way I would like it &amp; hoped it would be. It is NO where near african american hair texture. The girl who posted a video somehow managed with it. The overall length &amp; style is perfect. I will repost when I try to do some things to it to attempt to make it more better. Would I recommend it? Only if you of a descent of which your hair texture is that to very straight shiny hair,otherwise black ladies you will not be pleased, I think in my opinion. You will definitely need to use your bag of tricks on this one. Hope this review helped somewhat to anyone. Take care.</li>
    <li> This hair is nice for the price. Its my go to wig when I need to get to an event its very useful I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice, I love the style,  it came extremely fast &amp; it fit great ( not small at all)</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive bob for fun and costume!  Has decent coverage at the scalp and the hair is soft and tossable.. doesn&#x27;t knot easy either because the hair is on the silky side! The bangs seemed long on me, they could have been side swept bangs but I trimmed the bangs for a blunt bang look! Super cute and sassy.</li>
    <li> I like the glamorous looking cut and style of the wig but the hair is too straight and silky for an african american. It looks too fake or maybe it cld be the fact that the seller&#x27;s black really is a brown. I ordered black and received a dark brown.  Shipping was within&#x27; a pretty descent time frame.</li>
    <li> make is small but still good product</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for the first time and it was amazing and I loved the length and how it didn&#x27;t tangle as much as my other ones. I decided to order a second one the same color Black even though they both look dark brown. The second wig  I got today was not the same length as the first one I received. I know it is a bob, but it is very short and I am disappointed with that. I won&#x27;t be purchasing another one any time soon.</li>
    <li> The product is okay. For how long it took to get here and what the actual product looks like for my taste i will rate it just an okay. I think i will have to think really hard before i order again from this seller. The best thing about ordering from this seller is the packaging. It was excellent. The box inside was even wrapped with a beautiful red ribbon.  The packaging gets 2 thumbs up, Superb excellent rating.</li>
    <li> Wig was light and comfortable. Style was not great. Wig was described as black mine had reddish brown highlights. I would recommend wig to others.</li>
    <li> Just received this today and Immediately put it on! It fits like a glove! Its not to hot! I looks really and was Just as pictured!!! I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> One big no no is it sheds a lot I really like the style and the color but the shedding is a bit too much</li>
    <li> This did not arrive to me with the wig cap. This product also did not look like a wig more of a straight cut bang look but it is easy to&lt;br /&gt;take care of.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It worked well with minor altering to become a pompadour.</li>
    <li> I Loved this wig. Everything except for the shininess. Of course that&#x27;s expected for a synthetic wig BUT for this value it is great. I recommend, for the shine, shampoo(any kind) ONLY, no conditioner, and then sprinkle a bit of powder(any kind) on the palm of your hands and run them over the wig. VOILA! Looks like a human wig and sometimes I flip the wig and wear it like that because it is a layered wig that way. So you can either wear a bob or a wrap. 4 STARS! Loved it! Highly recommended.</li>
