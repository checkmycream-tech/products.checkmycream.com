    <li> This stuff does what it promises, even on my overtreated, frizzy, long hair.  I love it, but it&#x27;s easy to use a little too much and end up with stringy hair.  So 4 stars for the learning curve, and the misleading &amp;#34;apply generously&amp;#34; directions.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair soft and very shinny!! It smells fantastic and the price is oh so right!</li>
    <li> Not heavy, I use a &amp;#34;nickel size&amp;#34; amount in my hand on wet hair.  Works great and makes my hair shine.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. You have to use this &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; sparingly as it can cause your hair to look greasy. It is much like the well known biosilk, but with more natural ingredients. I will purchase this again. Hair is shiny without damaging ingredients. With all these types of products, you have to reapply to keep the shine.</li>
    <li> I have clip in human hair extensions and most of the time they are frzzy after washing. But this serum is the icing to a cake! When i use this guess what....no more frizzies! And i absolutely adore the scent of this! It has a nice fresh flower smell to it. It leaves my hair super silky just like the Chi serum...only difference is that its about half the price of Chi. Best serum ever! Works just like a salon product! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
    <li> Omg.....my hair new best friend, love this product....I have nappy brittolike...afro texture n this serum has my hair feeling sooooo soft...I just follow the direction on the label.... so all you natural hair who decide not to perm your natural hair should try this follow the direction, no harsh ingredient, no paraban so Im happy</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product for shiny hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m white, my hair is semi straight/wavy. The smell of this Serum is undesirable. I was repulsed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is heavy/thick and even though I followed the instructions and applied it on damped hair&lt;br /&gt;(4 different times after I washed my hair), it felt heavy and my hair got fluffed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my straightener and my hair still felt heavy, sticky and it looked greasy and dirty when actually my&lt;br /&gt;hair is naturally dry.  Needless to say I am not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t like the one I used before. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. Waste of money. Should&#x27;ve bought the other brand.. smells good though</li>
    <li> all I like is the smell. Its very runny, which makes it hard to determine how much is enough, or how much is too much. If you&#x27;ve ever used the good stuff, stay with it.</li>
    <li> A great alternative to Biosilk</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product! It only takes a small amount to see immediate results - really makes my hair soft and adds shine</li>
    <li> Lovely stuff.  My old salt and pepper locks will shine sleekly now.  As long as I remember, less is more.  Start with ONE drop.  Add more if you insist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve of the serum bottles wasn&#x27;t packed right ant it spilled all over the shipment. But I love the product anyway!</li>
    <li> My hair is really frizzy and I have problems keeping it &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; during my work day, but this product works well for my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! Makes my hair literally silky smooth and I have thick curly out of control hair. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Controls my frizz and curls without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> This hair serum does not work on my 3B nautural hair. I use enough and i still have lots of frizzy hair ! I dont recommend this product for 3b type hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes hair smooth and silky. the smell is great too. You have to be careful to not use too much or hair could look greasy.</li>
    <li> I like the smell it helps the frizz on my wavy to curly hair. Does the job love the price.</li>
    <li> I have really frizzie long hair and I always try different products on my hair to take the frizz away but nothing has work. I&#x27;m so tired of always having to put hairspay on my hair or having to use heat on my hair to control it.So, I decided to use this product since i saw great review on it. And let me tell u IT WORKS! I only have 3 days applying this product and I really like it! It leaves your hair soft with shine and my split ends dont look as dry.Unlike other hair serum this one doesnt leave your hair greasy and oily that it goes to your face. It just blends in more naturaly. I really recommend this product to anyone that is trying to get ride of dry frizzie hair!! :)</li>
    <li> I love it.  Makes your hair smooth and helps with frizz.  Also helps with split ends.  its a great product.</li>
    <li> Hair is hard to figure out.  I thought mine was mostly straight until I started letting it air dry and realized it was, in fact, wavy.  And then rather than a curl enhancing product, I found I preferred this silk drop serum.  It keeps my hair from looking frizzy or crunchy, two pluses in my book.</li>
    <li> Best serum ever!  Does not make hair, even fine hair, too greasy and is easy to apply and style with</li>
    <li> This is such a great product if you have split ends or dry hair. If you have curly hair it&#x27;s awesome for this type of hair</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but was having trouble finding it locally.  Makes my hair shiny and less fly-away.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this product. It tames my frizzy hair especially in the humid summer months.</li>
