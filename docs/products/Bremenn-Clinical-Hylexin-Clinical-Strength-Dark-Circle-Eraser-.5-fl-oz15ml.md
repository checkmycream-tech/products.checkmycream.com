### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Can be drying so use your best moisturizer!</li>
      <li>So I was very happy to find that cream, it made sense to me, I guess,</li>
      <li>This stuff works great!</li>
      <li>Prompt delivery and very effective product!</li>
      <li>feels it is very effective</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I had read some good reviews about it.</li>
      <li>Good luck :-)</li>
      <li>it is so effective for me that i can tell if i skip a couple of days.</li>
      <li>I do need to use it every day, but since I rarely use foundation and consealer in my make up routine, this is great.</li>
      <li>You do have to use it every day for best results but it will produce results if used the night before the big event.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the one thing i wouldnt be caught without, absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Must use daily to achieve the best result.</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t meet the expectations of so many customers that I can&#x27;t find it in the department stores in my area.  </li>
      <li>, the concealer does a much better job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad the cost came</li>
      <li>What better testimony could you want?</li>
      <li>It would be interesting to compare the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many product and none of them ever made a difference in the colour.</li>
      <li>I laughed because the family trip had been very stressful</li>
      <li>Do not believe in the bogus positive reviews written by people from the company!!!</li>
      <li>If you want to avoid wrinkles and fine lines, get a moisturizer, not this.  </li>
      <li>so different things will often give great results to some and none to others.  </li>
      <li>I did notice a light improvement</li>
      <li>I can now tell you that Neocutis Lumiere works great on my fine lines, and Teamine is totally amazing for puffiness, but neither one has improved the black-and-blue color (which got worse after I stopped using Hylexin).  </li>
      <li>It applies easy, lasts awhile, doesn&#x27;t smell or look funny and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you for a super product.</li>
      <li>honestly don&#x27;t think anything topical is going to correct the circles under my eyes</li>
      <li>The only thing I note is a slightly warm feeling in the area when the cream is applied.  </li>
      <li>I have had good success with other products from this company, but not this one.</li>
      <li>I definitely agree that this is the best product for dark circles giving visible results within a couple of weeks of usage.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would be more apparent after using it for a year.</li>
      <li>Then about 5-6 years ago I saw some good reviews on an Avon product for dark circles</li>
      <li>Good resource for those of us with asthma black eyes during allergy season</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a make up treatment from Loreal that has the same ingredients and actually works as a concealer for 10 bucks and works great</li>
      <li>full Egyptian decent and one Jewish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have not finished my first tube though.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this despite the mixed reviews because I am sure there must be something out</li>
      <li>(Don&#x27;t know exactly how many, but my last purchase was in Nov 2011</li>
      <li>I have used $10 products from local drug stores with better results.  </li>
      <li>this is my personal FAVORITE of everything i use.  </li>
      <li>I love Hylexin and use it daily and have been using it for years.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m back on Amazon to order more Hylexin.</li>
      <li>in fact it made the circles seem darker or blacker where as before they were more red and easier to cover up.</li>
      <li>Hylexin actually made the skin better or stronger.</li>
      <li>(Easy to say, less easy to do, right?)  </li>
      <li>My dark circles are not gone at 3 weeks but about 50% lighter and the moisturizing effects are also nice.</li>
      <li>Offered at at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Will definitely purchase again as it is well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I figured that would be better than any of the other products I had tried.</li>
      <li>I  intend to keep using it as long as it is available.  </li>
      <li>you have dark circles and puffy eyes because of a lack of sleep, don&#x27;t get Hylexin, get more sleep.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised much, nothing has really worked for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>a little goes a looooooong way :)</li>
      <li>- you really have to be consistent and use it twice daily.</li>
      <li>I keep getting complements and people asked what I am doing new.</li>
      <li>I told him it must be my new eye cream.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge waste of money, especially since it costs sooooo much!  </li>
      <li>It has significantly reduced dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this product&#x27;s promises were too good to be true because there was absolutely no change whatsoever after using it.</li>
      <li>I noticed SIGNIFICANT improvement in less than 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve reordered it for her frequently</li>
      <li>I can see some improvement, but I bet I could find something much cheaper that gave me the same results.</li>
      <li>Sometimes in the morning when tired the skin under my eyes feels warm after applying it.  </li>
      <li>But for now, I feel like there is no hydration, just a strange oily-like residue.&lt;br /&gt;Not feeling too positive. . .</li>
      <li>However, after the first several months of using it TWICE a day, I did notice an definite improvement.  </li>
      <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t help that the initial price was more than $100 for a small 15 ml</li>
      <li>It really does help with those dark circles so much that I don&#x27;t have to use concealer.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way for me and the 15 ml tube can last for many months.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little more than one month and it has lightened the dark areas somewhat.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t look as tired and look more refreshed around the eye area.  </li>
      <li>Will not eliminate my extremely and hereditary dark circles but is the first product to significantly diminish them so a little cover-up and powder and they disappear.</li>
      <li>I always had dark circles no matter how much sleep.</li>
      <li>the price is half that much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a middle eastern woman I bought this hoping to find a real solution for my dark circles.</li>

<li> This is the only product to work for two male friends that had severe dark circles from hereditary issues.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles since my early teens (now 49) but never tried any products to address them other than concealer.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep using it,it&#x27;s the only cream for dark circles that might actually work for people like me who suffer from hereditary dark circles.</li>

<li> I have hereditary dark circles which were present since I can remember.</li>
<li> Not for occasional dark circles.  </li>
<li> but then the next day they are dark again.</li>
<li> It was related to having very sensitive and thin skin under my eyes</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps my dark circles!  </li>

<li> It does not work instantly like consealer, but I put it on and 20 minutes later when I am walking out the door, no more dark circles under my eyes.</li>
<li> Also I went to my dermatologist and she said those kinds of creams never really work.  </li>
<li> However consider this the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; version of other over- priced products which tout a similar outcome: little or lessened dark circles.</li>
<li> Not only did it help a little, it helped a lot!</li>
<li> I have to agree with all the other ladies: It does not work.</li>
<li> Does seem to have some effect on dark circles.</li>
<li> I had really dark circles under my eyes for over 30 years.</li>
<li> I am not thrilled with the consistency of this cream it is similar to hemorrhoid creams and I have heard that make ups artists do use Preparation H ( I think that is what he hemorrhoid cream is called) to cover under eye bags and discolorations.</li>
<li> I used this product as prescribed day &amp; night, my dark circles did not changed a bit</li>
<li> I thought that it just might help eliminate some of the dark coloring under my eyes.</li>
<li> Been using this for awhile (4 months) for dark circles under my eyes and it has not helped noticeably at all.  </li>
<li> Used for over a month &amp; there was no difference with my dark circles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this very expensive eye cream to get rid of my dark circles and after a month of use there is NO change!  Also I went to my dermatologist and she said those kinds of creams never really work.  It&#x27;s a huge waste of money, especially since it costs sooooo much!  I returned mine and luckly got my money back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle eastern woman I bought this hoping to find a real solution for my dark circles. I have been using Hylexin for two months and let me tell you, it works! I can see that my dark circles are less noticeable. I&#x27;ll keep using it,it&#x27;s the only cream for dark circles that might actually work for people like me who suffer from hereditary dark circles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this despite the mixed reviews because I am sure there must be something out that to minimize my dark circles and bags. Just received it yesterday, so have only used twice, last night and again this morning. I am not thrilled with the consistency of this cream it is similar to hemorrhoid creams and I have heard that make ups artists do use Preparation H ( I think that is what he hemorrhoid cream is called) to cover under eye bags and discolorations. It would be interesting to compare the ingredients. of course I have seen no results after just two applications, didn&#x27;t expect to, so will update after one month of use. But for now, I feel like there is no hydration, just a strange oily-like residue.&lt;br /&gt;Not feeling too positive. . .</li>
    <li> I have to agree with all the other ladies: It does not work. I really want to get rid of my bad circles so so so badly. So I was very happy to find that cream, it made sense to me, I guess, oh well, I tried. I should have done something else with my money. It does not work at all. Try to cover your dark circles, there is quiet a lot of stuff out there that covers well. That&#x27;s my advice. Good luck :-)</li>
    <li> I definitely agree that this is the best product for dark circles giving visible results within a couple of weeks of usage. Will definitely purchase again as it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have to use prescription eye drops.  One of the unfortunate side effects is that the drops darken your undereye area.  This creme is amaxing and has lightened up the area.  I no longer look tired and worn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this used to be quite expensive.  I&#x27;m glad the cost came down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - you really have to be consistent and use it twice daily.</li>
    <li> Not for occasional dark circles.  Must use as directed twice daily --- forever.  Will not eliminate my extremely and hereditary dark circles but is the first product to significantly diminish them so a little cover-up and powder and they disappear. I keep getting complements and people asked what I am doing new.</li>
    <li> I think I reviewed this product before but maybe it was under a different Hylexin product listing because I don&#x27;t see my review.  So I&#x27;m chiming in here.  I&#x27;ve had dark circles since my early teens (now 49) but never tried any products to address them other than concealer.  Then about 5-6 years ago I saw some good reviews on an Avon product for dark circles so I bought some.  After a couple of months I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement, so I decided to try Hylexin based on the admittedly hyped-up ads.  I actually noticed some improvement after just a couple of weeks.  Coming back to work after a very brief family trip, a male co-worker told me I looked rested.  I laughed because the family trip had been very stressful and I hadn&#x27;t gotten any rest at all.  I told him it must be my new eye cream.  I kept using the Hylexin until the tube was used up, but I decided to try a different product for a couple of reasons:  (1) the Hylexin started to separate in the tube, so it would squeeze out as an oily mess, and (2) I wanted to see if I could get similar results for a little less money.  I can now tell you that Neocutis Lumiere works great on my fine lines, and Teamine is totally amazing for puffiness, but neither one has improved the black-and-blue color (which got worse after I stopped using Hylexin).  So I&#x27;m back on Amazon to order more Hylexin.</li>
    <li> I have alway had dark circles, that have gotten worse lately. I hoped to see some improvement in a 4-6 weeks but.... I noticed slight lightening in 2 DAYS !!! I noticed SIGNIFICANT improvement in less than 2 weeks. My dark circles are not gone at 3 weeks but about 50% lighter and the moisturizing effects are also nice.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my eye area just days after I started to apply Hylexin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am diligent and I apply it twice a day as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on and off over the years and it&#x27;s always worked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months, twice a day and it just doesn&#x27;t work on my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye cream to address my dark circles. i chanced upon this on a sale (75% off) at a beauty bazzar. worked for me and for a friend who tried mine. a little goes a looooooong way :)</li>
    <li> Regrettably I have not seen any improvement in my dark circles.  I have been using it twice a day for three weeks.  Perhaps it takes longer before improvement is seen.</li>
    <li> This is the only product to work for two male friends that had severe dark circles from hereditary issues.&lt;br /&gt;One full Egyptian decent and one Jewish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No product will work the same on everyone, but on my two former raccoon look a likes, this did the trick and quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a super product.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eye and this did nothing for them. Not worth spending the money for it.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks . This cream has not worked for me. I wasn&#x27;t surprised much, nothing has really worked for me. My dark circles come from my grandma. I did notice a light improvement but then the next day they are dark again. I will keep using for a bit longer will see how that goes. Have not finished my first tube though.  Overall some could benefit from this cream.</li>
    <li> Must use daily to achieve the best result. However consider this the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; version of other over- priced products which tout a similar outcome: little or lessened dark circles.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  Are they kidding me?  I have used $10 products from local drug stores with better results.  I have been using for 45 days and see no results at all.  This product must not have been tested because it simply &amp;#34;Does Not Work&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK!  very disappointing; used as directions stated, but did absolutely nothing... big waste of money!  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product has done nothing on me. I&#x27;ve been constantly using it for over a month now.. And I see no change at all. There&#x27;s a make up treatment from Loreal that has the same ingredients and actually works as a concealer for 10 bucks and works great, You can get it at Walgreens or cvs. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Been using this for awhile (4 months) for dark circles under my eyes and it has not helped noticeably at all.  I only paid $20 at the time when I purchased it but I notice it is up to $45 now, I would have been really disappointed if I had paid that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t think anything topical is going to correct the circles under my eyes but I am hoping something at least helps.  This did nothing for me but perhaps this does and will work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with the product besides the fact that it didn&#x27;t help my circles.  It applies easy, lasts awhile, doesn&#x27;t smell or look funny and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product multiple times.  I have been using it for years.  What better testimony could you want?</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and very effective product!</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in using this product. Maybe it would be more apparent after using it for a year.</li>
    <li> I have hereditary dark circles which were present since I can remember. I don&#x27;t think anything can cure them.. I used this product as prescribed day &amp; night, my dark circles did not changed a bit and I can say it irritated my undereye area and made it worse!! Do not believe in the bogus positive reviews written by people from the company!!! THIS CREAM DOES NOTHING! HEREDITARY DARK CIRCLES CAN NOT BE CURED.</li>
    <li> I had really dark circles under my eyes for over 30 years. I tried everything on the market. Nothing worked. I mean NOTHING. When I purchased Hylexin all I had was hopes of this product helping a little. I figured that would be better than any of the other products I had tried. Boy was I wrong! Not only did it help a little, it helped a lot! I won&#x27;t be without it ever. I use it every day and always keep a spare in my makeup drawer. I am in my 70&#x27;s and if it can help me, I have no doubt it will help you.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time and I&#x27;ve reordered it for her frequently</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the miracle product.  I can see some improvement, but I bet I could find something much cheaper that gave me the same results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x60;t work at all actually made my dark circles look worse. I have delicate thin skin under my eyes and this didn&#x60;t work in fact it made the circles seem darker or blacker where as before they were more red and easier to cover up.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It does not work instantly like consealer, but I put it on and 20 minutes later when I am walking out the door, no more dark circles under my eyes. I do need to use it every day, but since I rarely use foundation and consealer in my make up routine, this is great.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a year.  It produces visible results.  Can be drying so use your best moisturizer! You do have to use it every day for best results but it will produce results if used the night before the big event.  I use it at night with Regenerist moisturizer.  Good resource for those of us with asthma black eyes during allergy season</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years now. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps my dark circles!  Even coverup didn&#x27;t do it. But this does--of course I need to use it regularly--which I don&#x27;t always do!</li>
    <li> I have had good success with other products from this company, but not this one. I used as directed for over 4 months. No change. I&#x27;ve had bad circles most of my adult life. This is not the fix.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little more than one month and it has lightened the dark areas somewhat.  The only thing I note is a slightly warm feeling in the area when the cream is applied.  I don&#x27;t look as tired and look more refreshed around the eye area.  I&#x27;ve  noticed since using Hylexin, the concealer does a much better job.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  As a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t meet the expectations of so many customers that I can&#x27;t find it in the department stores in my area.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t help that the initial price was more than $100 for a small 15 ml tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the price is half that much and I buy it online.  A little goes a long way for me and the 15 ml tube can last for many months.  (Don&#x27;t know exactly how many, but my last purchase was in Nov 2011 and I&#x27;m still using it now in August of 2012.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dark circles and puffy eyes because of a lack of sleep, don&#x27;t get Hylexin, get more sleep.  (Easy to say, less easy to do, right?)  If you want to avoid wrinkles and fine lines, get a moisturizer, not this.  If, on the other hand, you have thin skin and delicate capillaries under the eyes, this may work for you.  At least it does for me.  Very gently applying a little of this under the eyes lessens my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hylexin doesn&#x27;t reduce puffiness or wrinkles and I don&#x27;t believe it claims to.  On the other hand, for a small percentage of people (and I&#x27;m lucky to be one of them) it does reduce the darkness of the circles under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Hylexin has not cured my dark circles.  However, after the first several months of using it TWICE a day, I did notice an definite improvement.  Before Hylexin, I looked like a dead zombie.  After several years of use, I still have dark circles, but they are not as dark as before.  I won&#x27;t stop using Hylexin because I don&#x27;t want to go back to that \\&quot;dead\\&quot; look.  So this will lighten your dark circles by a few shades, but not eliminate them.  I tried several other products, and they made my dark circles worse.  This product also removes all puffiness from your eyes.</li>
    <li> i believe all of the reviews here and, unfortunately, i have learned that skin is so different things will often give great results to some and none to others.  this is my personal FAVORITE of everything i use.  it is so effective for me that i can tell if i skip a couple of days. i actually stopped using concealer after i found it.  a tube lasts me close to a year so the expense isnt bad from that perspective. id encourage people to buy from a place like sephora where you can return it and try something else if this doesnt do it for you.  it&#x27;s the one thing i wouldnt be caught without, absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Used for over a month &amp; there was no difference with my dark circles.</li>
    <li> My wife asks me to buy this.. she is Asian.. feels it is very effective</li>
    <li> I love Hylexin and use it daily and have been using it for years.  It really does help with those dark circles so much that I don&#x27;t have to use concealer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had read some good reviews about it. I thought that it just might help eliminate some of the dark coloring under my eyes. Unfortunately, this product&#x27;s promises were too good to be true because there was absolutely no change whatsoever after using it. This is definitely a beauty treatment to pass up. Please save your money so that you don&#x27;t have to experience the same disappointment.</li>
    <li> Does seem to have some effect on dark circles.</li>
    <li> It does what it promised. I always had dark circles no matter how much sleep. It was related to having very sensitive and thin skin under my eyes but Hylexin actually helped. I have tried so many product and none of them ever made a difference in the colour. Hylexin actually made the skin better or stronger. All I know is that it is not for people with darker under eyes because they didn&#x27;t sleep well or partied hard. It is actually a fix and a cure for us who did everything to have those rested eyes but we never did because we were born with them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It has significantly reduced dark circles under my eyes.  I put a very small amount on in the morning and before bed.  Sometimes in the morning when tired the skin under my eyes feels warm after applying it.  The product works and I  intend to keep using it as long as it is available.  Highly recommended.  Offered at at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> helps a little bit...but have to use it non-stop or effects wear off</li>
</ol>
