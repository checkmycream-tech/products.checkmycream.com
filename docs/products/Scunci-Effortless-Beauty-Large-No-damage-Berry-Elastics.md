<li> I thought these were the thin elastics</li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to explain in writing, but once you stretch them out, they don&#x27;t feel as elastic anymore.  </li>
<li> /&gt;So unhappy with that.</li>
<li> I hate the process of return and exchange, otherwise I would return it and ask for a refund.</li>

<ol>
    <li> havent had any break on me</li>
    <li> These are OK; they are not as thick as some others I&#x27;ve tried (I think my last pack was Goody).  It&#x27;s difficult to explain in writing, but once you stretch them out, they don&#x27;t feel as elastic anymore.  Also, they seem to break a bit easier than Goody.</li>
    <li> It was good for my hair, it didn&#x27;t break or snag but I had to use two of them to hold my very thick thick curly hair. If I use one or won&#x27;t hold my hair tight. Good purchase good brand I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The colors are okay, but the rubber inside must be very old, it does not stretch like it is supposed to, it hurts my fingers trying to stretch it open, and it it not at all elastic. I hate the process of return and exchange, otherwise I would return it and ask for a refund. I will remember not to buy anything online which is expected to degrade over the years.</li>
    <li> I thought these were the thin elastics but it turns out they are the 4mm ones.  Nice, just wish the size had been clearer.</li>
    <li> For some reason, us girls are ALWAYS losing these, I&#x27;m a mom of two girls, and I love these.. this is the best hair elastic out there.. my girls and I have thick, curly hair that is prone to breakage and lots of tangles. These have no metal on them which means no hair breakage or snags! Love them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, don&#x27;t tear my long hair.  Hold well.  Pretty colors.  Well made.</li>
    <li> My 3 girls love to have their hair &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; but often rip it out halfway through the day and loose the hair ties. These are an economical and pretty replacement. We&#x27;ll be back, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Am I really reviewing hair elastics? Yes I am. They are great! highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought it only because the colors on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;What I received was nothing like it - totally different colors.&lt;br /&gt;Why there is no choice which colors we are purchasing?&lt;br /&gt;So unhappy with that.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> These snag-free hair ties will hold even the thickest hair, and they last a good long while before wearing out.</li>
    <li> I love these elastic bands for long hair, no sharp parts to break off hair.</li>
    <li> My girls and I all have long thick hair and we love these. These are the only hair ties that don&#x27;t rip out a bunch of hair but will hold all of our hair.</li>
    <li> Nice colors and handy.  Docked two stars because they stretch out waaaay too fast!</li>
    <li> Love these! They have good stretch, keep their stretch over time and don&#x27;t have metal or a big ugly seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the different colors offered and my daughter likes that they don&#x27;t pull her hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, A BIT OVERPRICED COMPARED TO THE STORE</li>
    <li> These bands were just as I ordered.  The correct thickness and do not contain the metal piece, so they are gentle on your hair.</li>
    <li> These Scunci elastics are great. Soft covering yet still a nice strong hold. I have popped a couple, but I have quite a few of these elastics so a few popping is not a big deal. I still feel these elastics are a great buy and a product. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> good quanlity,i like them, but the black is too less.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and they hold really well. I love that there is no metal. It seems that is where they usually break down and the elastic goes. I haven&#x27;t had these long enough to say how long they will last but for now, I love them.</li>
