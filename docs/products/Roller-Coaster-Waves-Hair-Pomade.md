    <li> This bottle is going to last me for a while. A little dab goes a long way and stays manageable and keeps that wet look all day. Oh and it smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t as good most people claimed i was very disappointed i wish it did live up to the hype...</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells amazing &amp; feels soft &amp; creamy. Not a fan of wave grease. If you prefer the cream, you should get it.</li>
    <li> When u use the product consistently it will work and keep ur hair down which is what u want. Smells good and non greasy so ill recommend this product just stay with it and results will come.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade. I was expecting something that I have used before as far as pomades are concerned. I was pleasantly surprised that it is actually a cream...a nice thick one. A lil&#x27; dab will do you and it smells great. This has officially become a hair product staple for me. Thanks to all who responded to my question and your great reviews because you&#x27;re the reason I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Would definitely buy another one</li>
    <li> Good s*** highly recommended</li>
    <li> it smells good but other than that it does not work for me</li>
    <li> I realize that its primarily for wave styles but this stuff is great for all hair styles, especially if you have natural curls and wish to maintain and condition your hair.  It keeps hair strong and shining with a natural sheen with very good ingredients like Vitamin E, Aloe Vera and Shea.  I may add a touch of one and only Argan styling lotion after it, give it all a good rub into my roots and scalp, brush or go and I&#x27;m good...hair is strong and growing with this combo.  No complaints and ordering my second jar now.</li>
    <li> Lays my hair down easily and smells great also</li>
    <li> Does not hold that good. Waves are the same.</li>
    <li> At first I didnt see a big difference in results. I would say after 2 weeks (one haircut) is when I started noticing a change and my hair started to wave up. But at my 4 week mark (two haircuts) is when i sae the biggest difference. I NEVER HAD WAVES AND NOW I DO!!! Extremely excited about this product, smells amazing and not clumpy or thick.</li>
    <li> Great and smells awesome</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  Works well with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have slightly wavy hair and was hoping this helped! All it does for me is leave a residue I have to wash out my hair after a few days. Brushing your hair multiple times a day usually works but the reviews sold me to give this a try. Not impressed but love the smell. If you have wavy hair it may work!</li>
    <li> Love it, moisturizing without being too heavy. I use it on my sons and me - unisex.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, added shine to my waves and kept them silky smooth.  And the smell is out of this world.  To all my &amp;#34;wavers&amp;#34; out there, check this stuff out.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!! When you put it in your hair it makes your hair soft, then when you take your du rag off in the morning, it&#x27;s even softer. This makes your hair easier to curl up. I recommend this to ALL serious wavers.</li>
