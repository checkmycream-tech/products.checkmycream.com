### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOVE IT !!!!</li>
      <li>The Best brightening lotion I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>the best!</li>
      <li>This medication working great after 1 month the change is incredible!</li>
      <li>The packaging is beautiful but it did not work at all.</li>
      <li>I use this every night and since I started using it, which is about 2 weeks ago, I see great results already.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to report</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>GOOD LUCK.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist had me on hydroquinone for years, telling me it was the best product available for melasma.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
      <li>It is safe and effective!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing, but takes some time.</li>
      <li>amazingly so--</li>
      <li>For all I know it could be an effective generic.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
      <li>BUT I DO ALWAYS STILL KEEP ONE HANDY</li>
      <li>use this lotion in the morning and add sunscreen on top of it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why these sophisticated fraudsters changed the name from \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; to \\&quot;brightening\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I will have to use it longer to see more improvements.</li>
      <li>I have used many products to lighten my age spots that have helped, but are not even close to how well this works.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I am pleased as punch.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>and I know there is more &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; in there even when it won&#x27;t pump anymore.</li>
      <li>you decide to go with the Elure, make sure you use it one to two times per day (I recommend morning AND night).</li>
      <li>The design copy is sophisticated--</li>
      <li>Elure has done more for me in 6 months than her fancy prescription cream did in 2 years.</li>
      <li>Best part is my Doc says I can continue using it as long as I wanted, it is safe.</li>
      <li>I like this - and the two step process works fine (I like the pump better than the compartments on their night cream).</li>
      <li>The Amazon email and packing slips, like the site, promised Advanced Whitening Lotion.  </li>
      <li>For that price, all should work smoothly.</li>
      <li>and I like how light it is.  </li>
      <li>Although it looks like elure, it calls itself Advanced &#x27;Brightening&#x27; Lotion--which does not exist.  </li>
      <li>but the skin became more luminous which is even better and more natural.</li>
      <li>very smooth and light skin, I like this product very much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and have noticed a significant improvement in the melasma on my forehead.</li>
      <li>I went through two bottles and saw no difference in the spots, although it made my skin look nice in general.</li>
      <li>What you will notice first, after 2 or 3 weeks, is that your complexion appears much brighter and more luminous.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really mad</li>
      <li>Worth the money if I had it.  </li>
      <li>This formula is completely non-irritating and literally produces no sensation after application, unless you happen to be allergic to it like another reviewer, which is not the product&#x27;s fault, bythe way :).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying for yourself.</li>
      <li>To be fair to the product, I didn&#x27;t buy any of the other &amp;#34;accompanying&amp;#34; products so maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much of a result from just using this lotion.  </li>
      <li>If you decide to buy this be aware: skincarerx or elure itself</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>The first bottle was purchased from my a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>Outstanding product the ONE and ONLY to deliver on the promise to improve skin tone!</li>
      <li>if used consistently it does work.</li>
      <li>big as most everyone has pigment issues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>&#x27;Saw this in Allure magazine a few months ago, supposedly good for knocking out sun spots, etc, but it did nothing at all for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 36, blonde and very fair complected, and I began to develop sun spots on my forehead a few years ago, although I still don&#x27;t have any visible lines.</li>
      <li>My skin is like a baby&#x27;s clear, clean and glowing.  </li>
      <li>Give this product for 5 star,its really great,though i still not use it.</li>
      <li>I will just be more careful when making online purchases.</li>
      <li>AS DIRECTED AND UP TO 8 WEEKS STRAIGHT.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t get paid that much.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>have been using it for 2 months now and it has really made a difference.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t fall for this, or check this product closely when it arrives to see what it really is.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much clearer and rosier</li>
      <li>You MUST use sunblock- the higher, the better- absolutely everyday</li>
      <li>I have ordered these twice to make sure I used them long enough to see if they worked as they said they would</li>
      <li>or you will develop new hyperpigmentation.</li>
      <li>I first bought it from my Dermatologist, but bought it on Amazon when I was getting low.</li>
      <li>I have been using Elure Advanced Brightening for almost 3 weeks and it seems to be lightening my dark spots with some just disappearing completely.  </li>
      <li>I DID NOT SEE ANY MARKED DIFFERENCE.  </li>
      <li>I found another site which offers hydroquonine 4%</li>
      <li>I need to have it fixed.  </li>
      <li>My old scars are lighter.</li>
      <li>It also has really fast results, only a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>After this experience I would be leery of buying any skin products on Amazon, especially if they seem like real bargains.  </li>
      <li>In the past I used strong products like hydroquinone and never had anything like that.</li>
      <li>Wish I had found this skin care regimen in my early 20s but better late than never!</li>
      <li>aware that Amazon does not appear to exercise even minimal fraud control.  </li>
      <li>I still get breakouts but applying this daily has lessened the intensity of new scars as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you can afford it, I highly recommend a Fotofacial, or series of Fotofacials, as the procedure is more expensive but will provide instantaneous results.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all so far after using it twice daily.  </li>
      <li>I spent so much money</li>
      <li>This just proves that just because a product is expensive doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>works really well on dark circles under eyes.  </li>
      <li>No new spots have developed so it seems to be working.  </li>
      <li>I had two a few years ago before the sun damage developed and the results were nearly miraculous!</li>

<li> this will not (and is not meant to) work in less than a month or two, although I began to see results after a few weeks, and the discoloration fades a little more each day.</li>
<li> I estimate that my skin will be completely clear in another month or so, and I could have cut that time in half</li>
<li> I was very skeptical because it costs a bomb(I had never purchased a moisturizer for more than 20 bucks prior to this).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> I think I&#x27;ve almost used up the entire bottle and will not be purchasing another once its empty!  </li>
<li> Other products leave a definite difference.</li>
<li> I have not noticed any lightening in the dark spots or a brightening of my complexion overall.  </li>
<li> Did NOT live up to the hype!</li>
<li> Unlike all the other skin agents, this is the 1 and only product to break down the brown spots from the surface.  </li>
<li> The key is to have a little patience.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Background information: I&#x27;ve been using sunscreen daily for 15+ years and apply two layers (always a high SPF (usually 50) and at least PA+++).  </li>
<li> This product is not cheap, so I now limit use to my problem area as opposed to my entire face.</li>
<li> no real difference.</li>
<li> the #1 pump did not produce any product after may tries.  </li>
<li> and I am in the military</li>
<li> I did see a noticeable difference on a few of the larger dark spots on my face.</li>
<li> Due to the price, I used it as a spot corrector versus applying it all over my face.</li>
<li> Other choices were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on faint spots. I went through two bottles. The first bottle was purchased from my a dermatologist. I used it on my entire face once a day and it only lasted one month.  It was shocking how fast this product went because it was about $120/bottle at the time. The second bottle was purchased from skincarerx. This time I only used it on the area of the faint spots. I used it twice a day and used up the entire bottle over the course of several months. It didn&#x27;t do anything. It probably works better for dark spots but it doesn&#x27;t work for faint spots. I probably will need to get laser treatments to remove my faint spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background information: I&#x27;ve been using sunscreen daily for 15+ years and apply two layers (always a high SPF (usually 50) and at least PA+++).  I also use a vitamin C serum before applying sunscreen since 2007.</li>
    <li> I like this - and the two step process works fine (I like the pump better than the compartments on their night cream). I just don&#x27;t see any progress with my skin.  I will continue to use this until it is gone, but I probably will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I bought elure as I read in allure magazine that it improved a readers skin in under a month.&lt;br /&gt;I have been battling melasma for 2 years and just wanted my former skin back. I am happy to report&lt;br /&gt;That it has been 3 weeks and I am pleased as punch.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone has vastly improved. It&#x27;s much clearer and rosier and I wear much less foundation&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it along with my retinoids and hope to see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Wondering if to buy? Get it.  You won&#x27;t regret.  Just wish I could buy shares in this as it&#x27;s going to&lt;br /&gt;Be big as most everyone has pigment issues.&lt;br /&gt;Oh,I am an esthetician and have tried myriad things, so I know what works and what dosent&lt;br /&gt;All the best!</li>
    <li> Tried it for 2 weeks with no result.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended elure to lighten dark spots. I went through two bottles and saw no difference in the spots, although it made my skin look nice in general. I consider it money wasted.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time.  It is safe and effective!  There is virtually no side effects, unlike other products like Hydroquinone. The key is to have a little patience.  It takes time to work.  Unlike all the other skin agents, this is the 1 and only product to break down the brown spots from the surface.  I also see other aesthetic benefits.  I know this because this is the only product I use.  I&#x27;m a guy and I like how light it is.  Not greasy.  It even lightens my acne spots.  It&#x27;s definitely worth trying for yourself.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Saw this in Allure magazine a few months ago, supposedly good for knocking out sun spots, etc, but it did nothing at all for me.  Since it was not an inexpensive purchase, I&#x27;m regretting it.</li>
    <li> I received this at the end of July and have used it diligently since that time.  I have not seen anything I could consider as a lightening or brightening of my complexion.  To be fair to the product, I didn&#x27;t buy any of the other &amp;#34;accompanying&amp;#34; products so maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much of a result from just using this lotion.  But, I was also using a prescription strength hydroquinone cream at night on my dark spots in addition to using this product in the morning.  I have not noticed any lightening in the dark spots or a brightening of my complexion overall.  I think I&#x27;ve almost used up the entire bottle and will not be purchasing another once its empty!  It&#x27;s too expensive to continue without having seen some results after 8+ weeks of use!  I was hoping to see some results -- alas, that has not been the case.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Although I followed the instructions and used it every night and day, it did not lighten the sunspots. This just proves that just because a product is expensive doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This is a 2 part system.  the #1 pump did not produce any product after may tries.  The 2nd pump is an activator lotion for #1.  No use not having them both work.  For that price, all should work smoothly.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really works! Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS OFF AND ON FOR TWO YEARS NOW.  I DID NOT SEE ANY MARKED DIFFERENCE.  I USED AS DIRECTED AND UP TO 8 WEEKS STRAIGHT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I SWITCH IT UP WITH OTHER BRANDS. BUT I DO ALWAYS STILL KEEP ONE HANDY BECAUSE ALL THE DERATOLOGIST SAY IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO WORK.  BUT, EVERYONES SKIN REACTS DIFFERENTLY TO PRODUCTS. WHAT MAY NOT WORK WELL ON MY SKIN MY WORK WONDERS ON YOURS.  GOOD LUCK.</li>
    <li> Expensive and not worth it. I have ordered these twice to make sure I used them long enough to see if they worked as they said they would Nope, nada, nothing.  Face was just oilier and that is about it.  Oh and I did notice that the bottles were not full. In fact the one I got both sides were not even close to the brim.</li>
    <li> If you decide to buy this be aware: skincarerx or elure itself dont care if this product gives you a very bad reaction (like horrible blisters as I had). In the past I used strong products like hydroquinone and never had anything like that. For an expensive product like this, try something at another such as Sephora which not only has a (much) better return policy but seem to care about their costumers.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 4 weeks and have not noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I will use Obagi in the future.</li>
    <li> no real difference. waste of my money</li>
    <li> Worth the money if I had it.  The Best brightening lotion I have ever used.  My skin is like a baby&#x27;s clear, clean and glowing.  I will buy it again once I have enough money....LOVE IT !!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Elure Advanced Brightening for almost 3 weeks and it seems to be lightening my dark spots with some just disappearing completely.  No new spots have developed so it seems to be working.  I will have to use it longer to see more improvements.</li>
    <li> I purchased the products because hydroquonine 4% was taken off the market in USA, unfortunately. I not only purchased these two products but the face wash as well. I spent so much money and I am in the military so I don&#x27;t get paid that much. When I purchased it months ago there were not reviews at the time. The packaging is beautiful but it did not work at all. I am an African American woman so that might be the reason. I&#x27;m not really mad I will just be more careful when making online purchases. I found another site which offers hydroquonine 4% and I purchased it tonight.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fall for this, or check this product closely when it arrives to see what it really is.  Although it looks like elure, it calls itself Advanced &#x27;Brightening&#x27; Lotion--which does not exist.  The design copy is sophisticated--amazingly so--only the false title and the too-large size give it away.  Who knows what&#x27;s in it.  For all I know it could be an effective generic.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that Amazon does not appear to exercise even minimal fraud control.  The Amazon email and packing slips, like the site, promised Advanced Whitening Lotion.  I can&#x27;t imagine why these sophisticated fraudsters changed the name from \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; to \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; and but for that glitch I might not have realized that the product is a fake.  After this experience I would be leery of buying any skin products on Amazon, especially if they seem like real bargains.  Amazon&#x27;s product picture, name, and description are no protection.  Both picture and description are identical to what the dermatologist sold me.  Only the product was fake.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I have used many products to lighten my age spots that have helped, but are not even close to how well this works. It also has really fast results, only a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and since I started using it, which is about 2 weeks ago, I see great results already.  My melasma has gotten a lot lighter and the skin has a glow to it.  Will continue and see if the spots get lighter.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product the ONE and ONLY to deliver on the promise to improve skin tone!</li>
    <li> I did see a noticeable difference on a few of the larger dark spots on my face. Due to the price, I used it as a spot corrector versus applying it all over my face. I give this beauty product two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> Used the product for three week, but didn&#x27;t notice anything different about my completion.  Probably not a great product for African American skin types.  Other products leave a definite difference.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. It does work over time, but it is a little pricy.</li>
    <li> very smooth and light skin, I like this product very much</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested it, I was skeptical, being Asian my spots are darker, but I saw results in 3 months. Best part is my Doc says I can continue using it as long as I wanted, it is safe. Other choices were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it was not in a pump, it is expensive and I know there is more &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; in there even when it won&#x27;t pump anymore. Tried to take it apart, but it was a no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, used 2x a day, lasts me almost 3 months. I use the cleaner too.</li>
    <li> Did wonders for my skin! The spots didn&#x27;t disappear... but the skin became more luminous which is even better and more natural. Definitely getting another</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all so far after using it twice daily.  I would not purchase again as it is quite pricey and I have seen no results.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist had me on hydroquinone for years, telling me it was the best product available for melasma. She was wrong! Elure has done more for me in 6 months than her fancy prescription cream did in 2 years.</li>
    <li> Because the second pump is not working so I don&#x27;t have access to the lotion that comes from the second pump.  I need to have it fixed.  Please advise what to do.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have a hyperpigmentation in my face and neck after that I used retinoic acid peeling and I have melasma too! This medication working great after 1 month the change is incredible! I am hispanic with mestizo skin</li>
    <li> Did NOT live up to the hype! I would not buy this product again!</li>
    <li> works really well on dark circles under eyes.  must apply religiously every day however</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I initially bought this product based upon Allure&#x27;s recommendation. This is the only product that I know of which actually dissolves the melanin on skin, rather than simply bleaching it. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and have noticed a significant improvement in the melasma on my forehead. I&#x27;m 36, blonde and very fair complected, and I began to develop sun spots on my forehead a few years ago, although I still don&#x27;t have any visible lines. This product is not cheap, so I now limit use to my problem area as opposed to my entire face. If used on the entire face, the product lasts approximately one month. You MUST use sunblock- the higher, the better- absolutely everyday or you will develop new hyperpigmentation. That, and, you MUST be patient- this will not (and is not meant to) work in less than a month or two, although I began to see results after a few weeks, and the discoloration fades a little more each day. What you will notice first, after 2 or 3 weeks, is that your complexion appears much brighter and more luminous. I use it at night, and in the morning apply sunblock and makeup as usual. If you can afford it, I highly recommend a Fotofacial, or series of Fotofacials, as the procedure is more expensive but will provide instantaneous results. If I realized that I would be on my third bottle by now, I would have had another Foto instead- I had two a few years ago before the sun damage developed and the results were nearly miraculous! My broken capillaries have never returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to go with the Elure, make sure you use it one to two times per day (I recommend morning AND night). I have sometimes applied it in the morning under my sunscreen and makeup and have seen the seem results- I think I will start to do this again. This formula is completely non-irritating and literally produces no sensation after application, unless you happen to be allergic to it like another reviewer, which is not the product&#x27;s fault, bythe way :). I received all three bottles from LifeMeds and have had no problems with the supplier. If you can&#x27;t afford a Fotofacial, I recommend committing to this product. I estimate that my skin will be completely clear in another month or so, and I could have cut that time in half had I used the product twice each day.</li>
    <li> Give this product for 5 star,its really great,though i still not use it.Maybe in future i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product does wonders for Melasma and evening out skin tone. It&#x27;s amazing, but takes some time. I first bought it from my Dermatologist, but bought it on Amazon when I was getting low. I love it.</li>
    <li> if used consistently it does work. I am not sure yet what will happen when I stop using it, but the difference is about 80%</li>
    <li> Expensive when it only lasts 3-4 weeks. Saw very little difference. I used it faithfully morning and night. Won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> 3 weeks and dont see results yet</li>
    <li> I recently had some growths removed from my face by a dermatologist. He recommended this lotion to me to maintain my skin going forward. I was very skeptical because it costs a bomb(I had never purchased a moisturizer for more than 20 bucks prior to this).&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 2 months now and it has really made a difference. My old scars are lighter. I still get breakouts but applying this daily has lessened the intensity of new scars as well.&lt;br /&gt;I use this lotion in the morning and add sunscreen on top of it. At night I use Vitamin C serum + argan oil. Wish I had found this skin care regimen in my early 20s but better late than never!</li>
