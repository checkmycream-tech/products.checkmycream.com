    <li> I used to use Cellex C-- a good product, but much more expensive for the same results as I get from Resilient Beauty Vitamin C serum and It left orange marks around my clothes necklines.

    <li> Recommended for skin.  Has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>

    <li> This serum is phenomenal! I have tried many different ones in the past but I have finally found one that’s great for my sensitive skin! My real problem is uneven color and the acne scars on my face. This definitely has helped and has really been fantastic this far!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! It smells great and that little bottle is going to last you a long time and it&#x27;s worth the money! I have always had blotchy spots on my skin and I rarely wear makeup so I wanted something straight forward that I could use to improve the look of my skin and this does just that. My skin looks so great that even my husband told me I look outstanding and asked me what I did differently. Now that&#x27;s saying a lot!
