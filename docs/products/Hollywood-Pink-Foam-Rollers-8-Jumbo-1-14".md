      <li>I was pleased to find them on-line!  </li>

      <li>They are cute they stay put and the curls</li>
      <li>its ok for the price.</li>

      <li>Took them out next morning and my hair was beautiful.</li>

      <li>I did have to order 2 packs because I have so much hair, but for the price that was ok.</li>

      <li>the foam is the right size</li>
      <li>They are the right size.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much</li>
      <li>I purchased both the large (1&amp;#34;) and the jumbo (1 1/4&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>They fall out easy and like others said, you have to keep snapping them back together when you&#x27;re setting your hair.</li>

      <li>I mean a normal amount that looks okay.</li>
      <li>I slept with the rollers on and my hair looked naturally curly in the morning.</li>
      <li>The product is flimsy and won&#x27;t last more than a few times (if you don&#x27;t use product).</li>
      <li>The ones I received look very small and I am not even sure they are 1 1/4 inch.</li>
      <li>These rollers are weak and would not hold even the smallest section of my hair; and I have fine hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered these larger rollers because I could not find any at the beauty supply stores. I have very thick naturally curly hair. I wanted something to make smoother curls I didn&#x27;t have to work for. I put these in my damp hair at night- sleep in them- and in the morning I can take them out and just run my fingers through it and go!! I did have to order 2 packs because I have so much hair, but for the price that was ok.</li>
    <li> Really good if you need to sleep with your rollers in because they don&#x27;t hurt your head</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use these!!</li>
    <li> I like it very much and I am going to order it again soon.Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I wanted some very large foam rollers and couldn&#x27;t find any locally.  (The stores carry small or medium ones.)  I was pleased to find them on-line!  They are the right size.  I use them all the time. One slight problem with them, is that they don&#x27;t like to stay clipped as you are rolling your hair.  Minor inconvenience. Yes, I would order again.</li>
    <li> I got these rollers so that my hair wouldn&#x27;t fly all over the place. I really don&#x27;t want curly hair - infact I want really straight hair. I guess I should have paid for attention to the size. I saw that they were &amp;#34;Jumbo&amp;#34; and so I ordered them. I am a bit disappointed because they don&#x27;t give me the straight hair that I want.</li>
    <li> Put these in while hair was damp before bed. Took them out next morning and my hair was beautiful. Curls stay in pretty great throughtout the day</li>
    <li> Looked bigger on picture, were same size I can get at Walmart..</li>
    <li> the plastic is flimsy. its ok for the price. i guess you get what you pay for.  the foam is the right size</li>
    <li> My bad, I thought these were bigger rollers than what I had but they were the same.  Tossed them out as I didn&#x27;t need them.  Returning them would have been more expensive.  Took a while to get them also.  Doesn&#x27;t anyone make bigger rollers?</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not good for sleeping. They fall out easy and like others said, you have to keep snapping them back together when you&#x27;re setting your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> The pink clasps don&#x27;t hold on all the curlers. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about these rollers.  Enough said, right?</li>
    <li> the plastic big piece comes apart, no pressure, very little pressure at all just touch the thing to put it over the roller oh, there it goes and you have to take the roller out of your hair start over&lt;br /&gt;then it does it again and again&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t get this cheap version get the conair or some name brand no probs with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or better yet, litely twist your hair strands, pin curl it and bobby pin it.&lt;br /&gt;make sure you leave some conditioner in your hair and use that glossy smooth shine fructose stuff when styling. dont need rollers</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t appear how they do in the picture above.  The curlers in this picture look large.  The ones I received look very small and I am not even sure they are 1 1/4 inch.</li>
    <li> Ordered a2  Jumbo but still thought it was little small for my long, thick hair. I slept with the rollers on and my hair looked naturally curly in the morning. I slept comfortably with them all over my hair. Might not be the sturdy ones that lasts long, but it works .</li>
    <li> I guess they work and all, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in them, and by too much I mean a normal amount that looks okay. The clip traps weren&#x27;t very good either. I gave them to my daughter for her dolls hair.</li>
    <li> They are cute they stay put and the curls last long I just need more practice on how to put these things on perfectly!!</li>
    <li> My mistake.  I thought these were the large curlers since I measured the large ones and they seemed to be 1 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> this is a great size, I use them along with the 1.5 inch</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter, who has long, thick hair.  Her hair takes, and holds, the curl well.  I purchased both the large (1&amp;#34;) and the jumbo (1 1/4&amp;#34;).  She sleeps well in them.</li>
    <li> Have used similar products in the past. I got this package and rolled my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to unhook them, three of the eight rollers broke at the attachment ends.&lt;br /&gt;Not good.&lt;br /&gt;Very inexpensive -- you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Leave this one alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen George author and reviewer</li>
    <li> I like it because In knew I was ordering cheap curlers. The product is flimsy and won&#x27;t last more than a few times (if you don&#x27;t use product).</li>

    <li> These are soft and very comfortable to sleep in every night.</li>
    <li> Good quality, flexible yet dense foam. No problems with them popping apart.</li>
    <li> Not only did it take a really long time to get this, but it was not what I had hoped for. I wanted LARGE foam rollers and these were very small. I would  not recommend these or buy again.</li>
