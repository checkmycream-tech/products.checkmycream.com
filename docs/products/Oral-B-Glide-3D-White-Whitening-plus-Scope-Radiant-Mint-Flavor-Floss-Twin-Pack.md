      <li>Will not buy again, that is for sure.</li>
      <li>These go smoothly between your teeth and leave a nice minty taste.</li>
      <li>As a dental hygienist, I love glide, perfect for tight teeth and spaces also.</li>
      <li>Does not shred or break easily.</li>
      <li>the fibers do not come apart that easy</li>
      <li>Never noticed any whitening, but the floss is easy to use.</li>

      <li>Best floss!.Have used other types but always come back to Glide products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not whitening, but it&#x27;s as good as all the other glide flosses.</li>

      <li>It is perfect, not to thin, but slides between teeth very well.</li>
      <li>I am more of a fan of the water flossers, but when I use the regular floss, I like this floss because it does not fray if you need to tug it out from between your teeth.</li>
      <li>Funny thing is that this is an add-on item</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super strong, lasts a long time, cuts well, and tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I still use this far more frequently.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t paid much attention to the whitening effects, but this floss helps to get anything that&#x27;s stuck between my teeth.</li>
      <li>That is all I ask of floss really.</li>
      <li>I also appreciate Amazon&#x27;s double pack since it&#x27;s very economical.  </li>
      <li>As I stated they forgot in original order but were quick to send another and it was not a burden since I still had some of the previous product and didn&#x27;t have to go without</li>
      <li>Instead of a bunch of fine loosely woven fibers, you get a strand of seemingly continuous material that won&#x27;t tear or shred on you.</li>
      <li>is easy to floss, unlike some other products.</li>
      <li>I can clearly see a difference after a month or so of use every night!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no weird taste, they&#x27;re not over waxed and moderately priced.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to clean between teeth, but also glides smoothly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple products, and this one is by far</li>
      <li>But I like it in general.</li>
      <li>so you can see how much floss is left, and you aren&#x27;t surprised when it&#x27;s empty.</li>

<li> Other types of floss feel too thin.</li>
<li> but those are expensive and this one is cheap but little annoying when it breaks and strips apart.</li>
<li> My wife loves it, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in her teeth, whitens your teeth but its hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know about the claim of whitening, hard to test that,</li>
<li> It is difficult to whiten between your teeth, so why not do it with your floss.</li>
<li> But there is nothing bad about this.</li>
<li> I hate flossing.</li>

    <li> I look forward to flossing everyday with this Oral-b floss. Other types of floss feel too thin.</li>
    <li> A bit thinner but works well as the original, no shred and smells great too ! However the whitening feature is somewhat gimmick imo.</li>
    <li> As a dental hygienist, I love glide, perfect for tight teeth and spaces also. Good flavor and it&#x27;s the only kind my husband will let me buy.</li>
    <li> This floss is great for you&#x27;re teeth. I only use Oral-b floss and I prefer the glide brand as it&#x27;s seem less to floss my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will point out is that this twin pack says each case only has 38.7 yards of floss in it. This was the first time I purchased the whitening brand vs the green case, I think that was mint flavored or something, but the green case always came with 43.7 yards of floss. Not a big deal, but always something to keep in mind nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I have been using this floss for months now and it was recommended to me by my hygienist.  It is thick but flat and glides between your teeth effortlessly.  Feels nice and has a minty taste.  Makes my mouth feel healthy and clean!!  I also appreciate Amazon&#x27;s double pack since it&#x27;s very economical.  Amazon&#x27;s delivery was efficient as always!</li>
    <li> I cannot see how these slippery things can clean well between teeth. Will not buy again, that is for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the best darn floss in the world.

    <li> This review relates to all Crest Glide floss. Instead of a bunch of fine loosely woven fibers, you get a strand of seemingly continuous material that won&#x27;t tear or shred on you. In fact, this floss has its origins with Gore textiles (the company that makes GoreTex &#x27;waterproof breathable&#x27; fabric for outdoor clothing). One of the founders at Gore decided to try flossing his teeth with the fiber and found that it worked great. Of course, this stuff has progressed over the years and they&#x27;re no longer associated with each other. The reality however is that floss comes down to personal preference and if you need to read a review about it, you might have some serious psychological problems. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Best dental floss I&#x27;ve used! Love the gentle mint smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple products, and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good after using it (fresh.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also is easy to floss, unlike some other products.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.</li>
    <li> This stuff breaks pretty easily.  But I like he extra protection for the gums, since it is not like that filament style of the regular floss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years but the stores don&#x27;t always have any in stock that have the whitening, so it&#x27;s good to order them and keep them in stock at home.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss! These go smoothly between your teeth and leave a nice minty taste.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. Everyone hates flossing. So just floss with this and get it the hell over with and shut up.</li>
    <li> The mint flavor is too strong for me. But I like it in general.</li>
    <li> As I stated they forgot in original order but were quick to send another and it was not a burden since I still had some of the previous product and didn&#x27;t have to go without</li>
    <li> The right thickness to get in between my teeth and leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth as I floss.</li>
    <li> These work great and even get into my really tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Great. It&#x27;s thick enough to clean between teeth, but also glides smoothly. Occasionally it breaks while flossing. I also like that there is a small window so you can see how much floss is left, and you aren&#x27;t surprised when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss. My wife loves it, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in her teeth, whitens your teeth but its hard to find in stores. This is a good price and included a coupon for my price.  Funny thing is that this is an add-on item but it shipped separately  from my other items. Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I should expect from floss... But there is nothing bad about this.</li>
    <li> What can you say, it&#x27;s floss. I keep one at my desk so I floss when I&#x27;m watching Ted talks.</li>
    <li> They glide well (no pun intended) and the fibers do not come apart that easy to cause stripped bunching between teeth. That is all I ask of floss really. There&#x27;s no weird taste, they&#x27;re not over waxed and moderately priced.</li>
    <li> Not as good as one with handle and disposable strips.  but those are expensive and this one is cheap but little annoying when it breaks and strips apart.</li>
    <li> I am more of a fan of the water flossers, but when I use the regular floss, I like this floss because it does not fray if you need to tug it out from between your teeth. It is smooth and threads through your teeth easily. I would never use traditional floss again.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Does not shred or break easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not whitening, but it&#x27;s as good as all the other glide flosses.</li>
    <li> Great product. I never had it ripping on me while flossing. Great flavor. I Use it with all of my other Crest Whitening products and always get compliments on my white teeth.</li>
    <li> The only floss I use.</li>
    <li> Best deal for two bundles of floss, its floss i don&#x27;t really know if my teeth have whiter since use!</li>
    <li> This is the best floss I have ever used. It is perfect, not to thin, but slides between teeth very well. Additionally, the taste is great. I don&#x27;t know about the claim of whitening, hard to test that, but I love is floss.</li>
    <li> What could I say.  It does the job.  It is the right flossing tape for me.</li>
