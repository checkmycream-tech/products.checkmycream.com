<li> I have dry skin, I live in a low humidity climate zone and a medication I have to take makes my all combine to make my skin itch.</li>
<li> Much cheaper to buy it on Amazon especially since it is a small bottle.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve got seriously itchy skin, not just the dry winter variety, it may be worth it.</li>
<li> I have purchased Aveeno Anti Itch Lotion several times for my husband who has dry skin.</li>
<li> I suggest, after application, you then add a cold pack to the itchy site for better control of the itch.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve not tried it yet for other itches, such as mosquito bites, chiggers, or poison ivy/oak.</li>
<li> Helps to reduce skin itching due to dryness, simple eczema, etc.  </li>
<li> This is the same product as the little tubes that they sell at target for bug bites.</li>
<li> Did not work as well as I had expected.</li>
<li> The smell is strong, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long ways.  </li>
<li> Only takes a small amount of Aveeno to effect results in stopping the itching.</li>
<li> I have Graves Disease which causes my legs to be extremely itchy, to the point of bleeding.</li>
<li> Now I have two and a half bottles of product just sitting there.</li>
<li> Both of which works but was expensive to spend 5 dollar on a 1 ounce tube which didn&#x27;t last me long because I had to use it twice a day on my legs.</li>
<li> But the scent is unpleasant, so be aware.</li>
<li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.</li>
<li> It does stop the itching for a few hours.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t stop all the itching of those nasty Shingles, but does calm them down.  </li>
<li> it was hard to find something she wasn&#x27;t allergic to.</li>
<li> but he has the rought he-man skin, well weathered tanned skin - if you know what I mean.  </li>
<li> She had such bad allergies</li>
<li> And it is really very hard to ignore</li>
<li> Would recommend to everyone who wants to get rid of those nasty body itches.</li>
<li> Seems expensive</li>
<li> Try it you will not be sorry.</li>
<li> This product is to something I find difficult to be without.</li>
<li> I have a terrible time in the winter with itchy skin &amp; this year my problems have all but disappeared since using this cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. Itching stops within minutes</li>
    <li> Of all the common OTC anti-itch products that I&#x27;ve tried this is by far the best and this price combined with Amazon Prime is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> My best friend on the winter time. It helps with itchy and cracked skin on legs, arms, nipples, etc.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Handles my mild itching skin all day long. I mix it with the Aveeno Intense Relief Overnight Cream and I get great results which lasts 24 hours. I have dry skin, I live in a low humidity climate zone and a medication I have to take makes my all combine to make my skin itch. And it is really very hard to ignore so I have tried several products. This is a practical solution that works for me. And it doesn&#x27;t cause drowsiness like the pill form of itch relief does. I recommend all the Aveeno fragrance free products, particularly the Anti-itch concentrate.</li>
    <li> Great Product works very well for seasonal itching problems in tropical climates like Jamaica and India. Very satisfied indeed.</li>
    <li> Got very bad case of poison ivy, this was the best relief for the itch.  Seems expensive but it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product at the end of 2005 when I broke out into hives all over my body and it instantly stopped the itching. I used it also when I developed hive and it helped with that as well. I break out a lot I am allergic to just about everything and so far no matter what breaks me out this cream relieves it. I am still using the same bottle, you don&#x27;t need much for the relief and after 5 years it still works just as well as it did on day one. I am starting to run out and am glad I checked here first before buying anywhere else 3 bottles should last me quite a while. I have also forced my boyfriend to use it when he gets bit by insects while working and he also think its great. Try it you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother who was always complaing of body itching.  When I applied, she said it helped immediately. Has a slight odor but does not last long and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  Not a greasy lotion which makes it great.  Would recommend to everyone who wants to get rid of those nasty body itches.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got seriously itchy skin, not just the dry winter variety, it may be worth it. But the scent is unpleasant, so be aware.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my pregnancy hives. Now I have two and a half bottles of product just sitting there. This is the same product as the little tubes that they sell at target for bug bites. I wish I realized that before I decided to buy these 3 so I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money. Oh well. I&#x27;m sure this is a good product for some if you need it in mass quantity. Try those little tubes at the store first though!</li>
    <li> Helps to reduce skin itching due to dryness, simple eczema, etc.  Better than hydra cortisone cream in my estimation.  Only takes a small amount of Aveeno to effect results in stopping the itching. This product is to something I find difficult to be without.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. It is very effective and stops her skin irritation within a few hours after she tried others and failed.</li>
    <li> The title alone is a TURN-off.  Anti-Itch concentrated Lotion sounds to me like you have lice or bedbugs taunting you at night.  I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;horse face&#x27; Jennifer Aniston uses this inexpensive lotion.  My husband likes it but he has the rought he-man skin, well weathered tanned skin - if you know what I mean.  Personally, I use Kai products and love em.</li>
    <li> This anti-itch cream is recommended by my dermatologist &amp; really works. I have a terrible time in the winter with itchy skin &amp; this year my problems have all but disappeared since using this cream. When first applied it has a slight &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; smell which disappears quickly. Much cheaper to buy it on Amazon especially since it is a small bottle.</li>
    <li> I try to avoid hydrocortisone so thought I would try this as an alternative when dealing with a summer rash.  Great stuff.  Soothing.  Goes on easily.  Contains calamine, an aid to healing.  A little goes a long ways.  The smell is strong, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.  I just discovered Aveeno products this past year and am loving them.  I&#x27;ve had no negative reactions when using them.  The price seems fair.</li>
    <li> the best stuff if you got bug bites.</li>
    <li> Although not listed specifically for sunburn relief this stuff is amazing in sunburns. Oatmeal us like the #1 recommended relief for sunburn and the calamine in it helps immensely</li>
    <li> I have photosensitivity which makes my skin itch. The anti-itch cream plus medication allows me to sleep.</li>
    <li> This is the best anti itch cream ever! And it smells good and is not very sticky either..</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s doctor turned us on to Aveeno. She had such bad allergies it was hard to find something she wasn&#x27;t allergic to. This takes away the itch and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering. Now my dad uses it for his eczema. Works better than the prescription he has.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It truly helped me with my shingles. Its very soothing.  I would like to reorder it to give as a gift. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This works!!  Stops the itching almost immediately.  Excellent product..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of creams &amp; lotions for a recurring heat/dust rash &amp; nothing worked till this. Aveeno has been quite the life saver.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it just came in bigger pump bottles instead of the tiny packs.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I had expected. It does stop the itching for a few hours.</li>
    <li> This anti-itch lotion is great and a great price on amazon! I have Graves Disease which causes my legs to be extremely itchy, to the point of bleeding. My doctor recommended a cortizone cream or topical benadryl. Both of which works but was expensive to spend 5 dollar on a 1 ounce tube which didn&#x27;t last me long because I had to use it twice a day on my legs. So I decided to look for something else. I wanted something that was bigger and would last longer and an Aveeno product. I found this and decided to give it a try and glad I did. It&#x27;s not runny like calamine lotion and spreads very well. And great for summer time too for bug bites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering you can buy this at a drug store for $10 a bottle this is a definite steal!</li>
    <li> I have purchased Aveeno Anti Itch Lotion several times for my husband who has dry skin. He really likes the Aveeno over several other brands he has tried.  I will purchase this lotion again.</li>
    <li> This really helps with surface itching. It is really worth a try if you have an itch you can&#x27;t ignore.</li>
    <li> This product was the most soothing, and stopped the itching of my Shingles better than the dozen other products I tried. It won&#x27;t stop all the itching of those nasty Shingles, but does calm them down.  I suggest, after application, you then add a cold pack to the itchy site for better control of the itch.  I&#x27;ve not tried it yet for other itches, such as mosquito bites, chiggers, or poison ivy/oak.</li>
