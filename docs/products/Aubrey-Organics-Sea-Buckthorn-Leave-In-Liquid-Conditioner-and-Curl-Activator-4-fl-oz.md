      <li>/&gt;The smell is just ok.</li>

      <li>bothered me more than the oiliness of the product</li>
      <li>It is a natural spray (no propellers), and produces a fine, herbal mist -very pleasant smell during and after.</li>
      <li>Very nice product, smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh hour down.</li>
      <li>I find it&#x27;s best to use it on towel dry</li>
      <li>and I was able to easily smooth the product from the tops of my twists to the ends of my twist</li>
      <li>Just wanted to let all you fine heads out there</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it is by far the most amazing hair product I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
      <li>and they would send another one free.</li>
      <li>and I loved the way that it instantly made my hair more manageable by detangling my hair and elongating my curls, while bringing out the natural curly pattern which I loved.</li>
      <li>My hair is more wavy than curly, so this product actually provides some nice curls in my hair.</li>
      <li>Here are some tips how to best use this product: don&#x27;t use too much or on consecutive days; when the bottle is empty, put some water in it, shake it</li>
      <li>It was easier to manage my hair without it falling in my face and it made my hair feel lighter and softer, and made it more curly from the large curl/waves.</li>
      <li>I put it on right out of the shower and then apply gel!</li>
      <li>I have long corkscrew locks and it defines my locks in a most amazing way.</li>
      <li>to true, another Aubrey product that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>It sprays super evenly and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not giving up on the product because I LOVE Aubrey Organics, especially the primrose and lavender shampoo and their baby shampoo is awesome for the little ones.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because I wanted a more natural, less-chemical based product to use on my wavy hair.</li>
      <li>This product leavs my hair soft, curly, and friz free!</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product too, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong overwhelming smell that I associate with most Aubrey conditioners, instead it has a subtle, natural smell that fades away as soon as product is added to the hair.  </li>
      <li>The reviews were kind of mixed and, for the amount of product you get, this is pretty pricey, but I gave it a try anyways.</li>
      <li>My hair looks full and shiny and I would use this product again, but that smell is a real turn off.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried using the product, however, I couldn&#x27;t even get it out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>This was recommended by a friend who has thick, curly hair - mine is thin and fine, but this product has been great to keep my curls looking good with no chemical residue or heat appliances needed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps the product would be better suited to more coarse and dry hair types than mine (or hair</li>
      <li>I will keep trying new combos with this product, maybe using just a tiny bit and mixing it with some very light leave in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate so I need to use some kind of conditioner.</li>
      <li>We bought this according to some other reviews stating that the strong smell fades quickly when it dries.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the medicinal smell of sea buckthorn, but if you have fine hair, only use this if you&#x27;re going for the \\&quot;not washed in weeks\\&quot; look.</li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny and healthy and my scalp isn&#x27;t dry anymore!</li>
      <li>Moreover, I use a good-quality chemical straightener on parts of my hair (Phytospecific) which is great in itself (see my other reviews), but over time it does dry up my hair.</li>
      <li>This is really what you need to encourage and save your curls.  </li>
      <li>I find the price very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
      <li>It does add softness - I can see how it would help soften really curly hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to really activate, revive, or refreshen my kinky/curls</li>
      <li>I found that it just sat on top of the hair and left it far too greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got really nice curly wavy tame</li>
      <li>(I have long, fine, wavy/loose curls)</li>
      <li>I spray it on towel-dried hair every day, more on the tips, less on top, and let the hair dry naturally.</li>
      <li>that is protein-starved), but I do not recommend this product for persons with hair that is wavy or loosely curly, is fine or medium in thickness, and is not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>Therefore I had high hopes for this curl activator spray.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I applied the product to my wet hair and was excited to see that it looked really curly.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not heavy</li>
      <li>I been natural for about a year</li>
      <li>The chemical stuff was always too sticky and the natural stuff was always too oily.     </li>
      <li>Natural.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair with some loose spiral curls and I am always on the lookout for products that don&#x27;t weigh down my hair but which define the curls better.</li>
      <li>I love that a little bit of this product goes a long way; I applied this product when after wetting my twists with water</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t like, that the product had so much alcohol, which is probably the reason why it causes your hair to dry.</li>
      <li>So far, this product has worked wonders for my hair, it left my hair soft and moisturized, while defining my curls.</li>
      <li>But this product, instant WOW.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this, but it smells like a wet dog.</li>
      <li>I do like it, but I definitely won&#x27;t stop looking for a natural product to enhance the wavy-curly nature of my hair.</li>
      <li>I think this product would be good for people with thick hair but was too heavy for my fine thin hair.  </li>
      <li>It is the first Aubrey and curl activator that ever worked on my natural, thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>I looked inside and it was pretty thick product trying to go through this tiny little spray tube: this is the first thing they need to fix.</li>

<li> changed my review from a 5 to a 3 because the product seemed to work when I applied it to wet hair, but as soon as my hair dried the next day, then my hair became very hard and dry; it left a white coating on my scalp which makes me look like I have dandruff.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a guy with shorter, thick, and wavy hair that is pretty hard to control.  </li>
<li> I had to pull the spray tube out, unclog it by letting water pass through it a million times, then added some water to the Aubrey product so it would actually became a little less gloppy.</li>
<li> As my hair dried, however, it seemed to have a sticky coating on it that actually ended up weighing it down making it straighter.  </li>
<li> Its consistency is watery, not oily, creamy or viscous like other products.</li>
<li> And we can&#x27;t return it because she waited a little too long to try it, so we&#x27;re stuck with this stinky stuff!</li>
<li> and I used it every other day (</li>
<li> I have corse wavy hair, and it is extremely frizy when I don&#x27;t use any hair product.</li>
<li> Other hair products leave my hair crunchy, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
<li> It has, among other things, egg protein in it.</li>
<li> I have naturally curly hair and in the dry air we have here, it is usually frizzy and hard to deal with.  </li>
<li> a few spritzes is enough to evenly distribute it with your fingers, and after it&#x27;s air dried</li>
<li> It smells floral with faint yolk undertones if you really scrutinize it, and in any case I infinitely prefer that to the smell of methylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It leaves no stickiness or messiness behind, just healthy-looking, well-nourished curls and even enhances my natural espresso-dark color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When it arrived some had leaked out of bottle. I contacted Swanson Vitamins to return, but they told me to keep it because their policy was 100% customer satisfaction and they would send another one free. It arrived intact within 3 days. Great customer service. Very nice product, smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh hour down. However quite pricey for a four ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Aubrey Organics and use their Rose Honeysuckle Shampoo (which is awesome), however, this product didn&#x27;t do it for me. It worked well taming my coarse, wavy hair, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell. It leaves a very unpleasant scent in my hair. Have to return it unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to really activate, revive, or refreshen my kinky/curls but it did all those things and gave my hair the needed moisture (no greasiness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is the cost for such little product. It only last about 3 weeks and I used it every other day (and I&#x27;m not heavy handed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will purchase again for the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just ok. It smells herbal.</li>
    <li> My daughter needs a curl activator with minimal smell. We bought this according to some other reviews stating that the strong smell fades quickly when it dries. It did not. And we can&#x27;t return it because she waited a little too long to try it, so we&#x27;re stuck with this stinky stuff! I&#x27;m terribly disappointed with this product and the seller&#x27;s return policy.</li>
    <li> I have 1c/2a curly hair and love this stuff! I put it on right out of the shower and then apply gel! It works great!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works great!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair with some loose spiral curls and I am always on the lookout for products that don&#x27;t weigh down my hair but which define the curls better. Therefore I had high hopes for this curl activator spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was to be disappointed. I found that it just sat on top of the hair and left it far too greasy. I also detested the smell - to me it smelled like rotten eggs. Not surprising, given that one of the ingredients happens to be Egg Protein Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the product would be better suited to more coarse and dry hair types than mine (or hair that is protein-starved), but I do not recommend this product for persons with hair that is wavy or loosely curly, is fine or medium in thickness, and is not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What bothered me more than the oiliness of the product - I could have just used less - was the smell which kept me even from reusing the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with shorter, thick, and wavy hair that is pretty hard to control.  While this product does not have the greatest scent in the world, it worked very well and I could definitely see a difference with and without it.  It was easier to manage my hair without it falling in my face and it made my hair feel lighter and softer, and made it more curly from the large curl/waves.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local health store, have used it for over a month now and continue to be amazed by it. My hair is naturally dry, coarse and wavy/curly/frizzy. Moreover, I use a good-quality chemical straightener on parts of my hair (Phytospecific) which is great in itself (see my other reviews), but over time it does dry up my hair. But this product, instant WOW. It is a natural spray (no propellers), and produces a fine, herbal mist -very pleasant smell during and after. It has, among other things, egg protein in it. Its consistency is watery, not oily, creamy or viscous like other products. If one opens the bottle, the color of the stuff is oatmeal-like, but no color is visible in the mist. It gives my hair instant shine, the healthy kind not the silicone kind, and a wonderful fresh bounce to my curls. It leaves no stickiness or messiness behind, just healthy-looking, well-nourished curls and even enhances my natural espresso-dark color. What I love about this product is a) the immediate results, b) the fact that it nourishes my hair long-term and doesn&#x27;t just artificially luster it, c) the weightless feel, d) the lasting effects (no need for styling products since I started using this). I spray it on towel-dried hair every day, more on the tips, less on top, and let the hair dry naturally. Here are some tips how to best use this product: don&#x27;t use too much or on consecutive days; when the bottle is empty, put some water in it, shake it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have used some $$$ products in the past (Ojon, Kerastase, Phytospecific masque etc) and this by far outperforms the rest. I find the price very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: about the scent some reviewers say it smells like rotten eggs, but no way. It smells floral with faint yolk undertones if you really scrutinize it, and in any case I infinitely prefer that to the smell of methylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, 2012. It looks like the formula was altered. The product now smells of cinnamon, and still works great!orks great!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and in the dry air we have here, it is usually frizzy and hard to deal with.  However, after using this my hair curls like it was in a humid climate and I love it.  All I do is wash it, towel dry and then pump 6 to 7x into my hands and rub it through my hair and voila, I&#x27;m done.  Thrilled to see I can still get this online since the store I had purchased it at is not carrying it anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading these reviews and the reviews on the Aubrey website.  A lot of people on both websites talk about the smell.  I didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad at all and definitely NOT like eggs!  I applied the product to my wet hair and was excited to see that it looked really curly. (I have long, fine, wavy/loose curls) As my hair dried, however, it seemed to have a sticky coating on it that actually ended up weighing it down making it straighter.  I think this product would be good for people with thick hair but was too heavy for my fine thin hair.  I&#x27;m not giving up on the product because I LOVE Aubrey Organics, especially the primrose and lavender shampoo and their baby shampoo is awesome for the little ones.  I will keep trying new combos with this product, maybe using just a tiny bit and mixing it with some very light leave in conditioner.  Just wanted to let all you fine heads out there know that this may not be the best product for you!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hair product. I have corse wavy hair, and it is extremely frizy when I don&#x27;t use any hair product. Other hair products leave my hair crunchy, which I don&#x27;t like. This product leavs my hair soft, curly, and friz free!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but it smells like a wet dog. I don&#x27;t want to smell like perfume, but it&#x27;s hard to get beyond this odor. I have a bit of wave to my hair and I suppose it helps. It does add softness - I can see how it would help soften really curly hair.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend who has thick, curly hair - mine is thin and fine, but this product has been great to keep my curls looking good with no chemical residue or heat appliances needed.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate so I need to use some kind of conditioner. The chemical stuff was always too sticky and the natural stuff was always too oily.     I&#x27;m very impressed with the aubrey leave in. It sprays super evenly and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy at all. My hair looks shiny and healthy and my scalp isn&#x27;t dry anymore!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted a more natural, less-chemical based product to use on my wavy hair. The reviews were kind of mixed and, for the amount of product you get, this is pretty pricey, but I gave it a try anyways. I am not wow-ed by it, but I don&#x27;t hate it. The first time I tried using the product, however, I couldn&#x27;t even get it out of the bottle. I looked inside and it was pretty thick product trying to go through this tiny little spray tube: this is the first thing they need to fix. If it&#x27;s going to be that thick, it should really be in a tube that I can squeeze. If you want it in a spray container, give me something that&#x27;s actually going to come out. I had to pull the spray tube out, unclog it by letting water pass through it a million times, then added some water to the Aubrey product so it would actually became a little less gloppy. It works now but, for the price I paid, I don&#x27;t think I should have had to do any of this. My hair is more wavy than curly, so this product actually provides some nice curls in my hair. I do agree with some other reviewers that it does make it look a little greasy. I do have hair that is more on the thin side than thick, so maybe it just has this effect on those of us that aren&#x27;t graced with as much hair. I do like Aubrey Organics, as I use both their shampoo and conditioner, and will try to figure out a way to use this product. I do like it, but I definitely won&#x27;t stop looking for a natural product to enhance the wavy-curly nature of my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works well on my crazy hair. It actually does what it says...conditioners and helps with curl.</li>
    <li> The best leave in conditioner from the best company Aubrey! I use this every day as I use all of Aubrey products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the medicinal smell of sea buckthorn, but if you have fine hair, only use this if you&#x27;re going for the \\&quot;not washed in weeks\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> I gave it only 3 stars, even though the product is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to. I have long corkscrew locks and it defines my locks in a most amazing way. My hair looks full and shiny and I would use this product again, but that smell is a real turn off. It smells like baby powder concentrate. It&#x27;s overpowering everything else and unfortunately lasting several days, if I don&#x27;t wash my hair in between. This smell is really nasty, imo. Not buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!!! A great way to refresh my curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it is by far the most amazing hair product I&#x27;ve ever come across. I&#x27;ve got thick coarse curly wavy unruly frizzy dye-damaged hair, and this stuff tames it right down. I find it&#x27;s best to use it on towel dry hair-- a few spritzes is enough to evenly distribute it with your fingers, and after it&#x27;s air dried I&#x27;ve got really nice curly wavy tame hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that it does use up quickly, but if you unscrew the top and refill it about halfway full of water, and give it a good shaking, you&#x27;ll have another good run.</li>
    <li> This is really what you need to encourage and save your curls.  Natural.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the first Aubrey and curl activator that ever worked on my natural, thick curly hair. I been natural for about a year and I been searching desperately for a product to define my curls and just make them pop while keeping my hair soft and moisturized. So far, this product has worked wonders for my hair, it left my hair soft and moisturized, while defining my curls. In addition, it also brought out the natural shine of my hair, I never seen my hair shine so brilliantly and it even managed to elongate my curls, which made my twists look longer and fuller. I love the smell of this product too, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong overwhelming smell that I associate with most Aubrey conditioners, instead it has a subtle, natural smell that fades away as soon as product is added to the hair.  I love that a little bit of this product goes a long way; I applied this product when after wetting my twists with water and I sprayed a little bit of it on my hair and I was able to easily smooth the product from the tops of my twists to the ends of my twist and I loved the way that it instantly made my hair more manageable by detangling my hair and elongating my curls, while bringing out the natural curly pattern which I loved. I only wish the product was cheaper but I brought two of them and it seems that they will last a long time when you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product to define your curls. :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11/28/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my review from a 5 to a 3 because the product seemed to work when I applied it to wet hair, but as soon as my hair dried the next day, then my hair became very hard and dry; it left a white coating on my scalp which makes me look like I have dandruff. I also didn&#x27;t like, that the product had so much alcohol, which is probably the reason why it causes your hair to dry. I guess it was too good  to true, another Aubrey product that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
