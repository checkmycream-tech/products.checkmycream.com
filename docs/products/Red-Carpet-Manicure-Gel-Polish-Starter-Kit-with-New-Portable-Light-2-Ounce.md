      <li>Great product, works like a charm, easy to use, perfect coverage, the lamp works perdectly and has a great size for travelling</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>So if your just getting started gelling your own nails this product will work great for you.</li>
      <li>Loved the fact that the polish lasted 3 weeks, but I couldn&#x27;t get it off of my nails.  </li>
      <li>If someone wanted to try doing the gel nails themselves, I&#x27;d recommend it because it&#x27;s what a salon manicure or two would cost you, a good price to try it out at.</li>
      <li>Buy and enjoy beautiful nails.</li>
      <li>I feel it is best to watch a YouTube video before trying to do first time.  </li>
      <li>Easy peasy and works great.</li>
      <li>so I researched this product and found it had many good reviews.  </li>
      <li>It was nice to get to buy a starter kit to try for the cost of a salon manicure or two.</li>
      <li>A friend of hers had this kit and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>Love, love love this!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing so easy to follow</li>
      <li>Lots of fun polishes to choose from and the quality is good.  </li>
      <li>let you know more when she uses it</li>
      <li>more practice for removal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product is ok.  </li>
      <li>I am sure there are better machines than this.</li>
      <li>It is nice to have portability with the light -</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I love this set.</li>
      <li>so be sure to have a couple of hours free.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I&#x27;d go for a better led light.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought one for my sister and sister in law for their birthdays.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry and use</li>
      <li>and I had amazing results the first time.</li>
      <li>It is quite a process when you do your own nails for the first time</li>
      <li>The light works just fine</li>
      <li>and the light has already played out today Nov. 30.</li>
      <li>The light just isn&#x27;t what I hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>Although the led light is slim and takes about 2 mins cure time per coat.</li>
      <li>so I am excited about having it.  </li>
      <li>But both the first and second time I did my nails came out with great results.</li>
      <li>You can even use quick drying nail polish which is cheaper and works</li>
      <li>It has saved me so much money!!</li>
      <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t like red nails, order a color on your own.</li>
      <li>and I actually liked the red color that came with the kit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s priced just right and is worth the money.</li>
      <li>it uses both batteries or can even be used via a good USB power source, but the light is small and not as effective as the standard light, so you will need to redo nails a couple of times to get a proper cure.</li>
      <li>However, the bottles are so tiny - I will need to purchase more polish asap.</li>
      <li>By the third manicure, I did okay</li>
      <li>This is my first gel kit.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to also get orange-wood sticks and the remover goes fast if you do your nails regularly.</li>
      <li>It is complete and true to the advertisement.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>so would recommend just get the standard kit light instead.</li>
      <li>High quality, salon look!</li>
      <li>Like the color very well</li>
      <li>Make sure to use thin layers and the recommended minutes exposed to the light as directed and it will work as advertised!</li>
      <li>Also, the first time I used it I kept testing my nails after doing the light to see if they were dry.</li>
      <li>I really expected my first try to not go smoothly.</li>
      <li>The overall products included in the kit are the same with the standard kit, all good and work well.</li>
      <li>Your nails will not be dry after having them under the light.</li>
      <li>The process is simple and just as quick as have shellac done at the salon.</li>
      <li>Works good when you don&#x27;t get it on too thick!</li>
      <li>I highly suggest this product.</li>
      <li>The only reason I took it off was because I was ready to try another color!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use regular polish anymore now because the gel goes on so much nicer, lasts longer, and dries faster.</li>
      <li>For the first time I have long nails that aren&#x27;t breaking.  </li>
      <li>My 11 year old can do this.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use and lasts AT LEAST 10 days for me.</li>
      <li>Which is fast considering it takes my regular polish about 6 hours to completely dry.</li>
      <li>They will still be extremely tacky until you do the blue stuff at the very end, so don&#x27;t touch your nails before that</li>
      <li>This is not a good starter kit, as I originally thought it would be.</li>

<li> but the first two were lumpy and ridiculous.</li>
<li> The actual nail polish is fine, but the light is terrible.</li>
<li> I used the timer on my phone to keep up with how long I was curing each coat</li>
<li> just as well as long as it is completely dry.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other kits before, and my manicure peeled off the next day.</li>
<li> The little lamp ended up taking a long time since you can only do one hand at a time, then have to do your thumbs separately, and you have to use it between coats.</li>
<li> I am rough with my hands and nails so nail polish never lasts a day for me.</li>
<li> I have thin nails and the removal weakens them too much.</li>
<li> My nails have always grown fast, but they are thin and break off by the time they reach my finger tips.</li>
<li> It is not worth the money.</li>
<li> They had to file it off, which killed my nails.</li>
<li> :-/  </li>
<li> or you&#x27;ll end up with dull spots.</li>
<li> I thought this was something different:(</li>
<li> #1 thing put it on thin.  </li>
<li> After you get used to using the gels and ensuring the coats are thin</li>
<li> This set in particular is awful.</li>
<li> So when they say to apply very thin coats, they mean very thin coats</li>
<li> so ill</li>
<li> and if you don&#x27;t listen you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
<li> Difficult for me to go to BAM salon because I&#x27;m in wheelchair,</li>
<li> but it was crazy to shell that out every two weeks,</li>

    <li> High quality, salon look!</li>
    <li> This set is not what it seems. It only comes with 2 actual colors. It is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this kit for Christmas. I love it!!!  Difficult for me to go to BAM salon because I&#x27;m in wheelchair,so I am excited about having it.  I feel it is best to watch a YouTube video before trying to do first time.  #1 thing put it on thin.  Works best this way.  Also, if you don&#x27;t like red nails, order a color on your own. I say order at same time to save shipping fees and Tim.  Yes, you can buy colors at town, but more expensive.  Buy and enjoy beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> Great kit. Comes with everything you need to do gel nails. Gave this one as a gift to my brother&#x27;s girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for daughter.  A friend of hers had this kit and really liked it.  She says it works great.</li>
    <li> I love this set. It is complete and true to the advertisement. However, the bottles are so tiny - I will need to purchase more polish asap.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this! It has saved me so much money!!</li>
    <li> It was nice to get to buy a starter kit to try for the cost of a salon manicure or two. In the end, gel nails weren&#x27;t for me and I got rid of it. I have thin nails and the removal weakens them too much. Also, there is a learning curve, if anyone is thinking of getting one. By the third manicure, I did okay but the first two were lumpy and ridiculous. So when they say to apply very thin coats, they mean very thin coats and if you don&#x27;t listen you&#x27;ll be sorry. The little lamp ended up taking a long time since you can only do one hand at a time, then have to do your thumbs separately, and you have to use it between coats. If someone wanted to try doing the gel nails themselves, I&#x27;d recommend it because it&#x27;s what a salon manicure or two would cost you, a good price to try it out at.</li>
    <li> Loved the fact that the polish lasted 3 weeks, but I couldn&#x27;t get it off of my nails.  I soaked in the solution they supplied and tried acetone.  Neither budged it, I even went to the nail salon and they said all you have to do is soak it in acetone...Not.  They had to file it off, which killed my nails.</li>
    <li> This is my first gel kit.  It&#x27;s amazing so easy to follow</li>
    <li> Bought kit in April  2015 and the lamp stop drying the nail polish on my nails</li>
    <li> Works good when you don&#x27;t get it on too thick!</li>
    <li> This is not a good starter kit, as I originally thought it would be. The actual nail polish is fine, but the light is terrible. I would not suggest purchasing this kit.</li>
    <li> Great product, works like a charm, easy to use, perfect coverage, the lamp works perdectly and has a great size for travelling</li>
    <li> The overall products included in the kit are the same with the standard kit, all good and work well. It is nice to have portability with the light - it uses both batteries or can even be used via a good USB power source, but the light is small and not as effective as the standard light, so you will need to redo nails a couple of times to get a proper cure. It does work, but the standard light really is not that much larger or less portable (though with less power input options) so would recommend just get the standard kit light instead.</li>
    <li> Product is ok.  I ordered it Oct 17th and the light has already played out today Nov. 30.</li>
    <li> The light just isn&#x27;t what I hoped it would be. LED lights are supposed to cure faster and this one doesn&#x27;t. Good thing it&#x27;s just for my home use, and I have the time I need. Gel products are good and come with good instructions!</li>
    <li> I was getting gel nails done at a price of 37.00 at the salon.  They did a beautiful job but it was crazy to shell that out every two weeks, so I researched this product and found it had many good reviews.  I bought it and after the 2nd or 3rd time I am an expert.  This is a great product.  After you get used to using the gels and ensuring the coats are thin you can do salon nails at home.  You can even use quick drying nail polish which is cheaper and works just as well as long as it is completely dry.  I loved it so much I bought one for my sister and sister in law for their birthdays.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it all the time. I can&#x27;t use regular polish anymore now because the gel goes on so much nicer, lasts longer, and dries faster. The light works just fine and I actually liked the red color that came with the kit. It is quite a process when you do your own nails for the first time so be sure to have a couple of hours free. But once I got the hang of it it only takes me maybe around 45 mins. now. Which is fast considering it takes my regular polish about 6 hours to completely dry. I don&#x27;t know why. Be sure to also get orange-wood sticks and the remover goes fast if you do your nails regularly. Also, the first time I used it I kept testing my nails after doing the light to see if they were dry. Your nails will not be dry after having them under the light. They will still be extremely tacky until you do the blue stuff at the very end, so don&#x27;t touch your nails before that or you&#x27;ll end up with dull spots.</li>
    <li> Perfect size. Easy to carry and use</li>
    <li> My 11 year old can do this.  Easy peasy and works great. It&#x27;s going to save us a fortune this year in manicures. yay!</li>
    <li> Followed the directions that came in the box for application and ended up keeping my manicure on for 11 days. The only reason I took it off was because I was ready to try another color! They were still looking great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need more practice for removal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other kits before, and my manicure peeled off the next day. :-/  Make sure to use thin layers and the recommended minutes exposed to the light as directed and it will work as advertised!</li>
    <li> For the first time I have long nails that aren&#x27;t breaking.  My nails have always grown fast, but they are thin and break off by the time they reach my finger tips. Not anymore though.  I just recently found out about gel nails and ordered this kit.  Although the led light is slim and takes about 2 mins cure time per coat. I still like it for a starter kit. It&#x27;s priced just right and is worth the money. So if your just getting started gelling your own nails this product will work great for you. Otherwise I&#x27;d go for a better led light.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Manicure lasted 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I am sure there are better machines than this. This set in particular is awful. It took forever as the machine is tiny!!</li>
    <li> Like the color very well but this was caught as a gift so ill let you know more when she uses it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it!  Lots of fun polishes to choose from and the quality is good.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Awesome. So easy to use and lasts AT LEAST 10 days for me. I am rough with my hands and nails so nail polish never lasts a day for me. I highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this was something different:(</li>
    <li> I have now used this kit twice. The process is simple and just as quick as have shellac done at the salon. I read the directions once beforehand and kept them out to refer to as I went. I used the timer on my phone to keep up with how long I was curing each coat and I had amazing results the first time. I really expected my first try to not go smoothly. But both the first and second time I did my nails came out with great results. This was a great investment for me. I was doing shellac every two weeks to the tune of $115 per month. So this has already paid for itself in the two uses I&#x27;ve had from it. I look forward to expanding my polish collection!</li>
