<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Guess this oil is just pricey. But I do like it and it works</li>
    <li> All of the products arrived quickly. The Chamomile oil is not dispensing. When I try, some blue color is coming out. This is not a reflection on the seller, just a problem with the product.</li>
    <li> Oil is good, but it doesn&#x27;t drop out easily.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil for among other things skin allergy issues. One of the top essential oils recommended for use on dogs, in proper dilution. Recommended by our holistic vet for our dogs skin allergies. I also use it on my skin. Pleasant aroma. Not overpowering. Have seen positive results. This brand is cost effective and effective on the reasons we use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Plant Therapy German Chamomile for about a month now in my baby skin care products. I add it to a salve made with coconut oil, jojoba oil, and Shea butter, bees wax, lavender eo, and calendula extract. This has helped immensely at keeping my little guys bum red free. I also add it to my cloth wipes spray solution. This stuff is seriously blue, so expect it to turn what ever you add it to a tinted color. I look forward to trying other Plant Therapy would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never saw blue camomile before, then I found out that is the process they use is solvent rather than distilled, maybe tiny tiny traces of the solvent in it, I&#x27;ve only used it twice in my ultrasonic diffuserso I don&#x27;t know quite how well I&#x27;m going to like itI will probably try the distilled type again and compareit is not bad though</li>
    <li> Great product especially when used in combination with lavendar.</li>
    <li> Item was received just as described.</li>
    <li> it throught it would help me sleep but not so.</li>
    <li> The shipment was fast and arrived before the expected arrival date.  The quality of the German Chamomile was actually better than expected having used lower quality chamomile oil in the past so this was a bonus.  Use sparingly as a little goes a long way.  There is a strong chamomile order which I personally don&#x27;t like but is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the person who left a 1 star review because it did not help your sleeping, you bought the wrong type of chamomile.  This is German which is different than Roman Chamomile.  German Chamomile is used for skin irritation and stomach cramps among other uses but it does not help with sleeping.  For that you want to use Roman Chamomile.</li>
    <li> the product was delivered as promised, but I did not care for the smell of this scent of essential oil.</li>
    <li> Color is not blue but oils is good</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, AND it was delivered very fast.</li>
    <li> I am loving this oil. Works well for one of its intended uses with skin issues. Its blue in color.</li>
    <li> I am new to essential oils, but I used this oil in a recipe for shingles. It relieved the itching and healed the scars. Fabulous results!</li>
    <li> Smells like the real thing! Apples!!! I get a very warm sensation  and positive feeling when using this oil. Especially on  the meridian lines.  I use it neat. It&#x27;s calming and makes me sleepy and takes away pain and exhausted emotions.  I will be making an eye cream with this oil.  This is the second order I have made of this healing oil. My system resinates with this oil. I enjoy the frequency and need to use it on my body.</li>
    <li> This oil seems to be high quality.  It has a very strong scent.</li>
    <li> Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful blue color.  I am looking forward to using this oil in many formulas in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I wanted however kinda stinky. Almost a wet mulch smell. I use it very sparingly because of the smell</li>
