<li> Actually even better, I put a very thin watery liquid in the jar and shook it</li>

<li> Seals tightly.</li>
<li> I ordered these 1/2 ounce jars for travel, however over half the jar is wasted space as the bottom is recessed over an inch into the jar.</li>
<li> If you are planning to sell a product in these jars, just boil them for a few minutes to sterilize before  inserting your homemade creation.  </li>
<li> but there is a ton of wasted space at the bottom.  </li>
<li> The bottom of the jar is recessed at least half way up.  </li>
<li> sturdy little jars!  </li>
<li> They look small but hold a lot.</li>
<li> jars take up a small amount of room in my quart-sized bag.  </li>
<li> I hate lugging lots of big</li>
<li> I was very disappointed to receive a completely different item.  </li>
<li> I am going to attempt to use a dremel to cut the excess plastic off the bottom in order to use them, but am slightly disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my fault as I should have used a measuring tape as these jars are really tiny.  I will not be able to use these for the purpose I intended.</li>
    <li> sturdy little jars!  perfect for my needs.  will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I needed for my project</li>
    <li> Some of these were broken when I got them, but there was so many that it was fine and I still had enough.</li>
    <li> What is unclear in the product description is that these jars are more than 2x taller than perhaps needed. The actual jar part is high inside the cylinder making the filled jar a bit top heavy. The jars are well formed and seal well..&lt;br /&gt;I am using a couple for glue holders to avoid having an open quart jar during periods of use.</li>
    <li> I adore these 1/2 oz. jars.  They are perfect for giving out any of my natural healing salves or creams.  Solid and clean!  If you are planning to sell a product in these jars, just boil them for a few minutes to sterilize before  inserting your homemade creation.  I use these all the time to hold my face cream, cleanser, eye makeup remover and eye gel.</li>
    <li> I use these jars for samples of body cream to give my clients and they are perfect!  I added a colored sticker on the top to label the product.  I plan to order more!</li>
    <li> I ordered these 1/2 ounce jars for travel, however over half the jar is wasted space as the bottom is recessed over an inch into the jar. They&#x27;re two inches tall when they should have been only one. Not at all as advertised.</li>
    <li> They all function properly and are perfect size for a frequent traveler such as myself.  They are TSA compliant...WAHOOOO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you can write on the top with a sharpie...</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I am starting to use essential oils. I am wanting to create creams and ointments. I was looking for ointment jars with lids. This vendor offered 1/2 oz, 1 oz and 2 oz sizes. They delivered as promised and I received exactly what I ordered. Product looks solid and will hopefully prove reliable.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  Good quality, lids seal tightly.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These were great.  I love the lids on these because I was able to write the product with a Sharpie pen without the writing coming off.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described. Is a very good size for carrying in a bag or purse.  The seller is fantastic to deal with.</li>
    <li> I love these containers!  They make great travel containers for over night or for a long weekend...I hate lugging lots of big bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make a lot of my own creams and lotions so these are perfect sharing sizes for sampling.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to order these!&lt;br /&gt;-Amanda J</li>
    <li> Plastic is nice quality.  Threads of the lid are done well.  Good delivery.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, the jars I received are much taller than shown.  The bottom of the jar is recessed at least half way up.  They may only hold 1/2 oz but there is a ton of wasted space at the bottom.  I wanted these for travel specifically because 1/2 oz. jars take up a small amount of room in my quart-sized bag.  These won&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ll be returning them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling. Just the right size to store face moisturizing and hair products. Great item!</li>
    <li> Perfect for little wedding favors :) i put home made whipped body butter in it :)</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, just as advertised. Actually even better, I put a very thin watery liquid in the jar and shook it and it did not leak at all. I use these for my DIY face concoctions to keep them fresh and protect them from light, air, oxidation and germs.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade therapeutic salve for friends. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this before I went on a 3-week trip with only a carry on. This jar didn&#x27;t leak anything out and stayed in shape. They are also very light, which is great because every ounce counts in carry on now. When I came home, I also found these useful to be my vitamin jar to carry around or just leave in the office. This size is surprising flexible to fit different things.</li>
    <li> Terrific little jars.  Use for lotions, etc.</li>
    <li> Good multi purpose jar for salves &amp; ointments for the classes I teach.</li>
    <li> These are great to put antibiotic ointment, hydrocortisone cream, etc. in when you take a trip.</li>
    <li> These jars are about twice as tall as they appear to be in the photo, however the &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; of the jar is in the center of the inside, so they only hold half the amount that they appear to hold (which would be about 1/2 an ounce as advertized). I am going to attempt to use a dremel to cut the excess plastic off the bottom in order to use them, but am slightly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like these. Great for traveling. I like to mix my hair products in these. I also make my own bb creams in them.</li>
    <li> These jars were exactly what I needed and expected.  I used them to make lip gloss for a bridal shower.</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly and in good shape.  They are exactly as described.  The size is perfect to bottle up my daily supplements. I used to use film cans but the screw down lids are better.  They will probably make it thru the dishwasher in the silverware rack periodically. Hope this was helpful....</li>
    <li> I love these. I bought them because my favorite bath + body company had a &amp;#34;create your own scent&amp;#34; event with perfume oil and I wanted to make my own lotions with them. They fit perfectly in my purse, and are great for up to 10+ hand lotion uses depending on how sparing you are! For anyone curious, they are about the size of a ping pong ball.</li>
    <li> Perfect little jars.  One lid had a fracture, but no big deals.  I will order them again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my lip balms!</li>
    <li> The 1/2 oz jars are shorter than the picture, which must be the 1 oz jars, show.  They are what I needed, they hold a semi-solid securely and the lids are actually functional.</li>
    <li> These jars are great for taking lotions, etc. on vacation. They never leak. This is my second set. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Nice jars.  About the size of 2 blistex lip ointment containers stacked, and hold about half an oz ointment, or about 8-10 tylenols.  Seals tightly.</li>
    <li> I use these to keep moisturizer in my travel kit, and they&#x27;re great for that. They&#x27;re sturdy (won&#x27;t easily crack) and don&#x27;t leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little bigger than I thought they would be. Filled to the brim, they hold exactly 1 fl oz. The picture is deceptive as well -- they&#x27;re actually much wider and shorter than shown.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than it appears, if you&#x27;re looking for a film canister size, I would get a 1 oz.</li>
    <li> I made a lip scrub &amp; stored it in these.  They were just the right size.  They seal well, &amp; are sturdy plastic.</li>
    <li> They look small but hold a lot.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to receive a completely different item.  The picture does not match the product at all!!</li>
    <li> Perfect Little pot for my homemade cosmetics.  The flat top is great for my label.</li>
    <li> I use these for mixing my dog&#x27;s daily supplements ahead of time. They are perfect for that purpose! I&#x27;ve used some for hair products and essential oil mixes as well and they have never leaked!! These things are just great to have around and will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;I would add though that I have placed two separate orders for the half ounce size and the shape of the jars the first time were shorter and wider while the second time they were taller and more slender like in the picture. Either way they hold the same amount but I thought I would add that incase you specifically need a certain shape.</li>
