<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my go-to lotion. It keeps me feeling moisturized for a long time. The shimmer is a bonus. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The only lotion I use! Love the little bit of shimmer without any greasiness!</li>
    <li> good lotion, but I don&#x27;t really like the shimmer</li>
    <li> Love this body lotion! Gives just a hint of shimmer and moisturizes very well. I use it every day and just have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy oily feeling like other lotions.  I love the shimmer it has in it also.  Then the bonus came when I was able to get two of the large bottles together for such a low price!  I am even able to use this on my daughters skin which is very sensitive and what I call scaley in the winter time.</li>
    <li> Lotion is nice, but wanted more glitter.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever, but can be hard to find.</li>
    <li> Love it !  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It softens skin quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of 2 bottles of this lotion, and I am happy with the purchase.  It smells nice, and I love the way it leaves my skin shimmering.  I pour some of this lotion, along with a few drops of one of my favorite perfume (CK One) to a smaller bottle, which I take to the gym and use after I am out of the shower after working out.  I recommend if you are buying this product, to buy the packs of 2, since you can stock up on them, and they are cheaper this way.</li>
    <li> Like my wife told me:&lt;br /&gt;It is of very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Good texture and very nice odor&lt;br /&gt;stays long time on the body</li>
    <li> if you can stand the smell then this is a good moisturizer (not too much shimmer though). The scent is positively deplorable.. makes my eyes water involuntarily when I use it and if I use it all night then I have this dull low grade headache that lasts long after I wash it off. If you&#x27;re prone to migraines like me (especially the hormonal monthly sort)  then avoid like the plague. Most of these run of the mill lotions stink of the same caliber anyway which is unfortunate that any time you want a decent smelling lotion you&#x27;ve to compromise on moisture and finance  .. whatever happened to crisp clean scents or scentless?.. Can&#x27;t benefit from something you can&#x27;t stomach. Would hate to smell this on somebody else too.. the cocoa butter alone is so cloying ugh!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion,and the shimmer!</li>
    <li> always buy these. works well</li>
    <li> I have been fickle with lotions over the years, never really sticking to a particular brand mainly because I could never find one which impressed me.    This certainly impressed me. I save this lotion for after showers however and before bed and I absolutely love it. I enjoy the smell, but only reserve putting this lotion on at night because I feel like it may overpower any perfume I may want to wear. It is a very refreshing scent however. I enjoy the smoothness of it and how easily it smooths over my skin.    Once dried, it is not heavy or greasy, which I love. And I enjoy the shimmer it brings. I may have possible found my \\&quot;Can&#x27;t live without\\&quot; lotion.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion ever!  I have been using this for years and it has a lovely subtle shimmer and smells great.  I use it every day but it looks especially nice on tanned skin in the summer.</li>
    <li> Minimal moisture but if seem is what you want it works for that....</li>
    <li> Good price, well packaged, and arrived very quickly. I love the soft scent and shimmer of this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this particular version of Olay for years. Love the glistening crystals and consistency for the lotion. Truly makes my skin feel moisturized and lush. Love it :)</li>
    <li> Very pretty subtle shimmers under the sun, lightly scented and lingers on your skin throughout the day. This is a light lotion, will not be enough if you have dry skin, I often find myself applying a second layer. Overall, this is a good body lotion, my favorite during summer.</li>
    <li> this is a awesome price for how much Olay shimmer  there is. two big bottles! and it is a great Lotion to use on your skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with everything. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion and the slight shimmer it has! It&#x27;s not too greasy, soaks in nicely and hydrates perfectly!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It&#x27;s moisturizing without being heavy and the shimmer adds a subtle glow. The scent is nice and clean smelling and doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume, too</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite lotion for 8+ years. The shimmer is pretty and just the right amount. The price is a good deal for two large size bottles. I compared prices to Walgreens and Target. I think I ended up saving at least $2.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but I miss the original active hydration formula which hade a cleaner scent and moisturized very nicely too.</li>
    <li> My favorite; works well, no fragrance and very subtle gold shimmer.</li>
    <li> love the smell and feel of this.  It is a light smell and goes on nicely, not too greasy.  I originally thought the shimmer would be really cool but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the shimmer.  It&#x27;s winter so a bad time to evaluate that part.  I put on right after the shower. I have tattoos and just had surgery.  It is light but penetrating and feels wonderful on my skin. I am quite picky because I hate having dry skin and I hate reapplying.  This feels like it lasts all day without making me feel oily.</li>
    <li> love this lotion so much, it smells good and keep my skin moisturize all day long...</li>
    <li> I loooove the Olay Quench with shimmer! So relieved they have it on Amazon Marketplace. I had to ship it to my sister in Illinois and brought it myself back to Vancouver because they don&#x27;t ship it to Canada! I wish they would next time!</li>
    <li> Best light everyday, every season lotion. Great on sensitive skin and even has a hint of shimmer. Smells nice too:)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. although for some reason when bought online it didn&#x27;t have the strong amazing scent as it did in stores. Hmm seems to be mixed with something else.</li>
    <li> Sometimes the lotions with shimmer are high on shimmer, low on actual moisturizing.  This is a great body lotion and the shimmer it provides is very subtle - just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It makes my skin nice and soft! I will be ordering more in the future! I&#x27;m glad this lotion comes in such a large size! I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with the product. I got what I ordered. I am enjoying it. It is a fine product.</li>
    <li> Always liked Olay products. I like that they absorb well on your skin. I hate that greasy feel of other lotions.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells pretty good. I don&#x27;t LOVE it but it has a pleasant smell. The shimmer is definitely only visible in bright sunlight but it is very pretty on the skin. I received two bottles in this order and they are huge so it will take forever to use them so I don&#x27;t mind spending the money on them.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years.  I absolutely love it! I get so many compliments about how soft my skin is. I will only buy the one with shimmer because it&#x27;s a very subtle shimmer,  but very noticeable in the sunlight. I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a couple of years now. I put on right after my daily shower.  It helps my legs and arms look soft and smooth. The shimmer is faint, not too obvious but soft so you don&#x27;t get that cheap look:). But more importantly it makes my skin soft, so I have been told by my husband.  I buy this product on line because it&#x27;s very hard to find it with the shimmer in drug stores.  My experience with Oil of Olay products have always been politive.  I just made 50 and have olive skin if that helps anyone who is making a decision on purchasing.</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to moisturizer for about 10 years now. I&#x27;m 30 and still love the shimmer this lotion provides along witht the lovely smell and intense moisture. During extreme weather, I also add in 100% pure argan oil to enhance moisture. Works great!</li>
    <li> Why pay $40.00 to $ 80.00 for a body lotion when you can purchase one of the best hydra tours for smooth silky skin. I love Olay Quinch it delivers. I suffer from very dry skin that breaks out  I can&#x27;t use lotion on my body everyday . What I love about quench is I can use it one day and skip the next day. I use Olay body washes and st Ives.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great and has very subtle shimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it is my favorite. I love the little bit of shine it gives to your skin in the sunlight.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice.  Great lotion!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, but it has no shimmer - false advertising in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this shimmery lotion!  Very light, helps mask the appearance of scars and bruises for those of us who play hard in the outdoors!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite lotion. Leaves a sparkle on you that you can see in the sun, but doesn&#x27;t rub off on things. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I use lotion a few times a week to moisturize my hands.  This product is great and I only have good things to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The quantity is enormous.  We don&#x27;t strictly use this product, but it&#x27;s been a year and it seems like it will never run out.&lt;br /&gt;- Those little dried up globs that come out when you don&#x27;t use lotion for a while?  No issues with that for this product.&lt;br /&gt;- Mild and pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;- Absorbed quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin soft.  Only mildly greasy feeling after.</li>
    <li> I love the smoothness the lotion leaves on my skin. I have been using this product for years and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. I also love that it makes my skin shimmer!</li>
    <li> Really wanted something with visible shimmer (not glitter). This cream had neither. Very disappointing. Also the fragrance is overpowering, like a kind of fake mango scent.</li>
    <li> I have had a small container of this in my purse for over a year and loved it.  It was great to find the big bottles. It is perfect for our dry climate.  When my 16 year old granddaughter was here for a visit, she commented that it made her skin shimmery.  So I had to get her a bottle too.  I like it well enough that I have it on order to come every three months.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells wonderful and goes into skin nicely.  It has a very faint shimmer which give you a glow.</li>
    <li> Always have used this and love it!</li>
    <li> the subtle shimmer is so fun for the summer and makes your skin feel so soft and wonderful. I use it every night when I go to bed and again after my morning shower.</li>
    <li> My skin was very very dry, for years using lotions all brands, just this product restorated my skin it is amazing what this lotion did to it, I can go days sometime, my skin won&#x27;t look dry, it gave the natural shine I never seem before, BEST LOTION ever....;) Olay you did it!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is absolutely amazing. I used to have dry skin but now people keep asking me to recommend what product I use on my skin. It&#x27;s been 2 years since my love affair with Olay quench therapy and my skin is soft, supple and glowing. If you have dry skin then you will benefit from this lotion. I also mix mine with Almond Oil or other natural oils and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion but is not readily available in stores.  I buy it here in bulk.  Saves me hassle, time and money!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but it didn&#x27;t really quench my skin at all. It cctually left me feeling kind of dry but shimmery. I have eczema and wanted to see if this would help but it didn&#x27;t. I used it with the body wash as well and I feel like my eczema actually got worse so I am back to Eucerin- which works.</li>
    <li> The lotion Does not shimmer</li>
    <li> Love the subtle shimmer and it lasts all day,  No more ashy legs.</li>
    <li> just nice moisterizer . frequently use it but not in speciL love with it</li>
    <li> Not a lot of shimmer and it does (to me) have a somewhat &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; smell to it. But it does moisturize nicely.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a nice scent and does a decent job of moisturizing, however, I really do not see much shimmer on my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried other drug store brands of body lotion, and found that Olay Quench Body Lotion seems to be the best for me so far. Even though it says \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot;, but it seems to have minimal in it which I don&#x27;t mind much. I actually prefer no shimmer because that might not be even healthy to you other than looking shimmery. This product does provide descent moisture to your skin for the first few hours.You can feel that your skin is subtle and soft. But you would just need to keep applying maybe a few times per day. I like the light scent of it.&lt;br /&gt;One complaint though: the price here is much higher than elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for 10 years! I keep getting compliments on the slight shimmer, but I love the moisture it provides, and it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I bought my wife who suffers from eczema and extremely dry skin this product along with other lotions. She wasn&#x27;t really impressed. At best it was ok.. Olay is a huge brand you would think their product would be as huge</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion! It makes my skin super soft and the shimmer is just enough to add some light reflection to the skin to give it a natural glow, and not look like I am 16 year old from the 90s.</li>
    <li> I normally like Olay products but this lotion was disappointing. I find the scent a little nauseating (it&#x27;s sweet) and the lotion feels dry, not at all moisturizing. The shimmer is very subtle - probably good that it&#x27;s not too glittery but I don&#x27;t think I can get beyond the scent and dryness. I&#x27;ll try it one more time but I think this may be going into the garbage. On the plus side, niacinamide is the third ingredient; it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin.</li>
    <li> My fav brand so obviously I will have no complaints!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great at moisturizing my very dry skin in the summer and winter. I put it on after showers and before bed. Shimmer is very light but I still like it and use it year round!</li>
    <li> The price and quantity is great-- but as a lotion, I&#x27;m not very fond of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;quench&amp;#34; my dry skin at all, and on top of that you&#x27;ll get this shimmer on top of your skin that doesn&#x27;t really help the situation any.</li>
    <li> Love the shimmer, and the scent is nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years. Keeps my skin healthy.</li>
    <li> Works well smells like a perfumed play dough but its not awful it actually smells good oddly.&lt;br /&gt;There is a little bit of sparkle to it but not a lot&lt;br /&gt;Not something you should get if you&#x27;re looking for sparkly lotion</li>
    <li> I love the slight fragrance and how quickly it absorbs. Not at all greasy!</li>
    <li> Does everything I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Works great with very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great price, on time delivery</li>
    <li> I Love this lotion, it smells great and keeps me soft and the shimmer look great, especially in the summer sun shine.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this everywhere. Adds just the right amount of shimmer without making you look sparkly. Great for any age</li>
    <li> This is  a nice everyday lotion, nice fragrance and feel to it. But, I did think it would have a bit more shimmer to it - barely see the flecks of glitter - only really see them in the sun. I wanted it for my sons wedding but not enough shimmer. I did purchase a different glitter lotion and it is perfect. But, I will use this everyday for moisturizing. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My go-to lotion for all seasons especially winter.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it has a great smell. I especially love the shimmer which really looks great in the sun or bright light!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s very light with a touch of shimmer and a great smell. You get two huge bottles.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I am a bit bias I love most Olay products, they just do what they say, and I usually have no complaints. this product is not an exception it does what it say and I live in a northern hard on the skin in the winter state. On top of that I have dry skin so finding a great lotion is difficult, when they for what ever reason stopped selling this brand in my local store I honestly wanted to cry but I am so glad I found it here and I would recommend it to anyone (African american or Caucasian) the shimmer is just an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and loved it. I loved the fragrance, I loved Niacinamide as the second ingredient. I loved the slight sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have changed the formula! The ingredients are not the same as listed. Niacinamide is now the second to the LAST ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance has changed for the worse, blanded down and cheapened. The shimmer is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not repurchase! This is just like any cheap dollar store lotion now.</li>
    <li> The caps on both bottles were broken.  Great lotion....pain to have to use now.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I have used for the past 5+, I had some really dry patches of skin and it healed those patches and if I miss a day putting on the lotion my skin remains silky soft, this is the best lotion imho in the world.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It has a subtle, clean scent with a slight shimmer. It isn&#x27;t thick or greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I use this every day! It moisturizes well and also leaves your skin with a glittery sheen!</li>
    <li> Works great for dry skin.  Leaves a shimmer.  Helps stretch marks and other blemishes on the body disappear.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because she said they were no longer making this kind and this is one of her favorites, so i ordered a bunch for her. Every is 100% perfect. It was a great surprise for her and she loved it. Thank you for a fair deal and also thank you for sending it out so quickly.</li>
    <li> Not the lotion I thought. Pretty good moisturizer but wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Maybe would try a different olay. I would say try it .. not for me but maybe for you.</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty good.  It also has a nice fragrance.  The negative side is that the dispenser broke immediately after we started using it. Now we have to unscrew it and rub the tube to get to the lotion.</li>
    <li> Amazon Gobal is great. Recived it days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell like cocoanut,don&#x27;t like that smelling.~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;except that ,it&#x27;s good~smoothy</li>
    <li> i have used many other body lotions... including the ones with much higher price tags, but i always come back to this.  Nothing makes my skin so soft &amp; moisturized better.  I like all Olay body lotions, but love this one especially because it has better scent &amp; subtle shimmer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!! Right after the shower this stuff leaves my skin so soft and the shimmer is perfect!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. I always receive compliments on how soft my skin is. It has a VERRRRY SUBTLE shimmer to it (which I LOVE) and the shimmer can only be seen in direct sunlight, and even barely then, so it&#x27;s by no means overwhelming. It seems they have stopped selling it in the stores as I had to come here to purchase it. Very pleased with this purchase and will re-order with this seller.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. I have extremely dry skin and for 45 plus years I have tried everything under the sun, including prescription meds! This lotion works!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I&#x27;ve been using this kind for years. It has a very light shimmer to it, and a comforting smell. It goes on easily, and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> The best lotion for dry skin which I have had and its keeps the elasticy in your skin making it look young.</li>
