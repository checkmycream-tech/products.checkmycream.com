      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product to help me with my girl&#x27;s hair and it was perfect, and she loves the smell so much too.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that makes combing after a shower a challenge.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel very comfortable putting using this considering it was unsealed and in a bottle that I don&#x27;t recognize for this brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many salon detanglers and this beats them all.</li>
      <li>I used to leave the beach looking like I had a bird&#x27;s nest on top of my head.  </li>
      <li>I think I have tried just about every detangling spray and this one works significantly better than any of the others.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it works.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny since it sprays in a nice fine mist...</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of the smell, its not bad, but I don&#x27;t like coconut!</li>
      <li>Some say the scent is too strong, granted it is for children so that may be why.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice pineapple scent that does not linger on the hair as strong as when it is first applied.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome for fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and that it has an interesting, non traditionally commercial character associated with it.</li>
      <li>I first bought it at Sweet&#x27;n Sassy</li>
      <li>and I immediately knew something wasn&#x27;t right when I saw the bottle.</li>
      <li>Makes mornings so much easier!</li>
      <li>We are avid COF hair product users</li>
      <li>This detangler really works!</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine blonde hair that curls (corkscrew) at the end.</li>
      <li>I can go straight to dinner from the beach.  </li>
      <li>I have reached out to COF to find out if this is indeed a real product of theirs or some counterfeit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it daily for 2 weeks now with many sprays and it barely looks like I used any..</li>
      <li>This product not only makes that less challenging, but it also smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>this is the only product that actually does what it says I love it for my childs hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I understand the need to put an irritant in the scent to make you notice the smell, but this product has gone too far!!   </li>
      <li>HIs hair is really curly and tight but this stuffmakes it so easy to comb threw.</li>
      <li>A few sprays and a gentle combing the comb slides right from the knots.  </li>
      <li>If you use this product and your little kids act out-of-sorts a lot, it could very well be a headache from this product!!</li>
      <li>I received the 8 oz detangler in a clear, flimsy bottle when what&#x27;s pictured here is the 10oz salon version in the white container.</li>
      <li>I have recommended or bought this for everyone I&#x27;ve ever met that has thin fine hair.</li>

<li> I have recommended or bought this for everyone I&#x27;ve ever met that has thin fine hair.</li>
<li> The pump nozzle on the clear container was loose, spilling 60% of the contents all over the box containing all the other things I ordered.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it oily.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky or limp, and seems to reactivate upon re-wetting the next day.</li>
<li> The doc said her reaction was probably due to the methylparaben and propylparaben in the product.  </li>
<li> so it seems like it will last at least 3 months.  </li>
<li> This product has been a total game changer for her hair.</li>
<li> One less thing to rinse out!</li>
<li> my skeptical brother didn&#x27;t believe it would be different from other detanglers.</li>
<li> Extremely flimsy and the cap wasn&#x27;t sealed nor twisted on tight!</li>
<li> I bought this for my daughter who has thick hair that is always tangled underneath the nape.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
<li> My daughter has very curly hair which gets miserably tangled.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed and will never order things like this again from amazon.</li>

    <li> I was looking for a product to help me with my girl&#x27;s hair and it was perfect, and she loves the smell so much too.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I use this for our longer hair.  It works better than most products we have tried and the scent is great!</li>
    <li> This is a good detangler and it smells great too.  It is works well on your child&#x27;s hair before blowdrying it to protect it from heat.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my granddaughter who used it for two weeks before she had an allergic reaction.  We stopped using the product for 2 weeks and tried it again.  Same results.  The doc said her reaction was probably due to the methylparaben and propylparaben in the product.  We had used Circle Of Friends - Bonitas Banana Detangler before and she didn&#x27;t have any reaction.  So back to what worked!</li>
    <li> I received the 8 oz detangler in a clear, flimsy bottle when what&#x27;s pictured here is the 10oz salon version in the white container. The pump nozzle on the clear container was loose, spilling 60% of the contents all over the box containing all the other things I ordered. I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair which gets miserably tangled.  I think I have tried just about every detangling spray and this one works significantly better than any of the others.  As a bonus, it smells great. This helps take the pain out of our daily hair brushing.</li>
    <li> This detangler really works! It doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky or limp, and seems to reactivate upon re-wetting the next day. Makes mornings so much easier! I just wish it weren&#x27;t quite so scented.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great! If you have a child who doesn&#x27;t like to get shampoo&#x27;d and conditioned, this will help cut the fight out of the bath. Just follow up after shampoo has been rinse and comb through. Leaves hair silky, shiny and smelling great! One less thing to rinse out!</li>
    <li> I understand the need to put an irritant in the scent to make you notice the smell, but this product has gone too far!!   If you have any kind of allergies at all, don&#x27;t get this!! It gave me a stuffed up nose and a sinus headache. My boyfriend, who was sitting across the room from me, instantly got a stuffed up nose an red eyes when I came in to watch TV. If you use this product and your little kids act out-of-sorts a lot, it could very well be a headache from this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has thick hair that is always tangled underneath the nape.  A few sprays and a gentle combing the comb slides right from the knots.

    <li> This stuff is awesome for fine, thin hair. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it oily.</li>
    <li> I have recommended or bought this for everyone I&#x27;ve ever met that has thin fine hair. I bought it for my niece and my skeptical brother didn&#x27;t believe it would be different from other detanglers. He is a convert! This has totally changed the &amp;#34;after-bath&amp;#34; routine to remove the tears from pulled tangly hair. I love the smell and that it has an interesting, non traditionally commercial character associated with it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has fine blonde hair that curls (corkscrew) at the end. I cannot simply brush her hair without a detangler. This works great! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never had a problem with Amazon until today. What is pictured on this listing is not what I received. We are avid COF hair product users and I immediately knew something wasn&#x27;t right when I saw the bottle. Extremely flimsy and the cap wasn&#x27;t sealed nor twisted on tight! I don&#x27;t feel very comfortable putting using this considering it was unsealed and in a bottle that I don&#x27;t recognize for this brand. Not to mention that this bottle is NO where on their website nor is the Abebi friend that is on the front. I have reached out to COF to find out if this is indeed a real product of theirs or some counterfeit. Very disappointed and will never order things like this again from amazon.</li>
    <li> I take this product to the beach and comb it through my hair as soon as I get out of the ocean.  It works so amazingly well.  I used to leave the beach looking like I had a bird&#x27;s nest on top of my head.  Now I leave with beautiful curls and no tangles.  In fact, I look so good I can go straight to dinner from the beach.  This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Have been using this on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and it is the best detangler on the market.  I first bought it at Sweet&#x27;n Sassy but when they went out of business, I went to Amazon.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that actually does what it says I love it for my childs hair. HIs hair is really curly and tight but this stuffmakes it so easy to comb threw.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Smells great and tackles my daughters tangles like a dream. Does not make her hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this!!!!!!!!!! My daughters hair get so knotted. This product has been a total game changer for her hair. I am not a fan of the smell, its not bad, but I don&#x27;t like coconut!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it works. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> This is a great detangler. I have very fine hair that makes combing after a shower a challenge. This product not only makes that less challenging, but it also smells fantastic.</li>
