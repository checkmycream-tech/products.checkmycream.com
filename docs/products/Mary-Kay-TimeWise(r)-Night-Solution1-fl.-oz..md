    <li> made me break out but it works well with people that I am sure are not allergic to too much hydrating of the skin.</li>
    <li> There was no Expiration date on this product; very disappointed as a result.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a young&#x27;n at about 22 and I started to get some very fine smile lines and crow&#x27;s feet.  I started applying a pump at night and, while the lines are still there, there is a noticeable difference.  You can hardly see them!  Very good product for the price, and even if it seems silly to other young people, if you start taking care of yourself early on, it will pay off!</li>
    <li> My product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I have used the product for a few weeks and feel the difference.  I will make sure to keep this product on hand as part of my skin care.</li>
    <li> My husband recently told me that I look hot in the morning right when I get up. I guess it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Luv this stuff can&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
    <li> no noticeable difference in my skin</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite product for my face! I put it on at night and when I wake up, my skin is soooo soft!</li>
    <li> A friend and a neighbor gave me several different beauty products. some cost 3x more than Mary Kay timewise. What did I choose to purchase on my own?? Mary Kay timewise!! Work better for me than any other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference. Seemed overly sticky to me.</li>
    <li> It is a great product  Will buy it again and it lasts for a long time.  Need very little to get results.  It came very quickly.</li>
    <li> I ran out of it for a few weeks and I could definitely tell that I stopped. My skin was dull and tired looking, but after I start using it again, its definitely brighter. It absorbs very quickly after I wash my face and there is no greasiness at all.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay Timewise Night Solution for about 2 months. I am pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the results. I have sensitive skin and I do not have any pronlems with this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> Love this for my skin looks better with it.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with acne all my life. I got it early in third grade and didn&#x27;t get rid of it until Sophomore year in college when I tried the Mary Kay Timewise combo/oily set. One of the products that works the most in my favor is the night solution. If used properly, it diminishes acne overnight and reduces oil! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and I love how firm &amp;amp; soft my skin feels in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product gives my face a clean healthy glow, so I actually use it every morning.  I use another brands cream at night. (Amazons 5 stars uses the word &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; so four stars is max for me.)</li>
    <li> Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> This night solution keeps my face soft and smooth it is rich and you only need a little because it goes along way. This is the first step in my night time routine for getting ready for bed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used for a long time. I highly recommend it. It is gentle and easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of products to help my dry skin and redness....nothing has worked.      Then I found Mary Kay Timewise Night Solution and this product is truly a miracle.  My skin looks AMAZING for the first time in my life. I apply it in the morning and at night and it keeps my skin even and looking awesome.</li>
    <li> I had been blessed with very good skin, that was up until I turned 25. For whatever reason my skin started to change, I had way more noticeable pores on my chin, nose and t-zone areas. I had breakouts on my chin and forehead and large bumps as if I had pimples under the skin. I felt like giving up when I tried everything from over the counter products including Biore, Neutrogena, and Olay- I tried Proactive and that just DRIED out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff changed my life- I started using the Time Wise collection and in 3 days noticed a HUGE change in my skin. The pores on my forehead shrunk, seemingly over-night. My breakouts were reduced in size and the redness vanished. Even in the spots where the breakout had left a mark I noticed them fading.  The best part about the collection is that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin! I used to almost dread washing my face because some products were so drying and some even stung! Now I enjoy the whole process because as soon as I take off my makeup and apply the moisturizers my skin glows!&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;ve never tried Mary Kay or you already love other makeup products I seriously advise you to try their skin care! It&#x27;s a little bit more expensive than drug store brands but less that department store stuff and coming from someone who&#x27;s tried the Philosophy, the Clinique, the Proactive I know what I&#x27;m talking about. Trust me it is worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> This night solution works great, I use it at least 3 times per week, less wrinkles, face feels and looks great</li>
    <li> This peptide is a great vehicle for retina A.</li>
    <li> Love this nighttime lotion....my skin feels so much better</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dry skin - using Retin A - and this works like a charm.  Super easy to use (before moisturizer) and I use is 2x a day.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I could see improvement in the condition of my skin.  I&#x27;m always skeptical of claims that products make, but this one is true.</li>
    <li> Brand new &amp; arrived on time</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my skin.  Very light, not sticky or heavy and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle is going to last me for quite some time.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth and refreshing. Very gentle to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Last for a along time.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> The Mary Kay night serum is NOT just for night-time. I use this whenever I&#x27;d like to smooth out dry skin, wrinkles, and pores to give my skin a consistent appearance without ANY grease. As someone who has TERRIBLE dry eye and allergic sensitivity to anything applied near and around my eyes (where we all could use the most help-right? :/) this serum has been a lifesaver because it never gives me any sort of a negative reaction when I apply it very closely around my eyes for complete coverage! For this reason, I have really taken to Mary Kay products because they work really well and are THE MOST hypoallergenic products I have ever used, 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! The Timewise Night Solution is by far one of my favorites from Mary Kay. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and refreshed. It&#x27;s like vitamins for my skin! Another plus, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I got this item very quickly and it was packaged well. This is a great firming product. It works well if u put it on daily. I have tried it with other products, but it works best with other marykay timewise products. I would definitely recommend this company to others</li>
    <li> I ARRIVED FAST AND WAS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Excellent use this product for 12 years, my face looks younger and helps me to prevent and heal acne.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer ever.  Great price for it also.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in original packaging within the specified time and was in excellent condition.  I love the way the product makes my skin feel at night.  It is refreshing and seems to stabilize the tautness of my skin.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is real light-weight and feel good on the skin.  Only need a little bit to cover the whole face so it should last awhile.  It doesn&#x27;t clog skin.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and product meet my expectations!!!</li>
    <li> Skin feels great. I put this on after washing my face every night and havent had any problems with my skin.</li>
